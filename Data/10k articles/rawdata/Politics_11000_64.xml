The '''2011 Wisconsin Act 23''' established a requirement for nearly all voters to present approved photo identification to cast a ballot.  It was one of many new [[voter ID laws in the United States]].  Act 23 was developed by Republican Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] and the Republican controlled [[Wisconsin Legislature]] during a walkout by Democratic lawmakers as part of the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]].

==Approved forms of identification==
Section 1 of Act 23 specifies that only the following forms of photo identification are acceptable:&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23]{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Wisconsin [[driver's license]]
* An nondriver identification card issued by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation
* Photo identification issued by the United States military
* A [[United States passport]] or [[United States Passport Card|passport card]]
* A United States naturalization certificate, issued not more than two years prior to the election
* An unexpired receipt for a Wisconsin driver's license or nondriver identification card (this is given at the Department of Motor Vehicles, as Wisconsin's licenses and identification cards are printed and mailed from an outstate provider in California)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/your-new-photo-ids-will-arrive-via-mail-b53h48n-136292453.html|title=Your new photo IDs will arrive via mail|last=Stein|first=Jason|date=27 December 2011|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A tribal identification card issued by a recognized Wisconsin [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe
* An unexpired identification card issued by an accredited Wisconsin college or university with a date of issuance, a date of expiration not later than two years after the date of issuance, the voter's signature, and further provided that the student also present proof of enrollment in said college or university

==Implementation==
In July 2011, the [[Associated Press]] reported that the [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] administration was planning to close some DMV locations that could issue identification under the voter ID law and increase the hours that other DMVs were available.  The changes were made to comply with a requirement that every county have a DMV location open at least 20 hours per week.  A Democratic legislator said that the closures would occur in primarily Democratic areas, while the expansions would occur in primarily Republican areas.&lt;ref name=wis-dmv-closure-ap&gt;{{cite news|title=Wis. DMV says closure decisions aren't final|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9OKSP800.htm|accessdate=21 September 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two weeks later, the plan was replaced with a plan to maintain all existing DMV offices and create four new ones.&lt;ref name=roller&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roller|first1=Emma|title=State puts brakes on plan to close DMV sites|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/126814653.html|accessdate=21 September 2014|work=Journal Sentinel|date=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] (DOT) sent an internal memo instructing employees that an applicant for an ID card must pay the $28 fee unless the applicant requests that the ID be issued for free.&lt;ref name=venegren-doherty&gt;{{cite news|last1=Venegren|first1=Jessica|last2=Doherty|first2=Shawn|title=Top DOT official tells staff not to mention free voter ID cards to the public — unless they ask|url=http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/capitol-report/article_335f59fa-d8fe-11e0-8a23-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=21 September 2014|work=Capital Times|date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, the DMV began posting signs instructing applicants seeking free "ID cards used for voting" to check the appropriate box on the application form.&lt;ref name=marley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marley|first1=Patrick|title=DMV employees told not to volunteer information on free IDs|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/129400013.html|accessdate=21 September 2014|work=Journal Sentinel|date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As initially implemented, an applicant for an identification card was required to present a birth certificate.  The Division of Motor Vehicles maintains form MV3002, which allows identification cards to be issued without a birth certificate.  The form is not mentioned in publicly available materials published by the DMV, and a high-ranking DMV official was unfamiliar with the form.&lt;ref name=vielmetti&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vielmetti|first1=Bruce|title=Legal filings hone arguments over Wisconsin voter ID law|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/legal-filings-hone-arguments-over-wiscnosin-voter-id-law-b99171322z1-237190571.html|work=Journal Sentinel|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 2014, a procedure was implemented where applicants could supply birth information that would be verified with the State Vital Records Office for free.&lt;ref name=henzl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henzl|first1=Ann-Elise|title=Voter ID: No Birth Certificate Needed to Apply for Wisconsin ID at DMV Office|url=http://wuwm.com/post/voter-id-no-birth-certificate-needed-apply-wisconsin-id-dmv-office|website=WUWM|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitrof&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitrof|first1=Marge|title=Walker Approves New Rules for Obtaining Voter ID, While Court Considers Law's Status|url=http://wuwm.com/post/walker-approves-new-rules-obtaining-voter-id-while-court-considers-laws-status|website=WUWM|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenges==
On December 13, 2011, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the lawsuit ''Frank v. Walker'' in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin]] seeking to block the Act as a violation of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name=glauber&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glauber|first1=Bill|title=At 84, she lacks identification, but not will to fight voter ID law|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/at-84-she-lacks-identification-but-not-will-to-fight-voter-id-law-f03eqti-135635733.html|accessdate=22 September 2014|work=Journal Sentinel|date=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, U.S. District Judge [[Lynn S. Adelman]] in Milwaukee issued a permanent injunction against the Act, ruling that the Act was unconstitutional as well as a violation of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].&lt;ref name=federal-judge-unconstitutional&gt;{{cite news |first=Brendan |last=O'Brien |date=April 29, 2014 |title=Federal judge strikes down Wisconsin voter ID law |agency=Reuters |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-04-29/news/sns-rt-us-usa-voter-wisconsin-20140429_1_voter-identification-law-penda-hair-poor-and-minority-voters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adelman said that it was not shown that voters without acceptable identification could obtain it under the Act and that the state failed to show evidence of recent voter impersonation fraud.&lt;ref name=blake&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Judge Strikes down Wisconsin Voter ID law |work=The Washington Post |date=April 29, 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/04/29/judge-strikes-down-wisconsin-voter-id-law/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adelman's ruling marked that first time that a voter ID law had been found to violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Adelman found a violation of Section 2 on the basis of racial minorities not only being more likely to lack acceptable identification, but also facing additional barriers to acquiring acceptable identification.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{cite news |first1=Dee J. |last1=Hall |first2=Matthew |last2=Defour |date=May 1, 2014 |title=Legislature cannot fix voter ID law before November election, leader says |work=Wisconsin State Journal |url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/legislature-cannot-fix-voter-id-law-before-november-election-leader/article_307d1616-042b-58b4-a82f-2a6488c209ff.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate litigation, on July 31, 2014, the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] rejected a challenge to the Act by giving the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles discretion to waive fees, over dissent by Chief Justice [[Shirley Abrahamson]], and Justices [[N. Patrick Crooks]] and [[Ann Walsh Bradley]].&lt;ref name=wislrev&gt;[http://wisconsinlawreview.org/softening-voter-id-laws-through-litigation-is-it-enough/ Richard L. Hasen, ''Softening Voter ID Laws Through Litigation: Is It Enough?,''] 2016 Wis. L. Rev.

Walker''], 851 N.W.2d 262, 2014 W.I. 98, 357 Wis. 2d 469 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The state appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] and asked for a stay of Judge Adelman's injunction.&lt;ref name=defour&gt;{{cite news |first1=Matthew |last1=DeFour |date=Jul 16, 2014 |title=U.S. attorney general wades into Wisconsin voter ID court battle |work=Wisconsin State Journal |url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/u-s-attorney-general-wades-into-wisconsin-voter-id-court/article_0c4335e7-6ecf-5e59-8629-e1fd3bc69ee0.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 12, 2014, the same day oral arguments were held, a Seventh Circuit panel stayed Adelman's injunction, allowing the Act to immediately take effect, and Wisconsin officials announced plans to implement the Act for the November 2014 election.&lt;ref name=richmond-tarm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richmond|first1=Todd|last2=Tarm|first2=Michael|title=Appeals Court Reinstates Wisconsin's Voter ID Law|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/appeals-court-decide-wisconsin-voter-id-law-25450077|accessdate=22 September 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook]] was joined by Judges [[Diane S. Sykes]] and [[John Daniel Tinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1043035160199030878&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Frank v. Walker''], 768 F.3d 744 (7th Cir. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 10, an equally divided circuit voted 5-5 to deny rehearing [[en banc]], over written dissent by Judge [[Richard Posner]].&lt;ref name=wislrev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10532566321621705356&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Frank v. Walker''], 773 F.3d 783 (7th Cir. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2014, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] vacated the stay imposed by the Seventh Circuit, and thus temporarily barred the state from implementing the voter id law, due to
the proximity of the upcoming general election and the fact that absentee ballots were sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted, over written dissent by Justice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Ct. 7 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2015, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a ''[[writ of certiorari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032315zor_b97d.pdf|author=SCOTUS|title=ORDER LIST: 575 U.S.:CERTIORARI DENIED|page=3|date=March 23, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}{{psc|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/23/1372760/-Supreme-Court-lets-strict-Wisconsin-voter-ID-law-stand-Time-for-Dems-to-ensure-everyone-has-an-ID|author=Meteor Blades|work=DailyKos|title=Supreme Court lets strict Wisconsin voter ID law stand.

On October 19, 2015, Judge Adelman, entered the order denying the injunction.  However, on April, 12, 2016, the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, with Judge Easterbrook finding the plaintiffs could now challenge the law as it had been applied individually.&lt;ref name=wislrev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=RUTHELLE+FRANK&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_ylo=2016&amp;case=10530002385585013004&amp;scilh=0 ''Frank v. Walker''], No. 11-C-1128 (E.D. Wis. July 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 19, Judge Adelman found that the state was applying the Act unconstitutionally, ordering the state to allow anyone who makes an [[affidavit]] of their eligibility to vote in the November general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Robert|title=Federal judge rules that Wisconsinites without ID can sign affidavit to vote|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/federal-judge-rules-that-wisconsinites-without-id-can-sign-affidavit-to-vote/2016/07/19/9711e7f8-4df0-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2016, in a separate trial in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin]] in Madison, U.S. District Judge [[James D. Peterson]] also found the Act was applied unconstitutionally but ordering more limited oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zapotosky|first1=Matt|title=Post Nation Federal judge orders investigation into Wisconsin’s voter ID system|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/30/federal-judge-orders-investigation-into-wisconsins-voter-id-system/|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 10, 2016, the Seventh Circuit stayed Judge Adelman’s injunction, leaving in place Judge Peterson’s order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Michael Wines]]|title=Appeals Court Prevents Voting Without ID in Wisconsin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/us/wisconsin-voters-photo-id-law.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 August 2016|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Peterson held a new hearing after reading news reports in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine that the state was ignoring his order.&lt;ref name="nyt25nov"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Michael Wines]]|title=As ID Laws Fall, Voters See New Barriers Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/elections/voter-id-laws.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 October 2016|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Ari|title=Wisconsin Is Systematically Failing to Provide the Photo IDs Required to Vote in November|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/wisconsin-is-systematically-failing-to-provide-the-photo-ids-required-to-vote-in-november/|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=[[The Nation]]|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 13, 2016, Judge Peterson entered an order expanding his oversight but still not permitting voters to swear eligibility by affidavit.&lt;ref name=nyt25nov/&gt;  The [[United States presidential election in Wisconsin, 2016]] was held on November 8.

In unrelated litigation, on November 21, the Seventh Circuit found Wisconsin Legislature’s 2011 redistricting plan was an unconstitutionally partisan [[gerrymandering]], the first successful claim of partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States]] in thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Michael Wines]]|first1=|title=Judges Find Wisconsin Redistricting Unfairly Favored Republicans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/wisconsin-redistricting-found-to-unfairly-favor-republicans.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 November 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 November 2016|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was founded in August 2007 by a merger of [[Ibrahima Moctar Sarr]]'s [[Movement for National Reconciliation (Mauritania)|Movement for National Reconciliation]] and the [[Alliance for Justice and Democracy (Mauritania)|Alliance for Justice and Democracy (AJD)]] party, with Sarr elected as the leader of the new party.   Sarr, a [[Serer people|Serer]] journalist, had been a high profile activist since the 1980s, and his party defined itself as campaigning for [[Civil rights|equal rights]] for [[Pulaar]]-speakers, [[Soninke people|Soninké]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people alongside [[Moors]], and the return of Mauritanian [[refugee]]s from [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="ami.mr"&gt;[http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2007/mars/15/5.html "Le conseil constitutionnel proclame les résultats du premier tour de l'élection présidentielles du 11 mars 2007"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Agence Mauritanienne d'Information, March 15, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarr had stood as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] in the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2007|March 2007 presidential election]] on an anti-racist platform, came in fifth place with 7.95% in the first round&lt;ref name="ami.mr"/&gt; and supported [[Ahmed Ould Daddah]] for the second round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=23863 "Mauritania : Ould Daddah gets support of fifth place holder for presidential runoff"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, African Press Agency, March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 break with government==
On May 10, 2008 the AJD/MR announced they would not participate in the government of Prime Minister [[Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef]] due to policy differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2008/Mai/10/03.html "L'AJD/MR annonce qu'il ne participera au nouveau gouvernement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514080556/http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2008/Mai/10/03.html |date=2008-05-14 }}, AMI, May 10, 2008 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 coup==
Following the [[2008 Mauritanian coup|August 2008 military coup]], Sarr and the AJD/MR expressed support for the military junta. But on August 26, 2008, the AJD/MR, along with the [[Rally of Democratic Forces]] (RFD) and the [[Movement for Direct Democracy]] (MDD) all announced their decision to not participate in the Laghdaf's government&lt;ref name=Three&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hArWJ2Rue6z_YF7lrznr_ouXLD4w "Three parties refuse to join Mauritanian government"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520164929/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hArWJ2Rue6z_YF7lrznr_ouXLD4w |date=2011-05-20 }}, AFP, August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; because the junta had not clarified whether or not someone serving in the military would be allowed to stand as a presidential candidate&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewGov&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jPTnuP1yd3YB8MACszotPxb4akUg "Mauritanian junta announces formation of a government"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520164527/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jPTnuP1yd3YB8MACszotPxb4akUg |date=2011-05-20 }}, AFP, September 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and had not specified how long it intended to remain in power.&lt;ref name=NewGov/&gt; The new government led by Laghdaf was appointed on August 31&lt;ref name=NewGov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Composition&gt;[http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2008/Aout/31/11.html "Composition du nouveau gouvernement"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904050204/http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2008/Aout/31/11.html |date=September 4, 2008 }}, AMI, August 31, 2008 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 elections==
Sarr announced on 11 April 2009, that he would be the AJD/MR candidate in the controversial [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2009|June 2009 presidential election]], which was being organized by the junta and which opposition parties were planning to boycott. Sarr said that "the conditions are there for a free poll" and that Mauritania did not have democracy under Abdallahi's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iUVGcFo7Gw9AcISVJyQfhcnoS83A "Pro-coup leader to stand in Mauritania presidential poll"], AFP, 11 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association internationale des femmes''' ('''AIF'''; International Association of Women) was a short-lived feminist and pacifist organization based in Geneva that was active between 1868 and 1872. It demanded full equality between men and women. This was too radical for many feminists at the time.

==Foundation==

The origins of the association may perhaps be traced to the 1854 proposal by the Swedish feminist [[Fredrika Bremer]] for a women-only organization dedicated to peace.{{sfn|Elshtain|Tobias|1990|p=145}}
The Swiss feminist [[Marie Goegg-Pouchoulin]] (1826–99) was active in the International Peace and Freedom League when it was founded in 1867, became a member of its central committee and edited the league's journal ''Les États-Unis d'Europe''.{{sfn|Schelbert|2007|p=143}}
On 8 March 1868 the journal published Goegg's proposal to create an international association of women in connection with the league.{{sfn|Cooper|1991|p=290}}
This became the ''Association Internationale des Femmes'' (AIF).{{sfn|Schelbert|2007|p=143}}

Foundation of the AIF and of [[Eugénie Niboyet]]'s feminist and pacifist weekly ''La Paix des Deux Mondes'' mark the start of identification by women with peace work.{{sfn|Moynagh|2012|p=353}}
According to the historian Sandi Cooper, Goegg was responding to the growing militarism of Prussia and aimed for, "the re-education of mothers to prevent another generation of boys trained to respect the false idols of national glory through military conquest.{{sfn|Offen|2000|p=126}}

The AIF was the first transnational women's organization. It was concerned with women's suffrage and with secular education.{{sfn|Tripp|2006|p=55}}
The association demanded "equality in salary, in instruction, in the family, and in the law".{{sfn|Offen|2000|p=151}}
An AIF membership card issued to [[Matilde Bajer]] of Copenhagen in December 1870 states that its goals were, "To work for the moral and intellectual advancement of woman, for the gradual amelioration of her position in society by calling for her human, civil, economic and political rights."{{sfn|Offen|2000|pp=150–151}}

==History==

The association's position was too extreme for many middle-class women, so the number of members remained relatively small.{{sfn|Schelbert|2007|p=143}}
The association's activities were disrupted by the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], but it was revived by Goegg at the end of 1870.{{sfn|Offen|2000|p=150}}
The organization received international coverage in pacifist and feminist publications, such as the journal ''Woman'', edited and published in Italy by [[Alaide Gualberta Beccari]].{{sfn|Rappaport|2001|p=60-61}}
However, the association failed to develop a strong organizational foundation.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=65}} 
By 1872 the AIF was viewed with suspicion, since the word "International" was associated with the [[Paris Commune]]. Members were also divided over Goegg's leadership.{{sfn|Offen|2000|p=151}}

In June 1872 a communique was issued that called for a meeting at the home of Julie von May von Rued in Bern to organize a new association called ''Solidarité: Association pour la défense des droits de la femme'' (Solidarity: Association for the Defense of Women's Rights). 
Signatories included [[Caroline de Barrau]] of France, [[Josephine Butler]] of England, Christine Lazzati of Milan and the German feminists Rosalie Schönwasser, [[Marianne Menzzer]] and Julie Kühne.{{sfn|Offen|2000|p=151}}
Marie Goegg-Pouchoulin was also active in this organization.{{sfn|Schelbert|2007|p=143}}

The '''Bodo League massacre''' ({{korean|hangul=보도연맹 학살사건|hanja=保導聯盟虐殺事件}}) was a [[massacre]] and [[war crime]] against [[Communism|communists]] and suspected sympathizers (many of whom were civilians who had no connection with communism or communists) that occurred in the summer of 1950 during the [[Korean War]]. Estimates of the death toll vary. It has been estimated that the number of victims killed is between 100,000 and 200,000.&lt;ref name="smh20081114"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/south-korea-owns-up-to-brutal-past/2008/11/14/1226318928410.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 South Korea owns up to brutal past] Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Bodo League members killed in [[Ulsan]], [[Cheongdo County]] and [[Kimhae]] alone, where the number of confirmed victims was almost exactly 4,934, was 30 to 70 percent of the press alliance members massacred and more than 100 people to more than 1,000 people were killed in each county unit respectively.&lt;ref&gt;진실화해위는 확인된 희생자 수만 4천934명으로 거의 정확하게 희생자 수가 밝혀진 울산ㆍ청도ㆍ김해 지역은 보도연맹원 가운데 30~70%가 학살됐고 각 군 단위에서 적게는 100여명, 많게는 1천여명이 살해된 것으로 추정된다고 밝혔다.{{cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20091126115504424|title=진실화해위, 보도연맹원 4천934명 희생 확인(종합)|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was wrongly blamed on the communists.&lt;ref name="smh_1226318928410"/&gt; For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre.

==Aftermath==
After the UN offensive in which South Korea recovered its occupied territories, the police and militia groups executed suspected North Korean sympathizers. In October 1950, the [[Goyang Geumjeong Cave Massacre]] occurred. In December, [[British troops]] saved civilians lined up to be shot by South Korean officers and seized one execution site outside [[Seoul]] to prevent further massacres.&lt;ref name=cbs-20090211/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc080818&gt;{{cite news

such as the Ganghwa Self-defense Forces, by providing combat equipment and supplies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth and Reconciliation: Activities of the Past Three Years|url=http://www.jinsil.go.kr/pdf/%EC%98%81%EB%AC%B8%EB%B0%B1%EC%84%9C_20MS%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%BC_0205.pdf|website=Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Republic of Korea|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Republic of Korea|accessdate=30 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171441/http://jinsil.go.kr/pdf/%EC%98%81%EB%AC%B8%EB%B0%B1%EC%84%9C_20MS%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%BC_0205.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–75}}

'''''Bourdieu v. Pacific Western Oil Co.''''', 299 U.S. 65 (1936), was a decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], which held that an inquiry into [[Indispensable party|indispensability]] would be unnecessary where the complaint did not state a [[cause of action]].

==Background==
Pacific Western Oil Corporation was established by Edward L. Doherty in 1928 before later coming under the control of [[J. Paul Getty]] and owned oil and gas drilling rights for large sections of [[Fresno County, California]]. An agricultural landowner had [[Mineral rights|"mining" rights]] for the same area and sued. The oil companies asserted that, since their leases were issued by the [[United States Secretary of State]], that they could not be sued without including the U.S. government but the court disagreed.

}}
"'''Bring Us Together'''" was a [[political slogan]] popularized after the election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Richard Nixon]] as [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[United States presidential election, 1968|in 1968]]. The text was derived from a sign which 13-year-old Vicki Lynne Cole stated that she carried at Nixon's rally in her home town of [[Deshler, Ohio]] during the campaign.

Richard Moore, a friend of Nixon, told the candidate's speechwriters he had seen a child carrying a sign reading "Bring Us Together" at the Deshler rally. The speechwriters, including [[William Safire]], began inserting the phrase into the candidate's speeches. Nixon mentioned the Deshler rally and the sign in his victory speech on November 6, 1968, adopting the phrase as representing his administration's initial goal—to reunify the bitterly divided country. Cole came forward as the person who carried the sign, and was the subject of intense media attention.

Nixon invited Cole and her family to [[First inauguration of Richard Nixon|the inauguration]], and she appeared on a float in the inaugural parade. The phrase "Bring Us Together" was used ironically by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] when Nixon proposed policies they disagreed with or refused to support. Cole declined to comment on Nixon's 1974 resignation, but subsequently expressed her sympathy for him. In newspaper columns written in his final years before his 2009 death, Safire expressed doubts that Cole's sign ever existed.

== Background ==
The 1968 presidential campaign was one of the most bitterly fought in the nation's history. Set among national divisions over the [[Vietnam War]], social policy, and against the backdrop of riot and assassination,&lt;ref name="UPI 1968 in review" /&gt; none of the campaigns made healing divisions a major theme—an early slogan by Democratic candidate [[Hubert Humphrey]], "United With Humphrey" had been scrapped.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt; The incumbent President, Democrat [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] (often called L.B.J.) could give Humphrey little support because of his own unpopularity.&lt;ref name="Wise 1968–11–03" /&gt;

By 1968, candidates were appealing to the electorate through television, rather than through [[whistle-stop train tour]]s.&lt;ref name="Mickelson 1972" /&gt; Nixon had included them in his past national campaigns—he had broken off one such tour in 1952 to make the [[Checkers speech]],&lt;ref name="Morris 1990" /&gt; and in 1960, had stopped at Deshler. The rural Ohio village, about {{convert|45|mi}} southwest of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], was popular among whistle-stopping presidential candidates as two main lines of the [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad]] crossed there—other visitors in search of votes had included [[Al Smith]], [[Harry Truman]], and [[Barry Goldwater]].&lt;ref name="Ionne 1968–11–09" /&gt; Deshler voters would respond in 1968 by giving Nixon an overwhelming majority of their votes.&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade 1968–11–08" /&gt;

== Rally and sign ==
[[File:Nixonette.jpeg|thumb|"Nixonette" dress (on left)]]
Cole was an eighth grader in Deshler; her father was the local Methodist minister while her mother taught third grade.&lt;ref name="Ripley 1968–11–08" /&gt; On October 22, 1968, the day of Nixon's stop in Deshler, Cole attended class as usual. During the morning session, one of her teachers announced that any girls interested in being "Nixonettes" (girls asked to cheer and provide atmosphere at the rally) should report to the fire station after school. Cole did so, along with her friend, Rita Bowman, and the girls were provided with paper red, white, and blue dresses (to be worn over other clothing) and signs. Cole's said, "L.B.J. Convinced Us—Vote Republican".&lt;ref name="Ripley 1968–11–08" /&gt;

That afternoon, Cole attended the rally, wearing her dress and holding her sign. The Nixon train pulled in, and the police lowered the rope which kept the crowd clear of the tracks. In interviews, Cole related that as the crowd surged forward, she dropped her sign amidst the pushing and shoving.&lt;ref name="Wash Post 1968–11–07" /&gt; Cole stated, "I wanted a sign to wave. I had lost my own placard and as the crowd moved forward as the train approached I saw this sign lying in the street and I just picked it up and held it high, hoping Mr. Nixon would see it."&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–11–07" /&gt;

Nixon gave a speech from the rear platform of the train. He praised the size of the crowd, stating, "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960."&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–10–24, promises" /&gt; The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should tell that to the farmer.&lt;ref name="The Deshler Flag 1968–10–24" /&gt; Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [local] violence."&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–10–24, promises" /&gt; He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same."&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–10–24, promises" /&gt; He recalled that [[Francis A. Nixon|his father]] had hailed from Ohio: "his roots are here and mine are too!"&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–10–24, precautions" /&gt; As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, "Bring Us Together Again" was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.&lt;ref name="Ripley 1968–11–08" /&gt;{{efn|name=Deshler text}}

Nixon speechwriter [[William Safire]] had been told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at campaign stops to mingle with the crowd&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt; and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on the early days of the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with, some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick."&lt;ref name="Safire 2005 p82" /&gt; According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'."&lt;ref name="Safire 2007–09–02" /&gt; Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.&lt;ref name="Safire 2007–09–02" /&gt;{{efn|name=next stop}}

Nixon used the phrase in concluding a rally at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] on October 31, 1968. Recalling the visit to Deshler, the Republican candidate stated, "There were many signs like those I see here. But one sign held by a teenager said, 'Bring Us Together Again'. My friends, America needs to be brought together."&lt;ref name="Schulman 2002" /&gt; However, Nixon's use of the phrase received little coverage until after the election.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt; Deshler school officials heard of the speech, and asked students about the sign, but no one came forward.&lt;ref name="Ionne 1968–11–09" /&gt;

Safire included the incident in a draft victory statement, which Nixon looked at before addressing the nation as [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]].&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt; In his victory speech on November 6, Nixon recalled the sign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I saw many signs in this campaign, some of them were not friendly; some were very friendly. But the one that touched me the most was one that I saw in Deshler, Ohio, at the end of a long day of whistle-stopping. A little town. I suppose five times the population was there in the dusk. It was almost impossible to see, but a teenager held up a sign, "Bring Us Together." And that will be the great objective of this administration at the outset, to bring the American people together.&lt;ref name="Evans Novak 1971" /&gt;{{efn|name=notes re sign}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Forward Together.jpg|thumb|250px|Vicki Lynne Cole (right) with her "Bring Us Together Again" sign on the "Forward Together" theme float.]]
[[File:Bring Us Together.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ohio float, recreating Nixon's visit to Deshler, passes by the presidential reviewing stand.]]
Reconciliation among the American people was also a theme of Humphrey's concession statement. "I have done my best. I have lost, Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its will, so now let's get on with the urgent task of uniting our country."&lt;ref name="UPI 1968 in review" /&gt;

School officials again asked students about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated that she had not done so before as she had not written the sign.&lt;ref name="Ionne 1968–11–09" /&gt; Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again.&lt;ref name="Ionne 1968–11–09" /&gt; Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class.&lt;ref name="Ripley 1968–11–08" /&gt; The [[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo ''Blade'']] investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, "I think this has to be the most important thing that has ever happened around here."&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade 1968–11–08" /&gt; Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler ''Flag'', stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up.&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade 1968–11–08" /&gt; Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt;

As early as November 7, the ''Northwest Signal'', local paper for nearby [[Napoleon, Ohio]], reported that Deshler merchants were considering taking up a collection to send Cole to Washington;&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–11–08" /&gt; the following day the paper editorialized that she, along with whoever actually made the sign, be sent to Washington to see the inauguration.&lt;ref name="Northwest Signal 1968–11–08" /&gt; On November 19, 1968, campaign special assistant and longtime Nixon advisor [[Murray Chotiner]] proposed inviting the Cole family to the inauguration and having Vicki Cole ride the theme float.&lt;ref name="Chotiner 1968–11–19" /&gt; The President-elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration;&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1968–12–04" /&gt; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1969–01–19" /&gt; Vicki Cole carried a recreation of her sign on the theme float in the inaugural parade.&lt;ref name="Time 1969–01–17" /&gt;

Carla Garrity, a fourteen-year-old girl from [[Burbank, California]], objected to Cole's invitation to the inauguration on the ground that Cole had done nothing to deserve it. In a letter to her congressman, [[Ed Reinecke]], Garrity stated she had worked very hard for Nixon and other Republican candidates, "Therefore, I am very much against that 13-year old girl in Ohio who held up the sign 'Bring us Together' being invited to the inaugural. She didn't even ''read'' or ''write'' it!"&lt;ref name="Garrity 1968–11–17" /&gt; Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide [[John Ehrlichman]] with the comment, "I suspect that Carla's reaction may be shared by other young people who worked in the Nixon campaign".&lt;ref name="Reinecke 1968–12–03" /&gt; Nixon assistant [[Charles E. Stuart]] replied to Reinecke, stating, "Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign, or even because she made the sign, but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon" and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans.&lt;ref name="Stuart 1968–12–17" /&gt;

== Political usage and aftermath ==
[[File:Bring Us Together video.ogv|left|thumb|Vicki Cole and sign in the Inaugural Parade]]
[[File:Deshfire.jpg|thumb|left|Deshler, Ohio fire department, where the "Nixonettes" assembled]]
The Inaugural Committee wanted to adopt "Bring Us Together" as the inaugural theme, appalling Safire, who said, "That wasn't the theme of the campaign."&lt;ref name="Evans Novak 1971" /&gt; Safire and other aides felt the administration should seek to advance its agenda, rather than seeking consensus on policy,&lt;ref name="Safire 2007–09–02" /&gt; and White House Chief of Staff-designate [[H. R. Haldeman]] was able to change the theme to "Forward Together." Nevertheless, the phrase "Bring Us Together" was thrown in the face of the Nixon administration by Democrats each time something divisive was proposed, and was used as the title of a tell-all expose by [[Leon Panetta]] after he was fired from the Nixon administration for dissenting from the White House's "[[Southern strategy]]" on [[civil rights]] policy.&lt;ref name="Evans Novak 1971" /&gt; According to Safire, the use of the phrase against Nixon shows a slogan which evokes emotion can cut both ways.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt;

Nixon's advisors denied he had abandoned a desire to bring the American people together.&lt;ref name="Sidey 1970" /&gt; However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]], who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him, and should seek to win over the voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]], as the key to reelection in 1972.&lt;ref name="Drew 2007" /&gt; According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the [[Silent majority|Silent Majority]].&lt;ref name="Safire 2005 p308–310" /&gt; Historian [[Stanley Kutler]] suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.&lt;ref name="Kutler 1992" /&gt;

In late 1970, Vicki Cole indicated in an interview Nixon was doing the best he could.&lt;ref name="Bryan Times 1970–05–12" /&gt; During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses.&lt;ref name="LATimes 1977–01–17" /&gt; In 1974, Cole declined to comment on the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]],&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 1974–08–09" /&gt; but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.&lt;ref name="LATimes 1977–01–17" /&gt;

Safire, in his political dictionary published in 2008, recollected that when he asked Moore, some years after the inauguration, whether he had really seen the girl holding the sign, or whether he had imagined it, "his eyes took on a faraway look".&lt;ref name="Safire 2008" /&gt; In columns written in the final years before his 2009 death, Safire commented that the sign was "almost too good to be true",&lt;ref name="Safire 2008–01–20" /&gt; and said of Moore, "[h]e may have made that up".&lt;ref name="Safire 2007–09–02" /&gt;

{{efn
| name = Deshler text
| Nixon did not speak from a prepared text in Deshler; his campaign released a statement of themes Nixon intended to cover. According to the statement, Nixon was to discuss the number of various crimes that had been committed in the time it took his train to go from the previous stop (Lima) to Deshler. Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, 1968 speech files, October 22 (Deshler).
}}

{{efn

| The speech files at the Nixon Library do not show that Nixon used those words at the next stop, though he could have departed from his prepared text. At least one speech he gave the following day in Michigan was on the theme of unity, though no verbatim transcript is there, simply a statement of themes Nixon intended to discuss in his talk. Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, 1968 speech files October 22 (Toledo), October 23.

Community economic development encourages using local resources in a way that enhances [[economic]] opportunities while improving [[social]] conditions in a [[Sustainability|sustainable]] way. Often CED initiatives are implemented to overcome crises, and increase opportunities for communities who are [[disadvantaged]]. An aspect of “localizing economics,” CED is a community-centered process that blends social and economic development to foster the economic, social, ecological and cultural well-being of communities. For example, neighborhood business organizations target growth in specific commercial areas by lobbying government authorities for special tax rates and real estate developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Community Development Reader|last = DeFilippis|first = James|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0415507769|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community economic development is an alternative to [[Economic development|conventional economic development]]. Its central tenet is that: “... problems facing communities—unemployment, poverty, job loss, [[environmental degradation]] and loss of community control—need to be addressed in a holistic and participatory way.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==
[[Economic development]] has existed even at a basic level since the earliest recorded communities. However, in the US and several other countries, the concept of Community economic development emerged "in response to tenacious poverty and the need for affordable housing, good jobs, affordable health care and quality of life matters needed for human existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clay|first1=Roger|last2=Jones|first2=Susan|title=A brief History of Community Economic Development|journal=Journal of Affordable Housing &amp; Community Development Law|date=Spring 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=257–267|jstor=25782846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CED in the US===
In the late 19th century reformers discovered less than desirable areas of the country where communities were overcrowded, unhealthy, poor and centered near factories, docks and various other places of employment. In the early twentieth century during the [[Progressive Era]] reformers began making connections between the condition of communities and "social ills" such as crime and poverty and ways to improve upon them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Investing In What Works for America's Communities   » The Past, Present, and Future of Community Development in the United States|url = http://www.whatworksforamerica.org/ideas/the-past-present-and-future-of-community-development-in-the-united-states/2/#.VlLNT3arTIU|website = www.whatworksforamerica.org|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive agenda of political, social, and physical reform swept the nation and led to comprehensive antipoverty strategies, embodied by New Deal programs and other grants in the 1930s. Policies during this time were top-down and citizens being affected had very little input to the changes being made. Once communities began to be revitalized, [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation policy]] followed to determine who was allowed to live where. Housing policy and real estate practices stifled upward mobility for non-whites and their communities developed with unique characteristics and problems as a result. These actions shaped communities until the 1960s, when [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President LBJ]] signed into law many anti-discriminatory laws such as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and also declared a war on poverty which brought renewal and upward mobility for many people. More loan programs, grants and [[Fair Housing Act|fair housing]] policies were implemented throughout the 60's and 70's but still failed to be non-discriminatory on the basis of race in some cases thus shaping communities in a particular fashion. Social investment gained momentum once again in the 80's and 90's bringing change to communities across America. Municipal governments become more representative of the communities they serve and the public is more involved and can interact with [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] and elected officials with greater ease. Many initiatives existed at this time to renew inner cities and rural areas while also tackling social issues such as eradicating drugs and improving education. The modern day CED movement is focused on renewing urban and rural communities. Social justice is a key component to policy and conversation about changes to be made. Citizens are engaged with bureaucracies and their elected officials through a variety of mediums such as [[social media]]. Input from the people has gained more value due to increased demands for transparency.

===CED around the world===
In NIgeria CED is approached with a central focus on sustainability referred to as Sustainable Community Development. This concept combines economic, social and environmental practices and policies that promote sustainability for future generations. Much of this began in the 1980s, 2 decades after gaining independence, when the World Bank declared Nigeria eligible to receive funds from the [[International Development Association]] (IDA).

In Asia for the last 60 years the [https://web.archive.org/web/20151208063731/http://asiafoundation.org/index.php Asian Foundation] has supported Asian initiatives to foster inclusive economic growth and broaden economic opportunities.The Foundation designs and implements economic programs in three core areas business environments for private sector growth, Entrepreneurship Development and Regional Economic Cooperation.

==Theories and strategies==
The most significant aspect of community economic development, aside from the fact that it focuses on [[economic development]] in specific localities, is that focuses on the process of [[community building]].  This “community” aspect of CED assumes that the community will play a dynamic role in economic development processes and that [[community development]] will contribute to sustained economic development and vice versa.  In this understanding, the community is considered both as an input and output in this CED equation.&lt;ref name="Fulbright-Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fulbright-Anderson|first1=edited by Karen|last2=Auspos|first2=Patricia|title=Community change : theories, practice, and evidence|date=2006|publisher=Aspen Institute Roundtable on Community Change|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89843-444-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at CED from an economic viewpoint, the initial purpose of such an approach is the creation of local jobs and the stimulation of business activity.  Integrally linked to these purposes are strategies to increase access to [[capital (economics)|capital]], stimulate [[asset]] building, improve the general [[business]] climate, and link citywide economic development efforts to specific community development efforts.&lt;ref name="Fulbright-Anderson" /&gt;

Increasing access to capital is an extremely important strategy for community economic development.  Historically, residents in poor neighborhoods have experienced great difficulty finding access to capital because they are traditionally viewed as [[credit (finance)|credit]] risks.  In places where banks do offer services, these residents face other structural barriers such as minimum deposit requirements, high service fees, and complex paperwork.  To solve these problems, a community economic development approach would develop alternate neighborhood [[community development financial institution]]s such as community development [[credit union]]s, community development [[bank]]s, and community development [[venture capital|venture capital funds]].&lt;ref name="Fulbright-Anderson" /&gt;

Improving the general business climate is also integral to community economic development.  Strategies to do so would include improving the [[infrastructure]] and physical appearance of commercial areas, the quality of quantity of residential housing, and the [[transport]]ation systems in a neighborhood.  While these may not directly economic activities, they serve to strengthen the economic well being of an area because it encourages businesses to locate there.&lt;ref name="Fulbright-Anderson" /&gt;

== Objectives and goals ==
Community economic development exists in all developed countries but varies in the way it functions with the different systems of governments around the world. Research makes it apparent that there are common goals and objectives such as economic activities and programs that develop low-income communities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Community development corporation|Community Development Corporations]], reformers and other agencies have other common initiatives including services to fight homelessness, lack of jobs, drug abuse, violence and crime as well as quality medical and childcare and home ownership opportunities while also bringing economic prosperity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another increasingly common objective is to preserve the character of communities and strong support for local business.

Countries across the globe participate in reinvestment and development through a bank such as the [[Community Reinvestment Act]], [[World Bank]] and the IDA amongst many others. Another commonality for nations international is need to incorporate sustainability and the natural environment into the growth of societies.

==Policies==
Economic policies of Central governments often do not appear to help economies on a local level. Large free market economies tend to take more out of local communities than they put back into them leaving economic dead zones within these communities. Community economic development policy argues that it is in the social interest of a local economy to be at least partially owned by the community. The locality is responsible for initially coming up with the visions for their economic future; community economic development assists with expanding access to capital and stimulating asset accumulation, increasing local access to consumer goods and services, expanding the local entrepreneurial base, expanding local employment opportunities; giving neighborhoods more control over ownership of local resources and connecting residents and businesses to the regional economy.

==Implementation==
Several Communities across the United States have successfully crafted policy to create groups and corporations to assist in multiple facets of the communities economy and welfare. The following organizations are examples of Community Economic Development Initiatives.

The [[Western Australian Government]] Department of Commerce and Trade had an active Community Economic Development Branch working within Regional Development during the 1990s.  They ran programs in Small Town Economic Planning (STEP) program in which local communities were asked to bring together a cross section of influential groups representative of the community for a one- or two-day community planning event, after which they were given a grant of up to $15,000 for the implementation of initiatives identified, for a considerable number of the state's 158 Local Government Councils. They also ran a Community Auditing initiative and with the Office of the Minister of Agriculture, ran a Community Development Program, training local people in the skills of Community Economic Development.  The reorganisation of the Department in 2002 saw the name changed to Community Capacity Building and the Department itself was reorganised as the Department of Regional Development and Local Government until 2007 after which the Community Capacity Building Branch was disbanded.

In Brazil, the [[Banco Palmas]] has established Community Economic Development initiatives through the use and development of a [[community currencies|community currency]].  The community has prospered and has been widely adopted so that by 2011 there were 43 community banks within the country using the Banco Palmas model.  The Brazilian government has since encouraged the movement and in 2015 there were more than 100 initiatives in various parts of the country.

==Obstacles==
In the US, Community Economic Development projects are often funded by commercial banks within the structure of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].  This Act of Congress took effect in November, 1978. It is administered by banks and other financial institutions and has been instrumental in helping the owners of smaller businesses navigate the steps of obtaining loans for development projects.   A bank will operate a separate division within their loan department that focuses its expertise on small business services, as well as training and education.
Because projects brought to CRA bank departments are often from areas of lower economic standing and/or unproven consumer markets, they are a larger risk to lenders.  This heavier risk brings more stringent underwriting guidelines, in addition to often rigid government requirements. Many financial institutions state that these rules are cumbersome and difficult to comply with.

==As a career==
There are several CED corporations and nonprofits that employ Community Economic Development Officers to implement development plans.

Those involved in implementing a Community Economic Development Plan – not only the development officers, but also public administrators and small business owners – will serve different functions, as plans vary from community to community.  The community economic development officer will create studies to determine what a certain community's goals are and send them to the appropriate municipal offices or economic development committees.  A community economic development officer will assist in implementing a development plan by researching local zoning ordinances and laws, helping community partners acquire financing for economic development, acting as a liaison with various local, state, and federal agencies, making recommendations to the appropriate authorities on community economic development, and serving as an advocate within a community.&lt;ref name="Human Services Edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Economic Development Occupation Overview|url=http://www.humanservicesedu.org/community-economic-development.html|website=Human Services Edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most employers require a bachelor's degree in Economics or Community Development as a minimum.  For better opportunities, pursuing a Master of Public Planning, Urban Planning, Economic Development, or Community Economic Development is recommended.&lt;ref name="Human Services Edu" /&gt; The annual median salary for a Community Economic Development Officer in the United States is $64,028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Development Director Salary (United States)|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Economic_Development_Director/Salary|website=PayScale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of corruption==
{{Essay-like|section|date=July 2017}}

A notable worsening of this ranking for Russia—from 90th place to 126th—occurred at the beginning of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s second term as president: a drop of 36 places in only one year. An equally pessimistic picture emerges from the estimates of the average size of bribes which has substantially increased over the last five years. For example, according to the Interior Ministry's Department for Combating Economic Crimes, the average bribe amounted to 9,000 Rubles in 2008; 23,000 Rubles in 2009; 61,000 rubles in 2010; and 236,000 rubles in 2011. In other words, the average bribe in 2011 was 26 times greater than the average bribe in 2008, many times the inflation rate for the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.imrussia.org/ru/society/1376-corruption-in-russia-as-a-business|title=Коррупция в России как бизнес|last=Kalinina|first=Alexandra|date=2013-01-29|work=Институт современной России|access-date=2018-01-09|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sergei Ivanov]], the Kremlin chief of staff, the most corrupt spheres in Russia (in terms of household corruption) are healthcare, education,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat.

In the 1990s, businessmen had to pay different criminal groups to provide a "''krysha''" (literally, a "roof", i.e., protection). Nowadays, this "protective" function is performed by officials. Corrupt hierarchies characterize different sectors of the economy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat. (2010). "Corrupt Organizational Hierarchies in the Former Soviet Bloc."

"Corruption Hierarchies in Higher Education in the Former Soviet Bloc." ''International Journal of Educational Development'', 29(3), pp. 321–330.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the Russian population pays for this corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat. (2012). "Who is Guilty and What to Do? Popular Opinion and Public Discourse of Corruption in Russian Higher Education." ''Canadian and International Education Journal'', 41(1), pp. 81–95.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some experts believe that the rapid increases in tariffs for housing, water, gas and electricity, which significantly outpace the rate of inflation, are a direct result of high volumes of corruption at the highest levels.&lt;ref&gt;Milov et al., Op,cit., 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed: starting from Putin's second term, very few corruption cases have been the subject of outrage. Putin's system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business, as well as its use of relatives, friends, and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property. Corporate, property, and land raiding is commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat. (2012).

==Anti-corruption efforts==
{{Further|Russian anti-corruption campaign|Combating Corruption}}

An anticorruption campaign in modern Russia began on April 4, 1992, when President [[Boris Yeltsin]] issued a decree entitled "The fight against corruption in the public service". This document prohibited officials from engaging in business activities. Moreover, state employees were required to provide information about their income, personal property and real estate holdings, bank deposits and securities, as well as financial liabilities. The implementation of the decree, which formed the basis of the laws on combating corruption and on civil service, was vested in the presidential control directorate. Russia passed the first package of anti-corruption laws in 2008 in response to its ratification of the UN's [[United Nations Convention against Corruption|Convention against Corruption]] and the [[Council of Europe]]'s "[[Criminal Law Convention on Corruption]]". The decree "On Anti-Corruption Measures" was signed by former President and current Prime Minister [[Medvedev]] in May of that year. Since then, numerous changes have been implemented to the Russia’s anti-corruption legislation with the purpose of combating bribery and improving its business climate. The [[Russian anti-corruption campaign]] is an ongoing effort by the Russian government to curb corruption, which has been recognized as one of Russia's most serious problems. Central documents in the campaign include the [[National Anti-Corruption Plan]], introduced by Medvedev in 2009, and the [[National Anti-Corruption Strategy]], introduced in 2010. The central organ in the campaign is the Anti-Corruption Council, established in 2008. Medvedev has made fighting corruption one of the top agendas of his presidency. In the first meeting of the Council on 30 September 2008, Medvedev said: "I will repeat one simple, but very painful thing. Corruption in our country has become rampant. It has become commonplace and characterises the life of the Russian society."&lt;ref&gt;Sakwa 2011, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the government adopted a new law requiring public servants and employees of state organisations to disclose their source of funds and both their and their families’ acquisitions of property, including real estate, securities, stock and vehicles. The legislation has also, for the first time, defined conflict of interest in connection to public officials and extended anti-corruption legislation to the military. The last modification to the Federal Anti-Corruption Law No. 273 was made in December 2012 and it was implemented on January 1, 2013. By upgrading the Anti-Corruption Law with Article 13.3, Russia has made a significant step towards strengthening the framework of its anti-corruption legislation, aligning it with the best practices recognized on the international level, such as the [[UK Bribery Act]] and the U.S. [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]. This articles 13.3 of the Anti-corruption Law requires organizations to develop and implement anti-corruption measures such as (i) appointing a specific department or an official to be responsible for preventing corruption and related offences; (ii) cooperating with enforcement authorities; (iii) developing and implementing standards and procedures for ethical business practices; (iv) establishing an ethical code of conduct for personnel; (v) preventing and resolving conflicts of interest; and (vi) preventing the filing of false or off-the-record reports and the use of forged documents. Russia also joined the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] in 2012 and has the G20 Presidency in 2013, where fighting corruption is one of three main issues on the agenda. Companies should therefore actively ensure that they stay compliant with the new amendment to the Anti-Corruption Law.

===The anti-money-laundering initiative===
Corruption has an obvious connection with [[money laundering]] as the stolen assets of a corrupt public official are useless unless they are placed, layered and integrated into the global financial network in a manner that does not raise suspicion. The proceeds of corruption may be laundered in jurisdictions which have not enacted strict anti-money laundering measures and in countries which uphold very strict bank-secretary laws or regulations. This is the reason why the "de-offshorization" policy endorsed by President Putin in 2012 and 2013 (after the Cyprus Affaire) is often considered to be a new anti-corruption measure. The government's recent initiatives for gradually strengthening control over financial operations of organisations and citizens have been the subject of The [[Russian Federal Financial Monitoring Service]] ("Rosfinmonitoring"). A law has been drafted, which introduced amendments to a number of legal acts and aimed at increasing the transparency of currency transactions and at strengthening anti-money laundering measures in Russia. This respective law, with corresponding amendments, was passed on 30 June 2013. The law introduces changes to a variety of legislative acts and ensures the overall enhancement of control over businesses and citizens with respect to financial operations.

The most important amendments for businesses are those that modify the regulation of banking activity. The amendments considerably affect credit organizations which would most likely be required to amend their internal anti money laundering policies and procedures for identification of customers. On one hand, they allow the bankers to demand disclosure of the transaction purpose from the client. On the other hand, this might raise substantial risks in terms of optimizing business, including potential delay in completing payments.

===National Plan to Counter Corruption===
Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new national anti-corruption plan for the period from 2014 to 2015. The president ordered executive and legislative authorities by July 1, 2014 to make relevant amendments to their anti-corruption plans and to ensure control over their execution. A relevant order was included in the National Plan to Counter Corruption for 2014–2015.

The governor of the Komi republic was arrested for stealing money from state funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/leonid-bershidsky-oil-crash-results-in-moscow-warning-to-russias-comfortably-corrupt|first=Leonid |last=Bershidsky |title=Oil crash results in Moscow warning to Russia’s comfortably corrupt | publisher=Bloomberg News via National Post| date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Corruption Foundation===
[[Anti-Corruption Foundation]] is a nonprofit organization based in Moscow established in 2011 by activist and politician Alexey Navalny. It's main goal is to investigate and to expose corruption cases among high-ranking Russian government officials, which they have been successfully doing for the last few years.

==Research==
Transparency International Russia's report from 2012 shows a variety of activities that give citizens a chance to monitor corruption. It collaborated with the Youth Human Rights movement on a large-scale campaign in 20 cities to check police officers' identification tags. This is a proactive exercise to stop petty corruption. If an officer can be identified, he or she is less likely to ask for a bribe. Transparency International Russia also monitors the income statements of Russian public officials with the help of students and publishes the results and monitored the use of 600 million rubles (US$19 million) of public funds to socially oriented NGOs, and found several cases of conflict of interests. It provided analysis and recommendations on making this process more transparent and accountable. the NGO works cooperatively with all individuals and groups, with for-profit and not-for-profit corporations and organisations, and with bodies committed to the fight against corruption. It undertakes professional analysis and papers on corruption-related issues trying to explain the reasons of the spread of corruption, its political and social implications and trying to analyse the possible scenarios for the future.

On 9 December 2014 Novosti agency reported that the head of the National Anti-Corruption Committee Kirill Kabanov admitted on air that a third of Russian officials were corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusnovosti.ru/news/356354/ "Каждый третий чиновник в России берёт взятки, заявили в НАК"], ''life.ru'', 9 декабря 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Russian officials are periodically accused of spending on luxury cars, mansions or clothes worth significantly more than their declared income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Investigation Exposes Glam Life Of Vladimir Putin's Bling Ring|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/new-investigation-exposes-glam-life-of-vladimir-putins-bling#.ctYJBMn8p|accessdate=2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Corruption Fatigue {{!}} Opinion|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/corruption-fatigue/436298.html|accessdate=2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Russia’s Prisoner Dilemma {{!}} Russia!

A 2018 study of state corruption in Russia during the 1750s–1830s found that "as far as we could tell on the basis of our sample of records, the volume of resources extracted from the population through ‘routine’ corruption appears to have been surprisingly low."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korchmina|first=Elena|last2=Fedyukin|first2=Igor|title=Extralegal payments to state officials in Russia, 1750s–1830s: assessing the burden of corruption|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ehr.12666/abstract|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/ehr.12666|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors write, "every little interaction with state officials involved paying a fee to the clerks, and such fees, although technically illegal, were so common and commonly accepted as to be entered in the account books alongside other operational expenses. On the other hand, these ‘routine’ payments were really quite small, especially if apportioned on a per capita basis among the entire commune ... Such fees appear to have been largely customary in nature, a part of the traditional economy of gift-giving, demonstrating respect, and maintaining informal relationships (‘good disposition’). Yet, even such a low level of per capita extraction would have allowed key district officials to amass significant amounts, at a very minimum tripling their salaries."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Russian Prosecutor General Office reported that of the persons convicted for corruption in 2017, the number of law enforcement functionaries and parliamentaries (nearly 2,200 persons) constituted over 11%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsru.com/russia/23apr2018/genproc.html Генпрокуратура отчиталась о числе осужденных за коррупцию силовиков и депутатов], ''[[news.ru]]'', April 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Rowland''' (born 1945) is a British property developer.

== Property career ==

Rowland took over other groups, issuing shares in his own company to pay for acquisitions. Eventually he sold his stake in Fordham for £2.4m in 1970, and moved to France.

In 1988, Rowland helped fund a lawyer, David Duff, in a takeover of Edinburgh Hibernian, parent company of [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] football club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. Eventually the company went into receivership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/hibernianfc/Mercer-Merger-20-years-on.6334773.jp |title=Hibs chairman’s revolution ended in club being open to hostile bid |publisher=Sport.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Rowland sold his controlling interest to Nycal Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-10924709/nycal-tries-swallow-firm.html |title=Washington Business Journal - Nycal tries to swallow firm 8 times its size |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=3 June 1991 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following years, Gulf resorted to the American courts to recover company monies they alleged were spent by David Rowland, firstly via the courts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romingerlegal.com/ninth_circuit/ninth_appeals/8540ninthcircuit.html |title=Gulf USA vs. David Rowland 1997/8 |publisher=Romingerlegal.com |date= |accessdate=25 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311072903/http://www.romingerlegal.com/ninth_circuit/ninth_appeals/8540ninthcircuit.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then via their insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/259/259.F3d.1049.99-35881.html |title=Gulf USA vs. Federal Insurance 2001 |publisher=Ftp.resource.org |date= |accessdate=25 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325093540/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/259/259.F3d.1049.99-35881.html |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; One case was settled (though no financial settlement was deemed necessary), while Gulf lost another.

In 2009, [[Kaupthing Bank]], affected by the global liquidity squeeze was divided into two new entities, a ‘good, healthy’ bank, later [[Banque Havilland]], and a ‘bad’ bank. David Rowland and his son Jonathan, via their investment company Blackfish Capital, acquired and recapitalized the former and now manage the assets, on behalf of the interbank creditors, of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/5819352/Rowland-family-open-new-bank-from-remains-of-Kaupthings-Luxembourg-arm.html |title=Rowland family open new bank|publisher=The Telegraph |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2013 |location=London |first=Graham |last=Ruddick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]], Rowland donated £2.8m to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], making him the party’s major donor.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt;  In 2010, he was announced as being the next Treasurer of the Conservative Party.

== Description ==
{{Wikinews|Canadian woman faces 234 counts of double-doctoring}}

A doctor shopper will visit multiple health care providers as a "new patient" or "visiting from out of town," and will exaggerate or feign medical problems to obtain prescriptive medications&lt;ref name="ci"&gt;{{citation | author1=Kären M. Hess | author2=Christine Hess Orthmann | chapter=Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator | title=Criminal Investigation | edition=9th | year=2010 | publisher=Delmar | page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a wanted medical opinion, diagnosis or treatment with no specific material gain.&lt;ref name="HYPOCH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HYPOCP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FD1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FD2" /&gt;

=== For prescription drugs ===

Frequently involved in prescription fraud are [[narcotic]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[tranquilizer]]s and other psychoactive substances manufactured for use in legitimate medical treatment. Law enforcement officers spend a significant amount of time investigating cases involving prescription fraud, many of which also involve [[insurance fraud|insurance]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], or [[Medicaid]] fraud.&lt;ref name="ci" /&gt;

Prescription drug diversion occurs by faking, forging, or altering a prescription; obtaining bogus prescriptions from criminal medical practitioners; or buying drugs diverted from health care facilities by personnel. Pharmacy thefts are increasing throughout the United States to feed the growing demand for prescription drugs. The rising cost of prescription drugs has also enticed senior citizens to join in the diversion and to sell their prescriptions.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;

Doctor shopping is a kind of [[malingering]] with the specific goal of procuring prescription drugs. Malingering is underdiagnosed, often because of the physician's fear of making false accusations. Covert surveillance has indicated that as many as 20% of pain clinic patients misrepresent the extent of their disability. The judgment of the morality of malingering is largely a matter of the observer and circumstances. Most people would regard the defraudment of an insurance company, by a false injury, as an antisocial act. In contrast, the malingering of a prisoner-of-war, who is attempting to manipulate his or her captors, would be seen by most compatriots as a skillful coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{citation | editor1=Michael H. Ebert | editor2=Peter T. Loosen | editor3=Barry Nurcombe |display-editors = 3 | editor4=James F. Leckman | author=Charles V. Ford | chapter=Factitious Disorders and Malingering | title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Psychiatry | edition=2nd | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-07-142292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor shopping is associated with the ubiquitous [[medicalization]] of drug use, as an alternative to [[criminalization]] and [[legalization]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== In hypochondriasis and factitious disorders ===

Some patients of [[hypochondria]], [[factitious disorder]] and [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy|factitious disorder imposed on another]] will visit multiple health care providers to find a medical opinion, diagnosis or treatment that they feel the need to get,&lt;ref name="HYPOCH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HYPOCP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FD1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FD2" /&gt; not specifically in search of prescription drugs, for no material benefit&lt;ref name=medscapeoverview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/295258-overview#a4 |title=Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another - Etiology |títulotrad= |accessdate=19 June 2016 | author= Dr. Guy E Brannon MD |publisher=[[Medscape]], [[WebMD]] |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cleveland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic_An_Overview_of_Factitious_Disorders |title=Diseases and conditions - Factitious disorders |accessdate=19 June 2016  |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even incurring in significant costs, debts or losses. This kind of doctor shopping lacks intention to commit malingering for material gain and is the result of such mental conditions.

'''Dual control''' is the situation in which a national [[government]] agrees to share control of its country with representatives of foreign governments, called ''controllers'', because it is [[international debt|indebted]] to them.

==Examples==
*[[Egypt]], which was indebted to European powers after the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and thus forced to accept controllers in its government in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="dualcontrol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/arab-world/lutsky/ch15.htm|title=Modern History of the Arab Countries by Vladimir Borisovich Lutsky 1969|first=Vladimir Borisovich|last=Lutsky|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee''' ({{lang-bn|দুর্বার মহিলা সমন্বয় সমিতি}} ''Durbar Mohila Shômonbôe Shomiti'' "Unstoppable Women's Synthesis Committee") or '''Durbar''', is a collective of 65,000 [[sex worker]]s in [[West Bengal]]. Established on 15 February 1992, in [[Sonagachi]], the largest [[red-light district]] in Kolkata, [[West Bengal]], India with estimated 11,000 sex workers, Durbar has been working on women's rights and [[sex workers' rights]] [[advocacy]], [[anti-human trafficking]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention.&lt;ref name=mint2012&gt;{{cite news |title=The new rhythms of Sonagachi: As the city’s sex workers collective turns 20...|url=http://www.livemint.com/2012/02/24202846/The-new-rhythms-of-Sonagachi.html |publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2208/stories/20050422000408100.htm A missionary enterprise] [[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]], Volume 22 - Issue 08, 12 - 25 Mar. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Durbar states that its aims are the challenging and altering of the barriers that form the everyday reality of sex workers' lives as they relate to their poverty or their [[ostracism]]. Durbar runs 51 free clinics for sex workers across West Bengal, with support from organisations such as the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[National AIDS Control Organisation]] (NACO), who also help Durbar in its initiatives like networking, rights protection and creating alternative livelihood for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex workers’ union gives them the power to say no|url=http://www.livemint.com/2009/11/30230829/Sex-workers8217-union-gives.html |publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=30 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They work for the legalisation of prostitution and seek to reform laws that restrict [[human rights]] of sex 

==History==
On 15 February 1992, a public health scientist Dr. Smarajit Jana of [[All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health]], Kolkata, visited the red-light area of [[Sonagachi]] for a HIV intervention research study. A [[peer education]] team was formed from amongst the sex workers and provided training. Shortly after, studies revealed larger issues amongst sex workers, such as sex workers rights, education of their children, access to financial services and handling of harassment by police and local thugs, along with promoting the use of condoms. Thus in 1995 he formed 'Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee' (DMSC) with 12 sex workers as stakeholders, by 2012 DMSC had a membership of 65,000 from 48 branches across the state of West Bengal, and continues to be managed by sex workers, their children and government officials as its board members, and has not just female sex workers as its members but also male and [[transgender]] sex workers.&lt;ref name=mint2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.durbar.org/html/history.asp History of Durbar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ba&gt;[[#Ba|Bagchi, p. 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, it has been working as an [[advocacy group]] for sex workers and over the years, it has worked towards sensitizing general public about rights of sex workers, often initiating debate and discussion in public media and press, besides advocating abolition of 'The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956' (PITA), and legalisation of sex work.&lt;ref name=ba/&gt; Many sex workers now have voters identity cards, health insurance and even bank accounts. In 1995, its [[consumer cooperative]] society and [[micro-credit]] programme, 'Usha' (literally meaning light), ensured that the [[Government of West Bengal]] altered the state's cooperative law to register it as a sex workers [[cooperative]], instead of a 'housewives cooperative' under the prevalent state laws. By 2006-2007, small saving of its 5,000 members lead to an annual turnover to {{INRConvert| 9.75|c}}, with loan of  {{INRConvert| 2.12|c}} distributed amongst its members, which also helped break the monopoly of local moneylenders, who would charge interest rates of up to 300%.&lt;ref name=mint2012/&gt; The DMSC hosted India's first national convention of sex workers on 14 November 1997 in Kolkata, titled 'Sex Work is Real Work: We Demand Workers Rights'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswp.org/rights/dmsc/indiaconf.html Sex work is real work: We demand workers rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212230342/http://www.nswp.org/rights/dmsc/indiaconf.html |date=12 December 2006 }}, announcement of the 1997 sex worker convention&lt;/ref&gt;

DMSC runs 17 non-formal schools for children of sex workers, and two hostels, one at [[Ultadanga]] and the other at [[Baruipur]].  Its cultural wing, 'Komol Gandhar', teaches dance, drama, mime and music to children, who invited regularly for paid shows.

==HIV/AIDS project==

The Durbar runs the STD/HIV Intervention Programme (commonly known as the [[Sonagachi|Sonagachi Project]]) since 1999. The ownership and management of the Sonagachi Project was taken over by DMSC from the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, a central government public health training and research institute based in [[Kolkata]], which had initiated the programme in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngoconnect.org/february2004issue6.htm The Songachi project is 12!] NGO Connect The Shakti Newsletter Issue 18. Jan / Feb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining control of the STD/HIV Intervention Programme in 1999, DMSC began replicating the Sonagachi model in other [[Red-light district|red light area]]s in West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DEAD ZONES: Fighting Back in India.; Calcutta's Prostitutes Lead the Fight on AIDS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/04/world/dead-zones-fighting-back-in-india-calcutta-s-prostitutes-lead-the-fight-on-aids.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 January 1999  }}&lt;/ref&gt; DMSC also implements STD/HIV intervention Programme among street-based sex workers and their clients, covering a population of over 20,000 sex workers and migrant labourers. DMSC currently implements and runs STD/HIV intervention programmes in 49 sex work sites in West Bengal.

The approach of Durbar's programme is based on the ''3 Rs'' - Respect, Reliance and Recognition. Respect towards sex workers, Reliance on the knowledge and wisdom of the community of sex workers and, Recognition of sex work as an occupation, for protecting their occupational and human rights.

Durbar is active in building broader alliances to promote HIV prevention, care and support for HIV infected and affected individuals and families both at the national and regional levels.

The book ''[[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]]'' reports investigations revealing, who tried to provide, contrary to stated policy, the DMSC allows sex slavery, trafficking, and underage girls in its brothels.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D.; Sheryl WuDunn. 2009.

'''Eddie and Sol Zakay''' (born July 1950 and June 1952 respectively) are Israeli-born British [[billionaire]] brothers. They made their fortune in real estate through their company [[Topland Group]].

==Early life==
Eddie Zakay was born in July 1950 and Sol Zakay was born in June 1952.&lt;ref name=CompaniesHouse&gt;{{cite web |title=Topland Group plc |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02615001/officers |website=Companies House |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were both born in Israel &lt;ref name=thisismoney&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bridge |first1=Sarah |title=£35m payday for property brothers |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1528271/16335m-payday-for-property-brothers.html |accessdate=1 October 2015 |work=thisismoney |date=16 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Eddie and Sol Zakay started their property business in Britain during the 1980s property boom. They later expanded into the U.S. and Middle Eastern markets.&lt;ref name=thisismoney /&gt; ''The Times'' described the brothers as having made their money principally through [[sale and leaseback]] deals with supermarkets, particularly an important deal with [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Sol Zakay Property entrepreneur", Catherine Boyle, ''The Times'', 21 July 2008, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sol Zakay left Britain to live in Israel. In 2013, he returned to the UK and took over as chairman and CEO of Topland from Eddie, who became deputy chairman.&lt;ref name=propertymall&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hanscomb |first1=Harry |title=Topland - General - UK, Sol Zakay set to return to UK to lead Topland investment drive |url=http://www.propertymall.com/property-news/article/32855-Sol-Zakay-set-to-return-to-UK-to-lead-Topland-investment-drive |accessdate=1 October 2015 |work=propertymall |date=2 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topland Group is one of the world's largest privately owned property and investment groups. The company owns property in the UK and in 2013 bought 12 out of the 15 hotels (all in the UK) owned by the bankrupt Menzies Hotels for about $135 million.&lt;ref name=JBN&gt;{{cite web |title=Zakay Brothers’s Topland Group Buys Menzies UK Hotel Chain for $135 Million |url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/12/04/zakay-brotherss-topland-group-buys-menzies-uk-hotel-chain-for-135-million/ |website=Jewishbusinessnews |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They own a number of other UK hotels, including Bath’s Royal Crescent Hotel, the [[Hilton Brighton Metropole]], the Glasgow Hilton and several [[Thistle Hotel]]s, six in central London and one in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=JBN/&gt;

The brothers are thought to be majority owners of Topland which, according to ''This is Money'' in 2003, is "ultimately controlled from the British Virgin Islands".&lt;ref name=thisismoney /&gt; On the ''[[Forbes]]'' 2016 list of the world's billionaires, they were ranked #688 with a net worth of [[United States dollar|US$]]2.5 billion.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/eddie-sol-zakay/?list=billionaires |title=The World's Billionaires (2016 ranking): #688 Eddie &amp; Sol Zakay |date=1 March 2016 |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has since diversified into natural resources and renewable energy.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

==Legal dispute==
In 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Topland and Eddie Zakay were being sued by the U.K.'s [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] for allegedly having "conspired with a property agent in 2002 to extract inflated rents from the government on one of its central London buildings which houses the main London divorce courts" and having engaged in "deceit, fraud by bribery, dishonest assistance and breach of confidence" and "unlawful conspiracy". The case was first lodged by Labour party minister [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]] in May 2010. In 2011, the brothers, via Topland, made a £25,000 donation to the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], who by then were in government with the Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramesh |first1=Randeep |title=Firm sued by ministry is Tory donor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/06/tory-donor-topland-sued |accessdate=1 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently "settled out of court on confidential terms".&lt;ref name=thelondonmagazine&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bar-Hillel |first1=Mira |title=The Brothers |url=http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/people-places/london-life/the-brothers.html |accessdate=2 October 2015 |work=thelondonmagazine |date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2010, Topland held a business lunch at the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] in London in conjunction with [[Jewish Care]], at which £241,000 was raised for the charity's causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/galleries/the-guest-list/lord-mandelson-helps-raise-%C2%A3241k-jewish-care?img=9 Lord Mandelson helps to raise £241K for Jewish Care.] ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'', 15 November 2010.

The '''El Calabozo massacre''' was an incident during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] on August 21&amp;ndash;22 1982, in which more than two hundred people, including children and elderly, were reportedly killed at El Calabozo by the [[Atlacatl Battalion]] of the [[Salvadoran Army]].

In August 1982, the Salvadoran military attacked the [[San Vicente Department]], an area where the rebel [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] was known to have bases. The department was bombed for several days before ground forces advanced, causing many civilians to flee.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/08/120822_el_salvador_masacre_aniversario.shtml |title=La masacre que quedó impune en El Salvador |language=Spanish |date=August 22, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvI3DQMf?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/08/120822_el_salvador_masacre_aniversario.shtml |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of August 21, a group of [[internally displaced people]] was overtaken beside the [[Amatitán river]] by the Atlacatl Battalion, a US-trained counter-insurgency unit.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,SLV,,503757f22,0.html |title=El Salvador: Killed in cold blood on the banks of the river at El Calabozo |date=August 22, 2012 |publisher=Amnesty International via UNHCR |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=April 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416033047/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,SLV,,503757f22,0.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlacatl Battalion had previously been responsible for the [[El Mozote massacre]], in which up to 900 captured civilians had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity |author=Alex J.

The dead included infants and elderly.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=AI /&gt;

The massacre was first publicly reported in [[The Boston Globe]] on September 8, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Salvador massacre of 300 alleged|last=Associated Press|first=|date=8 September 1982|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=55|access-date=|via=ProQuest Historical Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Defense [[José Guillermo García]] stated that the government had investigated the incident and determined that no massacre had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thinking Clearly: Cases in Journalistic Decision-Making |author=Tom Rosenstiel and Amy S.

Though the [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]] documented the massacre's existence, the government closed the case in 1993 without charges.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; As of 2012, the Salvadoran government had not acknowledged the existence of the massacre or prosecuted those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/el-salvador-urged-respond-el-calabozo-massacre-survivors-demands-2012-11-01 |title=El Salvador urged to respond to El Calabozo massacre survivors' demands |date=November 1, 2012 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvJFLW8D?url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/el-salvador-urged-respond-el-calabozo-massacre-survivors-demands-2012-11-01 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2644">'''Federal republicanism''' is an [[ideology]], prevalent mainly in the 19th century [[Spain]], which incorporates [[republicanism]] and advocates local associations of [[citizen]]s and promotes citizen participation in public affairs. An important part being the concept of [[federalism]], looking for the devolution or distribution and management to smaller administrative units to prevent [[government]]s with a strong central concentration of power. It was the prelude to [[cantonalism]] in the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Sarah (2004). "[http://app.cul.columbia.edu:8080/ac/handle/10022/AC:P:5590 Spain's glorious revolution : social protest and the politics of liberty in Mʹalaga, 1868-1874]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with anarchism==
[[anarchism|Anarchists]] have tended to feel close to Republican authors, e.g., [[Benjamin Tucker]] who wrote, "Anarchists are simply Jeffersonian democrats till the last consequences and without fear of it. They believe that 'the best government is that which governs least', and that which governs least does not govern at all", referring to quotes from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banderanegra.canadianwebs.com/tucker.html Socialismo de Estado y anarquismo en qué coinciden y en qué difieren] {{es icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] expressed their sympathies to the ideal of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] and proclaimed it to be close to the anarchist idea. [[Enrique Flores Magon]] tried to win over the Mexican public by claiming Thomas Jefferson was "an anarchist of his time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/trans/cast/mexico_wehling.html Influencias anarquistas en la Revolución Mexicana] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Francisco Pi y Margall]] was claimed by the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] of his time. It was speculated that he drew his conception of [[federalism]] from the work ''Principle of Federation'' of the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, although some experts argue that the ideas of Pi Margall were already outlined in his earlier writings prior to Proudhon's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asturiasrepublicana.com/pi1.html Biografía de Francisco Pi y Margall] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of Canadian Municipalities''' ('''FCM''', {{fr icon}} ''Fédération canadienne des municipalités'') is an advocacy group representing over 2000 Canadian municipalities.  It is an organization with no formal power but significant ability to influence debate and policy, as it is a main national lobby group of mayors, councillors and other elected municipal officials.  It negotiates with the [[Government of Canada]]'s departments and agencies on behalf of municipalities, and administers a number of funds.

==History==
In 1901, the Union of Canadian Municipalities was formed to represent the interests of municipal governments. Another association, the Dominion Conference of Mayors was established in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=UBCM: The First Century: Union of British Columbia Municipalities | url=http://www.granvilleislandpublishing.com/our_titles/history/UBCM.html | accessdate=2009-01-09 | year=2006 | isbn=1-894694-39-2 | publisher=Granville Island }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, these two associations were amalgamated into the Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities which in 1976 would be renamed the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social/communities-neighborhoods-cities/923842-1.html |accessdate=2009-01-09 |title=Coping with Canadian federalism: the case of the Federation of Canadian municipalities |author1=Stevenson, Don |author2=Gilbert, Richard |publisher=''Canadian Public Administration'' |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421002310/http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social/communities-neighborhoods-cities/923842-1.html |archivedate=2012-04-21 |df= }} or [http://www.richardgilbert.ca/Files/2005/Stevenson-Gilbert%20for%20CPAJ%20(Web).pdf on Gilbert's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

FCM was instrumental in negotiating the federal government's 2005 "New Deal for Cities" programme,&lt;ref&gt;G+M oped by [[Jack Diamond (architect)|Jack Diamond]]: [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/new-deal-for-cities-critical/article774172/ "New deal for cities critical"], 3 Dec 2003&lt;/ref&gt; under which Canadian federal gasoline taxes are remitted to municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infc.gc.ca/media/news-nouvelles/gtf-fte/2005/20050201ottawa-eng.html |publisher=[[Infrastructure Canada]] |accessdate=2009-01-09 |date=2005-02-01 |title=Government on track to deliver New Deal for Cities and Communities |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181815/http://www.infc.gc.ca/media/news-nouvelles/gtf-fte/2005/20050201ottawa-eng.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }} see also [[Department of Finance]] archives [http://www.fin.gc.ca/budget05/pamph/pacom-eng.asp "A New Deal for Canada's Communities"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successes==
• Delivering $2 billion each year to municipalities from a permanent federal Gas Tax Fund. Over the next 20 years, this gas tax transfer will be worth $40 billion to cities and communities.

• Successfully advocating for significant federal funding towards the $123-billion municipal infrastructure deficit. In the 2009 budget, the federal government committed more than $12 billion over two years in new and accelerated infrastructure funding to municipal priorities.

==Sustainable development==
• FCM's Green Municipal Fund (GMF) provides below-market loans and grants, as well as education and training services to support municipal initiatives that improve air, water and soil quality, and protect the climate.  This programme was established by the Chrétien government in 2001 with $100 million "to stimulate investment in innovative municipal infrastructure", and "to support municipal government action to cut pollution, reduce greenhouse gases and improve quality of life".&lt;ref name=gilbert/&gt;

==Global engagement==
• Since 1987, FCM's international department has helped more than 200 Canadian municipalities and associations engage in development cooperation in more than 40 countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean.

The '''Greek Military Police''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Στρατιωτική Αστυνομία}}), generally known in [[Greek language|Greek]] by the acronym '''ESA''' ({{lang-el|ΕΣΑ}}), was the [[military police]] branch of the [[Greek Army]] in the years 1951–1974.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Army General Staff, Directorate of Stratonomia, History&lt;/ref&gt; It developed into a powerful [[paramilitary]]{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} organization and a stronghold of [[right-wing]], [[conservative]] Army officers.&lt;ref&gt;Petridis, Exousia kai Paraexousia 1957-1967, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It became the main security ([[secret police]]) and [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] organization during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. After the fall of the junta and the restoration of democracy in 1974, it was disbanded because of its brutal practices, which included the widespread use of [[torture]].

From 1974, the Greek Army maintains a military police section called '''Stratonomia''' ({{lang|el|Στρατονομία}}), but its powers are far less extensive than those of ESA.

==Establishment==
The ESA was established in 1951, as Greece was preparing to join [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;Greek Army General Staff, Directorate of Stratonomia, History.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until then, the [[Greek Army]] did not have a specialized military police force. Being posted in the ESA was a major bonus for Army officers because it had very extensive powers within the military, even before the dictatorship. Both the officers and the soldiers who served in ESA were picked for their extreme, almost paranoid, [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodoracopoulos, the Greek Upheaval, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in making ESA a bastion of the most conservative and anti-democratic members of the Greek officer corps. ESA men wore a distinctive uniform with a [[royal blue]] [[cap]] (the soldiers wore a beret at the time), golden [[lanyard]] on their right shoulder and an armband with the letters ESA around their left arm.

==During the Junta==
In April 1967, shortly after seizing power in a coup, junta leader [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] appointed [[Dimitrios Ioannides]] chief of the ESA, which gradually had been transformed into an internal security army.

When Papadopoulos declared [[Martial law]] after the 1967 coup, he increased the power of the ESA even further by making it the junta's chief arm of law and order as well as repression. Under Ioannides, ESA rose to a force of more than 20,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Theodoracopoulos, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of the junta's political opponents were arrested by the ESA and sent to some of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]'s most desolate islands, called the prison islands. Many of the allegations of prisoner torture under the Papadopoulos regime involved the ESA, in particular its '''Special Investigative Section''' ({{lang-el|Ειδικόν Ανακριτικόν Τμήμα}}, tr. ''Eidikón Anakritikón Tmíma''), commonly known in its abbreviated form as ΕAT or EAT/ESA ({{lang-el|ΕΑΤ or ΕΑΤ/ΕΣΑ}}).

Use of [[torture chamber]]s by ESA during interrogations was reported during the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greek military junta]] years.&lt;ref name="ESA chambers"&gt;[http://www.athensnews.gr/athweb/nathens.print_unique?e=C&amp;f=13012&amp;m=A13&amp;aa=1&amp;eidos=A Athens news on ESA torture chambers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211184321/http://www.athensnews.gr/athweb/nathens.print_unique?e=C&amp;f=13012&amp;m=A13&amp;aa=1&amp;eidos=A |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-20100817&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/7950781/Dimitrios-Ioannidis.html |title=Obitury: Dimitrios Ioannidis |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandros Panagoulis]] was one example of a person tortured at the EAT/ESA interrogation cell units.&lt;ref name="ESA chambers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reportage"/&gt; Greek politician Nikos Konstantopoulos is another example.&lt;ref name="Red Cross"&gt;[http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&amp;f=12396&amp;m=C03&amp;aa=1 To Vima online]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Interview with Nikos Konstantopoulos. Quote: ''Δεν θα ξεχάσω τις τρεις - τέσσερις πρώτες μέρες μου στην ΕΑΤ-ΕΣΑ. Ημουν σε ένα κελί, αναγκασμένος μετά από πολύ ξύλο να στέκω όρθιος και να περπατώ συνέχεια, χωρίς νερό και φαΐ... Είχε παράθυρο το κελί σας; «Στην αρχή είχε μόνο έναν μικρό φεγγίτη. Μετά όμως με την παρέμβαση του Ερυθρού Σταυρού μού άνοιξαν ένα παράθυρο». .'' Translation: ''I will never forget my first three-four days at EAT/ESA. I was in a cell forced after a lot of beating to stand and to walk continuously without water or food. Did your cell have a window? In the beginning it only had a small opening. After the intervention of the Red Cross however they opened a window for me''&lt;/ref&gt; Army Major [[Spyros Moustaklis]] was left brain damaged and unable to speak after the torture he endured at EAT/ESA.

Alarmed at moves Papadopoulos was making towards a transition to democratic rule, loannidis used his position and power as ESA chief to oust him from power.

The ESA was disbanded in 1974 by [[Constantine Karamanlis]] and its leading members involved in torture were [[court-martial]]led and sentenced during the [[Greek junta trials]], although many served only token prison terms.

===Members===
Research based on interviews with 21 former ESA members shows that all had been men had been drafted, first into regular military service and then into the ESA. Carried out by Janice T. Gibson and Mika Haritos-Fatouros, the research also showed that recruits underwent series of rigorous treatments and training over a matter of months in order to prepare them psychologically for the task of torturing detainees.&lt;ref&gt;Janice T. Gibson &amp; Mika Haritos-Fatouros, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1175/is_v20/ai_4471948/pg_1 "The education of a torturer"], ''Psychology Today'' (1986), 20, pp. 50-58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
The headquarters of the Special Interrogation Sections of the Military Police (EAT-ESA) was in a building which now houses the Eleftherios Venizelos Museum at [[Eleftherias Park]], [[Vassilissis Sofias Avenue]] in Athens.&lt;ref name="Reportage"&gt;[http://www.rwf.gr/interviews_senaria-new.php?id=152&amp;interview=1&amp;interview_id=323 Reportage without frontiers from ET (Greek National TV)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211160841/http://www.rwf.gr/interviews_senaria-new.php?id=152&amp;interview=1&amp;interview_id=323 |date=11 February 2009 }} Interview with Vice Admiral Konstantinos Dimitriadis Quote: ''The food was filled with salt. Threats. Some even suffered moral threats. That their wives and so on and some forged photos with scandals let's say. With threats, with such stuff and profanity. All day and all night long a radio playing. A radio with various songs of the time and so on. And tape recorders with cries to break the morale, let's say. Such stuff, and for some people of course, not everybody was humiliated in the same way. Είχανε κάτι ζωστήρες. They had some belts. The worst case was that of Moustaklis, of course; the man was severely beaten and almost died.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Political prisoners"&gt;[http://www.political-prisoners.net/home.php?id=9&amp;lang=en&amp;action=campaign Political prisoners network] quote: 12.00 a.m. - 1.00 p.m.: Commemoration and press conference at the EAT-ESA (EAT-ESA is a museum today, and it was used as a torture center of the gendarmery during the military junta)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to witnesses at the [[court martial]] proceedings, ESA's operating [[doctrine]] was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those who enter here, exit either as friends or as cripples."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/print_article.php?e=B&amp;f=13021&amp;m=A44&amp;aa=1 To Vima online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807055752/http://www.tovima.gr/print_article.php/?e=B&amp;f=13021&amp;m=A44&amp;aa=1 |date=7 August 2011 }}  Christos Karanikas Quote: "«"Φίλος ή σακάτης βγαίνει όποιος έρχεται εδώ μέσα" ήταν το "δόγμα" της ΕΣΑ, όπως αποκαλύπτουν οι μάρτυρες εις το Στρατοδικείο» γράφει «Το Βήμα» της 13ης Αυγούστου 1975" &lt;br&gt; Translation Quote: "«" Whoever comes here, is a friend (of the regime) or  a cripple when he leaves "was the" doctrine "of ESA, as revealed by witnesses at the Court-Martial» writes The «Vima» of 13 August 1975,"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Law 276/76 renamed ESA simply to "Military Police" (Στρατονομία, ''Stratonomia'').

Corresponding organizations exist also for the other two branches of the Greek armed forces: for the [[Hellenic Air Force]] (Αερονομία, ''Aeronomia''), founded in 1945 as "Greek Air Force Police" (Ελληνική Αεροπορική Αστυνομία, EAA), and for the [[Hellenic Navy]] (Ναυτονομία, ''Naftonomia'', properly Υπηρεσία Ναυτονομίας or Y.NΑ.).

These three forces work together often but are independent from each other. Most of the personnel are draftee soldiers undergoing their regular military service.

A '''Herringbone''' is one type of [[military formation]] (named after the [[Herringbone pattern]]). When in a Herringbone formation, the person at the front of the [[squad]] faces forward, while the rest of the squad lines up behind them, facing left and right, alternating as such. The final member of the squad in the herringbone formation faces backwards. When the squad decides to relocate, the person next to the member facing backwards will tap him on the shoulder to make sure he is not left behind. This formation is performed commonly after crossing [[obstacle]]s.

[[File:Hubbert world 2004.svg|thumb|right|300px|2004 U.S. government predictions for oil production other than in [[OPEC]] and the [[former Soviet Union]]]]

The '''Hubbert peak theory''' says that for any given geographical area, from an individual oil-producing region to the planet as a whole, the rate of [[petroleum]] production tends to follow a [[Logistic distribution|bell-shaped curve]]. It is one of the primary theories on [[peak oil]].

Choosing a particular curve determines a point of maximum production based on discovery rates, production rates and cumulative production. Early in the curve (pre-peak), the production rate increases due to the discovery rate and the addition of infrastructure. Late in the curve (post-peak), production declines because of resource depletion.

The Hubbert peak theory is based on the observation that the amount of oil under the ground in any region is finite, therefore the rate of discovery which initially increases quickly must reach a maximum and decline. In the US, oil extraction followed the discovery curve after a time lag of 32 to 35 years.&lt;ref name="Laherrere2005"&gt;Jean Laherrere, "Forecasting production from discovery", ASPO Lisbon May 19–20, 2005 [http://www.cge.uevora.pt/aspo2005/abscom/ASPO2005_Laherrere.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wood2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/svl/GE3320/OIL%20SEMINAR%20jrw.ppt |title=Peak Oil: The Looming Energy Crisis |author=J.R. Wood |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is named after American geophysicist [[M. King Hubbert]], who created a method of modeling the production curve given an assumed ultimate recovery volume.

==Hubbert's peak==
"Hubbert's peak" can refer to the peaking of production of a particular area, which has now been observed for many fields and regions.

Hubbert's peak was thought to have been achieved in the United States contiguous 48 states (that is, excluding Alaska and Hawaii) in the early 1970s. Oil production peaked at {{convert|10200000|oilbbl/d}} and then declined for several years since.  Yet, recent advances in extraction technology, particularly those that led to the extraction of tight oil and oil from shale, have drastically changed the picture. A decline in production followed the 1970s peak of more than 10 million barrels. In November of 2017 the United States once again surpassed the 10 million barrel mark for the first time since 1970. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/us-oil-production-tops-10-million-barrels-a-day-for-first-time-since-1970.html|title=US oil production tops 10 million barrels a day for first time since 1970|last=Domm|first=Patti|date=2018-01-31|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peak oil]] as a proper noun, or "Hubbert's peak" applied more generally, refers to a predicted event: the peak of the entire planet's oil production. After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production on Earth would enter a terminal decline. On the basis of his theory, in a paper&lt;ref name="Hubbert1956"&gt;Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels, M.K. Hubbert, Presented before the Spring Meeting of the Southern District, American Petroleum Institute, Plaza Hotel, San Antonio, Texas, March 7–8–9, 1956 {{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he presented to the [[American Petroleum Institute]] in 1956, Hubbert correctly predicted that production of oil from conventional sources would peak in the continental United States around 1965–1970.  His prediction of inevitable decline has been incorrect, but the 1970 peak has yet not been surpassed. Hubbert further predicted a worldwide peak at "about half a century" from publication and approximately 12 gigabarrels (GB) a year in magnitude. In a 1976 TV interview&lt;ref name="Hubbert1976"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImV1voi41YY |title=1976 Hubbert Clip |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbert added that the actions of [[OPEC]] might flatten the global production curve but this would only delay the peak for perhaps 10 years. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Hubbert's theory==

===Hubbert curve===
[[File:Hubbert curve.svg|thumb|The standard [[Hubbert curve]]. For applications, the ''x'' and ''y'' scales are replaced by time and production scales.]]
[[File:US Crude Oil Production and Imports.svg|thumb|U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1910 to 2012]]
In 1956, Hubbert proposed that fossil fuel production in a given region over time would follow a roughly bell-shaped curve without giving a precise formula; he later used the [[Hubbert curve]], the derivative of the [[logistic curve]],&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett A.A 1999 ,[http://www.hubbertpeak.com/bartlett/hubbert.htm "An Analysis of U.S. and World Oil Production Patterns Using Hubbert-Style Curves."] Mathematical Geology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, 1962, "Energy Resources," National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; for estimating future production using past observed discoveries.

Hubbert assumed that after fossil fuel reserves ([[oil reserves]], coal reserves, and natural gas reserves) are discovered, production at first increases approximately exponentially, as more extraction commences and more efficient facilities are installed. At some point, a peak output is reached, and production begins declining until it approximates an exponential decline.

The Hubbert curve satisfies these constraints. Furthermore, it is symmetrical, with the peak of production reached when half of the fossil fuel that will ultimately be produced has been produced. It also has a single peak.

Given past oil discovery and production data, a Hubbert curve that attempts to approximate past discovery data may be constructed and used to provide estimates for future production. In particular, the date of peak oil production or the total amount of oil ultimately produced can be estimated that way. Cavallo&lt;ref name="cavallo"&gt;Hubbert’s Petroleum Production Model: An Evaluation and Implications for World Oil Production Forecasts, Alfred J. Cavallo, Natural Resources Research, Vol. 13, No. 4, December 2004 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q363778431537157/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; defines the Hubbert curve used to predict the U.S. peak as the derivative of:

:&lt;math&gt;
Q(t) = {Q_{{\rm max}}\over {1 + ae^{-bt}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the total resource available (ultimate recovery of crude oil), &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; the cumulative production, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are constants. The year of maximum annual production (peak) is:

:&lt;math&gt;
t_{{\rm max}} = {1\over b}\ln \left({a} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

so now the cumulative production &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; reaches the half of the total available resource:

:&lt;math&gt;
Q(t) = Q_\text{max}/2
&lt;/math&gt;

===Use of multiple curves===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The sum of multiple Hubbert curves, a technique not developed by Hubbert himself, may be used in order to model more complicated real life scenarios. For example, when new technologies like hydraulic fracing combined with new formations that were not productive before the new technology, this can create a need for multiple curves. These technologies are limited in number, but make a big impact on production and cause a need for a new curve to be added to the old curve and the entire curve to be reworked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Crude oil====
[[File:Hubbert Upper-Bound Peak 1956.png|thumb|Hubbert's upper-bound prediction for US crude oil production (1956), and actual lower-48 states production through 2014]]
Hubbert, in his 1956 paper,&lt;ref name="Hubbert1956"/&gt; presented two scenarios for US crude oil production:
* most likely estimate: a logistic curve with a logistic growth rate equal to 6%, an ultimate resource equal to 150 Giga-barrels (Gb) and a peak in 1965. The size of the ultimate resource was taken from a synthesis of estimates by well-known oil geologists and the US Geological Survey, which Hubbert judged to be the most likely case.
* upper-bound estimate: a logistic curve with a logistic growth rate equal to 6% and ultimate resource equal to 200 Giga-barrels and a peak in 1970.
Hubbert's upper-bound estimate, which he regarded as optimistic, accurately predicted that US oil production would peak in 1970, although the actual peak was 17% higher than Hubbert's curve. Production declined, as Hubbert had predicted, and stayed within 10 percent of Hubbert's predicted value from 1974 through 1994; since then, actual production has been significantly greater than the Hubbert curve. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Hubbert's 1956 production curves depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources, but he was dissatisfied by the uncertainty this introduced, given the various estimates ranging from 110 billion to 590 billion barrels for the US. Starting in his 1962 publication, he made his calculations, including that of ultimate recovery, based only on mathematical analysis of production rates, proved reserves, and new discoveries, independent of any geological estimates of future discoveries. He concluded that the ultimate recoverable oil resource of the contiguous 48 states was 170 billion barrels, with a production peak in 1966 or 1967. He considered that because his model incorporated past technical advances, that any future advances would occur at the same rate, and were also incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, 1962, "Energy Resources," National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbert continued to defend his calculation of 170 billion barrels in his publications of 1965 and 1967, although by 1967 he had moved the peak forward slightly, to 1968 or 1969.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, "National Academy of Sciences Report on Energy Resources: reply," AAPG Bulletin, Oct. 1965, Vol. 49 No. 10 pp. 1720–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, "Degree of advancement of petroleum exploration in United States," AAPG Bulletin, Nov. 1967, Vol. 51 No. 11 pp. 2207–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A post-hoc analysis of peaked oil wells, fields, regions and nations found that Hubbert's model was the "most widely useful" (providing the best fit to the data), though many areas studied had a sharper "peak" than predicted.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study of oil depletion by the [[UK Energy Research Centre]] pointed out that there is no theoretical and no robust practical reason to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve. Neither is there any reason to assume that the peak will occur when half the ultimate recoverable resource has been produced; and in fact, empirical evidence appears to contradict this idea. An analysis of a 55 post-peak countries found that the average peak was at 25 percent of the ultimate recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sorrell and others, ''Global Oil Depletion'', UK Energy Research Centre, {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural gas====
[[File:Hubbert US Lower 48 Gas Prediction - 1962.png|thumb|Hubbert's 1962 prediction of US lower 48-state gas production, versus actual production through 2012]]
Hubbert also predicted that natural gas production would follow a logistic curve similar to that of oil. At right is his gas production curve for the United States, published in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, 1962, "Energy Resources," National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, pp. 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
[[File:Oil imports.PNG|thumb|300px|Oil imports by country Pre-2006]]

===Energy return on energy investment===
The ratio of energy extracted to the energy expended in the process is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or [[EROEI]]). Should the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the [[Net energy gain]] falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.

There is a difference between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is.{{cn|date = May 2017}} Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using [[natural gas]] to fuel [[enhanced oil recovery]]. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most [[Athabasca tar sands]] plants. Cheap natural gas has also led{{cn|date = May 2017}} to [[ethanol fuel]] produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

The assumption of inevitable declining volumes of oil and gas produced per unit of effort is contrary to recent experience in the US. In the United States, as of 2017, there has been an ongoing decade-long increase in the productivity of oil and gas drilling in all the major tight oil and gas plays. The US Energy Information Administration reports, for instance, that in the Bakken Shale production area of North Dakota, the volume of oil produced per day of drilling rig time in January 2017 was 4 times the oil volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and nearly 10 times the oil volume per day of ten years previous, in January 2007. In the Marcellus gas region of the northeast, The volume of gas produced per day of drilling time in January 2017 was 3 times the gas volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and 28 times the gas volume per day of drilling ten years previous, in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration,  [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/ Drilling productivity report], 15 May 2017, (see “Report data” spreadsheet).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World energy consumption 2005-2035 EIA.png|thumb|[[World energy consumption]] &amp; predictions, 2005–2035. ''Source: International Energy Outlook 2011.'']]
Insofar as [[economic growth]] is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. Hubbert believed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976/ |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Our principal constraints are cultural. During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of non growth. | M. King Hubbert | Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History}}

Some economists describe the problem as [[uneconomic growth]] or a [[false economy]]. At the political right, [[Fred Ikle]] has warned about "conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page68.htm |title=Our Perpetual Growth Utopia |publisher=Dieoff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed—but did not stop—the growth of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%.

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million.

==Hubbert peaks==
Although Hubbert peak theory receives most attention in relation to [[peak oil|peak oil production]], it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===
{{Main|Peak gas}}
Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=White |url=http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |date=December 17, 2005 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153321/http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentley predicted a world "decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint - Global oil &amp; gas depletion: an overview

===Coal===
{{Main|Peak coal}}
Although observers believe that peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, Hubbert studied the specific example of [[Anthracite coal|anthracite]] in the US, a high grade coal,  whose production peaked in the 1920s. Hubbert found that anthracite matches a curve closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031184216/http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html|date=October 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbert had recoverable [[Coal#World coal reserves|coal reserves worldwide]] at 2.500 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons and peaking around 2150 (depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. ''Coal: Resources and Future Production'' (PDF 630KB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |title=Startseite |publisher=Energy Watch Group |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911224731/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name="energybulletin.net"&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Ari |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on this, Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal is likely to come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=Museletter |publisher=Richard Heinberg |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second study,
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that
""coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name="energybulletin.net"/&gt;

Work by [[David Rutledge (engineer)|David Rutledge]] of [[Caltech]] predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 [[gigatonne]]s.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff", by David Strahan, [[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726391.800-coal-bleak-outlook-for-the-black-stuff.html January 19, 2008, pp. 38–41].&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

===Fissionable materials===
{{Main|Peak uranium}}
In a paper in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Nuclear Energy And The Fossil Fuels |format=PDF |author=M.

{{cquote|There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the "foreseeable future."}}

As of 2015, the identified resources of uranium are sufficient to provide more than 135 years of supply at the present rate of consumption.&lt;ref name="Red Book"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]], [[IAEA]] |year=2016 |title=Uranium 2016 – Resources, Production and Demand |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2016/7301-uranium-2016.pdf |isbn=978-92-64-26844-9 |publisher=[[OECD|OECD Publishing]] |doi=10.1787/uranium-2016-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies such as the [[thorium fuel cycle]], [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] and [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeders]] can, in theory, extend the life of [[uranium]] reserves from hundreds to thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt;

Caltech physics professor [[David Goodstein]] stated in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tony|title=Professor Goodstein discusses lowering oil reserves|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=23 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

{{cquote|...&amp;nbsp;you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.}}

===Helium===
[[File:US Helium Production and Storage 1940-2014.png|thumb|Helium production and storage in the United States, 1940–2014 (data from USGS)]]
Almost all [[helium]] on Earth is a result of [[radioactive decay]] of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. Helium is extracted by [[fractional distillation]] from natural gas, which contains up to 7% helium. The world's largest helium-rich natural gas fields are found in the United States, especially in the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton]] and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The extracted [[Helium storage and conservation|helium is stored]] underground in the [[National Helium Reserve]] near [[Amarillo]], [[Texas]], the self-proclaimed "Helium Capital of the World". Helium production is expected to decline along with natural gas production in these areas.

Helium, which is the second-lightest chemical element, will rise to the upper layers of Earth's [[atmosphere]], where it can forever break free from Earth's gravitational attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Precious metals===
{{Main|Peak gold}}
In 2009, Aaron Regent president of the Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold said that global output has been falling by roughly one million ounces a year since the start of the decade.  The total global mine supply has dropped by 10pc as ore quality erodes, implying that the roaring bull market of the last eight years may have further to run. "There is a strong case to be made that we are already at 'peak gold'," he told The Daily Telegraph at the RBC's annual gold conference in London. "Production peaked around 2000 and it has been in decline ever since, and we forecast that decline to continue. It is increasingly difficult to find ore," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/6546579/Barrick-shuts-hedge-book-as-world-gold-supply-runs-out.html |title=Barrick shuts hedge book as world gold supply runs out |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ore grades have fallen from around 12&amp;nbsp;grams per tonne in 1950 to nearer 3&amp;nbsp;grams in the US, Canada, and Australia. South Africa's output has halved since peaking in 1970. Output fell a further 14 percent in South Africa in 2008 as companies were forced to dig ever deeper – at greater cost   – to replace depleted reserves.

World mined gold production has peaked four times since 1900: in 1912, 1940, 1971, and 2001, each peak being higher than previous peaks. The latest peak was in 2001, when production reached 2,600 metric tons, then declined for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Chaise, [http://news.goldseek.com/Dani/1273767071.php World gold production 2010], 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Production started to increase again in 2009, spurred by high gold prices, and achieved record new highs each year in 2012, 2013, and in 2014, when production reached 2,990 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;US Geological Survey,  [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gold/mcs-2016-gold.pdf Gold], Mineral commodity summaries, Jan. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphorus===
{{Main|Peak phosphorus}}
[[Phosphorus]] supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apda.pt/apda_resources/APDA.Biblioteca/eureau%5Cposition%20papers%5Cthe%20reuse%20of%20phosphorus.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006120520/http://www.apda.pt/apda_resources/APDA.Biblioteca/eureau%5Cposition%20papers%5Cthe%20reuse%20of%20phosphorus.pdf|date=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 study, the total reserves of phosphorus are estimated to be approximately 3,200 MT, with a peak production at 28 MT/year in 2034.&lt;ref&gt;

===Peak water===
{{Main|Peak water}}
Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources. However, [[over-exploitation]] often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/water_resource.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive. The term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.

Leonardo Maugeri, vice president of the Italian energy company [[Eni]], argues that nearly all of peak estimates do not take into account [[unconventional oil]] even though the availability of these resources is significant and the costs of extraction and processing, while still very high, are falling because of improved technology. He also notes that the recovery rate from existing world oil fields has increased from about 22% in 1980 to 35% today because of new technology and predicts this trend will continue. The ratio between proven oil reserves and current production has constantly improved, passing from 20 years in 1948 to 35 years in 1972 and reaching about 40 years in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maugeri |first=L. |year=2004 |url=http://www.condition.org/sm4602.htm |title=Oil: Never Cry Wolf&amp;mdash;Why the Petroleum Age Is Far from over |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pages=1114–15 |doi=10.1126/science.1096427 |volume=304 |pmid=15155935 |issue=5674}}&lt;/ref&gt; These improvements occurred even with low investment in new [[exploration]] and upgrading [[technology]] because of the low oil prices during the last 20 years.

[[Edward Luttwak]], an economist and historian, claims that unrest in countries such as Russia, Iran and Iraq has led to a massive underestimate of oil reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=18 |title=The truth about global oil supply |publisher=Thefirstpost.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221620/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=18 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) responds by claiming neither Russia nor Iran are troubled by unrest currently, but Iraq is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakoil.net/Luttwak.html |title=ASPO – The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas |publisher=Peakoil.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]] authored a report that is critical of Hubbert-influenced predictions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cera.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0236-821_ITM]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206034220/http://cera.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0236-821_ITM|date=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Despite his valuable contribution, M. King Hubbert's methodology falls down because it does not consider likely resource growth, application of new technology, basic commercial factors, or the impact of geopolitics on production. His approach does not work in all cases-including on the United States itself-and cannot reliably model a global production outlook. Put more simply, the case for the imminent peak is flawed. As it is, production in 2005 in the Lower 48 in the United States was 66 percent higher than Hubbert projected.}}

[[Cambridge Energy Research Associates|CERA]] does not believe there will be an endless abundance of oil, but instead believes that global production will eventually follow an "undulating plateau" for one or more decades before declining slowly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=Katie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/22381.html |title=CERA says peak oil theory is faulty |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2013-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128183759/http://energybulletin.net/22381.html |archive-date=2006-11-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/22381.html |title=CERA says peak oil theory is faulty |publisher=[[Energy Bulletin]] |date=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; and that production will reach 40 Mb/d by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valentine |first=Katie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/19120 |title=CERA's report is over-optimistic |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2006-08-10 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred J. Cavallo, while predicting a conventional oil supply shortage by no later than 2015, does not think Hubbert's peak is the correct theory to apply to world production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valentine |first=Katie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/6271.html |title=Oil: Caveat empty |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2005-05-24 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of peak element scenarios==
Although M. King Hubbert himself made major distinctions between decline in petroleum production versus depletion (or relative lack of it) for elements such as fissionable uranium and thorium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whipple |first=Tom |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/13630 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811001036/http://www.energybulletin.net/node/13630 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-11 |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2006-03-08 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some others have predicted peaks like [[peak uranium]] and [[peak phosphorus]] soon on the basis of published reserve figures compared to present and future production.  According to some economists, though, the amount of proved reserves inventoried at a time may be considered "a poor indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource."&lt;ref name = reserve_economics&gt;James D. Gwartney, Richard L. Stroup, Russell S. Sobel, David MacPherson. ''Economics: Private and Public Choice, 12th Edition''. South-Western Cengage Learning, p. 730. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIbH4R77OtMC&amp;pg=PA730|Online extract, accessed 5-20-2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

As some illustrations, tin, copper, iron, lead, and zinc all had both production from 1950 to 2000 and reserves in 2000 much exceed world reserves in 1950, which would be impossible except for how "proved reserves are like an inventory of cars to an auto dealer" at a time, having little relationship to the actual total affordable to extract in the future.&lt;ref name = reserve_economics/&gt;  In the example of [[peak phosphorus]], additional concentrations exist intermediate between 71,000&amp;nbsp;Mt of identified reserves (USGS)&lt;ref name = USGS2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/phosphate_rock/mcs-2012-phosp.pdf |title=Phosphate Rock |format=PDF |author=Stephen M.

'''Hungarian irredentism''' or '''Greater Hungary''' is a broad umbrella term consisting of [[Irredentism|irredentist]] and revisionist political ideas. The idea is associated with Hungarian revisionism. Its goal is to restore the pre-World War I borders of the Kingdom of Hungary, or at least to regain control over Hungarian-populated areas in Hungary's neighbouring countries.

The [[Treaty of Trianon]] defined the borders of the new independent Hungary and, compared against the claims of the pre-war Kingdom, new Hungary had approximately 72% less land stake and about two-thirds fewer inhabitants, almost 5 million of these being of Hungarian ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Fenyvesi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hungarian language contact outside Hungary: studies on Hungarian as a minority language |first=Anna |last=Fenyvesi |year=2005 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=90-272-1858-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3JYwHGYn7MC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=hungarians+3+million&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lt5rTZGXMMHOhAfylqWSAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hungarians%203%20million&amp;f=false |page=2 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

This political aim gained greater attention and was a serious national concern up through the second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hungaria.org/hal/hungary/index.php?halid=14&amp;menuid=248#318 |title=HUNGARY |accessdate=2011-02-13 |publisher=Hungarian Online Resources (Magyar Online Forrás)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary, supported by the [[Axis Powers]], was successful temporarily in gaining some (primarily ethnic Hungarian) regions of the former Kingdom in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s of 1938 and 1940, and through military campaign gained regions of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in 1939 and (ethnically mixed) [[Bačka]], [[Baranja region|Baranja]],  [[Međimurje]], and [[Prekmurje]] in 1941 ([[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories]]). Following the close of World War II, the borders of Hungary as defined by the Treaty of Trianon were restored, except for three Hungarian villages that were transferred to Czechoslovakia. These villages are today administratively a part of [[Bratislava]].

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Europe mediterranean 1190 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Kingdom of Hungary (shown in brown) around 1190 AD.]]
[[File:Partition of Hungary.png|thumb|Partition of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1541]]

The independent [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was established in 1000 AD, and remained a regional power in Central Europe until [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered its central part in 1526 following the [[Battle of Mohács]]. In 1541 the territory of the former Kingdom of Hungary was divided into three portions: in the west and north, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]] retained its existence under [[Habsburg]] rule; the Ottomans controlled the south-central parts of former Kingdom of Hungary; while in the east, the [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]] (later the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]]) was formed as a semi-independent entity under Ottoman [[suzerainty]]. After the Ottoman conquest in the Kingdom of Hungary, the ethnic structure of the kingdom started to become more multi-ethnic because of immigration to the sparsely populated areas. Between 1683 and 1717, the Habsburg Monarchy conquered all the Ottoman territories that were part of the Kingdom of Hungary before 1526, and incorporated some of these areas into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.

After a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|suppressed uprising in 1848-1849]], the Kingdom of Hungary and its [[diet (assembly)|diet]] were dissolved, and territory of the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into 5 districts, which were [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] &amp; [[Buda|Ofen]], [[Sopron|Ödenburg]], [[Bratislava|Preßburg]], [[Košice|Kaschau]] and [[Oradea|Großwardein]], directly controlled from [[Vienna]] while Croatia, Slavonia, and the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] were separated from the Kingdom of Hungary between 1849-1860. This new centralized rule, however, failed to provide stability, and in the wake of [[Austro-Prussian War|military defeats]] the [[Austrian Empire]] was transformed into [[Austria-Hungary]] with the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], by which Kingdom of Hungary became one of two constituent entities of the new [[dual monarchy]] with self-rule in its internal affairs.

A considerable number of the figures who are today considered important in Hungarian culture were born in what are today parts of [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Austria]] (''see [[List of Hungarians who were born outside present-day Hungary]]''). Names of Hungarian dishes, common surnames, proverbs, sayings, folk songs etc. also refer to these rich cultural ties. After 1867, the non-Hungarian ethnic groups were subject to assimilation and [[Magyarization]].
[[File:Kingdom of Hungary counties.svg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] before 1918]]
Among the most notable policies was the promotion of the [[Hungarian language]] as the country's official language (replacing [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]]); however, this was often at the expense of [[West Slavic languages]] and the [[Romanian language]]. The new government of autonomous Kingdom of Hungary took the stance that Kingdom of Hungary should be a Hungarian [[nation state]], and that all other peoples living in the Kingdom of Hungary&amp;mdash;[[ethnic German|Germans]], [[Jew]]s, [[Romanian people|Romanians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Poles]], [[Rusyns|Ruthenes]] and other ethnicities&amp;mdash;should be assimilated. (The [[Croats]] were to some extent an exception to this, as they had a fair degree of self-government within Croatia-Slavonia, a dependent kingdom within the Kingdom of Hungary.)

===World War I===
{{Main article|Treaty of Trianon}}
[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|The ceded territories on the Treaty of Trianon and their population (red is for Hungarian)]]
The peace treaties signed after the First World War redefined the national borders of Europe. The dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], after its defeat in the First World War, gave an opportunity for the subject nationalities of the old Monarchy to all form their own nation states (however, most of the resulting states nevertheless became multi-ethnic states comprising several nationalities). The [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920 defined borders for the new Hungarian state: in the north, the Slovak and Ruthene areas, including Hungarian majority areas became part of the new state of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Transylvania and most of the [[Banat]] became part of [[Romania]], while Croatia-Slavonia and the other southern areas became part of the new state of [[Yugoslavia]].

The arguments of Hungarian revisionists for their goal were: the presence of [[Hungarian diaspora|Hungarian majority]] areas in the neighboring countries, perceived historical traditions of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], or the perceived geographical unity and economic symbiosis of the region within the [[Carpathian Basin]], although some Hungarian revisionists preferred to regain only ethnically Hungarian majority areas surrounding Hungary.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Post-Trianon Hungary had about half of the population of the former Kingdom. The population of the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary that were not assigned to the post-Trianon Hungary had, in total, non-Hungarian majority, although they included a sizable proportion of ethnic Hungarians and Hungarian majority areas. According to Karoly Kocsis and Eszter Kocsis-Hodosi the ethnic composition in 1910

Trianon thus defined Hungary's new borders in a way that made ethnic Hungarians the overwhelmingly absolute majority in the country. Almost 3 million ethnic [[Hungarians]] remained outside the borders of post-Trianon Hungary.&lt;ref name="Fenyvesi"/&gt; A considerable number of non-Hungarian nationalities remained within the new borders of Hungary, the largest of which were [[Germans]] ([[Danube Swabians|Schwabs]]) with 550,062 people (6.9%).

====Aftermath====
After the [[Treaty of Trianon]], a political concept known as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|Hungarian revisionism]] became popular in Hungary. The Treaty of Trianon was an injury for the Hungarian people, and Hungarian revisionists have created a nationalistic ideology with the political goal of the restoration of borders of historical pre-Trianon Kingdom of Hungary.

The justification for this aim usually followed the fact that two-thirds of the country's area was taken by the neighboring countries with approximately 3 million&lt;ref name="Fenyvesi" /&gt; Hungarians living in these territories. Several municipalities that had purely ethnic Hungarian population were excluded from post-Trianon Hungary, which had borders designed to cut most economic regions (Szeged, Pécs, Debrecen etc.) half, and keep railways on the other side.

===Near realization===
[[File:Hungary map 1941.png|thumb|Hungary in 1920 and 1941]]

Hungary's government allied itself with [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II in exchange for assurances that Greater Hungary's borders would be restored. This goal was partially achieved when Hungary reannexed territories from Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia at the outset of the war. These annexations were affirmed under the [[Munich Agreement]] (1938), two Vienna Awards ([[First Vienna Award|1938]] and [[Second Vienna Award|1940]]), and aggression against Yugoslavia (1941), the latter achieved one week after the German army had already invaded Yugoslavia.

The percentage of Hungarian speakers was 84% in southern Czechoslovakia and 15% in the [[Sub-Carpathian Rus]].

The population of [[Northern Transylvania]], according to the Hungarian census from 1941 counted 53.5% [[Hungarians]] and 39.1% [[Romanians]].&lt;ref name="Hodosi, Kocsis"&gt;Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 116-153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Northern+transylvania++hungarians+romanians+number&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FQkfTdjRKdKZhQeQ4Zi3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yugoslav territory occupied by Hungary (including Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje and Prekmurje) had approximately one million inhabitants, including 543,000 Yugoslavs (Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), 301,000 Hungarians, 197,000 Germans, 40,000 Slovaks, 15,000 Rusyns, and 15,000 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rokai - Zoltan Đere - Tibor Pal - Aleksandar Kasaš, Istorija Mađara, Beograd, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bačka region only, the 1931 census put the percentage of the speakers of Hungarian at 34.2%, while one of interpretations of later Hungarian census from 1941 states that, 45,4% or 47,2% declared themselves to be Hungarian native speakers or ethnic Hungarians &lt;ref name="Hodosi, Kocsis" /&gt; (this interpretation is provided by authors Károly Kocsis and Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi. The 1941 census, however, did not recorded ethnicity of the people, but only mother/native tongue [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Northern+transylvania++hungarians+romanians+number&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FQkfTdjRKdKZhQeQ4Zi3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v=snippet&amp;q=1941%3A%20Hungarian%20census%20data%20%28mother%2Fnative%20tongue%29&amp;f=false]). Population of entire Bačka numbered 789,705 inhabitants in 1941. This means that from the beginning of the occupation, the number of Hungarian speakers in Bačka increased by 48,550, while the number of Serbian speakers decreased by 75,166.&lt;ref name="Zvonimir"&gt;Zvonimir Golubović, ''Racija u Južnoj Bačkoj, 1942. godine'', Novi Sad, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of Hungarian rule met with insurgency on part of the non-Hungarian population in some places and retaliation of the Hungarian forces was labelled war crimes such as [[Ip, Sălaj|Ip]] and other localities in Northern Transylvania (directed against Romanians) or [[Bačka]], where Hungarian military between 1941 and 1944 deported or killed 19,573 civilians,&lt;ref&gt;Slobodan Ćurčić, Broj stanovnika Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly [[Serbs]] and Jews, but also Hungarians who did not collaborate with the new authorities. About 56,000 people were also expelled from Bačka.&lt;ref name="Zvonimir"/&gt;

The Jewish population of Hungary and the areas it occupied were partly diminished as part of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of Romanians fled from Hungarian-ruled Northern Transylvania, and vice versa. After the war the areas were returned to neighboring countries and Hungary's territory was slightly further reduced by ceding three villages south of Bratislava to Slovakia. The reoccupying states exercised genocide on Hungarian civilians, both in Yugoslavia by Yugoslav partisans (the exact number of ethnic Hungarians killed by Yugoslav partisans is not clearly established and estimates range from 4,000 to 40,000; 20,000 is often regarded as most probable&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrije Boarov, Politička istorija Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;), and in Transylvania by the [[Maniu Guard]] towards the end of World War II.

During the Communist era, Marxist–Leninist ideology and Stalin's theory on nationalities considered nationalism to be a malady of a bourgeois capitalism. In Hungary, the minorities' question disappeared from the political agenda. Communist hegemony guaranteed a facade of inter-ethnic peace while failing to secure a lasting accommodation of minority interests in unitary states.

The fall of Communism aroused the expectations of Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries and left Hungary unprepared to deal with the issue. Hungarian politicians campaigned to formalize the rights of Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries, thus causing anxiety in the region. They secured agreements on the necessity for guaranteeing collective rights and formed new Hungarian minority organizations to promote cultural rights and political participation. In Romania, Slovakia, and Yugoslavia (now Serbia), former Communists secured popular legitimacy by accommodating nationalist tendencies that were hostile to minority rights.

The latest controversy caused by the government of [[Viktor Orbán]] is when Hungary took the presidency over the [[European Union|EU]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eu2011.hu/ |title=(Home page) |accessdate=2011-02-13 |publisher=Hungarian Presidency of The Council Of The European Union |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202084151/http://www.eu2011.hu/ |archivedate=2011-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the "historical timeline" features was presented - among other cultural, historical and scientific symbols or images of Hungary - an 1848 map of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Greater Hungary]], when Budapest ruled over large swathes of its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hungary in EU presidency 'history' carpet row |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12194899 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungary in EU presidency 'history' carpet row |url=http://www.bucharestherald.ro/worldnews/43-worldnews/18952-hungary-in-eu-presidency-history-carpet-row |work= |publisher=Bucharest Herald |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117173628/http://www.bucharestherald.ro/worldnews/43-worldnews/18952-hungary-in-eu-presidency-history-carpet-row |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===

===Slovakia===
{{main article|Hungarians in Slovakia}}
Under great pressure from the EU and NATO, Hungary signed a bilateral state treaty with Slovakia on [[Good Neighborly Relations and Friendly Cooperation]] in March 1995, aimed at resolving disputes concerning borders and minority rights. Its vague language, though, allows rival interpretations. One cause of conflict was the COE's Recommendation 1201 which stipulates the creation of autonomous self-government based on ethnic principles in areas where ethnic minorities represent a majority of the population.

The Hungarian Prime Minister insisted that the treaty protected the Hungarian minority as a "community". Slovakia accepted the 1201 Recommendation in the treaty, but denounced the concept of collective rights of minorities and political autonomy as "unacceptable and destabilizing". Slovakia finally ratified the treaty in March 1996 after the government attached a unilateral declaration that the accord would not provide for collective autonomy for Hungarians. The Hungarian government therefore refused to recognize the validity of the declaration.

===Romania===
{{see also|Székely autonomy initiatives}}
[[File:Szekely Land issues.svg|thumb|Szekely Land as envisaged by the autonomy supporters]]
After World War II, a [[Hungarian Autonomous Region]] was created in Transylvania, which encompassed most of the land inhabited by the [[Székelys]]. This region lasted until 1964 when the administrative reform divided Romania into the current counties. From 1947 until the 1989 [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]] and the death of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], a systematic [[Romanianization]] of Hungarians took place, with several discriminatory provisions, denying them their cultural identity. This tendency started to abate after 1989, the question of [[Székely autonomy initiatives|Székely autonomy]] remains a sensitive issue.

On 16 September 1996, after five years of negotiations, Hungary and Romania also signed a bilateral treaty, which had been stalled over the nature and extent of minority protection that Bucharest should grant to Hungarian citizens. Hungary dropped its demands for autonomy for ethnic minorities; in exchange, Romania accepted a reference to Recommendation 1201 in the treaty, but with a joint interpretive declaration that guarantees individual rights, but excludes collective rights and territorial autonomy based on ethnic criteria. These concessions were made in large measure because both countries recognized the need to improve good neighborly relations as a prerequisite for NATO membership.

===Vojvodina, Serbia===
{{see also|Hungarian Regional Autonomy}}
[[File:Hungarian Regional Autonomy02 map.png|thumb|Map of the proposed Hungarian Regional Autonomy as of the early-21st century.]]

*[[Hungarian Civic Alliance (Serbia)|Civic Alliance of Hungarians]], led by [[László Rác Szabó]]
*[[Movement of Hungarian Hope]], led by [[Bálint László]]

These parties are advocating the establishment of the territorial autonomy for Hungarians in the northern part of Vojvodina, which would include the municipalities with Hungarian majority (See [[Hungarian Regional Autonomy]] for details).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11953">[[File:Central American Report.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Central American Report]]
Established at [[Duke University]] ([[North Carolina]], [[United States]]) in 1987, the '''International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development''' (ICCARD) was a task force composed of thirty-three scholars and leaders (Ford Foundation 1988: 155).  The commission published its report, ''Poverty, Conflict, and Hope:  A Turning Point in Central America,'' in 1989 with principles for promoting peace, genuine democracy and [[Equity (economics)|equitable]] [[International development|development]] in [[Central America]].  Also known as the Sanford Commission Report (after [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Terry Sanford]], "the principal catalyst of the commission's work") the plan called for immediate action, regional and international cooperation based on learning from history (Zuvekas 2001: 128).  With numerous proposals for Central America over the years, the commission built upon past experiences.

The commission's recommendations represented the deliberations of an international body for regional democracy and development. With brief historical insights, from lessons learned the report's plan of action for a turning point in Central America is an easy to read guide for sustainable development and [[democracy]].  The report itself, released "on the eve of the fourth meeting of the Central American Presidents", (Envio 1989) is also a valuable reference for analysis of the region and developments since the time of the commission.

==Brief on the history==
The report noted that the economic expansion following the [[Second World War]] is critical to understanding the historical roots of the crisis that Central America faced during the 1970s and 1980s, after the region's economy nearly collapsed from the inability to adjust to international structural changes. While the region averaged unprecedented growth from 1950 to 1978, the strengths of the economy in Central America did not outweigh the faults of exclusionary politics, flawed economic structures, decline of intra-regional trade, and external economic setbacks that consequently led to social unrest, violence and civil war.  While Zuvekas (2001: 128-120) maintains that the report "does not sufficiently recognize the (admittedly limited) progress" made throughout the 1980s, the commentator on the commission does believe the "ICCARD is fundamentally sound."  From the historical detail on the civil strife that uprooted and caused suffering in the region for over ten years, the international commission then provided an immediate plan for action in order to attend to the social impact of the crisis.

==The plan==

The immediate plan to aid those in poverty is followed by a strategy for [[sustainable development]], including the revival of productivity and production, assuring the creation of employment, the development of [[human resources]], [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary]] reform as well as strategy to conserve natural resources.  In sequencing the plan, fiscal reform is noted as a fundamental step to finance the recovery of human resource development from positive, real returns of hard-earned profit.  With recognition of the difficulties in sustaining democratic [[governance]] in the region, the report then discusses building democracy as inseparable from development.  The plan for building democracy consists of broadening participation in [[civil society]], advocating respect for [[human rights]] with [[Toleration|tolerance]] to instill values of democracy and peace.  
[[File:CIA map of Central America.png|left|thumb|240px|Map of Central America]]
The international commission report stresses that the fragile institutions representing the interests of those excluded from political processes, the minimal financial resources for mobilizing to provide for the poorest in society, and the [[perceptions]] of those who hold [[Power (sociology)|power]] are obstacles to [[Progressivism|progressive]] reform.  At this point, the report as it was presented addressed the developmental needs of the region rather than on a country-by-country basis, allowing for the "development of more comprehensive policies" (Envivo 1989).  The plan to promote democracy thus involves strategy for civilian rule and civil-military relations where:  "security is not achieved by repression and military dominance of government.  Continued withdrawal of the military from the political scene, their training in democratic political values, the rejection of [[authoritarian]] doctrines of [[national security]], and the development of effective mechanisms of civilian political control," is critical Central American societies (ICCARD 1989: 61).  The commission's plan advises from the need for economic and [[social justice]] with a strong role in developing democracy through [[nongovernmental organizations]] and the support of the media.

For sustainable democracy, the report maintains regional institutions and cooperation are essential, noting The [[Central American Parliament]], The [[Central American Economic and Social Council]], as well as The [[Central American Court of Justice]] are vital to facilitating [[regional integration]].  The vision of regional economic planning accordingly "rests on an assumption that political dialogue is the means to resolve both internal and regional conflicts" (Envio 1989). Historical factions related to integration are detailed, including the central challenges to rebuilding the [[Free Trade Zone]] under the "conditionality" of [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] [[structural adjustment programs]].  The commission suggests that while there are favorable conditions for regional investment and cooperation, the intra-regional debt also remains a major obstacle.

If integration is to be sustainable and successful, regional institutions must be strengthened, particularly the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Secretariat of the Central American Monetary Council]].  The strengthening of these institutions is essential to achieving economic cooperation &amp;ndash; or "acting together internationally" in the words of the report &amp;ndash; which requires an institutional coherence that the commission suggests the [[European Community]] is, "with it long experience in developing regional structures, in an excellent position to provide expertise" (ICCARD 1989: 76).  To maintain [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]], the report addresses the conditions for any support to promote trade, advance technology in the region and open markets for Central American exports to revive the intra-regional economy.  Markets must provide for the modernization of regional technology and financial flows need be devoted to domestic reforms, debt reduction and restructuring.  Finally, the report advises for a coordinated diversification of foreign assistance based on performance conditions.

==Conclusion==

Anticipating a future turning point toward sustainable development and authentic democratic institutions in Central America, the commission concludes with statement that the recommendations documented are drawn from principles of democratic development by understanding problems of the past in light of the recent history of the region.  Commentators such as Zuvekas (2001: 125) maintains some of the report (actually, assembled from essays by key Central American scholars) is disappointing, and Envivo (1989) notes issues such as land reform remained untouched.  Nonetheless, the report is a reasonable analysis of the difficulties facing the region with authoritative perspectives for the direction domestic governments, international organizations and the overall Central American [[political economy]] need undertake to ensure recovery in the region.  The Report of the International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development is a valuable guide for [[case study]] and application of [[theory]] based upon history with hope for the future of the region.

==Developments since==

* '''Esquipulas II:'''  [[Internet]] searches, even further scholarly research reveal little.  Nonetheless, Envio (1989) reports that following the presentation of the report on the eve of the fourth meeting of Central American presidents, the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) responded positively with satisfaction for the peace process undertaken.  The summit resulted in the [[Esquipulas II]] framework for regional development, peace and cooperation.  The report claims that the "Stanford Commission Report, the presidential summit and the EEC meeting have opened a new space in Central American politics" (Envio 1989).  While the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement]] isolates the United States, the EEC continued with its support in Central America by increasing [[foreign aid]] with the dismantling and resettling of [[Honduras]]' contra troops in February 1989, showing progress for regional diplomacy.

'''Jim Wells''' (born 27 April 1957) is a [[Northern Ireland]] politician from the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and formerly [[Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLA Details|url=http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/mlas/details.aspx?&amp;aff=13292&amp;per=105&amp;sel=1&amp;ind=18&amp;prv=0|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells is one of five Assembly members for [[South Down (Assembly constituency)|South Down]]. He was a councillor on [[Down District Council]] from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydup.com/who-we-are/jim-wells|title=Who We Are:Jim Wells|publisher=myDUP.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Wells was employed as a manager by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] from 1989 until 1998. In 2017, he resigned his membership of the National Trust over the Trusts support for LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/jim-wells-cuts-ties-with-national-trust-over-gay-pride-issues-36004835.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Wells was elected to serve as a Councillor in Down District Council in 2001, having previously held a seat on Lisburn Borough Council and Banbridge Borough Council. He served on the Council until stepping down at the 2011 election.
He was Assembly Member for the South Down constituency initially from 1982 to 1986.  He was re-elected in 1998 and is currently in his fifth term having been re-elected in 2017.
During that time he served as Deputy Chair of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety before he was appointed as Minister of Health in September 2014 where he served until his removal in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mydup.com/who-we-are/jim-wells&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young Earth Creationism==
Wells is a [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/trust-set-to-review-creationist-exhibit-1-4070762|title=Trust set to review creationist exhibit|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=27 April 2015|publisher=The News Letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and along with his DUP colleagues, Nelson Mccausland and Gregory Campbell, he lobbied for the creationism dogma to be included in the Giants causeway exhibition. Initially the National Trust acceded to the request but after coming under pressure from the public withdrew the exhibition in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;2012.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19814284&lt;/ref&gt; Wells is not alone in his creationist views,. in 2013 some 40% of DUP activists believe that creationism should be taught in science classes, a Belfast Telegraph survey found.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/party-conference-teach-creationism-in-science-class-40-of-dup-29781222.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationism Education==
Wells and his colleagues have been accused of being science deniers. In 2014, DUP ministers tried to oppose proposals to introduce local measures against climate change in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2134162-five-things-you-need-to-know-about-dup-politicians-and-science/&lt;/ref&gt;

At an event aimed at promoting the rejection of evolution among children and was endorsed by the MLA who wants to see creationism “taught in every school”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/09/21/news/mla-backs-conference-promoting-the-teaching-of-creationism-in-schools-702781/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Wells had been tipped to become Northern Ireland's Health Minister during a mid term reshuffle of DUP Ministers. However, this failed to be realised as many within his party thought him too gaffe prone to hold the position.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32614604&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to court controversy over his views on abortion, gay rights and Pride marches. Wells stated in 2012 that [[abortion in Northern Ireland]] should remain illegal except in medical emergencies, without exception for pregnancies resulting from rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutherford|first=Adrian|title=DUP's Jim Wells: Abortion should be ruled out for rape victims|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/dups-jim-wells-abortion-should-be-ruled-out-for-rape-victims-16202088.html|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many political commentators and critics had claimed that the gaffe prone MLA would not be offered the role in the near future because of the importance of implementing health reform known as "Transforming your Care". It was widely believed that the then Health Minister Edwin Poots was seen by his party as a safer pair of hands to handle the review. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the DUP leader [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] dismissed [[Edwin Poots]] and appointed Wells to the Health role in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/24/jim-wells-abortion-northern-ireland_n_5872632.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2015, Wells said he continues to support a ban on gay men donating blood. Such bans were lifted in the rest of the UK in 2011; Wells's department had spent £39,000 as of January 2015 fighting a legal appeal of the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/jim-wells-i-back-edwin-poots-gay-blood-ban-30924523.html|title=Jim Wells: I back Edwin Poots' gay blood ban|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|last=O'Hara|first=Victoria|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he also said "The gay lobby is insatiable, they don’t know when enough is enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From abortion to evolution: the terrifying views of the DUP you need to know|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dup-hung-parliament-results-policies-manifesto-abortion-gay-marriage-climate-change-who-are-they-a7781656.html|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=The Independent|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2018, Wells compared abortion rights to the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]] on BBC Radio Ulster's [[The Nolan Show|Nolan Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DUP MLA Jim Wells compares abortion to Nazi Holocaust |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-44388279 |website=BBC News |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the calls for Westminster to change Northern Ireland's abortion laws as a "ghastly situation". He would later go on to clarify that he only meant to make the comparison to the Holocaust in relation to the "numbers" involved. Arlene Foster responded to Wells comments by saying "I think it's the wrong use of language" when discussing a "very emotive issue".

== Resignation as Health Minister==
During a hustings event on 23 April 2015, Wells was quoted as saying, "You don't bring a child up in a homosexual relationship. That the child is far more likely to be abused and neglected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-northern-ireland-32453345|title=Health Minister Jim Wells' gay abuse remarks: Children's body rejects comments|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=24 April 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an transcript released later, it showed that Wells had stated "All evidence throughout the world says the best way to raise children is in a loving, stable, married relationship; the facts show that, the facts show that certainly you don't bring a child up in a homosexual relationship. That a child is far more likely to be abused or neglected (uproar among audience). I say again, I say again, a child is far more likely to be abused or neglected in a non-stable marriage situation, gay or straight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sluggerotoole.com/2015/10/20/how-we-got-jim-wells-wrong-twitter-rage-and-the-redaction-of-empathy|title=How we got Jim Wells wrong, Twitter rage and the redaction of empathy…|accessdate=27 October 2015|date=20 October 2015|publisher=[[Slugger O'Toole]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells retracted the statement after a backlash from political leaders and the media. He claimed he was under pressure as a result of his wife's serious illness and that his view was not DUP policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wells added: "I regret having wrongly made that remark about abuse and I'm sorry those words were uttered. The comment did not reflect my view nor that of my party."&lt;/ref&gt; The views attracted strong criticism from other parties and calls for his resignation. On 24 April 2015, the Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed that they had received a complaint and officers were making enquiries.&lt;ref name="investigation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32443730|title=Health Minister Jim Wells: Police investigate gay abuse remarks|date=25 April 2015|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Prosecution Service later confirmed that Wells would not be charged. By mid October 2015 the Public Prosecution Service said it was decided that the case did not meet the test for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-34556389|title=Jim Wells not to be prosecuted over gay marriage remarks |accessdate=27 October 2015|date=16 October 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/pages/?title=%91No_matter_what_I_do%2C_I%92m_determined_to_clear_my_name%92 |title="No matter what I do, I'm determined to clear my name" |accessdate=27 October 2015 |date=14 October 2015 |publisher=[[Down Recorder]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323054815/http://www.blayney.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/329/3h%20-%20Hobbys%20Yards%20Heritage%20Items.pdf.aspx |archivedate=23 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2015, it was alleged that Wells, who was doing door-to-door canvassing, called at a lesbian couple's house and during a conversation was critical of their lifestyle. The PSNI said they had received three complaints regarding the conduct of an individual in [[Rathfriland]] near [[Newry]] on Saturday evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-northern-ireland-32484670|publisher=BBC|title=Jim Wells: Woman recalls Jim Wells canvassing incident in Rathfriland|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abuse-comments"/&gt;

On Monday 27 April 2015, Wells announced his resignation as Health Minister, citing his wife's ill health. However, even DUP sympathetic press believed the real reason was down to his anti gay views.&lt;ref name="abuse-comments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/dup-minister-jim-wells-quits-as-gay-abuse-comments-cause-huge-online-backlash-31173893.html|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|title=DUP minister Jim Wells quits as gay abuse comments cause huge online backlash|first1=Steven|last1=Alexander|first2=Nevin|last2=Farrell|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/minister-wells-quits-over-gays-slur-31173977.html|title=Jim Wells quits after gay comments|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=27 April 2015|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of Wells short tenure as Health minister little had changed and no major health reforms had been progressed. By July 2015, Wells was still stinging from his forced removal from health and stated that "I should still be a Minister".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/pages/index.asp?title=WELLS:_I_should_still_be_a_Minister&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells remains an MLA but has lost any significant powerbase within the DUP and now promotes his crusade to expose the truth about his resignation, stating on Belfast Live: “After four decades of work and dedication to the public I basically landed on the scrap heap because I felt I had to resign. I was abused and accused and it was all nonsense but for the sake of the DUP, I had to go, I had to sacrifice myself." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/former-health-minister-jim-wells-11678316&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loss of party whip==
Approaching the third anniversary of his sacking as Health Minister, Wells made allegations in the Belfast Telegraph in April 2018, that special advisors, the Press office and Leadership of the DUP reneged on a promise to re-instate him as health Minister.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/dup-reneged-on-an-agreement-to-bring-me-back-as-health-minister-says-wells-36786781.html&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday 9 April he appeared on BBC Talkback and lambasted the DUP leadership, Press office and special advisors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/bbc_radio_ulster&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his attacks, the party withdrew the whip from Wells in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Breen |first1=Suzanne |title=DUP’s Wells has the whip withdrawn after attack on leadership |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/dups-wells-has-the-whip-withdrawn-after-attack-on-leadership-36887820.html |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduced the DUP to 27 seats in the Assembly, the same number as Sinn Féin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cross |first1=Gareth |title=It's a tie: DUP's Wells says removal of whip gives Sinn Fein equal voting power in Northern Ireland |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/its-a-tie-dups-wells-says-removal-of-whip-gives-sinn-fein-equal-voting-power-in-northern-ireland-36893228.html |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labour law''' (also known as '''labor law''' or '''employment law''') mediates the relationship between workers, employing entities, [[trade union]]s and the government. Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between [[employee]], [[employer]] and union. Individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work and through the [[contract]] for work. {{Visible anchor|Employment standards}} are social norms (in some cases also technical [[standardization|standards]]) for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies (such as the former US [[Employment Standards Administration]]) enforce labour law (legislative, regulatory, or judicial).

==History==
{{main|History of labour law}}
Labour law arose in parallel with the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the relationship between worker and employer changed from small-scale production studios to large-scale factories. Workers sought better conditions and the right to join (or avoid joining) a [[labour union]], while employers sought a more predictable, flexible and less costly workforce. The state of labour law at any one time is therefore both the product of, and a component of struggles between various social forces.

As England was the first country to industrialise, it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of industrial revolution in a less regulated economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, as some of the more egregious aspects of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation. This was largely achieved through the concerted pressure from [[social reform]]ers, notably [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]], and others.

===Child labour===
A serious outbreak of fever in 1784 in [[cotton mills]] near [[Manchester]] drew widespread public opinion against the use of children in dangerous conditions. A local inquiry, presided over by Dr [[Thomas Percival]], was instituted by the [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] for [[Lancashire]], and the resulting report recommended the limitation of children's working hours.&lt;ref&gt;From an " Essay on Trade " (1770), quoted in ''History of Factory Legislation,'' by [[B. Leigh Hutchins]] and [[Amy Harrison (author)|Amy Harrison]] (1903), pp. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, the first major piece of labour legislation was passed − the [[Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802|Health and Morals of Apprentices Act]]. This was the first, albeit modest, step towards the protection of labour. The act limited working hours to twelve a day and abolished night work. It required the provision of a basic level of education for all apprentices, as well as adequate sleeping accommodation and clothing.

The rapid industrialisation of manufacturing at the turn of the 19th century led to a rapid increase in child employment, and public opinion was steadily made aware of the terrible conditions these children were forced to endure. The [[Factory Acts#Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1819|Factory Act of 1819]] was the outcome of the efforts of the industrialist [[Robert Owen]] and prohibited [[child labour]] under nine years of age and limited the working day to twelve. A great milestone in labour law was reached with the [[Factory Acts#Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Factory Act of 1833]], which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, prohibited all night work and, crucially, provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Pivotal in the campaigning for and the securing of this legislation were [[Michael Thomas Sadler|Michael Sadler]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]]. This act was an important step forward, in that it mandated skilled inspection of workplaces and a rigorous enforcement of the law by an independent governmental body.

A lengthy campaign to limit the working day to ten hours was led by Shaftesbury, and included support from the [[Anglican Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Ten Hours' Bill |newspaper=The Times |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/126/803/158807039w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS117603378&amp;dyn=3!xrn_5_0_CS117603378&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |date=18 January 1847 |page=7 |issue=19449 |accessdate=19 August 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many committees were formed in support of the cause and some previously established groups lent their support as well.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Library holds full text versions of the Ten Hours' Advocate in its microfilm department&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign finally led to the passage of the [[Factory Act 1847|Factory Act of 1847]], which restricted the working hours of women and children in British factories to effectively 10 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;Bloy, Marjorie http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/factmine/factory.htm "The Factory Question" accessed 20&amp;nbsp;March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working conditions===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Colliery.jpg|thumb|left|Men leaving the [[History of coal mining|pit]], before the start of [[World War I]]. The average [[life expectancy]] of a [[Liverpool]] mineworker was 30 years in 1900.]] --&gt;
These early efforts were principally aimed at limiting child labour. From the mid-19th century, attention was first paid to the plight of [[working conditions]] for the workforce in general. In 1850, systematic reporting of fatal accidents was made compulsory, and basic safeguards for health, life and limb in the mines were put in place from 1855. Further regulations, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused shafts, signalling standards, and proper gauges and valves for steam-boilers and related machinery were also set down.

A series of further Acts, in 1860 and 1872 extended the legal provisions and strengthened safety provisions. Steady development of the coal industry, increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the Coal Mines Act of 1872, which extended the legislation to similar industries. The same Act included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. The presence of a more certified and competent management and increased levels of inspection were also provided for.

By the end of the century, a comprehensive set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system (with certain national differences) was implemented in other industrializing countries in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

==Individual labour law==

===Employment terms===
{{Main|Employment contract|At-will employment}}
The basic feature of labour law in almost every country is that the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer are mediated through a [[contract of employment]] between the two. This has been the case since the collapse of [[feudalism]]. Many contract terms and conditions are covered by [[legislation]] or [[common law]]. In the US for example, the majority of [[State law (United States)|state laws]] allow for [[At-will employment|employment to be "at will"]], meaning the employer can terminate an employee from a position for any reason, so long as the reason is not explicitly prohibited,{{efn|For example, an employee's refusal to violate law or an employee's assertion of rights.}} and, conversely, an employee may quit at any time, for any reason (or for no reason), and is not required to give notice.

One example of employment terms in many countries&lt;ref&gt;e.g. In the European Union, Directive 91/533&lt;/ref&gt; is the duty to provide written particulars of employment with the ''[[essentialia negotii]]'' ([[Latin]] for "essential terms") to an employee. This aims to allow the employee to know concretely what to expect and what is expected. It covers items including [[Compensation and benefits|compensation]], [[Annual leave|holiday]] and [[sick leave|illness rights]], notice in the [[Termination of employment|event of dismissal]] and [[job description]].

The contract is subject to various legal provisions. An employer may not legally offer a contract that pays the worker less than a minimum wage. An employee may not agree to a contract that allows an employer to [[Wrongful dismissal|dismiss them for illegal reasons]].{{efn|In the US, under the [[National Labor Relations Act]], a worker has no right to organize where he is considered a manager, see ''NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care'', [http://www.lawmemo.com/nlrb/kyrivercases.htm 532 U.S. 706] (2001)}}

===Minimum wage===
{{Main|Minimum wage}}
Many jurisdictions define the minimum amount that a worker can be paid per hour. Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan,South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Spain,Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam, Germany (in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage Act in Germany with effect from 01-01-2015|url=http://www.mayer-kuegler.de/#!minimum-wages-law-germany/mov20|website=Dr. Mayer &amp; Kügler Rechtsanwälte PartG mbB - Arbeitsrecht|publisher=Lawyer Michael Kügler|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and others have laws of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The minimum wage is set usually higher than the lowest wage as determined by the forces of [[supply and demand]] in a [[free market]] and therefore acts as a [[price floor]]. Each country sets its own [[minimum wage law]]s and regulations, and while a majority of industrialized countries has a minimum wage, many developing countries do not.

Minimum wages are regulated and stipulated in some countries that lack explicit laws. In Sweden minimum wages are negotiated between the [[Labour economics|labour market]] parties (unions and employer organizations) through [[collective agreements]] that also cover non-union workers at workplaces with collective agreements. At workplaces without collective agreements there exist no minimum wages. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions but far from all do. The Swedish case illustrates that in countries without statutory regulation will part of the labour market do not have regulated minimum wages, as self-regulation only applies to workplaces and employees covered by collective agreements (in Sweden about 90 per cent of employees).&lt;ref name="portal.research.lu.se"&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2017) [https://web.archive.org/web/20170418083350/http://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/23904978/Kjellberg_FSNumhauserHenning_Self_Regulation_State_Regulation.pdf ”Self-regulation versus State Regulation in Swedish Industrial Relations”] In Mia Rönnmar and Jenny Julén Votinius (eds.)

===Living wage===
{{Main|Living wage}}

The living wage is higher than the minimum wage and is designed that a full-time worker would be able to support themselves and a small family at that wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clain, S.|year=2008|title=How Living Wage Legislation Affects U.S. Poverty Rates|journal=Journal of Labor Research|volume=29|issue=3|pages=205–218|doi=10.1007/s12122-007-9028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hours===
{{See also|Eight-hour day}}
The maximum number of hours worked per day or other time interval are set by law in many countries. Such laws also control whether workers who work longer hours must be paid additional compensation.

Before the Industrial Revolution, the workday varied between 11 and 14 hours. With the growth of [[industrialism]] and the introduction of machinery, longer hours became far more common, reaching as high as 16 hours per day.

The [[eight-hour day|eight-hour movement]] led to the first law on the length of a working day, passed in 1833 in England. It limited miners to 12 hours and children to 8 hours. The 10-hour day was established in 1848, and shorter hours with the same pay were gradually accepted thereafter. The 1802 [[Factory Act]] was the first labour law in the UK.

Germany was the next European country to pass labour laws; Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s main goal was to undermine the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. In 1878, Bismarck instituted a variety of anti-socialist measures, but despite this, socialists continued gaining seats in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]. To appease the working class, he enacted a variety of [[paternalistic]] social reforms, which became the first type of [[social security]]. In 1883 the Health Insurance Act was passed, which entitled workers to health insurance; the worker paid two-thirds and the employer one-third of the premiums. Accident insurance was provided in 1884, while old age pensions and disability insurance followed in 1889. Other laws restricted the employment of women and children. These efforts, however, were not entirely successful; the working class largely remained unreconciled with Bismarck's conservative government.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In France, the first labour law was voted in 1841. It limited under-age miners' hours. In the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] labour law was first effectively enforced, in particular after [[Waldeck-Rousseau]] 1884 law legalising [[trade unions]]. With the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|Matignon Accords]], the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] (1936–38) enacted the laws mandating 12 days each year of [[annual leave|paid vacations]] for workers and the law limiting the standard workweek to 40 hours.

===Health and safety===

{{Main|Occupational safety and health}}
Other labour laws involve safety concerning workers. The earliest English [[Factory Acts#Factory Act 1802|factory law]] was passed in 1802 and dealt with the safety and health of [[child labour|child]] [[textile]] workers.

===Discrimination===
{{Main|Anti-discrimination law}}
Such laws prohibited [[discrimination]] against employees as morally unacceptable and illegal, in particular [[racial discrimination]] or [[sexism|gender discrimination]].

===Dismissal===
{{Main|Unfair dismissal|Wrongful dismissal|At-will employment}}
[[Termination of Employment Convention, 1982|Convention no. 158]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] states that an employee "can't be fired without any legitimate motive" and "before offering him the possibility to defend himself". Thus, on April 28, 2006, after the unofficial repeal of the French [[First Employment Contract]], the [[Longjumeau]] ([[Essonne]]) ''conseil des prud'hommes'' (labour law court) judged the [[New Employment Contract]] contrary to [[international law]] and therefore "illegitimate" and "without any juridical value". The court considered that the two-years period of "fire at will" (without any legal motive) was "unreasonable", and contrary to convention.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Un contrat en CNE jugé contraire au droit international |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=2006-05-05 |publisher=Reuters |url=http://today.reuters.fr/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T165412Z_01_TOU860781_RTRIDST_0_OFRTP-FRANCE-EMPLOI-CNE-TRIBUNAL-20060428.XML |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524110508/http://today.reuters.fr/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T165412Z_01_TOU860781_RTRIDST_0_OFRTP-FRANCE-EMPLOI-CNE-TRIBUNAL-20060428.XML |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 24, 2006 |language=fr |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Bernard Thibault au plus haut |date=April 28, 2006 | accessdate=2006-05-05 | work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/info/quotidien/actu.asp?id=3591 | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001054905/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/quotidien/actu.asp?id=3591 | archivedate=2009-10-01 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child labour===
{{Main|Child labour}}
[[File:Abolish child slavery.jpg|thumb|right|Two girls wearing banners in Yiddish and English with the slogan "Abolish child slavery!!" at the 1909 [[International Workers' Day]] parade in New York City]]
Child labour was not seen as a problem throughout most of history, only disputed with the beginning of universal [[education|schooling]] and the concepts of [[labor rights|labourers']] and [[children's rights]]. Use of [[child labour]] was commonplace, often in factories. In England and Scotland in 1788, about two-thirds of persons working in water-powered [[textile]] factories were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.htm |title=Child Labor and the Division of Labor in the Early English Cotton Mills |publisher=Galbi Think! |date=13 June 1994 |author=Galbi, Douglas A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child labour can be factory work, mining or quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents' business, operating a [[small business]] (such as selling food), or doing odd jobs. Children work as guides for [[tourism|tourists]], sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and [[restaurant]]s (where they may also work). Other children do jobs such as assembling boxes or polishing shoes. However, rather than in factories and [[sweatshop]]s, most child labour in the twenty-first century occurs in the informal sector, "selling on the street, at work in [[agriculture]] or [[child domestic work|hidden away in houses]]&amp;nbsp;— far from the reach of official inspectors and from media scrutiny."&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web | title=The State of the World's Children 1997 | work=UNICEF | url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collective labour law==
{{main|Freedom of association}}
Collective labour law concerns the relationship between employer, employee and [[trade unions]]. Trade unions (also "labor unions" in the US) are organizations which generally aim to promote the interests of their members.

===Trade unions===
{{Main|Trade union}}
Trade unions are organized groups of workers who engage in [[collective bargaining]] with employers. Some countries require unions and/or employers to follow particular procedures in pursuit of their goals. For example, some countries require that unions poll the membership to approve a strike or to approve using members' dues for political projects. Laws may govern the circumstances and procedures under which unions are formed. They may guarantee the right to join a union (banning employer discrimination), or remain silent in this respect. Some legal codes allow unions to obligate their members, such as the requirement to comply with a majority decision in a strike vote. Some restrict this, such as "[[right to work]]" legislation in parts of the United States.

In the different organization in the different countries trade union discuses with the employee on behalf of employer. At that time trade union discussed or talk with the manpower of the organization. At that time trade union perform his role like a bridge between the employee and employer.

===Workplace participation===
{{Main|Co-determination|Industrial democracy}}
A legally binding right for workers as a group to participate in workplace management is acknowledged in some form in most developed countries. In a majority of EU member states (for example, Germany, Sweden, and France) the workforce has a right to elect directors on the board of large corporations. This is usually called "codetermination" and currently most countries allow for the election of one third of the board, though the workforce can have the right to elect anywhere from a single director, to just under a half in Germany. 
However, [[German company law]] uses a split board system, in which a "supervisory board" appoints an "executive board". Under the [[Mitbestimmunggesetz 1976]], shareholders and employees elect the supervisory board in equal numbers, but the head of the supervisory board with a casting vote is a shareholder representative. The first statutes to introduce board level codetermination were in Britain, however most of these measures, except in universities, were removed in 1948 and 1979. The oldest surviving statute is found in the United States, in the Massachusetts Laws on manufacturing corporations, introduced in 1919, however this was always voluntary.

In the United Kingdom, similar proposals were drawn up, and a command paper produced named the [[Bullock Report (Industrial democracy)]] was released in 1977 by the [[James Callaghan]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government. Unions would have directly elected half of the board. An "independent" element would also be added. However, the proposal was not enacted. The [[European Commission]] offered proposals for worker participation in the "fifth company law directive", which was also not implemented.

In Sweden, participation is regulated through the "Law on board representation". The law covers all private companies with 25 or more employees. In these companies, workers (usually through unions) have a right to appoint two board members and two substitutes. If the company has more than 1,000 employees, this rises to three members and three substitutes. It is common practice to allocate them among the major union coalitions.

===Information and consultation===
Workplace statutes in many countries require that employers consult their workers on various issues.

===Collective bargaining===
{{main|Collective bargaining}}

===Collective action===
{{Main|Strike action|Picketing (protest)}}
[[File:Tyldesley miners outside the Miners Hall during the 1926 General Strike.jpg|right|thumb|Strikers gathering in [[Tyldesley, Greater Manchester]] in the 1926 [[General Strike]] in the U.K.]]

[[Strike action]] is the worker tactic most associated with industrial disputes. In most countries, strikes are legal under a circumscribed set of conditions. Among them may be that:
* The strike is decided on by a prescribed democratic process ([[wildcat strikes]] are illegal).
* [[Sympathy strike]]s, against a company by which workers are not directly employed, may be prohibited.
* [[General strike]]s may be forbidden for example, among public safety workers, to maintain [[public order]].

A [[boycott]] is a refusal to buy, sell, or otherwise trade with an individual or business. Other tactics include [[go-slow]], [[sabotage]], [[work-to-rule]], [[sit-in]] or en-masse not reporting to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af-north.org/lordstown.html |title=The Lordstown Struggle and the Real Crisis in Production |author=Weller, Ken |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213065526/http://www.af-north.org/lordstown.html |archivedate=February 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.

[[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]] is often used by workers during strikes. They may congregate near the business they are striking against to make their presence felt, increase worker participation and dissuade (or prevent) [[strikebreaker|strike breakers]] from entering the workplace. In many countries, this activity is restricted by law, by more general law restricting demonstrations, or by injunctions on particular pickets. For example, labour law may restrict [[Picketing (protest)|secondary picketing]] (picketing a business connected with the company not directly with the dispute, such as a supplier), or [[flying picket]]s (mobile strikers who travel to join a picket). Laws may prohibit obstructing others from conducting lawful business; outlaw obstructive pickets allow court orders to restrict picketing locations or behaving in particular ways (shouting abuse, for example).

==International labour law==
{{Clist global labour}}
{{see also|International Labour Organization|World Trade Organization|Private international law}}
The labour movement has long been concerned that economic [[globalization]] would weaken worker bargaining power, as their employers could hire workers abroad to avoid domestic labour standards. [[Karl Marx]] said:
{{quote|The extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such organizations [unions] should be still further extended and made international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1869/basle-report.htm|author=Marx, Karl|authorlink=Karl Marx|title=Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress|location=[[Basle, Switzerland]]|date=September 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been a primary focus among international bodies for regulating labour markets. Conflicts arise when people work in more than one country. EU law has a growing body of workplace rules.

===International Labour Organization===
{{main|International Labour Organization|ILO Conventions}}
Following [[World War One]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the first constitution of a new [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) founded on the principle that "labour is not a commodity", and for the reason that "peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) [[s:Constitution of the International Labour Office|Part XIII]], Section I, and Article 427&lt;/ref&gt; ILO's primary role has been to coordinate international labour law by issuing Conventions. ILO members can voluntarily adopt and ratify the Conventions. For instance, the first [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919]] required a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members, although the [[Working Time Directive]] adopts its principles, subject to individual opt-out.{{efn|Two further general working time conventions are the [[Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935|Forty-Hour Week Convention]] (No. 51) and the [[Holidays with Pay Convention, 1936|Holidays with Pay Convention]] (No. 52). For general information, see {{cite book|last=Ewing|first=Keith|title=Britain and the ILO|year=1994|publisher=Institute of Employment Rights|location=London|isbn=9781873271339|edition=2nd|page=16}} }} ILO's constitution comes from the 1944 [[Declaration of Philadelphia]] and under the 1998 [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] classified eight conventions{{efn|There are 189 Conventions, however some have been superseded by others. For instance, Conventions No. 2, 34, 96, and 181 all concern [[private employment agencies]], but only Convention 181 is in force.}} as core.

These require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions No. [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention|87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention|98]]), abolition of forced labour ([[Forced Labour Convention|29]] and [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|105]]), abolition of labour by children before the end of compulsory school ([[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|138]] and [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|182]]), and no discrimination at work (No. [[Equal Remuneration Convention|100]] and [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|111]]). Member compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, relying on publicity to create pressure to reform. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or less frequent basis.

[[File:Wto logo.svg|thumb|left|As one of the only [[international organizations]] with real enforcement power through trade sanctions, the [[WTO]] has been the target for calls by labour lawyers to incorporate global standards of the [[International Labour Organization]].]]
Because the ILO's enforcement mechanisms are weak,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} incorporating [[labour standards in the World Trade Organization]]'s (WTO) operation has been proposed. WTO oversees, primarily, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] treaty aimed at reducing [[customs]], [[tariff]]s and other barriers to import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, contravening WTO rules as recognized by the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|dispute settlement procedures]] opens a country to retaliation through [[trade sanctions]]. This could include reinstatement of targeted tariffs against the offender.

Proponents have called for a "[[social clause]]" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example, by amending Article XX, which provides an exception that allows imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow comparable action where a WTO member state breaches ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could undermine labour rights, because industries, and therefore workforces could be harmed with no guarantee of reform. Furthermore, it was argued in the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that "the [[comparative advantage]] of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Singapore Ministerial Declaration|publisher=World Trade Organization|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm|date=13 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries want to take advantage of low wages and fewer rules as a comparative advantage to boost their economies. Another contested point is whether business moves production from high wage to low wage countries, given potential differences in worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elliot, Kimberly Ann|editor-first=Richard B.|editor-last=Freeman|title=Can Labor Standards Improve Under Globalization?|year=2003|publisher=Institute for International Economics|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780881323320|editor-link=RB Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GATT, most trade agreements have been bilateral. Some of these protect core labour standards.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--reason="many"--&gt;{{efn|e.g. [[European Union–South Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (14 May 2011) OJ 2011 L127, Article 13. }} Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations, some countries give preference to countries that respect core labour rights, for example under the EC Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/rules_origin/preferential/article_781_en.htm Tariff Preference Regulation (EC) No. 732/2008 Articles 7, 8, 15, and Annex II and III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in multiple countries===
{{main|Conflict of laws}}
[[Conflicts of laws]] (or [[private international law]]) issues arise where workers work in multiple jurisdictions. If a US worker performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a "peripatetic" worker) an employer may seek to characterize the employment contract as governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a [[UK labour law]] case, ''[[Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=[[United Kingdom Supreme Court]] |date=8 February 2012 |url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/1.html&amp;query=ravat&amp;method=boolean |accessdate= |quote=}} ([2012] UKSC 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of [[Halliburton]]. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in [[Egypt]]. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] he would have a right to claim unfair dismissal, but the Act left open the question of the statute's territorial scope. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that an expatriate worker, would be subject to UK rules if the worker could show a "close connection" to the UK, which was found in Rabat's case.{{efn|See also ''[[Lawson v Serco Ltd]]'' ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/3.html 2006 UKHL 3]) and ''[[Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]]'' ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/36.html 2011 UKSC 36]) }}

This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under EU [[Rome I Regulation]] article 8,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rome I Regulation]] (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:177:0006:0006:en:PDF Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; workers have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. They may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:177:0006:0006:en:PDF Rome I], recital 23 and [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33054_en.htm Brussels I], recital 13&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the [[Brussels I Regulation]] article 19,&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33054_en.htm Brussels I Regulation (EC) No 44/2001]&lt;/ref&gt; this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.

===EU law===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2013|section}}
{{main|EU law|European labour law|Directive on services in the internal market}}
The European Union has extensive labour laws that officially exclude (according to the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), fairness of dismissals and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the [[Working Time Directive]] guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the [[Equality Framework Directive]] prohibits all forms of discrimination and the [[Collective Redundancies Directive]] requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place on decisions about economic dismissals.

However, the [[European Court of Justice]] has recently extended the Treaties provisions via [[case law]]. Trade unions have sought to organize across borders in the same way that [[multinational corporations]] have organized production globally. Unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this coordination was challenged in the [[European Union]] in two controversial decisions. In ''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]'' C-319/05 (2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62005J0341:EN:HTML Case text]&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden. The local union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective bargaining agreement. Under the [[Posted Workers Directive]], article 3 lays down minimum standards for foreign workers so that workers receive at least the minimum rights that they would have in their home country in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) says that this "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g., in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) said that only the local state could raise standards beyond its minimum for foreign workers. Any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would infringe the business' freedom under [[TFEU]] article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the [[Rome I Regulation]], which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in ''[[The Rosella]]'', the ECJ held that a blockade by the [[International Transport Workers Federation]] against a business that was using an [[Estonia]]n [[flag of convenience]] (i.e., saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under [[TFEU]] article 49. The ECJ said that it recognized the workers' "right to strike" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment.

In 2017, Premier [[Brad Wall]] announced that Saskatchewan's government is to cut 3.5 percent from its workers and officers' wages in 2018. This salary cut includes [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan|MLA]] ministers and the Premier's office staff along all people employed by the government.

=== China ===
{{Further|Labour Law of the People's Republic of China|Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China}}

In the [[People's Republic of China]] the basic labour laws are the ''[[Labour Law of People's Republic of China]]'' (promulgated on 5 July 1994) and the ''[[Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China]]'' (adopted at the 28th Session of the Standing Committee of the 10th [[National People's Congress]] on June 29, 2007, effective from January 1, 2008). The administrative regulations enacted by the State Council, the ministerial rules and the judicial explanations of the [[Supreme People's Court]] stipulate detailed rules concerning various aspects of employment. The government-controlled [[All China Federation of Trade Unions]] is the sole legal labour union. Strikes are formally legal, but in practice are discouraged.

=== France ===
{{Main|French labour law}}

In France, the first labour laws were [[Waldeck Rousseau]]'s laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid [[Annual leave|vacation]] for workers, and a [[Matignon Accords (1936)|law]] limited the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The [[:fr:Accords de Grenelle|Grenelle accords]] negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''[[:fr:section syndicale d'entreprise|Section syndicale d'entreprise]]''  December 27, 1968 law&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum wage was increased by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[:fr:Salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti|SMIG]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Lionel Jospin]]'s government enacted the [[35-hour workweek]], reduced from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] enacted the [[New Employment Contract]] (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more [[Labour market flexibility|flexibility]] in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it favoured [[contingent work]]. In 2006, he then attempted to pass the [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that was met by [[2006 labour protests in France|students and unions' protests]]. President [[Jacques Chirac]] finally had no choice but to repeal it.

Mexican labour law reflects the historic interrelation between the state and the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]]. The confederation is officially aligned with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI). While the law promises workers the right to strike and to organize, in practice it is difficult or impossible for independent unions to organize.

=== Sweden ===
{{See also|Swedish labour movement}}

In Sweden many workplace issues such as working hours, minimum wage and right to overtime compensation are regulated through collective bargaining agreements in accordance with the Swedish model of ''self-regulation'', i.e. regulation by the labour market parties themselves in contrast to ''state regulation'' (labour laws).&lt;ref&gt;Kjellberg, Anders (2009) "The Swedish Model of Industrial Relations: Self-Regulation and Combined Centralisation-Decentralisation", in Craig Phelan (ed.)

=== Switzerland ===
{{main|Swiss labour law}}

The labour law of [[Switzerland]] covers all standards governing the [[employment]] of some kind. The regulation of the employment by private employers is largely harmonized at the [[Federal government|federal]] level, while public-sector employment still prevails a variety of [[cantonal]] laws. In particular, the civil standardization is distributed to a variety of laws. Of greater importance, particularly the new [[Swiss Federal Constitution|Federal Constitution]] of 1999, the [[Code of Obligations]] , the [[Labour Code]] as well as in the public sector, the [[Federal Personnel Act]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|UK labour law}}

The [[Factory Act]]s (first one in 1802, then 1833) and the 1823 [[Master and Servant Act]] were the first laws regulating labour relations in the United Kingdom. Most employment law before 1960 was based upon the Law of Contract. Since then there has been a significant expansion primarily due to the "equality movement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarahedmundslegal.co.uk/faqs/equality-british-employment-law |title=Equality In British Employment Law |publisher=Sarah Edmunds Legal |date=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313181121/http://www.sarahedmundslegal.co.uk/faqs/equality-british-employment-law |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Laws are either Acts of Parliament called Statutes, Statutory Regulations (made by a Secretary of State under an Act of Parliament) or Case Law (developed by various courts).

The first significant expansion was the Equal Pay Act of 1970. This act was introduced to bring about pay equality for women in the workplace. Since 1997, changes in UK employment law include enhanced maternity and paternity rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/maternity-paternity |title=Employers Maternity Leave Policy, Maternity &amp; Paternity Allowance Policy |publisher=Citation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016092520/http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/maternity-paternity |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of a National Minimum Wage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesssolicitor.com/glossary/employment-law/ |title=Statutory Regulations In British Employment Law |publisher=Access Solicitor |date=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218114024/http://www.accesssolicitor.com/glossary/employment-law/ |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Working Time Regulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/working-time-regulations |title=Employers Working Time Regulations 1998 2009, Working Time Directive |publisher=Citation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers working time, rest breaks and the right to paid annual leave. Discrimination law has been tightened, with protection from discrimination now available on the grounds of age, religion or belief and sexual orientation as well as gender, race and disability.

=== United States ===
{{Main|United States labor law}}

[[File:PalmercarpenterA.jpg|thumb|right|An American builder]]

The [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 set the maximum standard work week to 44 hours. In 1950 this was reduced to 40 hours. A [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] entitles immigrants to work, without requirement a separate [[work permit]]. Despite the 40-hour standard maximum work week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deskinlawfirm.com/working_more_than_72_hours_in_a_week_cannot_be_required |title=Working More than 72 Hours in a Week Cannot be Required |publisher=Deskin Law Firm |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some lines of work require more than 40 hours. For example, farm workers may work over 72 hours a week, followed by at least 24 hours off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Exceptions to the break period exist for certain harvesting employees, such as those involved in harvesting grapes, tree fruits and cotton.

Professionals, clerical (administrative assistants), technical, and mechanical employees cannot be terminated for refusing to work more than 72 hours in a work week.&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar, Victoria. [http://theargroup.com/remember-exemptions-flsa/ "Remember Exemptions to the FLSA"], ''[[The AR Group, LLP]]'', Colorado, 13 January 2015. Retrieved on 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
These ceilings, combined with a competitive job market, often motivate American workers to work more hours. American workers on average take the fewest days off of any developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0922052.html |title=Paid Vacation Around the World |work=infoplease |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] limit the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] governments to [[discriminate]]. The private sector is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but several laws, particularly the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], limit the private sector discrimination against certain groups. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]&lt;ref name=us-amendments&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/us_constitution_5th_and_14th_amendments#1 |title=US Constitution&amp;nbsp;– 5th and 14th Amendments |publisher=findUSlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an explicit requirement that the Federal Government not deprive individuals of "life, liberty, or property", without due process of law and an implicit guarantee that each person receive equal protection of the law. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]&lt;ref name=us-amendments /&gt; explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual's rights of [[due process]] and [[equal protection]]. Equal protection limits the State and Federal governments' power to [[discriminate]] in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group, like a race, religion or sex. [[Due process]] protection requires that employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a "liberty", like the right to [[free speech]], or a property interest.

The [[National Labor Relations Act]], enacted in 1935 as part of the [[New Deal]] legislation, guarantees workers the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.

The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]] prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is the principal federal statute with regard to [[employment discrimination]], prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, [[trade union|labour organizations]], training programmes and employment agencies based on race or colour, religion, sex and national origin. Retaliation is also prohibited by Title VII against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available to Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to jury trial.&lt;ref name="Finduslaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=findUSlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halakhah (Jewish religious law) ===
The beginnings of halakhic labour law are in the Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: The law against delayed wages (Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14-15) and the worker's right to eat the employer's crops (Deut. 23:25-26). The Talmudic law—in which labour law is called "laws of worker hiring"—elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzi'a. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers the parties to the customary law: "All is as the custom of the region [postulates]". 
Modern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen (the Hafetz Hayim) interprets the worker's right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions (that could easily be anchored in Talmudic law) and the right of strike (which is quite problematic in terms of Talmudic law). Rabbis [[Abraham Isaac Kook|A.I Kook]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel|B.M.H. Uziel]] tend to [[corporatism|corporatist]] settling of labour [[conflict (process)|conflict]]s, while Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] clearly adopts the liberal democratic [[collective bargaining]] model. Since the 1940s the halakhic literature on labour law was enriched by books and articles that referred to growing range of questions and basically adopted the liberal democratic approach.

[[File:Emblem of Israel.svg|thumb|200px|Emblem of the State of Israel]]
The '''legitimacy of the State of Israel''' has been brought into question,{{by whom|date=July 2016}} specifically, whether [[State of Israel|Israel's]] political authority over the area it claims should be accepted as [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate political authority]].

The campaign against the legitimacy of Israel is a campaign especially by some Palestinian and Arab leaders and groups for countries to deny or withdraw [[International recognition of Israel|recognition of Israel]].

==Rhetoric of delegitimization==
{{see also|Arab rejectionism}}
Especially in recent years, following the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative election of 2006]] and Hamas' [[governance of the Gaza Strip]], the term "[[delegitimisation]]" has been frequently applied to rhetoric surrounding the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

===Legitimacy rhetoric as antisemitism===
Delegitimization is seen by some observers to be a [[double standard]] which separates Israel from other legitimate nations which have imperfect government. [[Natan Sharansky]], head of the [[Jewish Agency]], discussed a [[3D Test of Antisemitism|3D Test]] for determining [[new antisemitism]]. The third of the three D's is delegitimization. He explains "when Israel's fundamental right to exist is denied – alone among all peoples in the world – this too is anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm |author=Natan Sharansky|title=3D Test of Anti-Semitism: Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization |publisher=Jewish Political Studies Review  |date= Fall 2004|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dore Gold]], President of the Israeli [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], believes there is a "campaign to delegitimize Israel" based on three themes, a "denial of Israel's right to security", "portrayal of Israel as a criminal state", and "denial of Jewish history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/116432/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/43f16e77-6ec1-4500-ac2a-45bcadd0b349/en/WholeDoc_Israel60a.pdf The Challenge to Israel’s Legitimacy]&lt;/ref&gt; Elhanan Yakira, professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, also considers portrayal of Israel as "criminal" and denial of Jewish history, specifically the [[Holocaust]], to be key to a delegitimizing narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Elhanan Yakira. ''Post-Zionism, Post-Holocaust: Three Essays on Denial, Forgetting, and the Delegitimation of Israel''. Cambridge University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0521127866}}. pp. 36–46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Dershowitz]] believes that other standard lines of argument include claims of Israel's "colonial" nature, a belief that statehood was not granted "legally", the [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|apartheid analogy]], and the necessity of a [[one-state solution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz]]. "[http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kiyum-dershowitz.pdf Countering Challenges to Israel's Legitimacy]". ''Israel's Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy''. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Irwin Cotler]], the lopsided number of anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UN is an example of delegitimization.&lt;ref name="harkov1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harkov |first=Lahav |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=262664 |title='Delegitimization of Israel masked as good vs. evil' |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian ex-Foreign Minister [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] has characterized Israel’s delegitimization as the new antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keinon |first=Herb |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=255816 |title=Delegitimization of Israel is new anti-Semitism |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimacy rhetoric as distraction===
[[M.J. Rosenberg]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', argued that the term "delegitimization" is a "distraction", whose purpose is to divert attention away from world opposition to the "illegitimate" occupation of the [[West Bank]] and blockade of the [[Gaza Strip]], from the "illegal" settlements, and from "the ever-louder calls for Israel to grant Palestinians equal rights". He concludes that "It's not the Palestinians who are delegitimizing Israel, but the Israeli government, which maintains the occupation. And the leading delegitimizer is Netanyahu, whose contemptuous rejection of peace is turning Israel into an international pariah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=M.J.|title=Israel: 'Delegitimization' is just a distraction|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/17/opinion/la-oe-rosenberg-israel-20110717|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers of delegitimization to peace==
According to [[Gerald Steinberg]] writing for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, attacks on Israel's legitimacy are a barrier to the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jcpa.org/brief/brief2-6.htm |title=Starting Over After Oslo |author=Gerald M. Steinberg |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Policy|date=22 August 2002 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Yadlin]], former head of Israeli intelligence said that "delegitimization of Israel is a graver threat than war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Podolsky |first=Philip |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/delegitimization-of-israel-a-graver-strategic-threat-than-war-former-intelligence-chief-says/ |title='Delegitimization' of Israel a graver threat than war, former intelligence chief says |work=Times of Israel |date=26 December 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Friedman]], writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', says "for 100 years, through violence and delegitimization, Israelis and Palestinians have made sure that the other was never allowed to really feel at home in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas L. Friedman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/weekinreview/promised-land-israel-and-the-palestinians-see-a-way-to-co-exist.html |title=Promised Land; Israel and the Palestinians See a Way to Co-Exist |work=The New York Times|date=5 September 1993 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegitimization of the adversary, among all the psychological themes, is said to be "one of the major detrimental forces that turns a conflict to be vicious and violent, while preventing its peaceful resolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/delegitimization/?nid=1080 |author=Daniel Bar-Tal |title=Delegitimization |publisher=Beyondintractability.org |date=September 2004|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
US President [[Barack Obama]] said in a May 2011 speech "for the Palestinians, efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure. Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September won't create an independent state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltoronto.com/world/Full+text+Obama+speech+Middle+East+North+Africa/4815768/story.html |author= |title=Obama Speech, Full Text |publisher=Globaltoronto.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the president said, "whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the State of Israel, my administration has opposed them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/03/04/president-obama-2012-aipac-policy-conference#transcript |author= |title=President Obama 2012 AIPAC policy conference transcript |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=4 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irwin Cotler]], former Canadian Attorney General, said that delegitimization is "masked under the current discourse". It is hidden in the anti-Israel resolutions passed by the UN, [[universal jurisdiction]] is "often abused" regarding Israel, it is "laundered under the cover of human rights", and is hidden behind the use of accusations of [[racism]] and [[apartheid]].&lt;ref name="harkov1" /&gt;

Delegitimization is seen as a threat to Israel's security. Demands for Israel to not enter into [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and defeat [[Hamas]] during [[Operation Pillar of Defense]] are characterized by David Schwartz as a "delegitimization of Israel's right to defend itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-11-20/news/fl-jjbs-protest-1122-20121120_1_israel-rabbi-simcha-freedman-pro-palestinian-supporters |author=David A. Schwartz |title=Israel conflict draws reaction |work=Sun-Sentinel |date=20 November 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tzipi Livni]] said that "the threat of delegitimization intensifies other threats facing Israel, and limits our ability to protect ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lis |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/livni-delegitimization-of-israel-exacerbates-other-threats-1.309993 |title=Livni: Delegitimization of Israel exacerbates other threats |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimacy and Israeli uniqueness==
Professor Emanuel Adler of the [[University of Toronto]] considers Israel as willing to accept a situation where its legitimacy may be challenged, because it sees itself as occupying a unique place in the world order.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuel Adler. ''Israel in the World: Legitimacy and Exceptionalism''. Routledge, 2012. {{ISBN|0415624150}} p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Stacie E. Goddard of [[Wellesley College]] argues that the legitimacy of Israeli historical narratives is used as a tool to secure territory.&lt;ref&gt;Stacie E. Goddard. ''Indivisible Territory and the Politics of Legitimacy''. Cambridge University Press, 2009. pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marxist Unification Movement''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Moviment d'Unificació Marxista'') was a political group in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. MUM was founded in 1977, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], by a group that had left the [[Socialist Party of National Liberation of the Catalan Countries]] (PSAN) in 1976 and the ''Col·lectiu Combat'', a splinter group of the [[Catalan National Front]] (FNC).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/catala/enciclopedia/people/m/o.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MUM differed from other radical Catalan [[Separatism|separatists]] in its willingness to participate in the Spanish electoral process. In the [[Spanish general election, 1977|1977 elections]], MUM formed part of the [[Popular Unity Candidature for Socialism]] (''Candidatura d'Unitat Popular cap el Socialisme''), which launched Salvador Casanova as its main candidate. After the elections, MUM merged with the [[Party of Labour of Catalonia]] (PTC) and formed the [[Catalan Workers Bloc]] (BCT).

'''NORM-UK''', currently operating as '''15Square''', is an English-registered [[charitable organization|charity]] concerned with the health of the human [[sex organ|genitals]], with a particular focus on the [[foreskin]] and the avoidance of unnecessary [[circumcision]]. It provides information about conservative treatments for conditions such as [[phimosis]] and [[frenulum breve]], as well as advice regarding [[foreskin restoration]] for circumcised males. It also hosts and participates in conferences and symposia about genital health and integrity.

The charity co-operates, but is not affiliated, with other non-profit organisations, and it is a member of the International Coalition for Genital Integrity.

==History and mission==
NORM-UK was founded in 1994 by English physician Dr. John Warren. The original aim was to provide information to circumcised men about non-surgical [[foreskin restoration]] methods. The organisation quickly expanded its mission to provide information about all aspects of health related to the [[foreskin]], [[human penis|penis]], and genital area.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web
 |url          = http://www.norm-uk.org/aims

 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is independent of any other organisation and it is regulated by the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]. It is registered with charity number 1072831 and with the stated objective: To advance the education of the public in all matters relating to circumcision and other forms of surgical alteration of the genitals including alternative treatments and offering information and advice on such matters.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female genital mutilation]], which is illegal in the United Kingdom, is also a concern of the charity.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The organisation currently trades under the name 15Square. If unfolded and laid out flat, a typical adult's foreskin would measure about 15 square inches.

==Publications==
15Square publishes a quarterly journal, ''15 Squared''. The charity also publishes a number of pamphlets covering a range of issues such as care of an infant's foreskin, [[phimosis]] and tightness of the foreskin in general, and alternatives to circumcision as a remedy. 15Square's vice-chairman, Dr. Peter Ball, also produced a video, ''Restoration in Focus''.

==Office and personnel==
The organisation's office is located in [[Stone, Staffordshire]]. David Smith serves as general manager and is the charity's only paid employee.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of volunteers who work in the office and remotely.

The board of trustees includes founder Dr. John Warren (chairman), Dr. Peter Ball (vice-chairman), Margaret Green (treasurer) and John Dalton (lead researcher and archivist).

[[File:Benedict Arnold oath of allegiance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Benedict Arnold]]'s Oath of Allegiance, May 30, 1778]]

An '''oath of allegiance''' is an [[oath]] whereby a [[nationality|subject]] or [[citizen]] acknowledges a duty of [[allegiance]] and swears [[loyalty]] to [[monarch]] or country. In republics, modern oaths specify allegiance to the country in general, or to the country's [[constitution]]. For example, officials in the [[United States]], a republic, take an oath of office that includes swearing allegiance to the [[United States Constitution]]. However, in a constitutional monarchy, such as in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, oaths are sworn to the [[monarch]]. Armed forces typically require a military oath.

In [[feudalism|feudal]] times a person would also swear allegiance to his feudal superiors. To this day the oath sworn by freemen of the [[City of London]] contains an oath of obedience to the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]].

Oaths of allegiance are commonly required of newly naturalised citizens (see [[Oath of Citizenship]]), members of the armed forces, and those assuming public (particularly parliamentary and judicial) office. Clergy in the [[Church of England]] are required to take an [[Oath of Supremacy]] acknowledging the authority of the [[British monarch]].

A typical example of an oath of allegiance is that sworn by Members of [[Parliament]] in the [[Netherlands]]:

{{Quote|I swear (affirm) allegiance to the King, to the [[Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and to the Constitution. I swear (affirm) that I will faithfully perform the duties my office lays upon me. So help me God almighty! (This I declare and affirm)''&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the 'Wet beëdiging ministers en leden Staten-Generaal' on [http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005430/1992-03-25]. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In many [[Commonwealth realm]]s all that is required is an oath to the monarch, and not the constitution or state. There have been moves in some of the realms to make the oath of citizenship sworn by new citizens refer to the country rather than the monarch. However, the oaths sworn by judges, members of parliament, etc., have not been changed. All of these moves have not succeeded as the Queen is the personification of the Canadian, British, or Australian state (or that of any other Commonwealth realm). Allegiance sworn to the monarch is the same as to the country, its constitution or flag. The [[New Zealand]] [[Oath of Allegiance (New Zealand)|Oath of Allegiance]] still refers to the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 1999 that the oath of allegiance to a reigning monarch is "reasonably viewed as an affirmation of loyalty to the constitutional principles which support... the workings of representative democracy in the respondent State."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin McGuinness|McGuinness]] v. United Kingdom; Application No. 39511/98, decision June 8, 1999 [http://echr.coe.int/Documents/Reports_Recueil_1999-V.pdf Reports and Judgements and Decisions 1999/V], {{ISBN|3-452-24950-6}}, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Operation Ruben''' ({{lang-sr|Акција Рубен/Akcija Ruben}}) was a police raid operation targeting suspected radical Islamists in the [[Republika Srpska]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It commenced on 6 May 2015, following an [[Zvornik police station shooting|attack on a police station]] in [[Zvornik]]. Several people were arrested a week after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afp.com/en/news/bosnian-police-launch-operation-root-out-radical-islamists|title=Bosnian police launch operation to root out radical Islamists|publisher=AFP|date=6 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
 {{see also|Islamism in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
On 27 April 2015, local Nerdin Ibrić (born 1991), a radical Islamist, [[Zvornik police station shooting|attacked a police station]] in [[Zvornik]]. He killed one police officer and wounded two others before he was shot dead by other police officers. Soon after Ibrić's two friends were arrested, the police expanded its investigation to include other radical Islamists, some of whom were also veterans of the Syrian Civil War. The police suspect that the village of [[Dubnica]] near [[Kalesija]] is one of the major gathering points of radical Islamists. Soon after the attack, Dodik met with Serbian President [[Tomislav Nikolić]] and Prime Minister [[Aleksandar Vučić]], asking them for intelligence and counter-terrorism assistance.{{sfn|Jazvić|29 April 2015}}

==Operation==
The [[Ministry of Interior (Republika Srpska)|Interior Ministry]] spokesman Milan Salamandija said that the search was underway in 32 locations within Republika Srpska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/svet/v-republiki-srbski-operacija-proti-islamistom/364479|title=V Republiki srbski operacija proti islamistom|publisher=RTVSLO|date=6 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salamandija said those detained were suspected of having "made supplies of weapons and explosives aimed at committing terrorist acts against the institutions of the Republika Srpska and their representatives". He added that the suspects "belong to radical movements, have fought in or returned from [[Syria]], or were recruiters of jihadists. We found a certain amount of arms and ammunition, bulletproof vests, uniforms and propaganda material for recruitment."

== Criticism ==

At least 30 people, all of whom are ethnic [[Bosniaks]], have been taken into custody by Republika Srpska police for suspected weapons smuggling. The mayor of [[Srebrenica]] called the operation a "form of repression" against Bosnian Muslims in Republika Srpska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/world/srebrenica-muslims-accuse-serb-authorities-of-harassment/article_0dd2dd7a-14e9-528a-98e8-ffa6b959796d.html|title=Srebrenica Muslims accuse Serb authorities of harassment|publisher=STL Today|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bakir Izetbegović]], incumbent Bosniak member of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] heavily criticised the Republika Srpska police for the operation, saying that they were proceeding to "unnecessary" detentions: "''They are acting excessively. Police have seriously crossed the line.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.videonews.us/bosnia-30-detained-alleged-weapons-smuggling-0711736.html|title=Bosnia: 30 detained over alleged weapons smuggling|publisher=Video News|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/world/158894/tanzania-opp-agree-to-field-presidential-candidate|title=Bosnian police carried out raids and have arrested 30 people suspected of smuggling weapons and ammunition|publisher=World Bulletin|date=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Izetbegović also said that the RS Serb police have "overstepped their authority".

[[Nermin Nikšić]] said that the terrorist attack on the police station in Zvornik is being used as justification for the persecution of Bosniak returnees in the Republika Srpska. He added: "''It is scandalous that 20 years after the war, those in power in Republika Srpska act as in the time when [[Radovan Karadžić]] criminally created this entity. We in the [[Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SDP]] believe the actions of the Republika Srpska police directly violate the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]], which guarantees free return of all people in the pre-war places of residence.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fokus.ba/72046/vijesti/bih/niksic-vlast-u-rs-u-ponasa-se-kao-u-vrijeme-radovana-karadzica/|title=Nikšić: Vlast u RS-u ponaša se kao u vrijeme Radovana Karadžića|publisher=Fokus|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.ba/new/vijest.php?id=11457|title=Nermin Nikšić: Vlast u RS-u ponaša se kao u vrijeme Radovana Karadžića|publisher=Nap|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor of [[Srebrenica]] Ćamil Duraković said that the Serb police stormed the homes of Bosniaks who returned after the war to homes they were expelled from in the war, and carried out arrests without explanation. He called it a "form of repression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/world/srebrenica-muslims-accuse-serb-authorities-of-harassment/article_0dd2dd7a-14e9-528a-98e8-ffa6b959796d.html|title=Srebrenica Muslims accuse Serb authorities of harassment|publisher=STL Today|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Defense of Marriage Coalition''' (sometimes styled '''Oregon Defense of Marriage Coalition''' to distinguish itself from similar organizations in other states) is a citizens' political organization support the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman.  It was organized in 2004&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianpost.com/news/defense-of-marriage-coalition-to-file-injunction-against-oregon-2389&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Oregon Family Council]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnnw.com/articles/articles4-04-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; as a campaign first to place [[Oregon Ballot Measure 36 (2004)]] before the voters by [[Initiative|initiative petition]], and then once signatures were collected, as a campaign for its passage.  The organization formed a coalition of 1,500 churches&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2004/06/19/rel_419509.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and collected a record 244,000 signatures to place the amendment on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bpnews.net/printerfriendly.asp?ID=18618&lt;/ref&gt;

{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}
The '''Orwell Prize''', based at [[University College London]], is a British prize for political writing of outstanding quality. Four prizes are awarded each year: one each for a fiction and non-fiction book on politics, one for [[political journalism|journalism]] and one for 'Exposing Britain's Social Evils' (established 2015); between 2009 and 2012, a fifth prize was awarded for blogging. In each case, the winner is the short-listed entry which comes closest to [[George Orwell]]'s own ambition to "make political writing into an art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-prize/about-the-prize/|title=The award|publisher=The Orwell Prize|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Youth Orwell Prize was launched, targeted at school years 9 to 13 in order to "support and inspire a new generation of politically engaged young writers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-youth-prize/|title=The Orwell Youth Prize|website=The Orwell Prize|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, The Orwell Prize for Exposing Britain's Social Evils, sponsored and supported by the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]], was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Orwell Prize for Exposing Britain’s Social Evils|url = http://theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-prize/exposing-britains-social-evils/|website = The Orwell Prize|accessdate = 2016-01-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Crick]] founded the prize in 1993, using money from the royalties of the hardback edition of his biography of Orwell. Its sponsors are Orwell's adopted son Richard Blair, ''[[The Political Quarterly]]'', and A. M. Heath &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-prize/sponsors/|title=The sponsors|publisher=The Orwell Prize|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize was formerly sponsored by the Media Standards Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A brief history|url = http://theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-prize/about-the-prize/a-brief-history/|website = The Orwell Prize|accessdate = 2016-01-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick remained Chair of the judges until 2006; since 2007, the media historian [[Jean Seaton|Professor Jean Seaton]] has been the Director of the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-prize/about-the-prize/a-brief-history/|title=A Brief History|website=TheOrwellPrize.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special awards==
In 2007, BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme was given a special award, the judges noting: "When we were discussing the many very fine pieces of journalism that were submitted ''Newsnight'' just spontaneously emerged in our deliberations as the most precious and authoritative home for proper reporting of important stories, beautifully and intelligently crafted by journalists of rare distinction." In 2008, [[Clive James]] was given a special award. In 2009, [[Tony Judt]] was given a lifetime achievement award. A posthumous award was made to [[Christopher Hitchens]] in 2012, his book ''[[Arguably]]'' having been longlisted that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan war book wins Orwell Prize for political writing|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18172208|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 May 2012|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Jonathan Freedland]] was given a special award, after having been shortlisted for the Journalism Prize that year.

==Controversy==
In 2008 the winner in the Journalism category was [[Johann Hari]]. In July 2011 the Orwell Prize Council decided to revoke Hari's award and withdraw the prize. Public announcement was delayed as Hari was then under investigation by ''The Independent'' for professional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title= Johann Hari faces fresh plagiarism allegations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/27/johann-hari-fresh-plagiarism-allegations|accessdate=27 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 Hari announced that he was returning his prize "as an act of contrition for the errors I made elsewhere, in my interviews", although he "stands by the articles that won the prize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Johann | last=Hari | title =Johann Hari: A personal apology | date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, the Council of the Orwell Prize confirmed that Hari had returned the plaque but not the £2000 prize money, and issued a statement that one of the articles submitted for the prize, [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-how-multiculturalism-is-betraying-women-446806.html "How multiculturalism is betraying women"], published by the Independent in April 2007, "contained inaccuracies and conflated different parts of someone else's story (specifically, a report in [[Der Spiegel]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunter|first=Joel|title=Orwell Prize will not pursue Hari over failure to return money|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/orwell-prize-will-not-pursue-hari-over-failure-to-return-money/s2/a546143/|work=www.journalism.co.uk|publisher=www.journalism.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hari did not initially return the prize money of £2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pugh|first=Andrew|title=Johann Hari yet to return Orwell prize £2,000|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=47949&amp;c=1|accessdate=25 July 2017|newspaper=Press Gazette|date=27 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302025226/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=47949&amp;c=1|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later offered to repay the money, but ''Political Quarterly'', responsible for paying the prize money in 2008, instead invited Hari to make a donation to [[English PEN]], of which George Orwell was a member. Hari arranged with English PEN to make a donation equal to the value of the prize, to be paid in installments once Hari returned to work at The Independent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.englishpen.org/press/the-orwell-prize-and-johann-hari/&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hari did not return to work at The Independent.

The '''Patrons of Industry''' in [[Canada]] were based on the Patrons of Industry of Michigan that had formed in 1889. It was dedicated to upholding and encouraging the moral, social, intellectual, political and financial situation of farmers and to preserve the way of life that existed in farming communities in the late nineteenth century against encroaching industrialization. It cooperated with the urban labour movement to address the political frustrations of both groups with [[big business]].

The Patrons' first appearance in Canada was The '''Grand Association of the Patrons of Industry in Ontario''', founded in 1890.  It declared itself independent of the U.S. group in 1891.

Although centred in Ontario, the organization branched out into Manitoba (see [[Patrons of Industry in Manitoba]]), Alberta,&lt;ref&gt;Edmonton Bulletin, Feb. 15, 1894; Edmonton Bulletin, March 12, 1894, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec and the Maritime provinces. The Patrons' membership exceeded 30,000 at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trentu.ca/admin/library/archives/91-1009.htm Patrons of Industry] Trent University Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Maritimes, [[Duncan Marshall]] in 1895 established more than eighty lodges in Prince Edward Island alone. He also edited a Charlottetown weekly newspaper "The Patron of Industry". Moving into P.E.I. provincial politics by contesting a by-election seat in 1896 the organization was unable to break into the established two-party alignment in the province and was soundly defeated. Marshal left the province soon after the election (and would go on to be a cabinet minister in Alberta and in Ontario), and the movement in the region collapsed.

The Patrons ran candidates in the [[Ontario general election, 1894|1894 Ontario provincial election]]. Three Patrons of Industry candidates were elected, and 13 other members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislative Assembly]] were elected with Patrons of Industry support—12 [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]] and one [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]].

The Patrons of Industry ran 31 candidates (including three in Manitoba and one in Quebec) in the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896 federal election]] (see below). Two, [[David Dickson Rogers]] and [[William Varney Pettet]], were elected, Rogers by acclamation.

The party was soon divided on the question of cooperation with the [[Ontario Liberal Party]], and the group was virtually extinct by 1900. Both Rogers and Pettet ran for re-election in the 1900 federal election but not under the Patrons banner.

The party achieved a few gains for farmers, such as institution of a cooling-off period to ban Ontario defeated politicians from holding office in government for one year after defeat &lt;ref&gt;Brandon Mail, April 16, 1896, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and a cut in tariffs effected in 1894.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13274">'''Pro-Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento Pro-Emancipación de las Mujeres de Chile}}) (often known as MEMCh or MEMCH) was both a historic women's rights organization, which pressed for equality between 1935 and 1953 and a current [[umbrella organization]] reorganized in 1983 to organize other women's organizations to provide unity in the struggle for the country to return to democracy. Once the dictatorship was overturned the [[NGO]] turned their focus to uniting organizations which pursue a broad spectrum of issues pertaining to women's rights and development.

==History==
Pro-Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women or MEMCh was created on 28 May 1935 by a group of mostly working class women, many of whom were members of or sympathizers with the [[Communist Party of Chile|Chilean Communist Party]];{{sfn|Power|2010|p=55}} however, their goal was to have broad membership representing all aspects of the nation. It was the first women's group formed in Chile with specific political goals and an organizational strategy to become a national organization, rather than a local club.{{sfn|Caffarena|Garafulić|1935|p=2}}{{sfn|Gaviola Artigas|Jiles Moreno|Lopresti Martínez|Rojas Mira|1986|p=43}} The journal, ''{{ill|The New Woman (magazine)|lt=The New Woman|es|La Mujer Nueva}}'' ({{lang-es|La Mujer Nueva}}) was created by the organization as a means of publishing their views on feminist issues.{{sfn|Eltit|1994|p=55}} Its leadership was composed of some of Chile's pioneering feminists and include [[Elena Caffarena]], [[Graciela Mandujano]], [[Olga Poblete]], and [[Marta Vergara]], among others.{{sfn|Memoría Chilena|2004}} Its first General Secretary and founder was Caffrena, who served in that capacity from 1935 to 1941.{{sfn|Eltit|1994|p=13}} The organization was considered radical for its era, in that the women wanted full emancipation of their economic, civic and political spheres,{{sfn|Power|2010|p=55}} recognizing that to attain those goals, radical changes must occur in all structures of society.{{sfn|Gaviola Artigas|Jiles Moreno|Lopresti Martínez|Rojas Mira|1986|p=43}} Because the organization was heavily joined by working class women, they stressed the importance of equal pay and elimination of segregation which barred women's participation in certain jobs based on marital or other status.{{sfn|Power|2010|p=55}}{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2004}} Related concerns were state-sponsored child care and maternity benefits,{{sfn|Rosemblatt|2003|p=82}} as well as the right of women to choose whether they would become mothers.{{sfn|Power|2010|p=55}} Support for [[contraception]] and regulation of [[Unsafe abortion|clandestine abortions]], since [[therapeutic abortion]] was already legal, caused some parts of society to accuse MEMCh members of wanting to destroy the traditions of family. In ''memchistas'' (MEMCh members) view, they saw controlling one's biology as a part of women's family rights, including child support, inheritance, legitimacy, pension rights and others.{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2004}} While they strove for [[women's suffrage]], attaining the vote was only one step toward increasing women's participation in the public sphere. MEMCh members focused their efforts on women's issues throughout the social spectrum including the families of the urban poor, middle classes and educated elites.{{sfn|Memoría Chilena|2004}} Social issues MEMCh supported were the availability of sanitary, affordable housing; assistance for alcoholism; reform of women's prisons;{{sfn|Ministry of Education|2004}} and equal access to education.{{sfn|Gaviola Artigas|Jiles Moreno|Lopresti Martínez|Rojas Mira|1986|p=44}}

MEMCh was the first women's group to use mass mobilization through public events, held not only in Santiago but also in the provinces.{{sfn|Gaviola Artigas|Jiles Moreno|Lopresti Martínez|Rojas Mira|1986|p=43}} They held rallies for votes and political freedom, and in favor of regulations dealing with the high unemployment and subsistence living; and others against a military pact between Chile and the United States, and sending Chilean troops to participate in the [[Korean War]]. MEMch developed an educational work, hosting schools for workers and job training courses, and created social service facilities to provide health care and legal advice.{{sfn|Gaviola Artigas|Jiles Moreno|Lopresti Martínez|Rojas Mira|1986|p=44}} In the 1940s, the organization strongly opposed [[fascism]], but rumors and actual links with communism of some of the feminists led to public defamation of several members and press which was critical of their objectives.{{sfn|Memoría Chilena|2004}}{{sfn|Furci|1982|p=81}} MEMch joined the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] and held two congresses (1937, 1940) to gather information from various sectors to create a platform which would address the issues that women faced. When [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] was elected as president, he agreed to introduce the issue of women's right to vote. In 1941, Caffarena and [[Flor Heredia]] drafted a proposal for consideration, but Cerdo died before it was introduced. In 1944, MEMCh organized a meeting held at the [[University of Chile]] in celebration of [[International Women's Day]] and that was followed by another congress, organized by [[Felisa Vergara]]. She brought together women from 200 different women's organizations, who agreed to align in an organization, {{ill|Chilean Federation of Women's Institutions|es|Federación Chilena de Instituciones Femeninas}} ({{lang-es|Federación Chilena de Instituciones Femeninas (FECHIF)}}).{{sfn|Eltit|1994|p=57}}

FECHIF in turn backed the candidacy of [[María de la Cruz]] in 1946, but MEMCh adhered to the Popular Front candidate, [[Gabriel González Videla]], believing that though charismatic, de la Cruz's vision was too narrow to support the needs of a wide constituency of women.{{sfn|Eltit|1994|pp=102-103}}{{sfn|Rosemblatt|2003|p=6}} After González Videla's election to the presidency in 1946,{{sfn|Eltit|1994|p=103}} moderate members' relationships were strained by the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist policies]] ushered in by the [[Cold War]] and the leftist leanings of many MEMch members. In 1949, having survived the government decision to outlaw the Communist Party and state harassment aimed at curtailing its activities, Chilean women gained universal suffrage. Membership turned their attention to [[pacifism]] and campaigns to protect children. The organization survived until 1953, when it was dissolved.{{sfn|Memoría Chilena|2004}}{{sfn|Furci|1982|p=81}} Though specific reasons for the dissolution are unknown, the political polarization and MEMCh's refusal to exclude anyone for their political views and factionalism dividing the focus to interest groups were contributing factors.{{sfn|Gaviola Artigas|Jiles Moreno|Lopresti Martínez|Rojas Mira|1986|p=45}}

==Current Organization==
In 1983, MEMCh83, named after the original organization, was founded founded by a broad spectrum of women's groups, some with [[feminist]] aims and others without feminist goals. The [[umbrella organization]]'s purpose was to unite women's efforts in the restoration of democracy{{sfn|Antezana-Pernet|Miller|2017}} during the [[Chilean dictatorship]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]].{{sfn|Mooney|Campbell|2009|p=22}} Initially the organization made no demands for women's rights, but when MEMCh83 organized its first mass mobilization on 28 November 1983, they expressed opposition to Pinochet and demanded peace and women's equality. In 1985, the organization was established as MEMch, under a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizational structure]]. Since democracy was restored in 1988, the organization has focused on joining a broad coalition of Chilean NGOs in the advocacy of  women's equality, which includes their reproductive and sexual rights, as well as all aspects of development.{{sfn|Antezana-Pernet|Miller|2017}}

'''Race in the United States criminal justice system''' refers to the unique experiences and disparities in the [[United States]] in regard to the policing and prosecuting of various [[Race (human categorization)|races]]. There have been different outcomes for different racial groups in convicting and sentencing felons in the [[United States criminal justice system]].&lt;ref name="United States 2008"&gt;United States.

==Historical timeline==
Race has been a factor in the United States criminal justice system since the system's beginnings, as the nation was founded on Native American soil.&lt;ref name=cutler&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lynch-law: An Investigation Into the History of Lynching in the United States|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uSgKAAAAIAAJ|publisher = Longmans, Green, and Company|date = January 1, 1905|first = James Elbert|last = Cutler}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a factor throughout United States history through the present.

=== Legal background (1763–1829) ===
Lynching and Lynch-Law date back to the 1700s when the term was first used by the Scotch-Irish in reference to an act pursued by the Quakers toward Native Americans.&lt;ref name=cutler/&gt; The law was originally regulatory, providing regulations regarding how lynching could and could not be carried out.&lt;ref name=cutler/&gt; Most crimes of and relating to lynching prior to 1830 were frontier crimes and were considered justifiable due to necessity.&lt;ref name=cutler/&gt;

In the construction of the United States Constitution in 1789, slavery and white supremacy were made part of the justice system, as citizens were defined as free white men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vs9wCQAAQBAJ|publisher = SAGE Publications|date = July 20, 2012|isbn = 9781483305936|first = Wilbur R.|last = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antebellum (1830–1860) ===
Lynch law was renewed with the anti-slavery movement, as several acts of violence towards people of color took place in the early 1830s.&lt;ref name=cutler /&gt; In August 1831, [[Nat Turner]] led the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|slave insurrection]] in Virginia. Turner, an African-American Baptist preacher, believing that the Lord had destined him to free his race, followed through with his plans to conquer Southampton county through the enlistment of other slaves.&lt;ref name=cutler/&gt; He did so by traveling from house to house murdering every white person he could find.&lt;ref name=cutler/&gt; Due to this act, many innocent slaves were killed by the police.&lt;ref name=cutler/&gt;

The court decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' made it so that African slaves and their descendants were considered non-citizens, further incorporating racism into the justice system.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Postbellum (1865–) ===
When slavery was abolished after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment to the constitution]], violence against African Americans increased tremendously and thousands of African Americans experienced lynching.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

During the same time period, unequal treaties towards Native Americans led to a large decrease in Native American land holdings, and Native Americans were forced into {{convert|160|acre|abbr=on}} [[Indian reservation|reservations]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Latin Americans entering the country were also a target for the penal system during this time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Reconstruction Period (1865–1877) ===
{{Further information|Reconstruction Era}}

The [[Ku Klux Klan]], was founded in 1865 in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]] as a [[vigilante]] organization whose goal was to keep control over freed slaves;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It performed acts of lawlessness against negroes and other minorities. This included taking negro prisoners from the custody of officers or breaking into jails to put them to death. Few efforts were made by civil authorities in the South against the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref name="cutler" /&gt;

The [[Memphis riots of 1866|Memphis Riots of 1866]] took place after many black men were discharged from the [[United States Army]]. The riot broke out when a group of discharged Negro soldiers got into a brawl with a group of Irish police officers in Memphis, Tennessee. Forty-six African Americans and two white people were killed in the riot, and seventy-five people received bullet wounds. At least five African American women were raped by predatory gangs, and the property damage was worth over $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Memphis Riots of 1866: Terror in a Black Community During Reconstruction|jstor = 2716953|journal = The Journal of Negro History|date = July 1, 1977|pages = 243–257|volume = 62|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/2716953|first = James Gilbert|last = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] overruled the 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] by establishing that those born or naturalized in the United States are entitled to [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] under the law, regardless of race.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Events after the Reconstruction Era==

===1882 Chinese Exclusion Act===
In 1882 Congress passed the [[Chinese Exclusion Act|1882 Chinese Exclusion Act]], prohibiting Chinese laborers from immigrating into the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Senator [[James G. Blaine]] proposed the idea in 1879 in an effort to prohibit the Chinese from taking over the [[Pacific Slope|Pacific slope]] and avoid the possibility of another civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x8OggvKjZSgC|publisher = Univ of North Carolina Press|date = January 1, 1998|isbn = 9780807847398|language = en|first = Andrew|last = Gyory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1896 ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' ===
In its 1896 ruling, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the United States Supreme Court established that segregation was legal in the United States, establishing the doctrine, "[[separate but equal]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Homer Adolph Plessy was removed from the East [[Louisiana]] Railroad train and arrested for violating the Jim Crow Car Act of 1890 on June 7, 1892. Despite the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling against him, Plessy's case marked the first use of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] provision after the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crdl.usg.edu/people/p/plessy_homer_adolph/?Welcome|title=Plessy, Homer Adolph|last=|first=|date=|website=Civil Rights Digital Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1935 ''Norris v. Alabama'' ===
In 1935 the United States Supreme Court overturned convictions of the Scottsboro Boys in ''[[Norris v. Alabama]]''. These were nine African American teenagers who had been previously denied equal protection under the law as stated in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] because African Americans were purposely excluded from their cases' juries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1941 Fair Employment Practices Commission===
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] established the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]] with Executive Order 8802, which banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in the defense industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1954 ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ===
In the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court decision overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine implemented in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case in schools and required that schools be integrated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The case was brought before the Court in 1952 after African American Oliver Brown tried to enroll his daughter Linda in a local white elementary school and was refused enrollment. He and other African American parents, with the help of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] sued the Topeka school district, and [[Thurgood Marshall]] argued before the Supreme Court in 1952 and 1953 that public school segregation violated the 14th Amendment. The Court decision was unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ushistoryatlas.com/era9/USHAcom_PS_U09_brown_R2.pdf|title = Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, Shawnee County, Kansas|date = |accessdate = |website = USHistoryAtlas.com|publisher = Nystrom: Herff Jones Education Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1955 Murder of Emmett Till ===
[[Emmett Till]], 14-year-old African American boy in Mississippi was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman. His mother's insistence on an open-casket funeral led to the publishing of images of his mutilated body in many newspapers and magazines to showcase the scrutiny of the Mississippi criminal justice system in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Death in the Delta: The Story of Emmett Till|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4OFSSHidzT0C|publisher = JHU Press|date = November 1, 1991|isbn = 9780801843266|language = en|first = Stephen J.|last = Whitfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960 ''Boynton v. Virginia'' ===
In the 1960 case of ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'', the United States Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public interstate transportation facilities such as bus or train stations violates the [[Interstate Commerce Act]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing ===
In 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|16th Street Baptist Church was bombed]], killing four African American girls and bringing attention to the need for increased civil rights protection in the United States Legislature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2002, nearly 40 years later, Bobby Frank Cherry was the last person brought to trial for the murder of the four girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ghosts of Alabama: The Prosecution of Bobby Frank Cherry for the Bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church|work= Michigan Journal of Race &amp; Law |date=2007|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mjrl12&amp;div=6&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=heinonline.org|accessdate = November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1964 Civil Rights Act ===
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment or public accommodations. It also overruled all state and local laws that mandated such discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1965 Watts Riot ===
In the [[1965 Watts Riot|1965 riot in Watts]], Los Angeles, an African American Neighborhood, 16,000 policemen, highway patrolmen, and National Guard troops were forced to restore order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The riot lasted for six days and resulted in property damages worth 40 million dollars. It started when an African American man by the name of Marquette Fry was pulled over by the police for suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol, after which tension grew between onlookers and police officers fusing the resulting violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Watts Riots|url = http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome|website = crdl.usg.edu|accessdate = November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1965 Voting Rights Act ===
In the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], poll taxes, literacy tests, and other impediments formerly used to prevent African Americans from voting were prohibited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The war on drugs ==
{{Further information|Race and the War on Drugs}}

The first U.S. law that restricted the distribution and use of certain drugs was the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914. The first local laws came as early as 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html |title=Opium Throughout History |publisher=PBS Frontline |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] was established in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by an act of June 14, 1930 (46 Stat. 585).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] publicly supported the adoption of the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' used the headline "Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm |title=ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935 |publisher=Druglibrary.net |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15024 |title=Letter to the World Narcotic Defense Association.

In 1937, the [[Marijuana Transfer Tax Act]] was passed. Several scholars have claimed that the goal was to destroy the [[hemp]] industry,&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=French|first1=Laurence|first2=Magdaleno|last2=Manzanárez|title=NAFTA &amp; neocolonialism: comparative criminal, human &amp; social justice|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|page=129|isbn=978-0-7618-2890-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ozF1Yg-c4MC&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earlywine, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=r9wPbxMAG8cC&amp;pg=PA24 p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55"&gt;Peet, 2004: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; largely as an effort of businessmen [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Randolph Hearst]], and the [[Du Pont family]].&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55" /&gt; These scholars argue that with the invention of the [[decorticator]], hemp became a very cheap substitute for the [[paper pulp]] that was used in the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bound in twine: the history and ecology of the henequen-wheat complex for Mexico and the American and Canadian Plains, 1880–1950|author=Sterling Evans|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58544-596-7|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wFkZgyuGFAC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars believe that Hearst felt{{dubious|date=March 2015}} that this was a threat to his extensive timber holdings.

In 1982, the current President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, officially declared war on drugs.&lt;ref name="heinonline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jgrj6&amp;div=19&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|title=Race, Crime and the Pool of Surplus Criminality: Or Why the War on Drugs Was a War on Blacks|author=Nunn, K. B.|website=heinonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President increased federal spending on anti-drug related programs. He also greatly increased the number of United States federal drug task forces.&lt;ref name="heinonline.org"/&gt; Ensuring a lasting impact, Reagan also launched a campaign marked by rhetoric that both demonized drugs and drug users.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105445|title=Race and Inequality in the War on Drugs|first=Doris Marie|last=Provine|date=November 19, 2017|publisher=|journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41–60|via=Annual Reviews|doi=10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Executive branch employed two types of anti-drug strategies during The War on Drugs: supply-reduction and demand-reduction. Supply-reduction strategies typically involved limiting access to drug sources and employing harsher penalties for drug possession and distribution. Demand-reduction strategies included drug use treatment and prevention. The Reagan administration favored supply-reduction strategies and focused their efforts on the seizure of illegal substances and prosecution of individuals caught in possession of these substances.&lt;ref name="heinonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The controversy surrounding The War on Drugs is still widely debated by the academic community. In March 2016, former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told a writer for Harper's magazine that "the Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people". He then went on to elaborate further, saying: "knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities".&lt;ref name="heinonline.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/osjcl9&amp;div=5&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|title=The New Jim Crow|author=Alexander, M.|website=heinonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recent comment by Ehrlichman made headlines primarily because it was the first instance of any person who was ever affiliated with the Presidential administration publicly framing the drug war as a political tactic to assist Nixon's win.&lt;ref name="heinonline.org1"/&gt;
 
Many scholars believe that The War on Drugs had a large impact on minority communities across the nation. In particular, African American communities were affected by the political implications of the new drug policies. It has been noted that throughout The War of Drugs, African Americans were investigated, detained, arrested, and charged with using, possessing, and distributing illegal drugs at a level disproportionate to that of the general population.&lt;ref name="heinonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[William Bennett|William J. Bennett]], John J. Dilulio, Jr., and [[John P. Walters]]' moral poverty theory counter argues that the increase in [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile crime]] and drug use during the 1980s and 1990s is due to children's lack of adult role models in their upbringing, such as parents, teachers, and guardians.  They argue that children born out of wedlock are more likely to commit crimes, and they use this argument to explain the higher rate of crime for [[African Americans|African American]] youth compared to that of white youth in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://study.sagepub.com/system/files/Bennett,_William_J.,_John_J._DiIulio,_Jr.,_and_John_P._Walters_-_Moral_Poverty_Theory.pdf|title = Bennett, William J., John J.

According to the United States [[Bureau of Justice Statistics|Bureau of Justice]], in 2014 6% of all [[Black people|black males]] ages 30 to 39 were in prison, while 2% of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] and 1% of white males in the same age group were in prison. There were 2,724 black male prisoners with sentences over one year per 100,000 black male residents in the United States, and a total of 516,900 black male sentenced prisoners in the United States as of December 31, 2014. This compares to 1,091 Hispanic male prisoners per 100,000 Hispanic male residents, and 465 white male prisoners per 100,000 white male residents in the United States at that time.

A 2016 study from the [[American Psychological Association]], "Discrimination and Instructional Comprehension", researched how the lack of comprehension of capital penalty jury instructions, relates to death sentencing in America.

===Race and the death penalty===
{{main article|Race and capital punishment in the United States}}

Various scholars have addressed what they perceived as the systemic racial bias present in the administration of capital punishment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Londono | first1 = O | year = 2013 | title = A Retributive Critique of Racial Bias and Arbitrariness in Capital Punishment | url = | journal = Journal of Social Philosophy | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 95–105 | doi = 10.1111/josp.12013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a large disparity between races when it comes to sentencing convicts to [[Death Row]]. The federal death penalty data released by the [[United States Department of Justice]] between 1995–2000 shows that 682 defendants were sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coker | first1 = Donna | year = 2003 | title = Foreword: Addressing the Real World of Racial Injustice in the Criminal Justice System | url = https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7132&amp;context=jclc | journal = Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 827–879 | doi=10.2307/3491312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of those 682 defendants, the defendant was black in 48% of the cases, Hispanic in 29% of the cases, and white in 20% of the cases.{{Ref label|reference3|3}}{{clarify|This should really state out of how many death-eligible people, what percentage of blacks were sentenced to death.

==Causes of racial disproportionality==
Two competing hypotheses exist regarding why racial/ethnic minorities, especially African Americans, are overrepresented in the criminal justice system compared to their share of the general population.. These are the '''differential offending''' or '''differential involvement''' hypothesis, which proposes that this overrepresentation is a result of African Americans committing more of the crimes that result in criminal justice processing, and the '''differential selection''' hypothesis, which proposes that this disproportionality is a result of discrimination by the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Piquero |first=Alex R. |last2=Brame |first2=Robert W. |date=April 14, 2008 |title=Assessing the Race–Crime and Ethnicity–Crime Relationship in a Sample of Serious Adolescent Delinquents |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0011128707307219 |journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency |language=en |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=390–422 |doi=10.1177/0011128707307219 |pmc=2782848 |pmid=19946564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piquero (2008) argues that it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine which of these factors is more important than the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/254202 |title=Disproportionate Minority Contact |last=Piquero |first=Alex R. |date=December 3, 2008 |website=The Future of Children |pages=59–79 |doi=10.1353/foc.0.0013 |access-date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice system in the United States has a staggering imbalance in the composition of races, specifically between blacks and whites, incarcerated. Alfred Blumstein states, "Although blacks comprise roughly one-eighth of the population, they represent about one-half of the prison population. Thus, the race-specific incarceration rates are grossly disproportionate." The research done by Alfred Blumstein and the apparent dis-proportionality raise the problem of injustice within the United States criminal justice system. This injustice is alluded to further, but not directly linked to racial injustice, because black males are the victims of having an incarceration rate twenty five times higher than that of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jclc73&amp;div=59&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals#|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettit|first=Becky|last2=Western|first2=Bruce|date=2004-04-01|title=Mass Imprisonment and the Life Course: Race and Class Inequality in U.S. Incarceration|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240406900201|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=69|issue=2|pages=151–169|doi=10.1177/000312240406900201|issn=0003-1224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education may also be a factor that plays into this dis-proportionality. Studies done from 1965 to 1969 based on administrative data, surveys, and census data showed that 3 percent of whites and 20 percent of blacks served time in prison by their early thirties. Thirty years later in 1999, risk of incarceration was partially dependent on education with 30 percent of college dropouts and roughly 60 percent of high school dropouts going to prison. Education playing a role in either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of incarceration based upon the education and skill a person possesses.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Racial disparity in the juvenile justice system ==
In the United States, racial disparities in the [[American juvenile justice system|juvenile justice system]] are partly, but not entirely, due to racial differences in offending; differences in treatment by the justice system also appear to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bishop |first=Donna M. |last2=Leiber |first2=Michael J. |date=December 23, 2011 |title=Racial and Ethnic Differences in Delinquency and Justice System Responses |url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385106.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195385106-e-20 |language=en |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385106.013.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black and Latino juvenile offenders are also vastly more likely to be tried as adults by local prosecutors throughout the US, and are generally likelier to be given harsher, longer sentences by the judges presiding over their trials.

A study of New Jersey juvenile court records for the years 2010-2015 released by WNYC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/black-kids-more-likely-be-tried-adults-cant-be-explained|title=Kids in Prison: Getting Tried as An Adult Depends on Skin Color|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; late in 2016 found that black and Latino offenders comprised almost 90% of juveniles tried as adults (849 black youths, 247 Latino out of a total of 1,251 juveniles tried as adults during the five-year period, thereby black/Hispanic teens represented 87.6% of the total cases.) WNYC also surveyed all NJ inmates currently serving sentences which resulted from crimes committed as a minor, and found that 93% of them are black or Latino. These numbers represent a clear racial disparity in sentencing, particularly so, given the fact that during this period New Jersey was only 14.8% Black and 19.7% Hispanic, in comparison to 56.2% of the state's residents being white.
"Controlling for nature of offense...for family background...for educational history—all of the things that go into a prosecutor's decision, there are still disparities, significant disparities, that cannot be explained by anything other than race," says Laura Cohen, the director of the Criminal and Youth Justice Clinic at Rutgers Law School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/new-jersey-juvenile-detention-minority-tried-adults|title=Nearly 90% of New Jersey children tried as adults since 2011 were black or Latino|first=Sarah|last=Gonzalez|date=October 11, 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These numbers are comparable to the juvenile detention and sentencing trends for the country as a whole, analysis of which shows that roughly 60% of all juveniles who received life sentences after being tried as adults are black. Judges, prosecutors, juries, and police/detention officers all commonly perceive black children as less innocent and childlike than white children. Black teens are commonly over-estimated in age by an average of 4.5 years, meaning that black boys as young as 13 could conceivably be seen as fully 18 years old, and thereby easily acceptable for overzealous prosecutors to treat as an adult defendant. This tendency to round black teens up to adults is detailed in a 2014 study by the American Psychological Association entitled: "The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0035663.pdf|title=The essence of innocence: consequences of dehumanizing Black children|date=2014|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=106|issue=4|pages=526–545|doi=10.1037/a0035663|pmid=24564373|vauthors=Goff PA, Jackson MC, Di Leone BA, Culotta CM, DiTomasso NA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race and sentencing length ==
Over the past 70 years, researching the impact that racial identity has on sentencing outcomes has been at the forefront of criminology. But, many studies contradict each other. Some studies found that minorities receive harsher sentences than whites, while others found that minorities received lighter punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Ojmarrh, and Doris L. MacKenzie. "The relationship between race, ethnicity, and sentencing outcomes: A meta-analysis of sentencing research." ''Final Report Submitted to the National Institute of Justice'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;In a study done from 2011-2014, that followed 302 men and women in drug related convictions found that blacks were actually convicted at a lower rate than other ethnicities, but had 2.5 more incarcerations on average. &lt;ref&gt;Blankenship, Kim M., et al. "Mass incarceration, race inequality, and health: expanding concepts and assessing impacts on well-being." ''Social Science &amp; Medicine'' (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have been conducted to examine whether race is associated with sentence length or severity. An early study by [[Joan Petersilia]] found that in California, Michigan, and Texas, Hispanics and blacks tended to receive harsher sentences than whites convicted of comparable crimes and with similar criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersilia|first1=J.|title=Racial Disparities in the Criminal Justice System: A Summary|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|date=January 1, 1985|volume=31|issue=1|pages=15–34|doi=10.1177/0011128785031001002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1998 [[meta-analysis]] found that the relationship between race and sentencing in the U.S. was not statistically significant, but that the use of different methods of classifying race may also mask the true race-sentencing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratt|first1=Travis C.|title=Race and sentencing|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|date=November 1998|volume=26|issue=6|pages=513–523|doi=10.1016/S0047-2352(98)00028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published the same year, which examined sentencing data from [[Pennsylvania]], found that young black men were sentenced more harshly than were members of any other age-race-gender combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=STEFFENSMEIER|first1=DARRELL|last2=ULMER|first2=JEFFERY|last3=KRAMER|first3=JOHN|title=THE INTERACTION OF RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN CRIMINAL SENTENCING: THE PUNISHMENT COST OF BEING YOUNG, BLACK, AND MALE|journal=Criminology|date=November 1998|volume=36|issue=4|pages=763–798|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1998.tb01265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2005 meta-analysis found that blacks tended to receive harsher sentences than did whites, and that this effect was "statistically significant but small and highly variable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Ojmarrh|title=A Meta-Analysis of Race and Sentencing Research: Explaining the Inconsistencies|journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology|date=December 2005|volume=21|issue=4|pages=439–466|doi=10.1007/s10940-005-7362-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study found that blacks and Hispanics received about 10% longer sentences than whites, even after controlling for all possible relevant characteristics, with regard to final offenses. However, when the researchers examined base offenses instead, the disparity was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7235&amp;context=jclc | title=Prison Time, Fines, and Federal White-Collar Criminals: The Anatomy of a Racial Disparity | author=Schanzenbach, Max | journal=Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology | year=2006 | volume=96 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 analysis of [[U.S. Sentencing Commission]] data found that blacks received the longest sentences of any ethnicity within each gender group (specifically, their sentence lengths were on average 91 months for men and 36 months for women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doerner|first1=Jill K.|last2=Demuth|first2=Stephen|title=The Independent and Joint Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age on Sentencing Outcomes in U.S. Federal Courts|journal=Justice Quarterly|date=February 2010|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1080/07418820902926197}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study found that black women with lighter perceived skin tones tended to receive more lenient sentences and serve less of them behind bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viglione|first1=Jill|last2=Hannon|first2=Lance|last3=DeFina|first3=Robert|title=The impact of light skin on prison time for black female offenders|journal=The Social Science Journal|date=January 2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=250–258|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study looking at felony case data from [[Cook County, Illinois]] found that the sentencing disparity between blacks and whites varied significantly from judge to judge, which the authors state provides "support for the model where at least some judges treat defendants differently based on their race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrams|first1=David S.|last2=Bertrand|first2=Marianne|last3=Mullainathan|first3=Sendhil|title=Do Judges Vary in Their Treatment of Race?|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|pages=347–383|doi=10.1086/666006|lay-url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/2170-new-study-by-professor-david-s-abrams-confirms#.VrejXTYrK1s|lay-date=August 22, 2012|lay-source=University of Pennsylvania Law School|citeseerx=10.1.1.688.5635}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 report by the [[U.S. Sentencing Commission]] found that black men's prison sentences were on average almost 20% longer than those of their white counterparts who were convicted of similar crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002 | title=Racial Gap in Men's Sentencing | work=Wall Street Journal | date=February 14, 2013 | accessdate=February 7, 2016 | author=Palazzolo, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police relation to race and ethnicity==
A study published by [[Roland G. Fryer, Jr.]] a professor at [[Harvard]] concluded in 2015, nationwide, white people were more likely to be shot by police than black people in similar situations while black and Hispanic people were more likely to be manhandled, handcuffed or beaten by the police — even if they are compliant and law-abiding. The study looked at 1,332 police shootings between 2000 and 2015 in 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. The study found that black and white suspects were equally likely to be armed and officers were more likely to fire their weapons before being attacked when the suspects were white. For shootings in [[Houston]], the study looked at incidents in which an officer does not fire but might be expected to. They concluded that officers were about 20 percent less likely to shoot black suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/upshot/surprising-new-evidence-shows-bias-in-police-use-of-force-but-not-in-shootings.html|title=Surprising New Evidence Shows Bias in Police Use of Force but Not in Shootings|accessdate=December 20, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Amanda|last=Cox|date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/13/why-a-massive-new-study-on-police-shootings-of-whites-and-blacks-is-so-controversial/|title=How a controversial study found that police are more likely to shoot whites, not blacks|accessdate=October 21, 2016|work=[[Washington Post]]|first=Jeff|last=Guo|date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to lethal force the study concluded that police are not racially biased in how they use lethal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fryer |first=Roland G., Jr. |date=July 2016 |title=An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force |work=NBER Working Paper No. 22399 |doi=10.3386/w22399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study published in the [[Injury Prevention (journal)|Injury Prevention]] journal concluded that African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos were more likely to be stopped by police compared to Asians and whites. They found that there was no racial bias in the likelihood of being killed or injured after being stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/police-use-of-force-study/index.html|title=Police acts of violence unbiased, controversial new data say|accessdate=December 20, 2017|work=[[CNN]]|first=Jacqueline|last=Howard|date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity in how police interact with white people and people of color was a contributing factor to the rise of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.

A database collected by [[The Guardian]] concluded that 1093 people in 2016 were killed by the police. The rate of fatal police shootings per million was 10.13 for Native Americans, 6.66 for Black people, 3.23 for Hispanics; 2.93 for White people and 1.17 for Asians. The database showed by total, Whites were killed by police more than any other race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database|title=The Counted: people killed by the police in the US|accessdate=October 21, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police behavior depends on the social dynamics of a scenario in a police to citizen interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VKqgBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=police+brutality+statistics&amp;ots=6AOfPCNfhR&amp;sig=PfRAGTsnvmlJGUJySt1XZVOvv6c#v=onepage&amp;q=police%20brutality%20statistics&amp;f=false|title=Criminal Justice Theory: Explaining the Nature and Behavior of Criminal Justice|last=Maguire|first=Edward R.|last2=Duffee|first2=David E.|date=2015-02-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134706112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within scenarios of a police to citizen interaction, different levels of force can be applied to the citizen.  A 2017 study found that people of different races are treated differently by police officers throughout the time of their interaction.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-50697-001|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  62 White, 42 Black, and 35 Latino use-of-force cases were studied from a medium to large sized urban police department in the United States.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  The studies showed that certain people were treated differently initially when force was used by a police officer, and other races are treated differently when the use of force escalates.  The outcomes of the study showed that Black and Latino suspects have more force applied to them early on in the police to citizen interaction, while White citizens receive more violent force as the interaction progresses.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A 2014 study involving computer-based simulations of a police encounter in which one has to decide whether to shoot or not found a greater likelihood to shoot Black targets instead of Whites when the participants were undergraduate students. The same simulation used with police shows the target race affects the police reaction in some ways but they do not generally show a biased pattern of shooting. A majority of police officers' see "ambiguous behavior as more violent when the actor is Black rather than White." Thus, a police officer's judgement of the suspect could be the difference between using force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|last2=Hudson|first2=Sean M.|last3=Guillermo|first3=Steffanie|last4=Ma|first4=Debbie S.|date=2014-05-01|title=The Police Officer's Dilemma: A Decade of Research on Racial Bias in the Decision to Shoot|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spc3.12099/abstract|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=201–213|doi=10.1111/spc3.12099|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study at [[Washington State University]] used realistic police simulators of different scenarios where a police officer might use deadly force. The study concluded that unarmed white suspects were three times more likely to be shot than unarmed black suspects. The study found that "the participants were experiencing a greater threat response when faced with African Americans instead of white or Hispanic suspects" but were still "significantly slower to shoot armed black suspects than armed white suspects, and significantly less likely to mistakenly shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white suspects." The study concluded that the results could be because officers were more concerned with using deadly force against black suspects for fear of how it would be perceived. A 1977 analysis of reports from major metropolitan departments found officers fired more shots at white suspects than at black suspects, possibly because of "public sentiment concerning treatment of blacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/04/27/this-study-found-race-matters-in-police-shootings-but-the-results-may-surprise-you/|title=This study found race matters in police shootings, but the results may surprise you|accessdate=November 16, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|first=Tom|last=Jackman|date=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race and [[recidivism]] ==
A study that considered 34,794 federal offenders took into account the race, risk assessment, and future arrests of all participating members of the sample. Though the use of the Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA), which proved to be highly accurate in predicting whether or not whites and blacks would return to prison after being released, showed that recidivism correlates less with race and more with criminal history.&lt;ref&gt;SKEEM, J. L. and LOWENKAMP, C. T. (2016), RISK, RACE, AND RECIDIVISM: PREDICTIVE BIAS AND DISPARATE IMPACT. Criminology, 54: 680-712. doi:10.1111/1745-9125.12123&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies suggest that recidivism rates as related to race vary based on state. For example, the Alabama Department of Corrections performed a study where they tracked 2003 releases for 3 years. In that time span, 29% of both African American and white males that were released returned to prison, 20% of African American females that were released returned to prison, and 24% of white females returned to prison. The Florida Department of Corrections performed a similar study; they tracked 2001 releases for 5 years. They found that 45% of African American males were reincarcerated and 28% of non-African American males were reincarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nccdglobal.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/created-equal.pdf|title=Created Equal: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the US Criminal Justice System|last=Hartney, Vuong|first=Christopher, Linh|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race and habitual offender sentencing==
There are two main studies that analyze the issue of habitual offenders in regards to race. Both were mostly conducted by Western Michigan University professor Charles Crawford. Published in 1998 and 2000, both studies focused on habitual offenders in the state of [[Florida]]. Crawford's studies found that black defendants in [[Florida]] were significantly more likely to be sentenced as [[Habitual offender|habitual offenders]] than were whites, and that this effect was significantly larger for drug offenses and property crimes of which whites are often the victims. &lt;ref&gt;CRAWFORD, CHARLES; CHIRICOS, TED; [[Gary Kleck|KLECK, GARY]] (August 1998). "RACE, RACIAL THREAT, AND SENTENCING OF HABITUAL OFFENDERS*". ''Criminology''. '''36''' (3): 481–512. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1111/j.1745-9125.1998.tb01256.x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining both individual level and county level variables, a new study from 2008 updated and evaluated Crawford's work. It affirmed that sentencing policies are becoming harsher, and habitual offender statutes are currently just another tool that lawmakers use to incarcerate minorities at a higher rate than their white counterparts. The 2008 study concluded that habitual offender statutes can only continue to be used if they are used in a way that completely disregards race and is unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, M. S., &amp; Johnson, K. A. (2008). Race, Ethnicity, and Habitual-Offender Sentencing: A Multilevel Analysis of Individual and Contextual Threat. ''Criminal Justice Policy Review'', ''19''(1), 63–83. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/0887403407308476&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Factors affecting incarceration rates==
Blacks had a higher chance of going to prison especially those who had dropped out of high school. If a Black male [[Dropping out|dropped out]] of high school, he had an over 50% chance of being incarcerated in his lifetime, as compared to an 11% chance for White male high school dropouts.&lt;ref&gt;Western, Bruce. 'Punishment and Inequality in America'. New York: Russell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Socio-economic, geographic, and educational disparities, as well as alleged unequal treatment in the criminal justice system, contributed to this gap in incarceration rates by race.

Failure to achieve [[literacy]] (reading at "[[Educational stage|grade level]]") by the third or fourth grade makes the likelihood of future incarceration twenty times more likely than other students. Some states use this measurement to predict how much prison space they will require in the future. It appears to be a poverty issue rather than a race issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Bob | last=Rains | title=Brevard's new literacy crusade:United Way.

According to Dorothy Roberts the current prison system serves as a [[punitive]] system in which mass incarceration has become the response to problems in society. Field studies regarding prison conditions describe behavioral changes produced by prolonged incarceration, and conclude that imprisonment undermines the social life of inmates by exacerbating criminality or impairing their capacity for normal social interaction. Roberts further argues this racial disparity in imprisonment, particularly with African Americans, subjects them to political subordination by destroying their positive connection with society.&lt;ref name="Roberts 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Dorothy|title=The Social and Moral Cost of Mass Incarceration in African American Communities|journal=Stanford Law Review|year=2004|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also aegues that institutional factors – such as the [[prison industrial complex]] itself – become enmeshed in everyday lives, so much so that prisons no longer function as "law enforcement" systems.&lt;ref name="Roberts 2004" /&gt;  It has also been argued thst Latinos have been overlooked in the debate over the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name="SpearIt"/&gt; It has also been suggested that differences in the way the criminal justice system treats blacks and whites decreases legitimacy, which, in turn, increases criminal behavior, leading to further increases in racial disparities in interactions with the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rocque|first1=M.|title=Racial Disparities in the Criminal Justice System and Perceptions of Legitimacy: A Theoretical Linkage|journal=Race and Justice|date=July 25, 2011|volume=1|issue=3|pages=292–315|doi=10.1177/2153368711409758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime in poorer urban neighborhoods is linked to increased rates of mass incarceration, as job opportunities decline and people turn to crime for survival.&lt;ref name=Pettit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettit|first=B.|author2=Western, B. |title=Mass Imprisonment and the Life Course: Race and Class Inequality in U.S. Incarceration|journal=American Sociological Review|date=April 1, 2004|volume=69|issue=2|pages=151–169|doi=10.1177/000312240406900201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime among low-education men is often linked to the economic decline among unskilled workers.&lt;ref name=Pettit /&gt; These economic problems are also tied to reentry into society after incarceration. Data from the Washington State Department of Corrections and Employment Insurance records show how "the wages of black ex-inmates grow about 21 percent more slowly each quarter after release than the wages of white ex-inmates".&lt;ref name="Lyons 257–280"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Christopher J.|author2=Pettit, Becky |title=Compounded Disadvantage: Race, Incarceration, and Wage Growth|journal=Social Problems|date=May 1, 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=257–280|doi=10.1525/sp.2011.58.2.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conviction leads to all sorts of social, political, and economic disadvantages for felons, and has been dubbed the "new civil death" (Chin 2012, 179). In the aggregate, these obstacles make it difficult for released inmates to transition to society successfully, which, in turn, makes it difficult for these communities to achieve social stability.

Black ex-inmates earn 10 percent less than white ex-inmates post incarceration on average.&lt;ref name="Lyons 257–280" /&gt;

Problems resulting from mass incarceration extend beyond economic and political aspects to reach community lives as well. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 46% of black female inmates were likely to have grown up in a home with only their mothers. A study by Bresler and Lewis shows how incarcerated African American women were more likely to have been raised in a single female headed household while incarcerated white women were more likely to be raised in a two parent household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Susan|title=Mothering and Making It, in and Out of Prison|journal=[[Punishment &amp; Society]]|date=April 1, 2004|volume=6|issue=2|pages=229–233|doi=10.1177/1462474504041269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black women's lives are often shaped by the prison system because they have intersecting familial and community obligations. The "increase incarceration of black men and the sex ratio imbalance it induces shape the behavior of young black women".&lt;ref name=mecho&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechoulan|first=Stephane|title=The External Effects of black Male Incarceration on Black Females|journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]]|issue=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education, fertility, and employment for black women are affected due to increased mass incarceration.  Black women's employment rates were increased, shown in Mechoulan's data, due to increased education. Higher rates of black male incarceration lowered the odds of nonmarital teenage motherhood and black women's ability to get an educational degree, thus resulting in early employment.&lt;ref name=mecho/&gt; Whether incarcerated themselves or related to someone who was incarcerated, women are often conformed into stereotypes of how they are supposed to behave yet are isolated from society at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=S.|author2=Haas, L.

Furthermore, this system can disintegrate familial life and structure. Black and Latino youth are more likely to be incarcerated after coming in contact with the [[American juvenile justice system]]. According to a study by Victor Rios, 75% of prison inmates in the United States are Black and Latinos between the ages of 20 and 39.&lt;ref name="Rios 40–54"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rios|first=Victor M.|title=The Hyper-Criminalization of Black and Latino Male Youth in the Era of Mass Incarceration|journal=Souls|date=July 1, 2006|volume=8|issue=2|pages=40–54|doi=10.1080/10999940600680457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rios further argued that, societal institutions – such as schools, families, and community centers can impact youth by initiating them into this "system of criminalization" from an early age. Rios argues that these institutions, which are traditionally set up to protect the youth, contribute to mass incarceration by mimicking the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name="Rios 40–54"/&gt;

From a different perspective, parents in prison face further moral and emotional dilemmas because they are separated from their children. Both black and white women face difficulty with where to place their children while incarcerated and how to maintain contact with them.&lt;ref name="Ferraro 9–40"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Kathleen J.|author2=Moe, Angela M. |title=Mothering, Crime, And Incarceration|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|date=February 1, 2003|volume=32|issue=1|pages=9–40|doi=10.1177/0891241602238937}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study by Bresler and Lewis, black women are more likely to leave their children with related kin whereas white women's children are likely to be placed in foster care.&lt;ref name="Ferraro 9–40"/&gt; In a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed how in 1999, seven percent of black children had a parent in prison, making them nine times more likely to have an incarcerated parent than white children.&lt;ref name="Roberts 2004"/&gt;

Having parents in prison can have adverse psychological effects as children are deprived of parental guidance, emotional support, and financial help.&lt;ref name="Roberts 2004"/&gt; Because many prisons are located in remote areas, incarcerated parents face physical barriers in seeing their children and vice versa.

Societal influences, such as low education among African American men, can also lead to higher rates of incarceration. Imprisonment has become "disproportionately widespread among low-education black men" in which the penal system has evolved to be a "new feature of American race and class inequality".&lt;ref name="Pettit" /&gt; Scholar Pettit and Western's research has shown how incarceration rates for African Americans are "about eight times higher than those for whites", and prison inmates have less than "12 years of completed schooling" on average.&lt;ref name="Pettit" /&gt;

=== Post release ===

These factors all impact released prisoners who try to reintegrate into society. According to a national study, within three years of release, almost 7 in 10 will have been rearrested. Many released prisoners have difficulty transitioning back into societies and communities from state and federal prisons because the social environment of peers, family, community, and state level policies all impact prison reentry; the process of leaving prison or jail and returning to society. Men eventually released from prison will most likely return to their same communities, putting additional strain on already scarce resources as they attempt to garner the assistance they need to successfully reenter society. They also tend to come from disadvantaged communities as well and due to the lack of resources, these same men will continue along this perpetuating cycle.&lt;ref name=Pettit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Cody|date=July 1, 2015|title=On the move: Incarceration, race, and residential mobility|journal=Social Science Research|volume=52|pages=451–464|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.03.009|issn=1096-0317|pmid=26004473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major challenge for prisoners re-entering society is obtaining employment, especially for individuals with a felony on their record. A study utilizing U.S. Census occupational data in New Jersey and Minnesota in 2000 found that "individuals with felon status would have been disqualified from approximately one out of every 6.5 occupations in New Jersey and one out of every 8.5 positions in Minnesota".&lt;ref&gt;Wheelock, Darren; Christopher Uggen and Heather Hlvaka.  [http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=socs_fac 'Employment Restrictions for Individuals with Felons Status and Racial Inequality in the Labor Market'] in 'Global Perspectives on Re-Entry'. Marquette University, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that combination of race and criminal status of an individual will diminish the positive aspects of an individual and intensify stereotypes. From the viewpoint of employers, the racial stereotypes will be confirmed and encourage discrimination in the hiring process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Christopher J.|last2=Pettit|first2=Becky|date=January 1, 2011|title=Compounded Disadvantage: Race, Incarceration, and Wage Growth|jstor=10.1525/sp.2011.58.2.257|journal=Social Problems|volume=58|issue=2|pages=257–280|doi=10.1525/sp.2011.58.2.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; As African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by felon status, these additional limitations on employment opportunity were shown to exacerbate racial disparities in the labor market.

==Calls for reform==
There have been minor adjustments to reduce the incarceration rate in the United States on the state level. Some of these efforts include introducing [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47]] in 2014, which reclassified specific property and drug crimes, and the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws|Rockefeller drug laws]] in 2009, which pressed extreme minimum sentences for minor drug offenses. According to [[Sentencing Project|The Sentencing Project]], there can be other alterations made to lower the incarceration rate. Some changes include reducing the length of some sentences, making resources such as treatment for substance abuse available to all and investing in organizations that promote strong youth development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2757">The '''Respect agenda''' was launched in September 2005 by [[Tony Blair]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Tony Blair described it as being about "putting the law-abiding majority back in charge of their communities" [http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page8819.asp]. Its aim was to help central government, local agencies, local communities and citizens to work together to tackle anti-social behaviour more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Securing Respect: Behavioural Expectations and Anti-Social Behaviour in the UK |author=Andrew Millie (ed.) |year=2009 |ISBN=1-84742-093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in January 2006, Tony Blair acknowledged the work of sociologist [[Richard Sennett]], particularly his 2003 book ''Respect: The Formation of Character in a World of Inequality'' &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Respect: The Formation of Character in a World of Inequality |author=Richard Sennett |year=2003 |ISBN=0-393-05126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4600156.stm].

In late December 2007, it was reported that the government of [[Gordon Brown]] had effectively ended the Respect programme by closing down the Respect Task Force and moving its head to another job inside the [[Cabinet Office]] [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/tonyblair/story/0,,2232055,00.html]. However, much of the Respect Agenda was incorporated into a Youth Taskforce Action Plan in the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Securing Respect: Behavioural Expectations and Anti-Social Behaviour in the UK |author=Andrew Millie (ed.) |year=2009 |ISBN=1-84742-093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Respect Task Force==

The agenda was co-ordinated by the Respect Task Force, a cross-governmental unit based at the [[Home Office]]. Louise Casey, former director of the Anti-Social Behaviour Unit, headed the Task Force.

==Respect Action Plan==

The key policies of the Task Force were published in the Respect Action Plan in January 2006. The report advised tackling the underlying causes of anti-social behaviour, intervening early where problems occur and broadening efforts to address other areas of poor behaviour.

==Anti-social behaviour==

The agenda promoted a range of tools including [[Anti-Social Behaviour Order]]s, Parenting Orders, Family Intervention Projects and Dispersal Orders. The Task Force claimed use of a combination of the available tools can be effective when tackling the problem, although Anti-Social Behaviour Orders have encountered some controversy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">'''Simon of [[Perea (Holy Land)|Peraea]]''' or '''Simon son of Joseph''' was a former [[slave]] of [[Herod the Great]] who rebelled and was killed by the Romans in between 4 BC and 15 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/men-mh/messiah/messianic_claimants02.html "Simon of Peraea (4 BCE)" www.livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been identified as the [[Jewish messianism|messiah]] of [[Gabriel's Revelation]]. He is mentioned by [[Flavius Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''Jewish War'' 2.57-59 and ''Jewish Antiquities'' 17.273-277&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Josephus:
:"There was also Simon, who had been a slave of king Herod, but in other respects a comely person, of a tall and robust body; he was one that was much superior to others of his order, and had had great things committed to his care. This man was elevated at the disorderly state of things, and was so bold as to put a diadem on his head, while a certain number of the people stood by him, and by them he was declared to be a king, and he thought himself more worthy of that dignity than any one else."
:"He burnt down the royal palace at [[Jericho]], and plundered what was left in it. He also set fire to many other of the king's houses in several places of the country, utterly destroyed them, and permitted those that were with him to take what was left in them for a prey. He would have done greater things, but care was taken to repress him immediately. [The commander of Herod's infantry] Gratus joined himself to some Roman soldiers, took the forces he had with him, and met Simon. And after a great and a long fight, no small part of those that had come from Peraea (a disordered body of men, fighting rather in a bold than in a skillful manner) were destroyed. Although Simon had saved himself by flying away through a certain valley, Gratus overtook him, and cut off his head."

==Messiah claim==
A tablet, known as the [[Gabriel's Revelation]] or The Jeselsohn Stone, was likely found near [[the Dead Sea]] some time around the year 2000. It has been associated with the same community which created the Dead Sea scrolls and mentions Simon. [[Israel Knohl]] formerly read the inscription as a command from the angel Gabriel "to rise from the dead within three days". He took this command to be directed at a 1st-century Jewish rebel called Simon, who was killed by the Romans in 4 BC. Knohl believed that the finding "calls for a complete reassessment of all previous scholarship on the subject of messianism, Jewish and Christian alike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knohl|first= Israel|title=In three days, you shall live|work=Haaretz|date= April 19, 2007 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/850657.html|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[National Geographic Channel]] aired ''The First Jesus?'' which addressed the claims and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/4290/facts "THE FIRST JESUS FACTS" channel.nationalgeographic.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819141040/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/4290/facts |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knohl has eventually abandoned this reading, in favor of Ronald Hendel's reading (followed by Qimron &amp; Yuditsky): "By three days the sign".&lt;ref name="Knohl"&gt;Israel Knohl, "The Apocalyptic and Messianic Dimensions of the ''Gabriel Revelation'' in Their Historical Context", in Matthias Henze (ed.), ''Hazon Gabriel: New Readings of the Gabriel Revelation'' (Early Judaism and Its Literature 29), Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43 n. 12}} He still maintains the historical background of the inscription to be as mentioned above. He now views Simon's death, according to the inscription, as "an essential part of the redemptive process. The blood of the slain messiah paves the way for the final salvation".&lt;ref name="Knohl"/&gt;{{rp|47-48}}

A '''state religion''' (also called an '''established religion''' or '''official religion''') is a [[religion|religious]] body or [[creed]] officially endorsed by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. A state with an official religion, while not [[secular state|secular]], is not necessarily a [[theocracy]], a country whose rulers have both secular and spiritual authority. State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but the state does not need be under the control of the religion (as in a theocracy) nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the state.

Official religions have been known throughout [[History of the world|human history]] in almost all types of cultures, reaching into the [[Ancient Near East]] and prehistory. The relation of [[Cult|religious cult]] and the state was discussed by [[Varro]], under the term of ''[[theologia civilis]]'' ("civic theology"). The first state-sponsored [[Christian church]] was the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], established in 301 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Ecclesiastical History''. p. 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christianity]], as the term ''church'' is typically applied to a Christian place of worship or organisations incorporating such ones, the term ''state church'' is associated with Christianity as sanctioned by the government, historically the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in the last centuries of the Empire's existence, and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], which are similar but carry a more minor connotation.

In the [[Middle East]], many states with primarily Islamic population have [[Islam]] as their state religion, either as the [[Shiite]] or [[Sunni]] variety, though the degree of religious restrictions on the citizen's everyday life varies by country. [[Kings of Saudi Arabia|Rulers]] of Saudi Arabia use both secular and religious power, while Iran's secular [[President of Iran|presidents]] are supposed to follow the decisions of [[Supreme leader of Iran|religious authorities]] since the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution of 1979]]. Turkey, which also has a primarily Muslim population, became a secular country after [[Atatürk's Reforms]], although unlike the [[Russian Revolution]] of the same time period, it did not result in the adoption of [[state atheism]].

The degree to which an official national religion is imposed upon citizens by the state in contemporary society varies considerably; from high as in [[Religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] to minimal or none at all as in [[Religion in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Religion in England|England]], [[Religion in Iceland|Iceland]], and [[Religion in Greece|Greece]].

==Types==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement (with or without financial support) with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (states follow the religion of the ruler) embodied in the text of the treaty that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with Rome in 1534, being declared the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]],&lt;ref&gt;The headship was administrative and jurisdictional but did not include the ''potestas ordinis'' (the right to preach, ordain, administer the sacraments and rites of the Church which were reserved to the clergy). Bray, Gerald. ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke &amp; Cº (1994), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; the official religion of England continued to be "Catholicism without the Pope" until after his death in 1547,&lt;ref&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Penguin (1960), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] opposed the religion of the ruler.

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pre-1905 French concordatry legal system and patterns in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;The concerned religious communities are the [[Diocese of Metz|dioceses of Metz]] and [[Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]] and the Reformed [[EPRAL]] and the three [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]] in Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[Religion in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Religion in Cuba|Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State churches===
There is also a difference between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A "state church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{clarify|Please give an example of a "state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state" or otherwise make it much clearer|date=March 2016}} An example of a "state religion" that is not also a "state church" is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in Costa Rica, which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution, despite the lack of a [[national church]]. In the case of a "state church", the state has absolute control over the church,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} but in the case of a "state religion", the church is ruled by an exterior body; in the case of Catholicism, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church. In either case, the official state religion has some influence over the ruling of the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As of 2012, there are only five state churches left,{{clarify|Whiche ones?|date=November 2016}} as most countries that once featured state churches have [[Separation of church and State|separated the church from their government]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Disestablishment===
&lt;!---This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]]---&gt;
{{further|Secular state}}
Disestablishment is the process of repealing a church's status as an organ of the state. Opponents of disestablishment of the [[Church of England]] were known as [[Antidisestablishmentarianism|antidisestablishmentarians]].

==Current state religions==
Currently, the following religions have been established as state religions in some countries. All are versions of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]].

===Buddhism===
Governments where [[Buddhism]], either a specific form of, or the whole, has been established as an official religion:
* {{Flag|Bhutan}}: The [[Constitution of Bhutan|Constitution]] defines Buddhism as the "spiritual heritage of Bhutan" and mandates that [[Druk Gyalpo]] (King) should appoint [[Je Khenpo]] and [[Dratshang Lhentshog]] (The Commission for the Monastic Affairs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.bt/draft_constitution_3rd_en.pdf |title=Draft of Tsa Thrim Chhenmo |date=1 August 2007 |publisher=www.constitution.bt |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-18 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127125443/http://www.constitution.bt/draft_constitution_3rd_en.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}

* {{Flag|Cambodia}}: The [[Constitution of Cambodia|Constitution]] declared Buddhism as official religion of the country. About 97% of the Cambodia's population is Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambodia.org/facts/?government=The+Constitution+of+Cambodia |title=Constitution of Cambodia |publisher=cambodia.org |accessdate=2011-04-13 |postscript=.}} (Article 43).&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Laos}}: According to Laos constitution, Buddhism is given special privilege in the society of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 9: The State respects and protects all lawful activities of Buddhists and of followers of other religions, [and] mobilises and encourages Buddhist monks and novices as well as the priests of other religions to participate in activities that are beneficial to the country and people.{{cite web|title=Lao People's Democratic Republic's Constitution of 1991 with Amendments through 2003|url=https://constituteproject.org/constitution/Laos_2003.pdf?lang=en|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Myanmar}}: Section 361 of the [[Constitution of Myanmar|Constitution]] states that "The Union recognizes special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Constitution of 2008|url=https://constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008.pdf?lang=en|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* {{Flag|Sri Lanka}}: the [[constitution of Sri Lanka]] accords Buddhism the "foremost place", although it does not identify it as a state religion.

The following states recognize some form of [[Christianity]] as their state or official religion (by denomination):

====Roman Catholicism====
Jurisdictions where [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] has been established as a state or official religion:
* {{Flag|Costa Rica}}: article 75 of the [[constitution of Costa Rica]] confirms that "The Roman Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the religion of the State, which contributes to its maintenance, without preventing the free exercise in the Republic of other forms of worship that are not opposed to universal morality or good customs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costaricalaw.com/Constitutional-Law/costa-rica-constitution-in-english.html|title=Costa Rica Constitution in English – Constitutional Law – Costa Rica Legal Topics|author=Super User|work=costaricalaw.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906224713/http://costaricalaw.com/Constitutional-Law/costa-rica-constitution-in-english.html|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Liechtenstein}}: the [[constitution of Liechtenstein]] describes the Catholic Church as the state religion and enjoying "the full protection of the State".

The highest state functionaries are all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergy of various national origins. It is the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]] ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}) and the location of the Pope's official residence, referred to as the [[Apostolic Palace]].

Jurisdictions that give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to Roman Catholicism without establishing it as the state religion:
* {{flag|Andorra}}
* {{flag|Argentina}} – article 2 of the [[Constitution of Argentina|Constitution]] explicitly states that the government supports the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith, but the constitution does not establish a state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994.pdf?lang=en|title=Argentina's Constitution of 1853, Reinstated in 1983, with Amendments through 1994|work=constituteproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gob.ar/pais/56-religion.php|title=Argentina – Religión|work=argentina.gob.ar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008102111/http://www.argentina.gob.ar/pais/56-religion.php|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The jurisdictions below give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], but without establishing it as the state religion:
* {{flag|Bulgaria}}: in the Bulgarian Constitution, the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] is recognized as "the traditional religion" of the Bulgarian people, but the state itself remains secular.
* {{flag|Finland}}: [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] has a special relationship with the state, along with [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]. These two churches are established as ”national churches”.
* {{flag|Georgia}}: [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] is not the state church of Georgia but has a special constitutional agreement with the state, with the constitution recognising "the special role of the Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia in the history of Georgia and its independence from the state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.ge/en/kanonmdebloba/constitution-of-georgia-68 Constitution of Georgia] Article 9(1&amp;2) and 73(1a{{sup|1}})&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Concordat of 2002]])

====Protestantism====

=====Anglicanism=====
The Anglican [[Church of England]] is the established church in England as well as all three of the [[Crown Dependencies]].
* {{flag|England}}: the [[Church of England]] is the established church in England, but not in the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only established Anglican church worldwide. The Anglican [[Church in Wales]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] are not established churches and they are independent from the Church of England. The [[British monarchy|British monarch]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The 26 most senior bishops in the Church of England are [[Lords Spiritual]] and have seats in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]].
* {{flag|Guernsey}}: the [[Church of England]] is the established church in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], and the leader of the Church of England in the territory is the [[Dean of Guernsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.churchofengland.org.gg/about|website=Guernsey Deanery|publisher=Church of England}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Isle of Man}}: the [[Church of England]] is the established church on the Isle of Man. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] is an ex officio member of the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] of the upper house of the [[Tynwald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gell|first1=Sir James|title=Gell on Manx Church|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol31/gell.htm|website=Isle Of Man Online|publisher=IOM Online|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Jersey}}: the [[Church of England]] is the established church in [[Bailiwick of Jersey|Jersey]], and the leader of the church on the island is the [[Dean of Jersey]], a non-voting member of the [[States of Jersey]].

=====Calvinism=====
* {{flag|Tuvalu}}: The [[Church of Tuvalu]] is the state religion, although in practice this merely entitles it to "the privilege of performing special services on major national events".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf2d05cc.html|title=Refworld – 2010 Report on International Religious Freedom – Tuvalu|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Tuvalu]] guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to practice, the freedom to change religion, the right not to receive religious instruction at school or to attend religious ceremonies at school, and the right not to "take an oath or make an affirmation that is contrary to his religion or belief".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Tuvalu, article 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lutheranism=====
Jurisdictions where a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has been established as a state religion include the [[Nordic countries]] (as of 2012 Norway does not have a public religion&lt;ref name="snl.no"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/religion_i_Norge|title=religion i Norge|first1=Tarald|last1=Rasmussen|first2=Sindre|last2=Bangstad|first3=Knut A.|last3=Jacobsen|first4=Bente|last4=Groth|date=23 April 2018|publisher=|via=Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* {{flag|Denmark}}: section 4 of the [[Constitution of Denmark]] confirms the [[Church of Denmark]] as the "established" church.&lt;ref name=DenmarkConstitution&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html Denmark – Constitution]: Section 4 State Church, [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ International Constitutional Law].&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{flag|Faroe Islands}}: the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the state church of the [[Faroe Islands]], an [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] country within the [[Danish Realm]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
** {{flag|Greenland}}: the [[Church of Denmark]] is the state church of [[Greenland]], an [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] country within the [[Danish Realm]].
* {{flag|Finland}}: the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.&lt;ref name=FinlandConstitution&gt;[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland – Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the [[Parliament of Finland]]. The Church Act is protected by the [[Constitution of Finland]] and the state can not change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has a power to tax its members. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eroakirkosta.fi/media/english/status_of_the_finnish_state_church_in_2007.html#privileges |title=Status of the Finnish State Church in 2007&amp;nbsp;– Privileges of the State Church |date=7 October 2007 |publisher=eroakirkosta.fi |accessdate=2007-10-23 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of Finland]] also decides the themes for intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts. The [[Union of Freethinkers of Finland]] has criticized the official endorsement of the two churches by the Finnish state, and has campaigned for the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eroakirkosta.fi]] – [http://eroakirkosta.fi/media/taustatietoa/toiminta-ajatus.html Palvelun tavoite: Kirkko on erotettava valtiosta]&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Sweden}}: the [[Church of Sweden]] was until 2000 the official state church of Sweden, and Lutheranism was therefore the state religion of Sweden. In spite of the separation between the state and the church in 2000, the [[Church of Sweden]] still has a special status in Sweden. Sweden is therefore often seen as a midway between having a state religion and not.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The church has its own legal regulation in the 1998 Church of Sweden Act, which regulates the church's basic structure, creeds and right to tax members of the church. According to the Act, the Church of Sweden must be a democratic, Lutheran people's church. Only the Swedish [[Riksdag]] can change this fact. The connections to the [[Swedish royal family]] are complicated. For example, the Swedish constitution stipulates that the [[Monarch of Sweden]] must be a true Lutheran, accepting the doctrine of the Church of Sweden. All members of the [[royal house]] must accept the same doctrine to be able to inherit the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Throne of Sweden]]. The parishes of the Church of Sweden were the smallest administrative entities in Sweden and were used as civil registration and taxation units until 1 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.raa.se/2014/06/framtidens-folkbokforing-efter-distrikt-istallet-for-forsamling-2/ |title= Framtidens folkbokföring efter distrikt istället för församling|publisher=Swedish National Heritage Board |language= Swedish |author=Cecilia Olla |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate= 31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other/Mixed====
* {{flag|Armenia}}: [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] is not the state church of [[Armenia]] but has a special constitutional agreement with the state, with the constitution recognising "The Republic of Armenia shall recognise the exclusive mission of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church, as a national church, in the spiritual life of the Armenian people, in the development of their national culture and preservation of their national identity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.am/parliament.php?id=constitution&amp;lang=eng AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|France}}: The [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]] accords official status to four religions in this specific region of France: [[Judaism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]. The law is a remnant of the Napoleonic [[Concordat of 1801]], which was abrogated in the rest of France by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law of 1905]] on the [[separation of church and state]].  However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexed by Germany]]. The Concordat therefore remained in force in these areas, and it was not abrogated when France regained control of the region in 1918. Therefore, the separation of church and state, part of the French concept of [[Laïcité]], does not apply in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Church-state tie opens door for mosque

===Status of religion in Israel===
{{See also|Jewish state}}
[[Israel]] is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] that can describe the Jewish people [[Who is a Jew?|as either an ethnic or a religious group]]. The debate about the meaning of the term "Jewish" and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals. The problem of the status of religion in Israel, even though it is relevant to all religions, usually refers to the status of [[Judaism]] in Israeli society. Thus, even though from a constitutional point of view Judaism is not the state religion in Israel, its status nevertheless determines relations between religion and state and the extent to which religion influences the political center.&lt;ref&gt;''Trouble in Utopia: The Overburdened Polity of Israel'', by Dan Horowitz and Moshe Lissak, pp. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate—in turn derived from the pre-1917 Ottoman system of ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]''. These are: Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009: Israel and the occupied territories], U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]).

The structure and goals of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it is a state Rabbinate. However, outspoken Israeli secularists such as [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Uri Avnery]] have long maintained that it is that in practice. Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by them are not recognized as valid. As pointed out by Avnery and Aloni, the essential problem is that Israel carries on the top-down Ottoman ''millet'' system, under which the government reserves the complete discretion of recognizing some religions groups and not recognizing others. {{As of|2015}} [[marriage in Israel]] provides no provision for [[civil marriage]], marriage between people of different religions, marriages by people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or [[same-sex marriage]]s, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

===Political religions===
In some countries, there is a [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] sponsored by the government that may be called [[political religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gentile |first=Emilio |year=2006 |origyear=2001 |title=Le religioni della politica.

* {{Flag|North Korea}}: the North Korean government has promulgated ''[[Juche]]'' as a political alternative to traditional religion. The doctrine advocates a strong nationalist propaganda basis and is fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]], the two largest religions on the Korean peninsula. ''Juche'' theoreticians have, however, incorporated religious ideas into the state ideology. According to government figures, ''Juche'' is the largest political religion in [[North Korea]]. The public practice of all other religions is overseen and subject to heavy surveillance by the state.

===Additional notes===
* {{flag|Indonesia}} does not declare or designate a state religion. However, [[Government of Indonesia|the government]] only recognizes six religions: [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The [[Constitution of Indonesia]] guarantees freedom of religion and the practice of other religions and beliefs, including the [[Animism|animistic]] indigenous ones, is not prohibited by any laws. Indonesians practicing traditional polytheistic and animists as well as [[Sikhs]] and [[Jains]] are often counted as "Hindu" for government purposes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Atheism]], although not prosecuted, is discouraged by the state ideology of ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]''. In addition, the province of [[Aceh]] receives a special status and a higher degree of autonomy, in which it may enact laws (''[[Qanun (law)|qanuns]]'') based on the [[Sharia]] and enforce it, especially to its Muslim residents.
* {{flag|Singapore}} is officially a secular country and does not have a state religion, and has been named in one study as the "most religiously diverse nation in the world", with no religious group forming a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5617068/a-surprising-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-religiously-diverse|title=This map of the world's most religiously diverse countries may surprise you|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That said the government gives official recognition to ten different religions, namely [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Jainism]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iro.sg/|title=Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore (IRO)|website=iro.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Singapore's penal code explicitly prohibits "wounding religious feelings".

== Former state religions ==

===Pre-modern era===

====Egypt and Sumer====
{{see also|History of religion}}
The concept of state religions was known as long ago as the empires of Egypt and [[Sumer]], when every city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological kings may have passed into the pantheon, like [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], and some later kings came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign was [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], followed by some later kings of [[Ur]], such as [[Shulgi]]. Often, the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government, such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the god Horus.

====Sassanid Empire====
[[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent state of [[Hyrcania]] until the 15th century.

The tiny kingdom of [[Adiabene]] in [[northern Mesopotamia]] converted to [[Judaism]] around 34&amp;nbsp;CE.

====Greek city-states====
Many of the Greek city-states also had a god or goddess associated with that city. This would not be its only god or goddess, but the one that received special honors. In ancient Greece, the city of Athens had [[Athena]], [[Sparta]] had [[Ares]], [[Delphi]] had [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] had [[Zeus]], [[Corinth]] had [[Poseidon]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] had [[Demeter]].

====Roman religion and Christianity====
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was often [[Apotheosis|declared a god]] posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire, because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor.

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''[[Augustus (title)|Augusti]]'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].

[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman Religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed [[heresy|heretical]], was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on 27 February 380&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=The Latin Library at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the decree ''[[Edict of Thessalonica|De fide catolica]]'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Han dynasty Confucianism====
In China, the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of government in 1911.  Note however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confucian Religiosity: A Partial Bibliography  |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Confucian%20religiosity%20bib.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yuan dynasty Buddhism====
During the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368 CE), [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was established as the ''de facto'' state religion by the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]], the founder of the Yuan dynasty. The top-level department and government agency known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in [[Khanbaliq]] (modern [[Beijing]]) to supervise [[Buddhist monk]]s throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the [[Sakya]] sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leader of the Sakya sect had held the post of [[Imperial Preceptor]] (Dishi), thereby enjoy special power.&lt;ref&gt;''History of civilizations of Central Asia.: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century''. Part two: The achievements, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden Horde and Ilkhanate====
[[Shamanism]] and [[Buddhism]] were once the dominant religions among the ruling class of the Mongol khanates of [[Golden Horde]] and [[Ilkhanate]], the two western khanates of the [[Mongol Empire]]. In the early days, the rulers of both khanates increasingly adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], similar to the Yuan dynasty at that time. However, the Mongol rulers [[Ghazan]] of Ilkhanate and [[Öz Beg Khan|Uzbeg]] of Golden Horde converted to [[Islam]] in 1295 CE because of the Muslim Mongol emir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]] and in 1313 CE because of [[Sufi]] [[Bukhara]]n [[sayyid]] and [[sheikh]] [[Ibn Abdul Hamid]] respectively. Their official favoring of Islam as the state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. In Ilkhanate, [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] subjects lost their equal status with Muslims and again had to pay the poll tax; [[Buddhists]] had the starker choice of conversion or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Persia 1040–1797'', [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In Golden Horde, Buddhism and Shamanism among the Mongols were proscribed, and by 1315, Uzbeg had successfully Islamicized the Horde, killing Jochid princes and Buddhist [[lama]]s who opposed his religious policy and succession of the throne.

====Former state churches in British North America====

=====Protestant colonies=====
* The colonies of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by [[Puritan]] Calvinist Protestants, and had [[Congregational church|Congregational]] established churches.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] maintained the [[Church of England]] as the established church.
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Roman Catholicism. Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions, low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary [[Glorious Revolution|came to the English throne]], they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701, the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the 18th century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.

=====Catholic colonies=====
* When [[New France]] was transferred to Great Britain in 1763, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by Parisian authorities.
* When [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to Great Britain in 1763, the British divided Florida into two colonies, East and West Florida, which both continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic residents.

=====Colonies with no established church=====
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* The [[Province of New Jersey]], without official religion, had a significant [[Quaker]] lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.
* [[Delaware Colony]] had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home.  The [[Rhode Island Royal Charter|King Charles Charter]] of 1663 guaranteed "full liberty in religious concernments".

====Non-British colonies====
These areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were tolerated by the English and later British colonial governments, as [[Foreign Protestants]], whose communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British Isles immigrants.
* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* [[New Sweden]] was founded by [[Church of Sweden]] Lutherans.

====State of Deseret====
The [[State of Deseret]] was a provisional [[U.S. state|state]] of the United States, proposed in 1849, by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government foundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns over the principle of separation of church and state conflicting with the practice of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] of placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on 4 January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] [[Edward Leo Lyman]], ''Utah History Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[República Velha|new Republican government]] passed, in 1890, Decree 119-A {{cite web|title=Decreto 119-A|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/1851-1899/d119-a.htm|quote=Prohibits federal and state authorities to intervene on religion, granting freedom of religion.}} (still in force), instituting the separation of church and state for the first time in Brazilian law. [[Positivist]] thinker [[Demétrio Nunes Ribeiro]] urged the new government to adopt this stance. The 1891 Constitution, the first under the Republican system of government, abolished privileges for any specific religion, reaffirming the separation of church and state. This has been the case ever since the 1988 [[Constitution of Brazil]], currently in force, does so in its Nineteenth Article.

Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]—especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator, but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The constitutions of eight states ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/StateConstitutions.htm |title=State Constitutions that Discriminate Against Atheists |publisher=www.godlessgeeks.com |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm

Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in [[no religious test clause|Article 6 Section 3]] of the United States Constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19475">The "'''Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs'''" was a speech delivered on November 25, 1969, by U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. In the speech, Nixon announced the end of the [[United States biological weapons program|U.S. offensive biological weapons]] program and reaffirmed a [[No first use|no-first-use]] policy for [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]]. The statement excluded [[toxin]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[riot-control agent]]s as they were not chemical and biological weapons, though herbicides and toxins were both later banned. The decision to ban [[Biological warfare|biological weapons]] was influenced by a number of domestic and international issues.

==Push for a U.S. ban==
[[File:Melvin Laird official photo.JPEG|thumb|right|[[Melvin Laird]] played a key role in the build-up to a U.S. ban on biological weapons]]
When Richard Nixon selected [[Melvin Laird]] as his [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in early 1969, Laird directed the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. biological warfare (BW) programs.&lt;ref name=mangold&gt;Mangold, Tom. ''Plague Wars: The Terrifying Reality of Biological Warfare''. Macmillan, 1999, pp. 54-57, ({{ISBN|0-312-20353-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Laird's push for a review of both the chemical and biological programs arose when Congress attempted to push the Pentagon for open, joint Congressional hearings on chemical-biological warfare (CBW).&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; The Pentagon balked and the result was Laird's memo to [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] urging a review of those weapons programs.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;

Laird hoped to eliminate the U.S. BW program.&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt; He saw two reasons to kill the BW program. The first was political&amp;mdash;eliminating the program could deflect growing [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|protests over Vietnam]]. The second was budgetary: As a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], Laird had watched Pentagon BW budgets balloon during the Kennedy and Johnson years.&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt; With Laird's impetus, and the concurrence of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff, in late May 1969 Kissinger directed key administration officials to begin a review of CBW "policies, programs and operational concepts" with a report to be issued no later than September.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;

Surprisingly, Laird found the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] receptive to BW elimination as well. In twice weekly meetings with the Joint Chiefs during 1969 Laird found none of the officers opposed to ending the U.S. BW program.&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt; They found the weapons ineffective and militarily useless, especially when compared to the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt; The Joint Chiefs made two demands, one was to continue defensive germ warfare research and the other was that they be allowed to maintain the U.S. chemical arsenal as a deterrent to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt;

In June 1969 Kissinger asked a former [[Harvard University|Harvard]] colleague, [[Matthew Meselson]] to prepare a [[position paper]] on U.S. chemical and biological weapons programs.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; Meselson and [[Paul M. Doty|Paul Doty]] then organized a private conference to discuss policy issues. The result was a September 1969 paper that not only urged U.S. ratification of the [[Geneva Protocol]] but an end to U.S. BW programs.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; Meselson and his colleagues argued that a biological attack would likely inflict a great toll on civilian populations while remaining largely militarily ineffective.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

Executive action on BW was followed by congressional action on chemical warfare (CW). In August 1969 the [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed an amendment to the Military Procurement Bill which unilaterally renounced first-use of chemical weapons.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; The Senate action also issued a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the acquisition of new chemical weapons as well as de-emphasizing the need for CW readiness.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; The bill passed 91-0, although some senators expressed reservations about the CW provisions.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt;

==Statement==
[[File:1 million liter sphere Fort Detrick.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon delivered his statement from [[Fort Detrick]], home of the [[One-Million-Liter Test Sphere]], used for testing static aerosols of biological agent, pictured here in 1968]]
Nixon issued his "Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs" on November 25, 1969 in a speech from [[Fort Detrick]].&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; The same day he gave a speech from the [[Roosevelt Room]] at the [[White House]] further outlining his earlier statement.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;&lt;ref name=remarks&gt;[[Richard Nixon|Nixon, Richard]]. "[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=2344 Remarks Announcing Decisions on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs]", via The American Presidency Project, November 25, 1969, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ended, unconditionally, all U.S. offensive biological weapons programs.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt; Nixon noted that biological weapons were unreliable&lt;ref name=graham&gt;Graham, Thomas. ''Disarmament Sketches: Three Decades of Arms Control and International Law'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=SNxp-gqDb1EC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), University of Washington Press, 2002, pp. 26-30, ({{ISBN|0-295-98212-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and stated:&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, pp. 61-64.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The United States shall renounce the use of lethal biological agents and weapons, and all other methods of biological warfare. The United States will confine its biological research to defensive measures such as immunization and safety measures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his speech Nixon called his move "unprecedented"; and it was in fact the first review of the U.S. BW program since 1954.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; Despite the lack of review, the BW program had increased in cost and size since 1961; when Nixon ended the program the budget was $300 million annually.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;&lt;ref name=cirincione&gt;[[Joseph Cirincione|Cirincione, Joseph]], et al. ''Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Threats'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=7F-nbw6q8S4C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), [[Carnegie Endowment]], 2005, p. 212, ({{ISBN|0-87003-216-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nixon's statement confined all biological weapons research to defensive-only and ordered the destruction of the existing [[List of U.S. biological weapons topics|U.S. biological arsenal]].&lt;ref name=mauroni&gt;Mauroni, Albert J. ''America's Struggle with Chemical-Biological Weapons'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TiSL-7ghCWwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA49,M1 Google Books]), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p. 49-60, ({{ISBN|0-275-96756-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nixon statement also addressed the topics of chemical warfare and U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol,&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; which, at the time, the nation had yet to ratify.&lt;ref name=quester/&gt; On chemical warfare Nixon reaffirmed [[no-first-use]] of [[List of U.S. chemical weapons topics|chemical weapons by the United States]].&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; He also announced that the United States would reconsider ratification of the Geneva Protocol,&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; which Nixon recommended to the Senate that year.&lt;ref name=quester&gt;Quester, George H. ''Before and After the Cold War: Using Past Forecasts to Predict the Future'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Qy1OCk7x3SEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA161,M1 Google Books]), Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002, p. 161, ({{ISBN|0-7146-8213-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omissions==
The presidential statement purposely omitted certain agents, while others were simply overlooked. In an exception to the [[no-first-use]] policy, which his statement reaffirmed, Nixon made a deference for [[riot-control agent]]s and [[herbicide]]s.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; Both were in use in Vietnam and both had been lightning rods for criticism.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;&lt;ref name=mauroni2&gt;Mauroni, Al. "[http://www.armyhistory.org/armyhistorical.aspx?pgID=868&amp;id=133&amp;exCompID=32 The US Army Chemical Corps: Past, Present, and Future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727160735/http://www.armyhistory.org/armyhistorical.aspx?pgID=868 |date=2007-07-27 }}", ''Army Historical Foundation''. Retrieved December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon promised later memorandums concerning abolition of both types of agents; herbicide use in Vietnam was discontinued in 1970 but riot-control agent use continued.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;

The other major omission from Nixon's statement were [[toxin]]s. His statement did not specifically address toxins, such as [[ricin]], which tend to blur the line between chemical and biological weapons.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; As debate within the Army raged over whether toxins were considered chemical or biological weapons concerning the president's order, work on them continued at [[Fort Detrick]],&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; the "hub" of U.S. biological weapons programs.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; For several months following the November order, the Army continued working on [[Staphylococcus|staphylococcus enterotoxin type B]] (SEB).&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; On February 20, 1970 Nixon added toxins, regardless of their means of production - be it chemical or biological, to the U.S. ban on biological weapons.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;

==Results and legacy==
[[File:Stem rust close up.jpg|thumb|right|Stockpiled [[wheat stem rust]] (''pictured'') and other anti-crop agents were destroyed in 1973 as a result of Nixon's statement]]
The statement immediately led to National Security Decision Memorandum 35 from Nixon, which was also dated November 25, 1969.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; The memorandum also stated that the U.S. government renounced all "lethal methods" and "all other methods" of biological warfare, it also stated that the U.S. would only conduct BW research and development for defensive purposes.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt;

U.S. biological weapons stocks were destroyed over the next few years. A $12 million disposal plan was undertaken at [[Pine Bluff Arsenal]],&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt; where all U.S. anti-personnel [[biological agent]]s were stored.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; That plan was completed in May 1972 and included decontamination of facilities at Pine Bluff.&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt;&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; Other agents, including anti-crop agents such as [[wheat stem rust]], were stored at [[Beale Air Force Base]] and [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; These anti-crop agents, along with agents at Fort Detrick used for research purposes were destroyed in March 1973.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt;

Nixon closed his statement, "Mankind already carries in its own hands too many of the seeds of its own destruction. By the examples we set today, we hope to contribute to an atmosphere of peace and understanding between nations and among men."&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; Shortly after Nixon's statement the United States and the Soviet Union began the [[SALT]] arms control talks, which eventually resulted in [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear arms control]]s as well as the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty]].&lt;ref name=guillemin&gt;Guillemin, pp. 122-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. commitment to end BW programs helped provide the lead for ongoing talks led by the United Kingdom in Geneva.&lt;ref name=carter/&gt; The [[Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee]] was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved in 1968 and that [[NATO]] supported.&lt;ref name=guillemin/&gt; These arms control talks would eventually lead to the Biological Weapons Convention, an international treaty outlawing biological warfare.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carter, April, ([[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]). ''Success and Failure in Arms Control Negotiations'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3vLPuAV4lcC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=nixon+ban+biological+weapons&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 298, ({{ISBN|0-19-829128-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's renunciation is often overlooked in discussions about his presidency and his presidential legacy. Books about Nixon devote little space to the act and those centered on the topic of arms-control, even less.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; The abandonment of an entire class of weapons remains unrepeated in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; In addition, Melvin Laird's role in the elimination of offensive U.S. biological capabilities has been largely overlooked.&lt;ref name=mangold/&gt;

==Nixon's motivation==
Scholars and critics have argued that Nixon's decision to ban biological weapons was purely politically motivated.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; This move was seen as a way to placate national, Congressional, and international concerns.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; It was also seen as a way to progress arms-control talks, additionally it could have stymied the outcry over the use of non-lethal chemical agents in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; In reality, the issue was much more complex than even those reasons suggest.&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbsbook/&gt;

Meselson and others had argued that biological weapons amounted to little more than a cheap version of a nuclear weapon, and were easily attainable.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; Biological weapons represented a significant threat in the hands of less-well-armed, poorer nations, and Nixon surely recognized this "asymmetrical" threat.&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt; The administration eventually came to the conclusion that any biological threat could be easily countered with the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt; 
[[File:A0112shee.jpg|thumb|left|Dead sheep resulting from the [[Skull Valley sheep kill]]]]
Nixon recognized that the BW program was unpopular and decided that there was no real reason to continue these programs.&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt; While there were some political considerations involved in Nixon's decision, the end result brought the topic into international forums for years following his declaration.&lt;ref name=croddy&gt;Croddy, Eric at al. ''Chemical and Biological Warfare: A Comprehensive Survey for the Concerned Citizen'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=MQMGhInCvlgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), Springer, 2002, p. 238, ({{ISBN|0-387-95076-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The media characterized Nixon's decision as a sudden awareness of the horrific nature of chemical-biological warfare.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt;

Nixon hoped that the move would bolster both the image of his administration and the United States as a whole.&lt;ref name=croddy2&gt;Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. ''Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 45, ({{ISBN|1-85109-490-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wanted to score points with the Democratic majority in Congress and he had chosen to do this through various [[arms control]] measures.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; Nixon knew Democrats could not afford to oppose his renunciation of BW programs in light of rising opposition to the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam and other events such as the [[Skull Valley sheep kill]] in Utah.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; Thus, the idealistic language Nixon used in his November statement was only part of the story. Besides the issue of proliferation raised by Meselson, the specter of growing dissent over Vietnam loomed large, as did the fact that the U.S. had never ratified the Geneva Protocol.&lt;ref name=pbsbook&gt;Schram, Martin. ''Avoiding Armageddon: Our Future, Our Choice: Companion to the PBS Series from Ted Turner Documentaries'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=oZGCG0luy4IC&amp;pg=PA178-IA2&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), Basic Books, 2003, p. 178, ({{ISBN|0-465-07255-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Nixon was motivated to ban biological weapons in the United States by a host of issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4866">Several times in [[History of Japan|Japanese history]], the new ruler sought to ensure his position by calling a '''{{nihongo|sword hunt|刀狩|katanagari}}'''. Armies would scour the entire country, confiscating the [[weapon]]s{{efn|By 1553, there were more [[firearm]]s per capita in Japan than in any other country.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;''[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond_rich/rich_p5.html How to Get Rich]: A Talk by [[Jared Diamond]]'' [6.7.99]&lt;/ref&gt; Since they required much less training than [[longbow]]s, they were essential to the [[Edo period|unification of Japan]] under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. For the same reasons of the sword hunts, later shoguns discouraged the production of guns.}} of the enemies of the new regime. In this manner, the new ruler sought to ensure that no one could take the country by force as he had just done. The most famous sword hunt was ordered by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in 1588.

==Sword hunts in the Sengoku period==
Prior to the sword hunt called by [[Oda Nobunaga]] towards the end of the 16th century, civilians were free to carry swords for defense or simply for decoration. Nobunaga sought an end to this, and ordered the seizure of swords and a variety of other weapons from civilians, in particular the [[Ikkō-ikki]] peasant-monk leagues which sought to overthrow ''samurai'' rule. 

In 1588, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], having become [[Sesshō and Kampaku|kampaku]] or "imperial regent", ordered a new sword hunt; Hideyoshi, like Nobunaga, sought to solidify separations in the class structure, denying commoners weapons while allowing them to the [[nobility]], the [[samurai]] class. In addition, Toyotomi's sword hunt, like Nobunaga's, was intended to prevent peasant uprisings and to deny weapons to his adversaries. This hunt may have been inspired by a peasant uprising in Higo the year prior, but also served to disarm the [[sōhei]] of [[Mount Kōya]] and [[Tōnomine]]. Toyotomi claimed that the confiscated weapons would be melted down and used to create a giant image of the [[Budai|Buddha]] for the [[Asuka-dera]] monastery in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]].

"Taikō's Sword Hunt", as it came to be called, was accompanied by a number of other edicts, including the Expulsion Edict of 1590, by which Toyotomi sought to establish a census and expel from villages any newcomers who arrived in or after 1590. The chief goal of this was to place a check on the threat posed by [[rōnin]], masterless wandering samurai who had the potential not only for crime and violence in general, but for banding together to overthrow Toyotomi rule. Hideyoshi, like most of this period, believed in rule by edict, paying little or no attention to legal principles.

While the Sword Hunt ostensibly succeeded in denying weapons to potential rebels, it also created discontent throughout the nation, increasing the number and passion of potential rebels.

==Sword ban in the Meiji Restoration==
The [[Meiji Restoration]] of the 1860s was the beginning of a period of major modernization and [[Westernization]]. In 1871, extensive reforms were passed and executed, [[Abolition of the han system|abolishing the ''han'' system]], and thus ending feudalism and the class system.

In 1876, ''samurai'' were banned from carrying swords. A standing army was created, as was a police force. This "sword hunt" was performed for, ostensibly, different reasons, and certainly with different methods than those of several centuries earlier. This sword hunt put an end to the class system while the earlier ones were intended to deepen the distinctions between commoners and nobles. Ultimately, however, the result of this sword hunt was the same as the results of its predecessors; the hunt ensured that the only weapons were in the hands of the ruling government and not available to potential dissenters.

Today, Japan has a [[Overview of gun laws by nation#Japan|Sword and Firearms Law]] which, much like gun control laws around the world, governs the possession and use of weapons in public. The purchase and ownership of certain swords within Japan is legal if they are properly registered, though the import and export of such items is tightly controlled, particularly in the case of items that might be labeled as national or cultural artifacts. Swords that are not produced by licensed smiths (including all machine-made swords) are prohibited for individuals. Japanese military swords are legal in Japan if they were made with traditional materials and methods.

'''The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army''' (TQILA) is a [[Queer anarchism|queer anarchist]] armed group and subunit of the [[International Revolutionary People's Guerrilla Forces]] formed on 24 July 2017 by [[LGBT]] members of the IRPGF. Its formation was announced from [[Raqqa|Raqqa City]] along with a statement explaining the purposes of its formation; [[Persecution of gay and bisexual men by ISIL|the systematic persecution of LGBT people by the Daesh]] was highlighted as a significant motivation for the creation of the group. TQILA is reported to be the first LGBT unit to fight against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and apparently the first LGBT militia in the Middle East.

== Formation ==
The testimonial image of its formation, in which fighters posed alongside a sign with the motto ''"These faggots kill fascists"'' and two flags — the flag of the group and an [[LGBT flag]] — went viral. Western media reported on the unit extensively.{{refn|group="note"|For example, ''[[HuffPost]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esteban|first1=Nacho|title=TQILA, un mal trago para la homofobia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.es/nacho-esteban/tqila-un-mal-trago-para-la-homofobia_a_23045767/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[HuffPost]]|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Matt|title=Armed militia of gay men named The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army are fighting homophobic Isis in Syria|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4097885/armed-militia-of-gay-men-named-the-queer-insurrection-and-liberation-army-are-fighting-homophobic-isis-in-syria/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Jack|title=First LGBT Unit 'Created to Fight ISIS' in Syria|url=http://www.newsweek.com/first-lgbt-unit-created-fight-isis-syria-its-name-queer-insurrection-641148|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[Newsweek]]|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the LGBT anarchists who've gone to Syria to fight Isis|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/lgbt-syria-isis-fight-rights-anarchists-queer-insurrection-islamic-state-a7859756.html|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[The Independent]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[New York Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lapin|first1=Tamar|title=LGBT soldiers are going after ISIS in Syria|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/25/lgbt-soldiers-are-going-after-isis-in-syria/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[New York Post]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euronews]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LGBT army unit established to take on ISIL|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/07/26/lgbt-army-unit-established-to-take-on-isil|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[Euronews]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[El Confidencial]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borja|first1=Rodrigo|title=La milicia LGTB que desafía al ISIS en Siria: "Estos maricas asesinan fascistas"|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2017-07-27/milicia-lgbt-siria-maricas-asesinan-fascistas_1421347/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[El Confidencial]]|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.}}

The unit, like the rest of the IRPGF, is a member of the [[International Freedom Battalion]]. One of the group's testimonial photos is features ''Heval Mahir'',{{refn|group="note"|Apparent [[nom de guerre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Twitter de las IRPGF|date=25 July 2017|url=https://twitter.com/IRPGF/status/889815807907303425|accessdate=28 July 2017|language= |quote=TİKKO guerrilla &amp; new IFB commander Heval Mahir is a dear friend of the IRPGF and supporter of Queer liberation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} commander of the International Freedom Battalion, and the [[marxist-leninist|Marxist-Leninist]] guerrilla groups, [[Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist–Leninist|TKP/ML TİKKO]], holding the LGBT flag.

Despite being part of the International Freedom Battalion some news outlets erroneously reported that TQILA was an official unit of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] which caused confusion. In response, Mustafa Bali, media director of the SDF, denied these claims. He stated that there is no LGBT brigade within the coalition. However, he did not deny the existence of an LGBT brigade within the International Freedom Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LGBT unit not officially part of SDF, says Kurdish official|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/lgbt-unit-not-officially-part-sdf-says-kurdish-official-1358340404|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=Middle East Eye|date=26 July 2017|language= |quote=TQILA, which announced on Twitter its acronym name is pronounced "tequila", is a part of the IRPGF, an anarchist unit and a sub-group of the International Freedom Battalion of foreign fighters formed to assist the SDF.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General]] [[Medals of Myanmar|Thura]] '''Tin Oo''' ({{lang-my|တင်ဦး}}, {{IPA-my|tɪ̀ɴ ʔú|IPA}}; born 3 March 1927 in [[Pathein]], often referred to as '''U Tin Oo''') is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] politician, activist and retired general in the [[Tatmadaw|armed forces of Union of Myanmar]] who is currently the Patron of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) in [[Myanmar]].

== Military career==
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;DSHMRI Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
Tin Oo joined the [[Tatmadaw|army]] on 26 February 1946 as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in [[Burma Rifles]] [[Battalion]].  He reached the ranks of [[Lieutenant]] on 7 January 1947, [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] on 27 September 1948 and served as executive officer at Armed Forces Training Headquarters.  On 22 June 1949, he was transferred to No.1 Burma Rifles Battalion as [[Company Commander]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[Major]] on 25 January 1950 and became Deputy [[Battalion Commander]] (2IC) of No.1 Burma Rifles Battalion and took over the position of acting [[Battalion Commander]] on 27 November 1951.

Tin Oo was promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] on 21 January 1954 and became Commander of 4th [[Infantry]] [[Brigade]] on 30 May 1957.  He was then transferred to Army Officer Training School as [[Commandant]] on 13 September 1957.  Throughout 1958 and 1961, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Tin Oo served as Battalion Commander for  No. 14 [[Infantry]] [[Battalion]] (from 18 November 1958), No. 2 Burma Rifle Battalion (from 16 February 1961) and after his promotion as [[Colonel]], he became acting Commander for No. 13 [[Infantry]] [[Brigade]] (from 20 February 1961).

He was then given the command of South West Regional Military Command and promoted to the rank of [[Colonel]] on 14 February 1963.  On 19 September 1964 he became Commander of Central Regional Military Command.  He was then promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] and became Deputy Chief of Staff ([[Tatmadaw|Army]]) on 20 April 1972.  On 8 March 1974 he was promoted to the rank of [[General]] and became [[Commander in Chief]] of Tatmadaw.  He was armed forces Commander in Chief during the bloody crackdown on student protests surrounding the funeral of former UN Secretary General U Thant.

During his military career, [[General]] Tin Oo was awarded with [[Medals of Myanmar|Thuya]] medal, prestigious award for gallantry and bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of [[Myanmar Armed Forces]]. He led both tactical and strategic campaigns against the Karen National Union as well as the Communist Party of Burma and various ethnic armed groups, especially in the north and east of the country.

== Forced retirement, accusations and imprisonment ==
On 6 March 1976, As per Order no. 26/76 issued by the Council of State, Tin Oo was forced to retired from his position as [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Tatmadaw|Armed Forces of Burma]].  According to the official explanation released by the then ruling party, [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]], General Tin Oo was forced to retire because Dr. Daw Tin Moe Wai, his wife, broke the rules and regulations laid down for the spouses of commanding officers of the Tatmadaw by accepting numerous bribes, thus affecting General Tin Oo's position as [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].

After his forced retirement, he was accused of high treasons against the armed forces ([[Tatmadaw]]), the party (BSPP) and the state.  He was subsequently arrested and tried for the alleged withholding of information concerning a failed coup-d'état against General [[Ne Win]] and the Council of State.  On 11 January 1977, Judge U Ohn Maung, Chairman of Divisional Justice Committee for [[Yangon]] Division sentenced him to 7 years hard labour and imprisonment according to Crime Against State and High Treasons Act 124.  Tin Oo's subsequent appeal for this judgement on 20 August 1977 was summarily dismissed by Judge Soe Hlaing, of Council of People Justice, the equivalent of the Supreme Court, and upheld the judgement handed out by Yangon Division Justice Committee. [[Colonel]] Hla Pe, commander of Northern Regional Command, [[Colonel]] Maung Maung, Colonel General Staff and [[Colonel]] Myo Aung, commandant of the National Defence College were also dismissed and the former two were imprisoned along with [[General]] Tin Oo.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Political career ==
He was released under general amnesty in 1980, after which he studied and received a degree in Law. On 2 September 1988, he became the Vice President of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) and on 20 December, the President of NLD. From 20 July 1989 he was put under house arrest and from 22 December 1989, he was imprisoned for three years.

On 30 May 2003, Tin Oo, travelling with the caravan of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], leader of the NLD, was attacked in the northern village of [[Depayin massacre|Depayin]] by a government-sponsored mob, murdering and wounding many of his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=2007-02-04 |date=2005-05-30 |format=PDF |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614185341/http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin Oo was taken into detention along with Aung San Suu Kyi and was initially held in prison in [[Kalay]] in northwestern Myanmar. In February 2004 he was brought back to his home in Yangon, where he is actually held under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/feb/15/yehey/world/20060215wor4.html |title=Myanmar extends Suu Kyi’s detention |accessdate=2007-02-14 |date=2006-02-15 |publisher=AFP/The Manila Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021092057/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/feb/15/yehey/world/20060215wor4.html |archivedate=October 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The junta extended his detention by one year in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=6687&amp;z=163 Irrawaddy.org]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008, and 2009. The last of these extensions was in violation of the rule of Burmese law, but no explanation was given by the junta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/myanmar-extends-tin-oos-house-arrest-by-another-year_100154898.html Thaiindian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from House Arrest on February 13, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8514159.stm|title=Burma frees NLD leader Tin Oo|date=February 13, 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Troubled Families''' programme is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government scheme under the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] with the stated aim of helping troubled families turn their lives around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-troubled-families-turn-their-lives-around|title=Helping troubled families turn their lives around|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The Troubled Families programme was launched by the [[Prime Minister]] in 2011. [[Louise Casey]] became Director General, Troubled Families on 1 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/louise-casey |title=Louise Casey CB |publisher=Gov.uk |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme initially intends to change the repeating generational patterns of poor parenting, abuse, violence, drug use, anti-social behaviour and crime in the most troubled families in the UK, with the government investing some £4,000 per family over 3 years, and each family having an assigned family worker.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6151/2183663.pdf |title=Listening to Troubled Families: A report by Louise Casey CB, Department for Communities and Local Government, Department for Communities and Local Government |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Troubled families are defined as those that have problems and cause problems to the community around them, putting high costs on the public sector. The aim is to get 120,000 troubled families in [[England]] turn their lives around by 2015 and in particular to:

* get children back into school
* reduce youth crime and anti-social behaviour
* put adults on a path back to work
* reduce the high costs these families place on the public sector each year

Mental health problems are often found in such families.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; David Cameron summarised the nature of the families in his Oldbury speech (New Statesman, 15.12.11) 
saying

'...these families are the source of a large proportion of the problems in society. Drug addiction. Alcohol abuse. Crime. A culture of disruption and irresponsibility that cascades down the generations... a small number of these families cost an extraordinary amount of money. Last year £9 billion was spent on 120,000 families'.

Although the TFP was supposedly aimed at intensive support the political rhetoric was often pejorative.Louise Casey, the 'Troubled Families Tsar' told the Daily Telegraph (20.07.12)

'We are not running some cuddly social workers programme...we should be talking about things like shame and guilt...we have lost the ability to be judgmental because we worry about being seen as nasty to poor people'.

Eric Pickles, communities minister, told the Daily Mail (10.06.12)

'We have sometimes run away from categorising, stigmatising, laying blame. We need a less understanding approach'.

However most of the people targeted were not involved in crime or anti-social behaviour; most were not alcohol or drug dependent.Most were poor,unemployed and with very high levels of 
mental / physical illnesses and disabilities in adults and children which resulted in high state support costs (see characteristics section). It is unclear how assertive, non-negotiable intervention and benefit sanctions can eliminate these costs.The evidence for long term success in 'turning around the families' is absent and on 12.06.14 Casey told a meeting at Reform

'As hard as it is to accept,the truth is despite our best efforts over many years -and I include myself in that-we just haven't got it right. We haven't succeeded in getting these families to change or in stopping the transmission of problems from generation to generation-we just haven't.
 
Many areas of England and Wales have renamed their local Troubled Families programmes, including Families First in Gloucestershire and Wales, Building Resilient Families and Communities (BRFC) in Staffordshire, and Think Family in Birmingham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/extra/familiesfirst|title=Gloucestershire County Council &amp;#124;Families First|publisher=Gloucestershire.gov.uk|accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/childrenyoungpeople/parenting/help/familiesfirst/?lang=en|title=Welsh Government&amp;#124;Families First|publisher=Wales.gov.uk|accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
The family-intervention approach used by the programme has been criticised by Stephen Crossley and Michael Lambert, who say that the evidence suggests that the approach does not work well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-trouble-with-the-troubled-families-programme-repeating-the-failed-attempts-of-the-past/ The trouble with the Troubled Families Programme – repeating the failed attempts of the past], Stephen Crossley &amp; Michael Lambert, London School of Economics, 18 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Troubled families, according to anecdotal evidence collected by Casey from family interviews, are characterized by inter-generational transmission, large numbers of children, shifting family make-up, dysfunctional relationships and unhelpful family and friends, abuse, institutional care, teenage mothers, early signs of poor behaviour, troubles at school, anti-social behaviour, mental illness (particularly depression, impeding ability to function in life), and drugs &amp; alcohol use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The definitive report, 'National Evaluation of the Troubled Families Programme' found that 49% of those in the program were lone parent families. Underage pregnancy was statistically insignificant, with the under-18 conception rate at 2%. 90% of adults had not been convicted of a criminal offence and 93% of adults had no record of anti-social behaviour. Among children, 88% of children had no record of anti-social behaviour. 3% of adults were recorded as treated for alcohol dependency and a further 3% of adults for drug dependency. The families were reported to suffer from high levels of health problems and disabilities. 46% had an adult or adults suffering a mental health problem; 33% of children had mental health problems. 32% of adults and 20% of children had a long-standing physical illness or disability; 39% had a child or children with SEN statements; 46% had a child with school problems; 15% had a child with a temporary exclusion. The families were also poor and in social housing: 74% of households were workless; 83% received out of work benefits; 27% were in rent arrears; 21% were at risk of eviction. The statistical characteristics shared by most families were poverty, unemployment, illness and disability and a high welfare cost to the state.

==Progress==
===November 2013===
By November 2013 some 22,000 families had been 'turned round', based on metrics such as child school attendance and crimes committed,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Department for Communities and Local Government |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/troubled-families-programme-on-track-at-half-way-stage |title=Troubled Families programme on track at half way stage - Press releases |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick Wintour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/25/problem-families-department-for-communities |title=Eric Pickles hails progress in tackling 'troubled families' &amp;#124; Society |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at least some of these families continue to commit some crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Doughty |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2513577/450m-scheme-problem-families-turn-lives-helps-just-1-500-parents-work.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490 |title=£450m scheme for problem families to turn their lives around helps just 1,500 parents find work &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casey does not believe people undertake behaviours to gain benefits, and that compulsory contraception, whilst reducing the number of children being born into such families, would lead to high-risk teens finding "something else to get into trouble with. Because they've got trouble in their souls, trouble in their heart, troubles in their head. So even if you brought in some draconian thing like that, they'd find something else to do that would actually be an expression of not having enough love or of having too much pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Decca Aitkenhead |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/29/troubled-families-louise-casey-whats-missing-love |title=Troubled Families head Louise Casey: 'What's missing is love' &amp;#124; Society |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; But consider also Casey's and Pickles' comments in the introduction.

===March 2015===
By March 2015 the Dept. for Communities and Local Government was claiming that 105,671 families of 117,910 processed had been 'turned around', some 89.6%. 8.9% of families had a member who had found a job. It could not be proved that the projects had achieved this. 80.7% had met the 'crime/ASB/education' target. However, only 7% of adults and 12% of children at project entry had an anti-social behaviour intervention.Only 10% of adults at entry had a proved offence (National Evaluation of the TFP, 2014). It must be concluded that most of the 80.7% families
'turned around' involved reduced truancy, not crime or ASB. According to the Dept. for Communities claims, each family cost the state £26,000 per annum at entry to the programme. The estimated average cost saving at exit was claimed to be £11,200 per family. This implies that although 89.6% of families had been 'turned around', 56.9% of the original family costs were still there (Troubled Families, Green Man Books,2015, {{ISBN|978-1514170588}}).

The 120,000 troubled families allegedly cost the state £9 billion per annum according to Cameron, Pickles and Casey at programme start up.However, Pickles told the House of Commons on 15.03.15 that £1.2 billion per annum would be saved. This was a hypothetical number based on assumptions that alleged improvements in behaviour would be sustained and depended on removing the high costs associated with disabled children and chronically sick, unemployed adults (Troubled Families, Green Man Books,2015,{{ISBN|978-1514170588}}). Pickles was challenged about the numbers in the House by Hilary Benn MP. Pickles responded

'The Rt. Hon. gentleman made a number of points on how we can demonstrate success and square the £1.2 billion with the £9 billion...this is notoriously difficult because governments of all types are absolutely terrible at measuring outcomes'

===May 2015===
DCLG published that 99% of the troubled families had been turned around by May 2015, with 132 of the 152 local authorities having turned around 100% of local troubled families and only two having a success rate under 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7585/CBP-7585.pdf The Troubled Families Programme (England)], House of Commons Library, 21 December 2016, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Louise Casey had stated to the Public Accounts Committee that the programme had worked with more than the stated total number of troubled families in England, which would increase the denominator for the 99% figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7585/CBP-7585.pdf The Troubled Families Programme (England)], House of Commons Library, 21 December 2016, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Jonathan Portes said of the figure, "I doubt that the North Korean statistical office would have the cheek."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Butler |first=Patrick |date=22 June 2015 |title=Troubled families scheme outcomes: miraculous success or pure fiction? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/22/troubled-families-scheme-outcomes-miraculous-success-or-pure-fiction | work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=10 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure was later criticised as misleading by a Public Accounts Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 December 2016 |title=Government misled public with 99% success rate claim on troubled families, say MPs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/20/troubled-families-government-misled-public-99-success-claim-say-mps | work=Press Association quoted in the Guardian |location=UK |access-date=10 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 December 2016 |title=Troubled families turnaround claim misleading, say MPs |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38369557 | work=BBC News |location=UK Politics |access-date=10 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost savings==
DCLG has published documents to say that the programme saves money for the public sector by preventive action with families who rely heavily on public-sector services.  A report in March 2015 claimed that the first programme had saved £1.2 billion,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/benefits-of-the-troubled-families-programme-to-the-taxpayer-report Benefits of the Troubled Families programme to the taxpayer: report, DCLG, 10 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; which was quoted in a speech by [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-105000-troubled-families-turned-around-saving-taxpayers-an-estimated-12-billion Press release: More than 105,000 troubled families turned around saving taxpayers an estimated £1.2 billion, 10 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  This figure was criticised as "unadultered fiction" by Jonathan Portes as it was based on data from only seven local authorities and were based on gross (rather than net) savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/troubling-attitude-statistics#.WJYIj1OLSM- ''A Troubling Attitude to Statistics'', Jonathan Portes, 15 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar criticisms were made by [[Full Fact]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://fullfact.org/economy/12-billion-saved-troubled-families-programme/ ''£1.2 billion saved? The troubled families programme'', Sam Ashworth-Hayes, Full Fact]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Daily Mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/revealed-eric-pickles-12bn-troubled-5310002 ''Revealed: Eric Pickles' £1.2bn Troubled Families "saving" is "completely meaningless"'', Frederica Coco, 16 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later costs report, based on data from 67 local authorities, was published in October 2016 to accompany the evaluation.  This found a gross saving of £7,050 per family per year for these councils, and did not make any claims on savings for the programme as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/560512/Troubled_Families_Local_Authority_Cost_Savings.pdf ''Local Authority Data on the Cost and Potential Fiscal Benefits of the Troubled Families Programme'', DCLG, 17 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
In June 2013, the UK government announced its intention to extend this intensive help to 400,000 more families, committing £200 million in funding in 2015 to 2016. It expects, for every £4,000 spent on a family, an annual saving of £15,000 in the costs of the police, health and social services in dealing with the family.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Evaluation leak==
An evaluation of the initial programme led by [[Ecorys]] was leaked to the BBC in August 2016.&lt;ref name="Leak"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Troubled Families report 'suppressed' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37010486|newspaper=BBC News |location=England |date=8 August 2016 |access-date=8 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evaluation stated that the programme had made "no discernable impact" on unemployment, truancy or criminality in the treatment families.&lt;ref name="Leak"/&gt;  The BBC said that the report was leaked by a senior civil servant who felt that government officials had suppressed the report because of its negative evaluation.&lt;ref name="Leak"/&gt; The [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] denied this, however. The Guardian also noted the scheme had been set up in the wake of the [[2011 England riots]] and was due to cost 1.3 billion pounds by the end of the expanded programme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/08/13bn-troubled-families-scheme-has-had-no-discernible-impact £1.3bn troubled families scheme has had 'no discernible impact'] Lisa O'Carroll, The Guardian, 8 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The Early Intervention Family called for DCLG to publish the report in full, but the Department replied that the evaluation work was not yet finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnstone |first=Richard |date=9 August 2016 |title=Ministers urged to publish Troubled Families report |url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2016/08/ministers-urged-publish-troubled-families-report|newspaper=Public Finance |location=UK |access-date=9 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the Guardian, [[Anna Bawden]] blamed the problems on the use of a ''payment by results'' system during a period when local government budgets were being cut and said, "The programme was bound to maximise waste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bawden|first=Anna |date=9 August 2016 |title=The troubled families scheme has failed – this is the folly of payment by results |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/troubled-families-programme-failed|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=9 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the leak, the House of Commons's Public Accounts Committee began an investigation and the National Audit Office was asked to provide an update on how money had been spent on the programme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-troubled-families-programme-update.pdf The Troubled Families programme: update, National Audit Office, October 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation publication and Dispatches programme==
The Evaluation by the [[National Institute for Economic and Social Research]] was published on 17 October 2016.  The report found that there had been "no significant impact" of the scheme.&lt;ref name="niesr.ac.uk"&gt;National Evaluation of the Troubled Families Programme - Final Synthesis Report. Publication date: 17 Oct 2016  Author(s): Portes, J; Bewley, H. http://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/national-evaluation-troubled-families-programme-final-synthesis-report#.WEbW2OlvjIU&lt;/ref&gt; A press release from NIESR stated, "we were unable to find consistent evidence that the programme had any significant or systematic impact".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niesr.ac.uk/media/niesr-press-release-%E2%80%93-no-evidence-troubled-families-programme-had-any-significant-impact-key#.WAVKOPnx6M9 NIESR Press Release – No evidence Troubled Families Programme had any significant impact on key objectives, NIESR evaluation finds]&lt;/ref&gt; The Times reported the following day, "the report was published quietly last night after complaints from Whitehall insiders that it was being suppressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Cameron 'wasted £1bn on troubled families'|author=Oliver Wright and Michael Savage |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=17 October 2016|page_numbers=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, the Channel 4 series [[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]] broadcast an investigation of the programme that was highly critical of the programme.  Interviews with critics of the programme such as Stephen Crossley, Jonathan Portes and Gen Maintland Hudson suggested that the 99% success rate was achieved by councils' classifying minor complaints such as noise as evidence of being a troubled family so that they were more likely to turn the families around and by data matching of families previously worked with before the programme.  Dispatches suggested that many of the problems targeted by the programme persisted in areas that claimed to have achieved 100% success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/722218/Dispatches-investigates-the-real-impact-of-Government-s-Troubled-Families-programme|date=17 October 2016|access-date=17 October 2016|title=‘It’s like living in the SLUMS’: The REAL impact of Troubled Families programme revealed|newspaper=Daily Express|location=UK|last=Rambhai|first=Jyoti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evaluation was published two days before a hearing before the [[Public Accounts Committee]] on 19 October.  The Public Accounts Committee had expressed concerns to Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for DCLG, on 5 October that the evaluation documents were not provided to the Committee in advance as were requested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/public-accounts/Correspondence/2015-20-Parliament/Correspondence-chair-sos-Communities-Local%20Government-re-Troubled-Families-Programme-051016.pdf Correspondence from the Chair to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government relating to the Troubled Families Programme], taken from [https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/troubled-families-16-17/publications/ Public Accounts Committee publications]&lt;/ref&gt; On the date of publication, the Committee tweeted followers to help it review the 765 pages of the Evaluation published late that day before the hearing on 19 October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/CommonsPAC/status/788071964724305924 Tweet from official account:] 765 pages of #troubledfamilies evaluation published tonight. Help us review and let us know your thoughts before Wed&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the finding of "no significant impact" of the scheme,&lt;ref name="niesr.ac.uk"/&gt; Dame Casey stated: "They ([[NIESR]]) had not, frankly, put any of the caveats in the public domain" and that "they have misrepresented their own research". NIESR responded that the caveats had been detailed in their press statement and that DCLG had approved of the press statement before its release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/public-accounts-committee/troubled-families/written/42437.pdf Written evidence from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research to the Public Accounts Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAC published its report on 19 December 2016.  They concluded that the delay in publication had been unacceptable, that DCLG had failed to demonstrate that the programme had any significant impact and that the terminology of saying that the families had been "turned around" was misleading given that many of the families had continuing problems after a result had been claimed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmpubacc/711/71102.htm House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10577">'''Ultra-imperialism''', or occasionally '''hyperimperialism''' and formerly '''[[super-imperialism]]''', is a potential, comparatively peaceful phase of [[capitalism]], meaning "after" or "beyond" [[imperialism]]. It was described mainly by [[Karl Kautsky]]. "[[Post-imperialism]]" is sometimes used as a synonym of "ultra-imperialism", although it can have distinct meanings.

== Origin of the term ==
The suggestion of a possible "Ultraimperialismus" is normally attributed to Karl Kautsky, the leading theoretician of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the era of the [[German Empire|Kaiserreich]].  Kautsky coined the term in 1914, but he had speculated on the issue several times in 1912 already. He postulated that in the field of international relations a "stadium [approaches], in which the competition among states will be disabled by their cartel relationship".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kautsky, Der erste Mai und der Kampf gegen den Militarismus, Neue Zeit 30 (1912), Vol. 2, p. 107-108 (translated from German).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Kautsky’s ''Ultraimperialismus'' concept was shaped by the idea of [[cartel]]s made up by states for the purpose of international policy.

The basic idea of a possible pacification of imperialism did not really originate from Kautsky. The British left-liberal [[John Atkinson Hobson]] had written in 1902 in a similar context about a potential "inter-imperialism", which could be established by a "combination" of great powers ("combination" or "combine" then being used to designate [[cartel]]s).&lt;ref&gt;John A. Hobson: ''Imperialism'', London 1902, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907, [[Karl Liebknecht]] stated in his brochure ''Militarismus und Antimilitarismus'' that "a trustification of all actual and potential colonies among the colonial powers, so to speak […] a disabling of the colonial rivalry among the states [could take place in the future], as it occurred to some extent for the private competition among capitalist entrepreneurs in the cartels and trusts".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Liebknecht: Schriften. Vol. 1., Berlin 1958, p. 269-270 (translated from German).&lt;/ref&gt; – On the eve of World War I these peace-loving social-democrats and liberals in Europe hoped that the great powers would – beginning with the British Empire and the Deutsche Reich – unite into a "[[state cartel theory|states' cartel]]" or a "combination" of states giving the rivals organization and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Holm A. Leonhardt, Zur Geschichte der Ultraimperialismus-Theorie 1902-1930. Die Ideengeschichte einer frühen Theorie der politischen Globalisierung [On the History of Ultra-Imperialism Theory 1902-1930], in: Homepage of the Institute of History, Hildesheim Universität (Germany) http://www.uni-hildesheim.de/de/30219.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kautsky's statements in 1914 ==
In 1914 Kautsky published an article on imperialism, which subsequently was translated into English and published in the USA. In these he argued, there could be a way out of direful wars among the imperialist powers, a solution now named "Ultraimperialismus" or "[[super-imperialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kautsky, ''Der Imperialismus'', in: ''Die Neue Zeit''. 32 (1914), Vol. 2, p. 908–922; Karl Kautsky: ''Imperialism and the War'', in: ''International socialist review'', 15 (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kautsky elucidated this thought in the September 1914 issue of ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]''. He described the current phase of capitalism as [[imperialism]]. In [[Marxist theory]], imperialism consists of capitalist states [[superexploiting]] [[Workforce|labour]] in agrarian regions in order to increase both the imperialist nation's [[productivity]] and their [[Market (economics)|market]].  However, imperialism also required capitalist states to introduce [[protectionism|protectionist]] measures and to defend their [[empire]]s militarily.  He believed that this was the ultimate cause of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Kautsky"&gt;[[Karl Kautsky]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1914/09/ultra-imp.htm Ultra-imperialism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kautsky noted that before the War, while industrial accumulation had continued, [[export]]s had dropped, as a result of a tendency of [[industry]] to expand out of proportion to [[agriculture]].  He pointed out that growing [[nationalism]] in the more industrially advanced [[colonies]] would necessitate a continuation of the [[arms race]] after the War, and that should this occur, [[economic stagnation]] would worsen.&lt;ref name="Kautsky" /&gt;

In Kautsky's view, the only one way in which capitalists would be able to maintain the basic system, while avoiding this stagnation, would be for the wealthiest nations to form a "[[cartel]]", in the same manner as which [[bank]]s had co-operated, agreeing to limit their competition and renounce their [[arms race]], in order to maintain their export markets and their systems of superexploitation.&lt;ref name="Kautsky" /&gt;  In doing so, he postulated that [[war]] and [[militarism]] were not essential features of capitalism, and that a peaceful capitalism was possible.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Lenin's criticism==
[[Lenin]] disagreed with Kautsky's approach.  In an introduction to [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s ''[[Imperialism and World Economy]]'', written in 1916, he conceded that "in the abstract one can think of such a phase. In practice, however, he who denies the sharp tasks of to-day in the name of dreams about soft tasks of the future becomes an opportunist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lenin]]'s introduction to [[Nikolai Bukharin]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1917/imperial/intro.htm Imperialism and the World Economy]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin developed Bukharin's theories of imperialism, and his own arguments formed the core of his work ''[[Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism]]''.  He wrote that Kautsky's theory supposed "the rule of finance capital lessens the unevenness and contradictions inherent in the world economy, whereas in reality it increases them."  He gives examples of disparities in the international economy and discusses how they would develop even under a system of ultra-imperialism.  He asks, under the prevailing system, "what means other than war could there be under capitalism to overcome the disparity between the development of productive forces and the accumulation of capital on the one side, and the division of colonies and spheres of influence for finance capital on the other?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Lenin]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent positions on the idea of ultraimperialism ==
Some Marxists have pointed out similarities between the co-operation between the capitalist states during the [[Cold War]] and ultra-imperialism.&lt;ref name="WSWS"&gt;''[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/apr2003/corr-a11.shtml Lenin, Kautsky and "ultra-imperialism"]'', [[World Socialist Web Site]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.workersliberty.org/node/1037 "Ultra-imperialism": a debate]'', [[Workers Liberty]].&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Thomas of [[Workers Liberty]] claims that this "since the collapse of the Stalinist bloc in 1989-91, that 'ultra-imperialism' has extended to cover almost the whole globe", but that "rather than being a sharply polarised world of industrial states on one side, agrarian states on the other, with the industrial states joining together to keep the agrarian states un-industrial by force, it is a very unequal but multifarious system, with political independence for the ex-colonies, rapidly-permuting new international divisions of labour, and many poorer states exporting mostly manufactured goods."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, ''[http://www.workersliberty.org.uk/files/ultra.pdf Introduction to Kautsky's "Ultra-imperialism"]'', [[Workers Liberty]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators have pointed to similarities between [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]]'s theory of [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|Empire]] and Kautsky's theory, although the authors themselves claim their theory is founded in [[Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bashir Abu-Manneh, ''[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0604abumanneh.htm The Illusions of Empire]'', [[Monthly Review]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the theory of ultra-imperialism argue that, whatever similar forms may have existed during the Cold War, since its end, inter-capitalist competition has tended to increase,&lt;ref&gt;Juan Chingo and Gustavo Dunga. ''[http://www.ft.org.ar/estrategia/ei17/ei17englishimperio.htm Empire or Imperialism?]'', Fourth International - Trotskyist Fraction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theories==
[[State cartel theory]] - a new concept in the field of [[International Relations theory]] - uses the basic conception of Kautsky's ultra-imperialism, but is not a Marxist theory.
