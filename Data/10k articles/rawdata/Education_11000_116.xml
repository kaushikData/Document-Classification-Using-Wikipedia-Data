'''AZUPANE-Lagunillas''' was the first school for children with learning disabilities in the western region of [[Zulia]], Venezuela. The school was inaugurated in [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia]] by its founder, [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]], on May 4, 1974. It was later integrated into the government educational program, becoming a public school and renamed as "Institute of Special Education" Jesús Enrique Losada".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Inicó actividedes AZUPANE" (AZUPANE started activities), article reviewing the inaugural event of AZUPANE-Lagunillas, published by Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", May 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticiaalminuto.com/efemerides-20abr-nacio-betty-cecilia-lugo-filantropa-dedicada-al-zulia-y-confundadora-de-la-casa-de-la-misericordia/|title=¡EFEMÉRIDES! #20Abr Nació Betty Cecilia Lugo, filántropa dedicada al Zulia y confundadora de La Casa de la Misericordia - Noticia al Minuto|website=noticiaalminuto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==
In the early 1970s the western region of Zulia state included four municipalities and it was the main center of Venezuela's oil industry. Many international corporations, connected to oil and gas, had long time and successful business in the district.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1975 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite being one of the richest regions in the country, Special Education was not included in the programs followed by local schools. There was not even awareness about the importance of integrating disabled children into the educational system.&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"/&gt;
[[File:Betty Cecilia Lugo.png|thumb|left|Venezuela philanthropist [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]], founder of AZUPANE-Lagunillas]]
This situation was perceived by philanthropist Betty Cecilia Lugo when she arrived in Lagunillas. Educated in Medicine and Special Education, she started a crusade in order to include special education into the local educational system. That is how the idea of starting a school for children with disabilities was born. The school was created primarily as a place where disabled children could be educated, have special activities outdoors and start to play sports. &lt;ref&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1974 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages===
Betty Lugo started the project by creating awareness within the local community. She discussed the importance of Special Education with private companies and government institutions and built a fundraising committee. The most important achievement at this stage was to make possible that oil international companies included the project in their donation programs.&lt;ref&gt;“Mayoritario respaldo merece AZUPANE" (Azupane deserves strong support), Betty Lugo interview in the Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", November 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"/&gt;

The second stage focused on the search and selection of teachers, to be chosen into a community where Special Education was an unknown field. Given her academic training on the subject, Betty Lugo took care of the education and guidance of selected teachers, training them as special educators.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The third stage aimed to find an appropriate building to start activities, which took one year of meetings with different public and private companies. The school was inaugurated on May 4, 1974, in a large building donated by Shell Company of Venezuela, located in Ciudad Ojeda, [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The building had enough space for classrooms and offices. It also had a large garden, where children could develop psychomotor skills. Furniture and other equipment was purchased with money collected by the fundraising committee. &lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Inicó actividedes AZUPANE" (AZUPANE started activities), article reviewing the inaugural event of AZUPANE-Lagunillas, published by Maracaibo newspaper "Crítica", May 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
[[File:Betty Cecilia Lugo. Charla.png|thumb|right|Betty Cecilia Lugo speaks to representatives of the local community, in order to create awareness about the need for Special Education]]
The name of the school was AZUPANE- Lagunillas ("{{lang|es|Asociación Zuliana de Padres y Amigos de Niños Excepcionales - Lagunillas}}", English: "Zulian Association of Parents and Friends of Exceptional Children" - Lagunillas district). It started with seven pupils while Betty Lugo, together with benefactors and local authorities, continued searching for disabled children within the region. Other cases in need for special education started to show up and the school soon began to increase the number of students. &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The school program was planned for children aged six to twelve years, suffering from neurological disorders, motor disabilities and communication and language problems. The main purpose was to create the appropriate atmosphere to grant academic learning, as well as the acquirement of social skills and the improvement of students quality of life.&lt;ref&gt; “Mayoritario respaldo merece AZUPANE" (Azupane deserves strong support), Betty Lugo interview in the Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", November 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents took care of the student’s daily transportation to the school, till Shell Oil Company of Venezuela, one of the greatest benefactors of the project, donated a school bus and provided the gasoline. Betty Lugo donated to the school all her special educational material, acquired during her training years in the United States. This kind of special educational resource was not produced or imported in Venezuela, by the time AZUPANE - Lagunillas started.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Legacy==
While AZUPANE- Lagunillas was raising awareness for the need of special education, Betty Lugo continued her crusade by encouraging private and official organizations to create special schools throughout the region. When she left Lagunillas, at the end of the 1970s, the school had increased the number of students, the local society was attentive to children with special needs and the Ministry of Education was planning to develop similar projects in the area. AZUPANE-Lagunillas was lately absorbed by the government as part of its educational programs, and the school was renamed as Institute of Special Education “Jesús Enrique Lossada”.&lt;ref&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, March 1979 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abigail A. Thompson''' (born in 1958, in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]])&lt;ref name="satter"/&gt; is an American mathematician. She works as a professor of mathematics at the [[University of California, Davis]], where she specializes in [[knot theory]] and [[low-dimensional topology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/research/profiles/?fac_id=thompson Faculty profile], UC Davis, retrieved 2014-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Thompson graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1979,&lt;ref name="satter"/&gt; and earned her Ph.D. in 1986 from [[Rutgers University]] under the joint supervision of [[Martin Scharlemann]] and [[Julius L. Shaneson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=6024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After visiting positions at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], she joined the UC Davis faculty in 1988.&lt;ref name="satter"/&gt;  Thompson had a postdoctoral fellowship with the National Science Foundation from 1988 to 1991 and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship from 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/thompson.htm|title=Abigail Thompson|website=www.agnesscott.edu|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1990-91 and 2000-01.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/thompson.htm|title=Abigail Thompson|website=www.agnesscott.edu|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Thompson extended [[David Gabai]]'s concept of [[thin position]] from knots to 3-[[manifold]]s and [[Heegaard splitting]]s.&lt;ref name="satter"&gt;{{citation|title=2003 Satter Prize|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200304/comm-satter.pdf|journal=[[Notices of the AMS]]|volume=50|issue=4|date=April 2003|pages=474–475}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education reform==
Thompson has also been an activist for reform of primary and secondary school mathematics education. She has publicly attacked the [[Mathland]]-based curriculum in use in the mid-1990s when the oldest of her three children began studying mathematics in school, claiming that it provided an inadequate foundation in basic mathematical skills, left no opportunity for independent work, and was based on poorly written materials. As an alternative, she founded a program at UC Davis to improve teacher knowledge of mathematics, and became the director of the [[California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science]], a month-long summer mathematics camp for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Thompson_Abigail|title=Abigail A Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Thompson won the 2003 [[Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics]] for her research on thin position and Heegard splittings.&lt;ref name="satter"&gt;{{citation|title=2003 Satter Prize|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200304/comm-satter.pdf|journal=[[Notices of the AMS]]|volume=50|issue=4|date=April 2003|pages=474–475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she became one of the inaugural [[fellow]]s of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="fams"&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2014-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austria-Forum''' is a freely accessible [[online]] collection of [[reference work]]s in both [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] about [[Austria]]-related topics.

==Background==
[[File:AeiouLogo.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|AEIOU logo]]
The predecessor of Austria-Forum, the AEIOU project was launched in 1996 by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research as part of Austria's millennial celebrations. The first mention of the name ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', or Austria was in the year 996. The content was based on the German-language ''Österreich-Lexikon'', first published in a printed version in 1995. Additional material was acquired, including more images and also audio and video files, and ''AEIOU'' soon grew into a [[multimedia]] [[information system]].

The title ''AEIOU''—the "'''&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;'''nnotatable '''&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;'''lectronic '''&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;'''nteractive '''&lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;'''esterreich '''&lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;'''niversal Information System"—is an [[allusion]] to the old [[Habsburg]] motto, [[A.E.I.O.U.]]. Suggestions for the improvements to articles can be made by reader; however, the ''aeiou Encyclopedia'' was not a [[wiki]].

The '''Aviators Code Initiative''' (ACI), formerly the '''Aviators Model Code of Conduct,''' is a [[Code of Conduct|set of model recommended practices]] designed to improve [[general aviation]] safety and [[airmanship]].

==Overview==
Developed by a group of aviation professionals, the voluntary Aviators Code Initiative has produced a family of  voluntary aviation codes. For example, the Aviators Model Code of Conduct (AMCC) "recommends operating practices to enhance the quality and safety" of general aviation flight operations.&lt;ref name="AviationCitizenship"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/safety_briefing/2013/media/SepOct2013.pdf |title=Aviation Citizenship — FAA Safety Briefing |publisher=faa.gov/news/safety_briefing/ |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMCC described behaviors that pilots and mechanics should exercise as good aviation citizens, including:

* making safety the highest priority;
* seeking excellence in airmanship;
* recognizing and managing risks effectively, and using sound principles of risk management;
* developing and exercising good judgment; and sound principles of aeronautical decision-making;
* maintaining situational awareness, and adhering to prudent operating practices and personal operating parameters;
* aspiring to professionalism;
* acting with responsibility and courtesy; and
* adhering to applicable laws and regulations.

The ACI family of codes is designed to be adapted by its implementers. It currently consists of eight volumes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.secureav.com |title=Aviators Model Code of Conduct |publisher=secureav.com |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Flight Instructors Model Code of Conduct'' in particular has been embraced by the aviation education community. Retired airline captain and aviation author [[Barry Schiff]] notes that "It is an outstanding document that belongs in every instructor's flight kit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2011/April/18/Model-code-of-conduct-issued-for-flight-instructors |title=Model code of conduct issued for flight instructors |publisher=aopa.org |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA Safety Briefing characterizes the AMCC as "Guiding Principles for Instructors". Participants in the [[Master Instructor Continuing Education Program]] are required "to subscribe to and abide by an aviation educator's code of conduct" and are provided with examples that include three volumes of the AMCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.masterinstructors.org/application-process/eligibility-requirements/ |title=Eligibility Requirements |publisher=masterinstructors.org |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Aviation and Flight Educators]] provides links to several volumes of the AMCC in the Public Resource Center on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.safepilots.org/resource-center/public-documents/syllabi-training-aids-etc/ |title=Syllabi, Training Aids, Etc. |publisher=safepilots.org |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[FAA]] introduces the AMCC in the "Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism" chapter of its ''Aviation Instructor's Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/aviation_instructors_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-9a.pdf |title=Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism — FAA-H-8083-9A Aviation Instructor's Handbook |publisher=faa.gov |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the AMCC being promoted by and adapted to other sectors in general aviation include the Lake Elsinore Soaring Club, the Lancair Owners &amp; Builders Organization, Gyroplane Aviators, and the [[Civil Air Patrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.soarelsinore.org/docs/GAMCC.pdf |title=Glider Aviators' Code of Conduct |publisher=soarelsinore.org |accessdate=2015-04-25 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lancairowners.com/lobo-code-of-conduct/ |title=LOBO Code of Conduct |publisher=lancairowners.com |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://gyronation.com/pledge.htm |title=Gyroplane Aviators' Code of Conduct |publisher=gyronation.com |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/Aviators_Model_Code_of_Conduct_F7732A0F1CE51.pdf |title=Aviators Model Code of Conduct |publisher=capmembers.com |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, ''The Aviators Model Code of Conduct for Kids'' was released to "introduce students to what it takes to be a good pilot, to fly safely, and be a good passenger if they take a ride in a small plane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.homeschoollibrary.info/2013/02/15/teaching-the-aviators-model-code-of-conduct-to-kids/ |title=Teaching the Aviators Model Code of Conduct to Kids |publisher=homeschoollibrary.info |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, AMCC released ''Flight Safety in the Drone Age'', offering safety guidance when operating near drones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://secureav.com/Drone-Listings-Page.html|title = Flight Safety In the Drone Age|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAS Pilots Code was released in January 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.secureav.com/Announcement-UASPC-Released.pdf|title=Unmanned Aircraft Systems Pilots Code|last=|first=|date=January 2018|website=SecureAV|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide guidance for unmanned aircraft pilots and operators.

==Permanent Editorial Board==
This [[non-profit organization|non-profit]]'s volunteer Permanent Editorial Board (PEB) provides "provides editorial oversight and stewardship of the Aviators Code Initiative (ACI), implementation of the family of codes of conduct, and supporting materials."&lt;ref name="SecureAvBoard"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.secureav.com/PEB.pdf|format=PDF|title = The Permanent Editorial Board|accessdate = 2015-04-25|last = Baum, Michael S|authorlink = |year = n.d.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514125520/http://www.secureav.com/PEB.pdf| archivedate= 14 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current members include:

* Don Steinman, ATP, CFII, Captain, [[American Airlines]]

==Structure==

The AMCC consists of the following seven sections (each containing principles and sample recommended practices):&lt;ref name="GoverningPrinciples"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/safe/safety/airman_code.htm |title=Aviators Model Code of Conduct |publisher=pilotfriend.com |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# General Responsibilities of Aviators
# Passengers and People on the Surface
# Training and Proficiency
# Security
# Environmental Issues
# Use of Technology
# Advancement and Promotion of General Aviation

For each aspect, the Code of Conduct covers governing principles (e.g., "minimize the discharge of fuel, oil, and other chemicals into the environment") and lays out specific practical recommendations (e.g., "Use a Gasoline Analysis Test Separator jar for all fuel sampling). Where applicable, sourced commentary and annotations are used to substantiate principles and recommendations, and to provide drafting considerations.

Recognizing the need for early socialization, recommendations for integrating the Code of Conduct into flight training (including sample lesson plans) are collected in ''Notes For Instructors''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secureav.com/Notes-for-Instructors.pdf Notes For Instructors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code of Conduct is intended to be specialized by aircraft operation and to evolve over time and place.

Foreign-language translations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secureav.com/AMCC-Listings-Page.html|title=Aviators Model Code of Conduct Download Page|work=secureav.com|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate national and regionally-specific practices and regulations.

''Notes for Prospective Implementers''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secureav.com/Notes-for-Implementers.pdf Notes for Prospective Implementers]&lt;/ref&gt; provides guidelines and resources for individuals and organizations adopting the Code of Conduct.

''Flight Safety in the Drone Age''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is organized in five sections: (1) General Education and Preparation, (2) Preflight Operations, (3) In-flight Operations, (4) Post-flight Operations, and (5) Aviation Community.

==Adoption==

In the United States, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] includes links to the Code of Conduct in their list of online resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faasafety.gov/gslac/onlineresources.aspx?categoryId=23&amp;masterId=1|title=Resources -  Online Resource - Resources for Pilots - FAA - FAASTeam - FAASafety.gov|work=faasafety.gov|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other users and promoters of the Code of Conduct include major [[aircraft type club]]s, air carriers, flight schools, insurers, manufacturers, and other general aviation players, including:
* Avemco Insurance Company
* Cessna Owners Organization
* Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions, [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6929">'''Beverley Peck Johnson''' (sometimes referred to as '''Beverley Johnson'''; June 12, 1904 – January 20, 2001) was an American [[voice teacher]], [[soprano]], and pianist who taught on the faculties of several institutions, including the [[Juilliard School]]. Her pupils included several prominent opera singers, actors, and entertainers, including sopranos [[Renée Fleming]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Anna Moffo]], tenor [[Anthony Dean Griffey]], and actors [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Kevin Kline]], and [[Constance Towers]] among others. Music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] wrote that "Johnson was particularly valued by students for a keen ability to find individual solutions to their problems."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Born Beverley Peck in [[Portland, Oregon]], Johnson was the daughter of Hartwig O. Peck and Cecilia W. Peck. She grew up in [[Walla Walla, Washington]], and earned degrees in both speech and drama from the Ellison-White Conservatory in Portland. Shortly thereafter she moved to New York where she began studies in piano with [[Andre Kostelanetz]], and was soon active as an accompanist for singers and ensembles in NYC.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Peck studied voice with one of the singers she accompanied in NYC, tenor Hardesty Johnson, who became her husband.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/22/arts/beverley-peck-johnson-96-voice-teacher.html|title=Beverley Peck Johnson, 96, Voice Teacher|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 22, 2001|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was a faculty member at the [[Juilliard School]] and she served as his studio accompanist during lessons and for masterclasses.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcB3cOsY0FQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=renee+fleming|title=The Inner Voice: The Making of a Singer|author=[[Renée Fleming]]|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She often performed in joint recital with her husband as both a pianist and a soprano vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPUTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1432|title=Virgil Thomson: Music Chronicles 1940–1954: (Library of America #258)|author=[[Virgil Thomson]]|publisher=[[Digital Public Library of America]]|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accompanied other well known singers as well in concerts during her career. Hardesty Johnson died in 1952.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In 1960, Johnson joined the voice faculty of the School of Sacred Music at the [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] where she taught until 1965. She joined the faculty at the Juilliard School in 1964 where she taught until her death 37 years later.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; She concurrently worked on the faculty of the [[Aspen Music Festival and School]]; as an adjunct professor at the [[Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College]]; and as a professor at the [[Manhattan School of Music]] from 1982–1989.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In addition to working as a University professor, Peck taught out of a private studio.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; One of her notable pupils was actor Kevin Kline who began studying with her to prepare his voice for the music in the 1983 film version of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|The Pirates of Penzance]]''. Kline stated in an interview that Peck "was very, very strict about protecting the voice", and that he must choose between cigarettes and her if he was a smoker.&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt; Peck's other private students included [[Sarah Atereth]], [[Ara Berberian]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Mignon Dunn]], [[Tammy Grimes]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Evelyn Lear]], [[Rita Shane]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Constance Towers]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], and [[Theodor Uppman]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metguild.org/Opera_News_Magazine/2014/10/News/Rita_Shane.html|title=Rita Shane, 78, Dramatic Coloratura Who Found Acclaim at New York City Opera and the Met, has Died|work=[[Opera News]]|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson also had a widely known reputation of helping voices experiencing distress.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvAaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;lpg=PT398&amp;dq=%22Beverley+Peck+Johnson%22|title=Madeline Kahn: Being the Music, A Life|author=William V. Madison|p=196|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was hired to assist President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in his post-operative recovery from the surgical removal of [[vocal fold nodule]]s while he was in office.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; She was also sought by Anna Moffo when the renowned soprano began experiencing vocal difficulties in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="R"/&gt;

In a 1977 interview with ''The New York Times'', Johnson said following about her work with Moffo:&lt;blockquote&gt;Anna's voice has been there all the time. It's just that somebody along the way forgot to tell her that you can't run a Rolls-Royce without  gas in it. She has one of the really natural beautiful voices, like Tebaldi. But she never had any true physiological technique to fall back on. She had no breath support; there was no resonance in the lower or middle voice. Only air was coming out. So what we tried to do for the past two years is wash away the crud and build up her stamina. A singer, like an athlete, has to have every workable muscle trained.&lt;ref name="R"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/05/15/145844292.html?pageNumber=81|title=A Troubled Prima Donna Tries For a Comeback|author=Stephen E. Rubin|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1977|pages=81, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Johnson died in Manhattan in 2001 at the age of 96. At the time leading up to her death she was closely administered to by her pupils Anthony Dean Griffey and Renée Fleming. Fleming described Griffey as "like a surrogate son to Beverley", and recounted how her final lesson with her teacher was just a month before Johnson's death.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Some of her pupils became celebrated voice teachers and accompanists in their own right, including Shane, [[Margot Garrett]], [[Ken Noda]], and [[Brian Zeger]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Adamantly opposed to having her photo taken, ''The New York Times'' was unable to locate or obtain a photo of her at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

'''Blueprint Education''' is a [[non-profit]] organization located in [[Glendale, Arizona]] providing [[distance learning]], curriculum design, and [[alternative education]] to students and schools in all 50 states and 20 countries around the world. Founded in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2c6EpFt2MgAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=blueprint+education+high+school&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie7tPfrNLXAhVMuI8KHcDhAm4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=blueprint%20education%20high%20school&amp;f=false|title=Complete Guide to Online High Schools: Distance Learning Options for Teens &amp; Adults|last=Nixon|first=Thomas|date=2007|publisher=Degree Press|year=|isbn=9780976471639|location=|pages=39|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Blueprint Education first offered correspondence learning to [[migrant worker]] families in [[Maricopa County, Arizona]].

Blueprint Education offers middle and high school courses that are compatible in content to traditional schools in the [[United States]]. Students may take courses either to make up classes or to accelerate the educational process in order to [[Graduation|graduate]] early. Each student learns at his or her own pace through an open-entry/open-exit system.

In 1994, Blueprint Education created a partnership with [[school districts]] to extend their students educational needs through alternative methods of learning.  Kids at Hope academies serves 20 districts, 60 schools for children grades 4 through 12 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

[[Arizona State University]] (''Baker &amp; Martinez 1999'') evaluated the effectiveness of the Kids at Hope Program enhancements. Almost 2,000 students studied. Statistically significant results demonstrated Kids at Hope positively influenced two success factors; identifying interested caring adults and feeling a sense of [[acceptance]] and belonging. Other scales also showed promise including: reporting better grades and participating in [[extracurricular activities]].

== Accreditation ==
[[Curriculum]] is designed specifically to work around students lives offering 250 courses for grades 7 through 12, allowing learners to work at their own pace and on their own schedule.  [[Distance Learning]] courses are fully accredited by [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] and the  Commission on International and Trans-Regional Accreditation and accepted by schools and colleges worldwide.

== Divisions ==

Upon successful completion, the [[college]] is notified and according to prior agreement, the college issues the appropriate grade and transcript.

=== Alternative education ===

In 1994, Blueprint Education created a partnership with school districts in the greater [[Maricopa County]] area to extend their students educational needs through alternative methods of learning.  The focus of these programs are to provide unique, high quality service to individuals and institutions through powerful innovations in education.   Blueprint Education now serves over 20 districts, 60 schools and hundreds of children grades 4 through 12 in the greater [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metropolitan area.

=== Charter School ===

Blueprint Education has been working with [[charter school]]s to provide curriculum and consulting since 1995.  In 1998, Blueprint Education in a partnership with [[Deer Valley Unified School District]] became one of the first state funded virtual schools.  This helped Blueprint Education gain necessary skills to open both a physical and [[virtual charter school]].

*  Hope High School Online:  In 2003, Hope High School Online opened as one of the seven selected virtual schools approved by the Arizona State Board of Charter Schools.  Hope High School Online serves students in ninth through twelfth grades.
*  Hope High School:  Located in Southwest Phoenix, Hope High School is a tuition-free charter high school where students seek small, self-paced learning. Students are gifted learners or new to the West Phoenix, who are teen parents, or working part-time or full-time, or transferring from other schools.
* Blueprint High School: Located in Chandler, Blueprint High School is a tuition-free charter high school.

'''Brain training''' (also called '''cognitive training''') is a program of regular mental activities purported to maintain or improve one's [[cognitive]] abilities. It reflects a [[hypothesis]] that cognitive abilities can be maintained or improved by exercising the [[brain]], analogous to the way [[physical fitness]] is improved by exercising the body.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;

Although there is strong evidence that aspects of brain structure remain "plastic" throughout life and that high levels of mental activity are associated with reduced risks of age-related [[dementia]], scientific support for the concept of "brain fitness" is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soveri |first1=Anna |last2=Antfolk |first2=Jan |last3=Karlsson |first3=Linda |last4=Salo |first4=Benny |last5=Laine |first5=Matti |title=Working memory training revisited: A multi-level meta-analysis of n-back training studies |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |date=23 January 2017 |volume=24|issue=4|pages=1077–1096|doi=10.3758/s13423-016-1217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/03/496120962/brain-game-claims-fail-a-big-scientific-test Brain Game Claims Fail A Big Scientific Test]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is infrequently used in academic literature, but is commonly used in the context of [[self-help]] books and commercial products.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exercise on the brain |author1=Sandra Aamodt |author2=Sam Wang |date=November 8, 2007 |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/opinion/08aamodt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Cognitive reserve]] is the capacity of a person to meet the various cognitive demands of life and is evident in an ability to assimilate information, comprehend relationships, and develop reasonable conclusions and plans. Cognitive training is a hypothesis that certain activities, done regularly, might help maintain or improve cognitive reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scarmeas|first=N|author2=Y Stern|title=Cognitive reserve and lifestyle|journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol|volume=25|pages=625–33|year=2003|doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.625.14576|pmid=12815500|issue=5|pmc=3024591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, companies offering products and services for cognitive training have marketed them as improving educational outcomes for children, and for adults as [[memory improvement|improving memory]], processing speed, and problem-solving, and even as preventing dementia or Alzheimers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yong|first1=Ed|title=The Weak Evidence Behind Brain-Training Games|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/the-weak-evidence-behind-brain-training-games/502559/|website=The Atlantic|date=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often support their marketing with discussion about the educational or professional background of their founders, some discuss neuroscience that supports their approach—especially concepts of [[neuroplasticity]] and [[transfer of learning]], and some cite evidence from clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;  The key claim made by these companies is that the specific training that they offer generalizes to other fields—academic or professional performance generally or everyday life.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;

As of 2016, there was some evidence that some of these programs improved performance on tasks in which users were trained, less evidence that improvements in performance generalize to related tasks, and almost no evidence that "brain training" generalizes to everyday cognitive performance; in addition most clinical studies were flawed.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simons |first1=DJ |last2=Boot |first2=WR |last3=Charness |first3=N |last4=Gathercole |first4=SE |last5=Chabris |first5=CF |last6=Hambrick |first6=DZ |last7=Stine-Morrow |first7=EA |title=Do "Brain-Training" Programs Work?|journal=Psychological science in the public interest  |publisher=Association for Psychological Science |date=October 2016|volume=17|issue=3|pages=103–86|pmid=27697851|url=http://psi.sagepub.com/content/17/3/103.full.pdf|doi=10.1177/1529100616661983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial programs==
[[Cogmed]] was founded in 2001, [[Posit Science Corporation|Posit Science]] in 2002, and ''[[Brain Age]]'' was first released in 2005,&lt;ref name=Conversation2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hurley|first1=Dan|title=The Science Behind 'Brain Training'|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/the-science-behind-brain-training/283634/|work=The Atlantic|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all capitalizing on the growing interest within the public in neuroscience, along with heightened worries by parents about ADHD and other learning disabilities in their children, and concern about their own cognitive health as they aged.&lt;ref name=Gunter2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunter|first1=Tracy D.|title=Can We Trust Consumers With Their Brains? Popular Cognitive Neuroscience, Brain Images, Self-Help And The Consumer|journal=Indiana Health Law Review|date=2014|volume=11|issue=2|pages=483–552|url=https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ihlr/pdf/vol11p483.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of ''Brain Age'' in 2005 marked a change in the field, as prior to this products or services were marketed to fairly narrow populations (for example, students with learning problems), but ''Brain Age'' was marketed to everyone, with a significant media budget.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;   In 2005, consumers in the US spent $2 million on cognitive training products; in 2007 they spent about $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aamodt|first1=Sandra|last2=Wang|first2=Sam|title=Exercise on the Brain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/opinion/08aamodt.html|work=The New York Times|date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, "brain training" was a $1 billion industry.&lt;ref name=Conversation2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Benjamin|title=Brain-training isn't just a modern phenomenon, the Edwardians were also fans|url=http://theconversation.com/brain-training-isnt-just-a-modern-phenomenon-the-edwardians-were-also-fans-29515|work=The Conversation|date=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 the market was $1.3 billion, and software products made up about 55% of those sales.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;  By that time neuroscientists and others had a growing concern about the general trend toward what they called "neurofication", "neurohype", "neuromania", [[Educational neuroscience#Neuromyths|neuromyths]].&lt;ref name=Gunter2014/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
To address growing public concerns with regard to aggressive online marketing of brain games to older population, a group of neuroscientists published a letter in 2008 warning the general public that there is a lack of research showing effectiveness of brain games in elderly.&lt;ref name=ScienceNews2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Underwood |first1=Emily |title=Neuroscientists speak out against brain game hype |journal=Science |date=22 October 2014|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/neuroscientists-speak-out-against-brain-game-hype}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend any method of preventing age-related memory deficits or [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = JW | date = Apr 2010 | title = Preventing Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/alzcog-evidence-report.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evid Rep Technol Assess | volume = 193 | issue = 193| pages = 1–727 | pmid = 21500874 | pmc=4781578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 another group of scientists published a similar warning.&lt;ref name=ScienceNews2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Consensus on the Brain Training Industry from the Scientific Community|url=http://longevity3.stanford.edu/blog/2014/10/15/the-consensus-on-the-brain-training-industry-from-the-scientific-community-2/|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Stanford Center on Longevity|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, another group of scientists made a counter statement,&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt; organized and maintained by the Chief Scientific Officer of Posit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Cognitive Training Data|url=http://www.cognitivetrainingdata.org/about/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and lawsuits==
Starting in January 2015, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) sued companies selling "brain training" programs or other products marketed as improving cognitive function, including WordSmart Corporation, the company that makes [[Lumosity]], and Brain Research Labs (which sold [[dietary supplement]]s) for deceptive advertising;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Austin|first1=Neil|title=Brainstorm: FTC Continues Enforcement Trend Against Cognitive Function Claims|url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2016/05/brainstorm-ftc-continues-enforcement-trend-against-cognitive-function-claims/|work=Trademark and Copyright Law|date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  later that year the FTC also sued [[LearningRx]].&lt;ref name=CNN2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Jacqueline|title=Do brain-training exercises really work?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/health/brain-training-exercises/|work=CNN|date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC found that Lumosity's marketing "preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, [[dementia]], and even [[Alzheimer's disease]]", without providing any scientific evidence to back its claims. The company was ordered not to make any claims that its products can "[improve] performance in school, at work, or in athletics" or "[delay or protect] against age-related decline in memory or other cognitive function, including mild cognitive impairment, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease", or "[reduce] cognitive impairment caused by health conditions, including Turner syndrome, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), stroke, or side effects of [[chemotherapy]]", without "competent and reliable scientific evidence", and agreed to pay a $50 million settlement (reduced to $2 million).&lt;ref name="FTC press release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumosity to Pay $2 Million to Settle FTC Deceptive Advertising Charges for Its "Brain Training" Program|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/01/lumosity-pay-2-million-settle-ftc-deceptive-advertising-charges|website=ftc.gov|publisher=U.S. Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=17 January 2016|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-settlement&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumosity pays $2 million to FTC to settle bogus "Brain Training" claims|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/lumosity-pays-2-million-to-ftc-to-settle-bogus-brain-training-claims/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its lawsuit against LearningRx, the FTC said LearningRx had been "deceptively claim[ing] their programs were clinically proven to permanently improve serious health conditions like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and concussions".&lt;ref name="Morran2016-05-18"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morran |first=Chris |date=2016-05-18 |title=LearningRx To Pay $200K For Allegedly Unproven Claims That Brain Training Can Improve Income, Treat Autism &amp; ADHD |url=https://consumerist.com/2016/05/18/learningrx-to-pay-200k-for-allegedly-unproven-claims-that-brain-training-can-improve-income-treat-autism-adhd/ |newspaper=[[Consumerist]] |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6leqfrVon?url=https://consumerist.com/2016/05/18/learningrx-to-pay-200k-for-allegedly-unproven-claims-that-brain-training-can-improve-income-treat-autism-adhd/ |archivedate=2016-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, LearningRx settled with the FTC by agreeing not to make the disputed assertions unless they had "competent and reliable scientific evidence" which was defined as [[randomized controlled trial]]s done by competent scientists." For the judgment's monetary component, LearningRx agreed to pay $200,000 of a $4 million settlement.&lt;ref name="Heilman2016-10-16"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heilman |first=Wayne |date=2016-10-16 |title=Lessons for LearningRx on comeback from federal lawsuit |url=http://gazette.com/lessons-for-learningrx-on-comeback-from-federal-lawsuit/article/1587895 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6leqL7kXw?url=http://gazette.com/lessons-for-learningrx-on-comeback-from-federal-lawsuit/article/1587895 |archivedate=2016-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business Games''''' was a software package published by [[Acornsoft]] for the [[BBC Micro]] (Model A and Model B) and [[Acorn Electron]]. It was released in the ''Acornsoft Education'' range and includes two [[business simulation game]]s; ''Stokmark'' and ''Telemark''.

==Gameplay==

===Stokmark===
''Stokmark'' is a simulation of the [[stock market]]. Up to eight players take turns to either buy or sell shares in a choice of four companies. As well as the price, players are given the [[P/E ratio|price-to-earnings ratio]] and [[dividend yield]]. Prices change instantly when transactions are made (usually based on the standard [[supply and demand]] principle although there is a random element). After each round a news story is displayed which affects the value of certain shares. After every four rounds, players are awarded [[dividends]] on the shares they hold and are ranked on their total current value (of both cash and shares). The object of the game is to make the largest amount of profit.&lt;ref name="instructions"&gt;[http://8bs.com/elecgame/businessgames.htm Original instructions] reproduced at 8bs.com (cited 2011-11-07)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telemark===
''Telemark'' is a four player game where each player has to make decisions based on the manufacturing of televisions. This includes whether to build or extend factories, spend on improving management or marketing, and setting the price. When the player enters their price, it is not displayed on the screen so other players do not know what their competitors are charging until the end of each round. The game introduces terms and reports such as [[market share]], [[Overhead (business)|overheads]], [[Income statement|profit and loss accounts]] and [[balance sheet]]s. The instruction booklet provides detailed instructions on working out the [[Break-even (economics)|break-even]] point as well as blank worksheets to be filled out by the players. The winner is the player who has made the most profit after a set number of rounds or the first player to gain more than half the market share for televisions.&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt;

==Release==
''Business Games'' was released in 1983 as part of Acornsoft's Education range which was aimed at schools as well as home users. As it only requires 16k [[Random-access memory|RAM]], it runs on the [[BBC Micro]] Model A as well as the Model B. It was also released for the [[Acorn Electron]] in 1984. The instructions recommend the games for teaching business and economic studies&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt; but the Acorn Electron version in particular was well known among home users, as it was often included with the Acornsoft software packs bundled with Electrons in 1984 and 1985.&lt;ref name="software pack"&gt;[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/66/a-rare.html "What's It Worth"] Dave E, EUG #66, Electron User Group "Most Electrons came bundled with five Acornsoft games (Typically Arcadians, Boxer, Business Games, Chess and Hopper)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The package was reviewed by Ken Garrett for [[The Micro User]] which was largely positive. ''Stokmark'' was described as "a well-presented and useful introduction to some investment terms" but also "rather repetitive".&lt;ref name="micro user"&gt;[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/themicrouser/reviews/games/businessgames.htm "Business Games"], The Micro User, Database Publications, Vol 2 No 1, March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed ''Telemark'' is "a good game and to be properly appreciated must be played seriously".&lt;ref name="micro user" /&gt;

'''Busy Beavers''' (also known as '''We Are Busy Beavers''') is an online children’s educational program. It is aimed at parents and teachers of toddlers who speak English or are learning English as a second language, and parents of children with a learning disability, [[autism]] or delayed speech.
The Busy Beavers [[YouTube channel]] and website provide [[interactive media]] to help teach children. Their YouTube channel has over 2 billion views, and over 2 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/10182275/YouTube-success-with-kids-videos|title=YouTube success with kids' videos|last=Anthony|first=John|date=2014-06-22|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2004, Dave Martin created Busy Beavers as an online business that produces children’s educational videos on YouTube and DVDs.
In March 2014, he launched a YouTube premium channel called ''Busy Beavers TV'' that gives the subscribers, all of Busy Beavers’ existing videos ad-free and in high definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Busy Beavers children's YouTube channel ready to take on world|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/87551713/Busy-Beavers-childrens-YouTube-channel-ready-to-take-on-world|website=Stuff|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Busy Beavers joined the [[Channel Frederator Network]], and is the number one channel (by views) of the [[Multi-channel network|Multi-Channel Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/network/channel_frederator_network/topusers/mostviewed|title=Top 100 Networked YouTubers in Channel_frederator_network Sorted by Most Viewed - Socialblade.com|website=socialblade.com|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Busy Beavers and Baby Beavers have both been added to [[Roku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://suzguru.com/wordpress/index.php/2016/04/12/new-roku-channels-april-8-2016/|title=New Roku Channels – April 8, 2016|date=2016-04-12|newspaper=suzguru.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kidoodle.TV in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvkids/kidoodle-tv-adds-four-new-titles-to-catalog/|title=Kidoodle.TV Adds Four New Titles to Catalog - TVKIDS|date=2016-09-05|newspaper=TVKIDS|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also created an app for iOS and Android called ''Busy Beavers Jukebox''.

==Introduction==

Established in 1965, Central Department of Chemistry is one of the first science department that has been commenced by Tribhuvan University as a branch of Tri-Chandra Campus for the beginning of advanced course of Science in Nepal,  which only provided the course in Organic Chemistry then.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/&lt;/ref&gt;
It has then ever since growing and extending its scope far beyond what has been in the start and currently enrolling the students for  Masters of  Chemistry degree as chief authority also  conducting entrance examinations, enrolling students,  running research activities as leader and pioneer in many interdisciplinary subjects and variations of chemistry  throughout the country, running with an affiliation. It has extended its branches at Bharatpur, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Tri-Chandra College and recently at ASCOL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdctu.edu.np/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tribhuvan University was established by promulgating the Tribhuvan University Act in 1959. TU has commenced teaching, research, and other academic activities from July 14, 1959. The teaching of Chemistry in Nepal, however, had already commenced in 1921 in Tri-Chandra College, with the introduction of Intermediate of Science (I.Sc.) program. It was then upgraded to Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) level in 1947. Master's Degree in Chemistry was started only from November 28, 1965 initially at Tri-Chandra College with the introduction of a program in Organic Chemistry. The program was conducted under the ''lecturer-in-Charge-ship'' of Late Professor Prasanna Man Singh Pradhan, the then Head of the Chemistry Department of Tri-Chandra College. This historical step also pioneered the introduction of research initiatives in Chemistry in Nepal.

The present Chemistry building within the University Campus was constructed on August 17, 1966 and inaugurated on July 16, 1967. The Central Department of Chemistry then started to function in its own building at the University complex.

Master's degree programs in Inorganic Chemistry and Physical Chemistry were introduced in 1966 and 1967, respectively. Late Professor Dr. Dhruba Man Singh Amatya was formally appointed as the first Head of the Department in 1966 and he remained to that post up to 1984. After him, Prof. Dr. S.P. Dhoubadel (1984/10/28 - 1984/11/25), Prof. Dr. C.L. Gajurel (1984/11/26 - 1985/08/31 and 1987/04/11 - 1987/11/05), Prof. J.K. Shrestha (1985/09/01 - 1987/03/31 and 1987/11/06 - 1994/06/05), Prof. Dr. M.D. Manandhar (19894/06/06 - 2002/06/01), Prof. Dr. R.R. Pradhananga (2002/06/06 - 2007/12/12), and Prof. Dr. T.P. Pathak (2007/12/13 - 2009/08/31) were appointed as Head of the Central Department of Chemistry during the period in between 1984-2009. Recently, Prof. Dr. Kedar Nath Ghimire has resigned from the post and Prof. Dr. Megh Raj Pokhrel has been leading the Department as the Head since 2014.

Since the establishment, the department has extended its courses on various subjects with amendment each year. The latest being Biochemistry, Natural Product Chemistry, Electro-chemistry, Nanotechnology, Polymer science, etc. Since 2013, the department has adopted a semester system which previously succeeded by year basis as major campuses here in Nepal do such.
The total quota of students for each year was 90 and after being converted to semester system, the quota has been limited to 45 per semester effectively maintaining the identical seats over the year.

==History==

CQUPT was founded in 1950 along with the foundation of the People's Republic of China and the communist takeover of Chongqing. It was initially founded in the name of Chongqing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1965, it was entitled to have postgraduate programs as one of the first 10 colleges that had the right to have such programs in the then Sichuan Province (Chongqing separated from Sichuan Province as a Municipality in 1997).

In 2000, under the university system reform in China, the university became co-governed and co-financed by the Chinese Central Government with the Chongqing government. In 2006, CQUPT contracted with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China) to become one of the universities supported by Ministry and Province (Municipalities) government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/lsyg.php History of CQUPT]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Damavand College1.jpeg|thumb|[[Damavand College]] class ring of 1975]]

A '''class ring''' (also known as a graduation, graduate, senior, or grad ring) is a [[ring (jewellery)|ring]] worn by [[students]] and [[alumni]] to commemorate their [[graduation]], generally for a [[high school]], [[college]], or [[university]].

Today class rings can be customized, from the material and style that the ring is made of to the color and cut of the gem in the center. There is a wide selection of emblems, pictures, and words that can be added to the sides of the rings and even inside the center gem.

== History ==

The tradition of class rings originated with the class of 1835 at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/publicaffairs/PV/040319/RingMelt.htm|title=Ring melt ceremony bonds past with the future|website= [[United States Military Academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to wear ==
The ''Complete Book of Etiquette'' by [[Amy Vanderbilt]] indicates the following protocol for wearing of a class ring.  For as long as the wearer is in school, the insignia should face the wearer to remind him/her of the goal of graduation.  Upon graduation, the class ring gains the status of a "badge of honor" similar to a diploma, with the effect that graduation entitles the wearer to display the insignia facing outward so that it faces other viewers.  An additional justification for this practice is the rationale that the ring also symbolizes the graduate him/herself:  During the wearer's time in school, he or she focuses on self-development and goals specific to the insular academic environment; upon graduation, the wearer enters the wider world and puts what he or she has learned to work in shaping it.&lt;ref&gt;''Complete Book of Etiquette'', [[Amy Vanderbilt]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable exception to this protocol is the custom followed by older graduating classes of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]].  Today, as in years past, Academy graduates frequently wear their rings on the left hand in observance of the ancient belief, which also underlay the Anglo-American custom of wearing wedding bands on the left hand, that a [[vena amoris|vein connects the left ring finger to the heart]].  Prior to graduation, these classes wore the USMA Class Ring with the Class Crest closest to the heart, signifying a given cadet's bond to his class within the Academy.  Following graduation, members of these classes wore (and, for surviving members, still wear) the ring with the Academy Crest closest to the heart, signifying their bond with the Academy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.west-point.org/family/bicent/rings.html CLASS RINGS, MINIATURES, AND A-PINS] The traditional Jewish custom is to wear a wedding ring on the right index finger, and only women wore them originally. However, most Jewish people will move rings to reflect the national custom of where they live.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ring melt ==

At the [[United States Military Academy]], [[United States Naval Academy]], [[United States Air Force Academy]], [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], and the United States Coast Guard Academy each cadet's class ring contains melted gold from rings donated to the respective school from deceased alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Citadel Band of Gold|title=The Citadel Band of Gold|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/2013-class-ring|website=www.citadel.edu|publisher=The Citadel|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=West Point Association|title=Class Ring Memorial Program|url=http://www.westpointaog.org/RingMemorialProgram|website=www.westpoint.org|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and Foundation|title=Bonds of Gold|url=https://www.usna.com/Page.aspx?pid=617|website=www.usna.com|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
''[[The Lords of Discipline]]''. "I wear the ring. I wear the ring and I return often to the city of Charleston, South Carolina, to study the history of my becoming a man."  Author [[Pat Conroy]] attended and graduated from [[The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] and wrote the fictional account of a cadet's journey at a military school set in Charleston, South Carolina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9294">[[File:Deposition_-_Holzschnitt_16._Jahrhundert.jpg|thumb|right|Deposition: Polishing off the horns. Woodcut from the 16th century]]

The '''''deposition''''' (from [[Latin]] ''depositio cornuum'', "taking off the horns") was a semi-official [[initiation]] ritual which was common at [[university|universities]] throughout Europe from the [[Middle Ages]] until the 18th century. The ritual was introduced at German universities in the late 15th century, probably from the influential [[University of Paris]]. Models may have included the ''Freisprechung'' ritual in artisan [[guild]]s, where apprentices were admitted to the status of journeymen.

==Purpose==
A basis for the deposition was the idea that the arriving student was still wild and unpolished before his immatriculation  – like an animal – and had to be relieved of the signs of his uncivilised state before he could be accepted as part of the University. The student only had to go through the deposition once in his life; he would receive a deposition certificate (''"Depositionsschein"'' in [[German language|German]]) which he could show in case of transferring to another university.

The deposition consisted of scolding, in which the unworthiness of the new student would be clarified to him, in ritual removal of animal-like artificial body parts with the help of over-dimensioned tools, as well as beating and other abuse, which would have the function of a purification ritual.

In the speeches at the ritual, models from classical antiquity for the deposition process would be cited. Reference would be made to the examination of the [[Sparta]]n youth, to the customs of the Academy of [[Plato]], and the water consecration among the Athenian [[Sophism|Sophists]] of Late [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

==Process==
The arriving student would in the Middle Ages be known by the term ''beanus'', derived from the [[French language|French]] ''bec jaune'', "yellow beak" (cf. English "[[wikt:greenhorn|greenhorn]]"). The beanus would be treated by his new fellow students as a ''pecus campi'' ("animal of the field") and outfitted correspondingly. He would have to don a hood with horns and put the teeth of a [[boar]] sticking out of his mouth. He would then have to listen to a speech about his own unworthiness. The animal-like traits would then be knocked off with the help of over-sized tools. The body of the student would be additionally abused, symbolizing the cleansing and beautification. During the process wood-working tools would be used, as the student still was an "uncouth man" (German ''ungehobelt'', unplaned).

[[File:Deposition_Jena_1740.jpg|thumb|300px|From 1682 onwards, the students would only be shown the deposition instruments (leaf from a ''Stammbuch'' from Jena, 1740).]]

At the [[University of Leipzig]], the tools used in the deposition ritual are still preserved and kept in the art collection. The tools include those used for knocking off or polishing away the animal-like parts ([[axe]], [[pliers]], [[grindstone (tool)|grindstone]]), tools for woodworking ([[plane (tool)|plane]]), and for personal hygiene ([[shaving]] brush, shaving cream, shaving knife, [[ear spoon]]). Injuries to new students were common with the use of these tools.

After this, examinations would be carried out, and additional speeches of admonition would be held. Finally, the leader of the ritual would put [[salt]] in the mouth of the beanus (''sal sapientiae'', "salt of wisdom"), pour [[wine]] over his head (''vinum laetitiae'', "wine of joy") and declare him free of his "beanism".

After the payment of the relevant fee, an entrance examination would follow, carried out by a [[professor]], and the matriculation by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university.

Normally a party would be held at the expense of the newly matriculated student or students, which would obviously be a significant burden for them. This custom was maintained even after the deposition had been abolished and would often be used excessively, leading to the prohibition of forcing the new students to participate in these parties.

==Duties and responsibilities==

In the Middle Ages, the deposition was led by the Rector, as the students in question would live and study under [[monasticism|monastery]]-like circumstances.

In the [[Early Modern period]], as the schools lost their ecclesiastical character and their finances were reduced, the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Faculty of Arts (later called the Faculty of Philosophy) would take over the task. In this faculty, the basic scholarly concepts (''[[septem artes liberales]]'') were taught. The teachers and the Dean were, as a rule, students in the "higher" faculties of [[medicine]], [[theology]] or [[law]]. It was during the Early Modern period that the custom of deposition slowly deteriorated into a farce. The position of depositor was taken over by the "[[pedell]]"; at the end of the 17th century, he would still demonstrate the tools and make out the deposition certificate for a fee.

In the 18th century, the responsibilities and duties of the depositor were still included in the statutes of a university determined by the ruler of the country. There were also detailed prescriptions on how to keep the tools.

The last known depositor at the [[University of Marburg]] was the pedell Johannes Georg Schimmelpfeng (1697–1785). In Jena, the deposition was abolished after the death of the last depositor in 1785. At the University of Leipzig, the deposition was prohibited by 1719, because of the excesses of the students.

==Book printers==
In the late Middle Ages, the new craft of book printing would be established in the vicinity of universities, and the printers – who, at the time, had no old traditions of their own – would borrow the custom of deposition. The deposition of book printers was abolished in 1803 because of the excesses.  A reminder of it still exists in the custom of ''[[Gautschen]]''.

The '''Dr. Fox effect''' is a [[correlation]] observed between teacher expressiveness, content coverage, student evaluation and student achievement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Donald H. Naftulin, John E. Ware, Jr., and Frank A. Donnelly, [http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/r30034/PSY4180/Pages/Naftulin.html "The Doctor Fox Lecture: A Paradigm of Educational Seduction"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209144510/http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/r30034/PSY4180/Pages/Naftulin.html |date=February 9, 2008 }}, ''Journal of Medical Education'' 48 (1973): 630-635; R. Williams and J. Ware, "Validity of student ratings of instruction under different incentive conditions: A further study of the Dr. Fox effect", ''Journal of Educational Psychology'' 68 (1976): 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect also allows insight to other related effects, such as those discussed below, and relationships between student achievement and evaluations of the teacher.

==Experiment==
The original experiment was conducted at the [[The University of Southern California|University of Southern California School of Medicine]] in 1970 in which two speakers gave lectures to a classroom of MDs and PhDs ([[psychiatrists]] and [[psychologists]]) on an irrelevant topic. The topic, "Mathematical Game Theory as Applied to Physician Education", was chosen to eliminate the factor that the students being lectured may know information about the actual subject. Students were divided into two separate classrooms; one classroom would be lectured by an actual scientist and the other by an actor, [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]], who was given the identity "Dr. Myron L. Fox", a graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

In the first half of the study the actor was instructed to teach his material in a more monotoned and inexpressive voice. This lecture was then compared to the control lecture by the scientist. After the lectures, the students were tested on the information they had learned and the students who attended the lecture taught by the scientist learned more about the material, and performed better on the examination.

However, when both "Dr. Myron L. Fox" and the scientist presented their material in an engaging, expressive, and enthusiastic manner, the students rated Dr. Fox just as highly as the genuine professor. This lack of correlation between content-coverage and ratings under conditions of high expressiveness became known as the Dr. Fox Effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Dr. Fox effect: a study of lecturer effectiveness and ratings of instruction |journal=Journal of Medical Education|volume=50|issue=2|pages=149–56|pmid=1120118|year=1975|last1=Ware Jr|first1=J. E|last2=Williams|first2=R. G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a critique of [[student evaluations]] of teaching, professor of law Deborah Merritt summarized the "Dr. Fox effect" as it was observed in the first experiments: "The experimenters created a meaningless lecture on 'Mathematical Game Theory as Applied to Physician Education,' and coached the actor to deliver it 'with an excessive use of double talk, neologisms, non sequiturs, and contradictory statements.' At the same time, the researchers encouraged the actor to adopt a lively demeanor, convey warmth toward his audience, and intersperse his nonsensical comments with humor. ... The actor fooled not just one, but three separate audiences of professional and graduate students. Despite the emptiness of his lecture, fifty-five psychiatrists, psychologists, educators, graduate students, and other professionals produced evaluations of Dr. Fox that were overwhelmingly positive. ... The disturbing feature of the Dr. Fox study, as the experimenters noted, is that Fox’s nonverbal behaviors so completely masked a meaningless, jargon-filled, and confused presentation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/lawreview/vol82/iss1/6  "Bias, the Brain, and Student Evaluations of Teaching"], ''Merritt, Deborah J''.

A 1980 study found that prestige of research could even be increased by confounding writing style, with research competency being positively correlated to reading difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/marketing_papers/117/ |title="Unintelligible Management Research and Academic Prestige" by J. Scott Armstrong |publisher=Repository.upenn.edu |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal evidence has since been reported nowadays by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/confession-of-an-economist-writing-to-impress-rather-than-inform |title=Hakes, David R. "Confession of an Economist: Writing to Impress Rather than Inform." Econ Journal Watch 6.3 (2009): 349-351 |publisher=Econ Journal Watch |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent research ==

=== Study of Air Force Academy ===
In this study, students were randomly assigned to professors, to eliminate the possibility of good students receiving better professors. These professors were then given all the same [[syllabi]], curriculum levels, and final exams so the difficulty was even across the board. There was also a follow-up course given to the students to test the value of deep learning that the students received. These professors taught introductory calculus to a group of over 10,000 students to achieve the proper information.

When the evaluations came through, the professors who were less experienced and less qualified had the best evaluations and best performances on the final exam. However the students who attended the examinations given by the more qualified and experienced professors did best on the follow-up examination. This brought speculation that the professors who were more experienced taught more of a broad manner of the material to produce a deeper understanding. This became obvious in the follow-up examinations.

The results showed that the professors who instilled a deeper meaning of the material appeared worse on the initial exam and evaluations, but in the long run received better academic standing. This finding calls into question the validity of student evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201305/do-the-best-professors-get-the-worst-ratings|title = Study of Air Force Academy Cadets|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eyal Peer and Elisha Babad ===
Criticisms of the original study include the experiment's lack of a control group, the use of a "Yes/No" scale, and lack of measurement evaluating learning among the participants. In a recent study published in the ''[[Journal of Educational Psychology]]'', researchers Eyal Peer of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and Elisha Babad of [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] recreated the original 1973 study taking these criticisms into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn = 2174409|title = The Doctor Fox Research (1973) Re-Revisited: 'Educational Seduction' Ruled Out|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their research, they found that the Dr. Fox effect was still present despite the manipulations they added. Manipulations included the use of a more in-depth questionnaire, removal of the first thirty seconds of video describing the credentials of the lecturer, and a warning at the beginning of the questionnaire to ensure that participants responded honestly.

However, the researchers found that although the students with a charismatic teacher enjoyed the lecture more, they reported that they had not actually learned anything new. This is in contrast to the original study, which argued that people attending the lecture actually believed they were learning new material. From their research they were able to reason that an enthusiastic speaker may entertain an audience, but much more is required to be a successful teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201405/the-return-dr-fox|title = The Return of Dr. Fox|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Halo effect ==
The [[Halo effect]] shares similar qualities to those of the Dr. Fox effect in relation to student evaluations of teachers. The halo effect is a cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we feel and think about his or her character.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hugh Feeley, Thomas (2002). Evidence of Halo Effects in Student Evaluations of Communication Instruction. ''Communication Education Volume 51, Issue 3'', 225-236. doi: 10.1080/03634520216519&lt;/ref&gt; For example, attractive-looking people create a halo effect in which we perceive them as kind, smart or successful, but it may not be true because their attractive appearance clouds our judgment of their performance capabilities. In one study examining halo effect on student evaluation, there was a higher rating for teachers who provided more nonverbal immediacy, but the study also found out that a higher evaluation of teachers was related to a greater halo effect.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the Dr. Fox effect study, a similar effect was found when Dr. Fox presented the lecture in an expressive manner.

== Effects of instructor characteristics on student evaluations ==
From the experiment of Dr. Fox effect, the expressiveness of a teacher when delivering lecture material can affect student evaluation of the teacher. Other than that, individual differences among teachers such as personality, popularity, lecture fluency, non verbal behavior, and attractiveness can also have an effect on student evaluation of teachers.

=== Personality ===
Instructor personality is one factor that has been shown to affect course evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, R. L., McKeachie, W. J., &amp; Milholland, J. E. (1963). Correlation of teacher personality variables and student ratings. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 54''(2), 110-117. doi: 10.1037/h0048797&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one study examining the [[Big Five personality traits|big five personality dimensions]], teachers who were perceived to be more extroverted, open, agreeable, and conscientious were evaluated more favorably, whereas teachers who were perceived to be more neurotic were evaluated less favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, C. L. (2011). Student evaluations of teaching: Effects of the Big Five personality traits, grades and the validity hypothesis. ''Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education, 36''(2), 239-249. doi: 10.1080/02602930903308258
&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Murray and colleagues suggested that the effects of instructor personality on student evaluations of instructor vary across the type of course.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Murray, H. G., Rushton, J. P., &amp; Paunonen, S. V. (1990). Teacher personality traits and student instructional ratings in six types of university courses. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 82''(2), 250-261. doi: 10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.250
&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some traits, like a teacher’s leadership, consistently predicted course evaluations, other traits varied across type of course.  For example, a teacher’s sociability positively predicted course evaluations in introductory psychology courses, but not graduate psychology courses, whereas the ambition of an instructor showed the opposite relationship – predicting evaluations of graduate, but not introductory psychology courses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Charisma/popularity ===
The [[charisma]] or popularity of a teacher might also be a factor that contributes to teacher effectiveness and teaching quality. In one study that examined the assessment of charisma as a factor in effective teaching, charismatic teachers tended to receive good student evaluation and were also perceived as being more funny, helpful, encouraging, knowledgeable, sympathetic and other traits that are considered charismatic.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Huang, Y.-C., &amp; Lin, S.-H. (2014). [http://www.ifets.info/journals/17_2/23.pdf Assessment of Charisma as a Factor in Effective Teaching]. ''Educational Technology &amp; Society,17 (2)'', 284–295.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides that, the study of Yun-Chen Huang and Shu-Hui Lin shows that different teaching methods can also increase the charisma rating of a teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, teachers that are perceived to be more charismatic offer explanations, answer questions by students, vary their teaching methods, and are also interested in and express concern for their students and their learning progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Charisma of teachers is becoming more recognized recently with the introduction of an instrument to measure charisma, called "Inventory of Teaching Charisma in the College Classroom" (ICCT).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Lecture fluency ===
The fluency of a lecturer when delivering teaching materials can contribute to the effectiveness of student evaluation of a teacher. According to the study of Shana K. Carpenter and colleague that examine the effect of lecture fluency on learning perception, a lecture that is considered to be fluent suggested that the teacher stood upright and straight, maintained eye contact, and spoke fluidly without notes whereas reasons for considering a lecture disfluent include teachers that are slumped and stand with a bent back, look away, and speak haltingly with notes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Carpenter, S. K., Wilford, M. M., Kornell, N., &amp; Mullaney, K. M. (2013). Appearances can be deceiving: Instructor fluency increases perceptions of learning without increasing actual learning.''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 20'', 1350-1356. doi: 10.3758/s13423-013-0442-z&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the study also shows that fluent teachers that are prepared and well organized will receive higher ratings than a disfluent teacher that is unprepared and disorganized in student evaluations of the teacher.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the same study of lecture fluency on learning perception successfully shows that lecture fluency will increase the student rating of a teacher, further interpretation of the results suggests that lecture fluency biases the students’ perceptions of their own learning because lecture fluency did not actually affect the amount of information learned.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Non-verbal behavior ===
Non verbal behavior or non verbal communication is a series of wordless behavior that is projected by the speaker to the listener. Common examples of non verbal behavior include eye contact, smile, facial expression, distance between speaker and listener and any other wordless behavior that can communicate information between people. According to Virginia P. Richmond on 'Teacher Nonverbal Immediacy', teachers that show more positive nonverbal behavior increase the immediacy between students and also contribute to higher student rating.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Virginia P. Richmond. "[http://www.uab.edu/Communicationstudies/richmond_files/Richmond%20Teacher%20Nonverbal%20Immediacy.pdf Chapter 6: Teacher Nonverbal Immediacy]". West Virginia University. Retrieved 2014-11-6.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, teachers with higher rating by students were more likely to express non verbal behavior like smiling, walking around, head nodding and touching upper torsos whereas low rating teachers were more likely to touch their head, head shaking rather than nodding, and sitting on a chair.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One study by Ambady and Rosenthal shows that subjects were able to form accurate judgement of impression by just watching short video clips of teachers providing non verbal behavior.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Ambady, Nalini; Rosenthal, Robert(1993). Half a minute: Predicting teacher evaluations from thin slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 64(3), ''431-441. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.64.3.431&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the study, participants were able to form accurate impressions of the teachers by just watching 10-second, 5-second, and 2-second lengths of short clips about teachers walking to classrooms. Ambady research provides support that nonverbal behavior has a strong influence on impression formation of teachers.

=== Attire/appearance ===
The way that teachers present themselves or the attire they wear when teaching lectures can be a factor on student evaluation of teachers. According to Virginia P. Richmond, the attire of a teacher influences the way that students perceive their teacher.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, teachers are perceived to be more competent, organized, prepared and knowledgeable when they dress formally with a coat and tie but they are also presumed to be not receptive to students' needs and low in student–teacher interaction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, when teachers dress casually with collar-button shirts and jeans, they are perceived to be more friendly, flexible, fair and open but not so competent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; From another study about predicting teacher evaluation from physical appearance, attire and appearance may be a factor influencing the rating by students but the effect will somewhat diminish when other more important and significant information is provided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For instance, the study found out that unattractive voices dilute the effects of attractive faces of teachers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Background of Dr. Fox experiment==

=== Authors ===
* Dr. Naftulin is associate professor and director of the Division of Continuing Education in Psychiatry, University of Southern California School of Medicine
* Mr. Ware is assistant professor of medical education and health care planning and director of research and evaluation, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine
* Mr. Donnelly is an instructor in psychiatry (psychology) in the USC Division of Continuing Education in Psychiatry&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Actor ===
The actor portraying Dr. Fox  was given one day to prepare for the lecture and was coached by the authors to present the lecture "with an excessive use of double-talk, neologisms, non sequiturs, and contradicting statements.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201405/the-return-dr-fox|title = The Return of Dr. Fox|date = May 5, 2014|accessdate = November 19, 2014|website = Psychology Today|publisher = Media Spotlight|last = Vitelli|first = Romeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation ===
There are previous reports and studies that show that the personality of a teacher/lecturer is one of the most important variables when it comes to evaluating the teacher’s effectiveness. Getzels and Jackson, with support from Wallen and Travers, expressed that the personality and patterns of teacher behavior and methods presented represent the main forces for the  most significant variable in evaluating the teacher’s effectiveness. Goffman explains that the receptivity of the audience is highly influenced by the person introducing the lecture, the quality of the introduction, and the speaker’s involuntary expressive behavior, which becomes a decisive factor in how the audience responds to the conveying information. One study which looked at the student perceptions of educators from 7th to 12th grade and reported that the students regarded “teacher charisma or popularity” as the most important characteristic when rating teachers.

If the charisma or popularity of the teachers have such an effect on their effectiveness ratings by junior high and high school students, would the ratings be influenced in the same way with a group of highly trained professional educators in a learning situation? So what the authors were looking to see is that if a sufficiently impressive lecture was given, would it result in an experienced group of high end educators participating in a new learning situation feeling satisfied that they had learned from the lecture despite irrelevant, conflicting, and meaningless content conveyed by the lecturer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Education in [[Barbados]]''' is based primarily on the [[Education in England|British model]].

There are presently:
*1 infant school,
*4 public nursery schools,
*71 public primary schools,
*2 assisted special schools,
*20 registered private schools,
*23 public secondary schools,
*7 assisted private secondary schools,

;3 tertiary-level institutions
*UWI Cave Hill
*Barbados Community College (BCC)
*The Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic (SJPP)
*1 teachers' training institution
*1 central administrative agency

;2 departments, namely:
*Audio Visual Aids and School Meals Department
*The Education Project Implementation Unit

In addition, there is 1 public senior school

'''Academic Term'''

The Barbadian school year is fashioned after the British system, and as such, it follows a scheduling with three terms per school year.

The first term begins the second week of September and continues for 15 weeks adjourning in mid-December excluding one week for Mid Term Break in Mid-October. The second Term begins in the first week of January and continues for 12 weeks ending the end of March. The final Third Term begins mid-April and continues for 11 weeks until the end of June.

The School Holiday period is 9 to 10 weeks long from the end of June until the first week of September.

Education is provided free of charge and is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16, and attendance is strictly enforced.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/barbados.htm "Barbados"].

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, the gross primary enrollment rate was 90.4 percent.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

It was reported that Barbados has spent roughly US$15 billion on Education since Independence in 1966. In 2006 during the inaugural Cecil F. deCaires Memorial Lecture at the Frank Collymore Hall, the former Central Bank Governor Sir [[Courtney Blackman]] remarked that between 1966 and 2000 successive Governments (of Barbados) had spent US$15 billion on education costs – "a remarkable investment for such a small state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Alleyne |title=NO WAY OUT |trans-title=|url=http://www.nationnews.com/286463873011668.php |work=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |date=2006-07-02 |accessdate=16 August 2009 |quote=THE DAYS OF FULL GOVERNMENT FUNDING for university education in Barbados is all but over.  This is the prediction of former Central Bank Governor Sir Courtney Blackman.  Speaking at the inaugural Cecil F. deCaires Memorial Lecture at Frank Collymore Hall on Wednesday night, Sir Courtney said few nations outstrip Barbados' spending to make education affordable.  He said between 1966 and 2000 successive Governments had spent US$15 billion on education costs - "a remarkable investment for such a small state".  "Government has begun to feel the fiscal burden of one of the world's most extravagant commitments to education," he said. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526022909/http://www.nationnews.com/286463873011668.php |archivedate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Ronald Jones as the Minister of Education and Human Resource Development said the Barbados government spent $290 million to upgrade the schools with information technology.  Given this Jones said the ministry would be entering a grading processes for schools on their usage of the technology using a scale of 1 to 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schools to be graded on computer use |trans-title=|url=http://www.cbc.bb/index.pl/article?id=4590779 |agency=[[Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=CBC |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=16 August 2009 |quote=Some 290 million dollars has been spent equipping schools with the relevant technologies but Minister of Education and Human Resource Development Ronald Jones says he is not yet satisfied with the use of information and communication technology in primary and secondary schools in Barbados.  Although millions of dollars have been invested in education hardware and software upgrades, Education Minister Ronald Jones says many schools across the island are not fully using the systems.  He says schools across the island will soon receive a one to six certification grade based on how well they use the technologies available in the administrative and teaching processes.  "If you are just simply using it for administrative purposes you might end up with a grade 1.  "THE highest point is where the full and total integration, where students are using it in the production of their work." |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307191602/http://cbc.bb/index.pl/article?id=4590779|dead-url=yes |archivedate=2016-03-07}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arlie Russell Hochschild]], who introduced the term in 1979, distinguished emotion work – unpaid emotional work that a person undertakes in private life  – from [[emotional labor]]: emotional work done in a paid work setting.&lt;ref name=Hochschild_1979&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 551–575 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | date = November 1979 | jstor = 2778583 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie R. |chapter=Ideology and emotion management: A perspective and path for future research|editor-last=Kemper |editor-first=Theodore D.|title=Research agendas in the sociology of emotions|pages=117&amp;ndash;142|location=Albany, NY|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0269-6|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotion work has use value and occurs in situations in which people choose to regulate their emotions for their own non-compensated benefit (e.g., in their interactions with family and friends). By contrast, emotional labor has exchange value because it is traded and performed for a wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callahan|first1=Jamie L.|last2=McCollun|first2=Eric E.|chapter=Obscured variability: The distinction between emotion work and emotional labor|editor-last1=Ashkanasy|editor-first1=Neal M.|editor-last2=Zerbe|editor-first2=Wilfred J.|editor-last3=Haertel|editor-first3=Charmine E.

In a later development, Hochschild distinguished between two broad types of emotion work, and among three techniques of emotion work.&lt;ref name=Hochschild_1990&gt;{{citation | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | contribution = Ideology and emotion management: a perspective and path for future research | editor-last = Kemper | editor-first = Theodore D. | title = Research agendas in the sociology of emotions | pages = 117–144 | publisher = [[State University of New York Press]] | location = Albany | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780585092379 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HkHgh2isxHIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=ARLIE+RUSSELL+HOCHSCHILD+emotion+work&amp;ots=U6qWOvm4dv&amp;sig=H5ZImY1DgQowyuIKXtKuHPezri0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; The two broad types involve evocation and suppression of emotion, while the three techniques of emotion work that Hochschild describes are cognitive, bodily and expressive.&lt;ref name=Hochschild_1990 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Peterson | first = Gretchen | contribution = Managing emotions | editor-last1 = Turner | editor-first1 = Jonathan H. | editor-last2 = Stets | editor-first2 = Jan E. | editor-link1 = Jonathan H.

However, the concept (if not the term) has been traced back as far as [[Aristotle]]: as Aristotle saw, the problem is not with emotionality, but with the ''appropriateness'' of emotion and its expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | author-link = Daniel Goleman | contribution = Aristotle's challenge | editor-last = Goleman | editor-first = Daniel | editor-link = Daniel Goleman | title = Emotional intelligence: why it can matter more than IQ | page = xiv | publisher = Bantam Books | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780553375060 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Examples of emotion work include showing affection, apologizing after an argument, bringing up problems that need to be addressed in an [[intimate relationship]] or any kind of [[interpersonal relationship]], and making sure the household runs smoothly.

Emotion work also involves the orientation of self/others to accord with accepted [[norm (social)|norm]]s of emotional expression: emotion work is often performed by family members and friends, who put pressure on individuals to conform to emotional norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1= Ruberg | first1= Willemijn | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1= Ruberg | editor-first1= Willemijn | editor-last2= Steenbergh | editor-first2= Kristine | title = Sexed sentiments: interdisciplinary perspectives on gender and emotion | page = 9 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9789042032415 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, then, an individual's ultimate obeisance and/or resistance to aspects of emotion regimes are made visible in their emotion work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ruberg | first = Odette | contribution = Divine providence and resignation: the role of religion in the management of emotions of the Anglo-Irish Countess of Dunraven, Caroline Wydham-Quin (1790-1870) | editor-last1= Ruberg | editor-last2= Steenbergh | title = Sexed sentiments: interdisciplinary perspectives on gender and emotion | page = 75 | year = 2010 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural norms often imply that emotion work is reserved for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | contribution = Gendered sexualities | editor-last = Kimmel | editor-first = Michael S. | editor-link = Michael Kimmel | title = The gendered society | pages = 237–238 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780195149753 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly evidence to the effect that the emotional management that women and men do is asymmetric;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Oliker | contribution = Women friends and marriage work | editor-last = Oliker | title = Best friends and marriage: exchange among women | page = 144 | year = 1989 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in general, women come into a marriage groomed for the role of emotional manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Goleman | author-link = Daniel Goleman | contribution = Intimate enemies | title = Emotional intelligence | editor-last = Goleman | editor-link = Daniel Goleman | page = 132 | year = 1995  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The social theorist, Victor Jeleniewski Seidler, argues that women's emotion work is merely another demonstration of [[false consciousness]] under [[patriarchy]], and that emotion work, as a concept, has been adopted, adapted or criticized to such an extent that it is in danger of becoming a "catch-all-cliché".&lt;ref name=Seidler&gt;{{citation | last = Seidler | first = Victor J. | contribution = Masculinity, violence and emotional life | editor-last1 = Williams | editor-first1 = Simon J. | editor-last2 = Bendelow | editor-first2 = Gillian | editor-link1 = Simon Williams (sociologist) | title = Emotions in social life: critical themes and contemporary issues | pages = 209–210 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780203437452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the concept of emotion work has itself been criticized as a wide over-simplification of mental processes such as [[Psychological repression|repression]] and [[denial]] which continually occur in everyday life.&lt;ref name=Seidler /&gt;

==Literary analogues==
[[Rousseau]] in ''[[The New Heloise]]'' suggests that the attempt to master instrumentally one's affective life always results in a weakening and eventually the fragmentation of one's identity, even if the emotion work is performed at the demand of ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ferrara | author-link = Alessandro Ferrara | contribution = Beyond the limits of autonomy Rousseau's ethic of authenticity: B The limits of autonomy | editor-last = Ferrara | editor-link = Alessandro Ferrara | title = Modernity and authenticity: a study in the social and ethical thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau | page = 104 | year = 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esprit Lodge''' is an historic lodge and [[hostel]] accommodation near [[Fort-Coulonge, Quebec|Fort Coulonge]], a village in the [[Pontiac Regional County Municipality, Quebec|Pontiac Regional County Municipality]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].

Jesuit settler Father Dablon, superior of the missions of the [[Algonquian peoples|Upper Algonkin]] in 1670, made note of the importance of the area with respect to the many tribes of the aboriginal [[Odawa people|Ottawa]] peoples who inhabited the region.

Originally, the area prospered as a [[logging]] settlement, but in the years since 1982, when the last of the log drives occurred, [[ecotourism]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Schulte-Peevers, Becca Blond, Kerryn Burgess, Pete Cruttenden: [https://books.google.com/books?id=IG4LaUrBH2EC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=esprit+lodge&amp;source=web&amp;ots=npWpM4Q200&amp;sig=mBcoTcz-sNDhkrafIgfEf0DB7Ak&amp;hl=en "Lonely Planet: Canada"], Paperback, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rafting|white water rafting]]&lt;ref&gt;Hap Wilson: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1550464388 "Rivers of the Upper Ottawa Valley: Myth, Magic and Adventure"], Paperback&lt;/ref&gt; have become the prominent attractions for travelers here. Adventure guides from Esprit Lodge lead tours of the region including the [[Coulonge Chutes]] and along the [[Cycloparc PPJ]],&lt;ref&gt;Pontiac Tourism Guide: [http://tourisme.mrcpontiac.qc.ca/en/agenda/evenement_135_official+opening+of+the+ppj+cyclopark.html "Official opening of the PPJ Cyclopark"], May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a major eastern Canadian hiking and bicycle trail.

The area is rich in history with respect to the French settlement of Canada and was written about and explored by early [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries who noted the tradition and heritage of [[canoeing]] via the [[Ottawa River]].

{{Quote|"Father Le Mercier (Jes. Rel. 1654), speaking of a flotilla of canoes from the "upper nations," says that they were "partly Ondataouaouat, of the [[Algonquin language|Algonquine]] language, whom we call les Cheueux Releuez." And in the Relation for 1665 the same Father says of the Ottawa that they were better merchants than warriors."
|Claude Bélanger|''[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/OttawaIndians-CanadianHistory.htm The Quebec History Encyclopedia]&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/OttawaIndians-CanadianHistory.htm "The Quebec History Encyclopedia"], Claude Bélanger, Marianopolis.edu&lt;/ref&gt;''}}
&lt;!-- Logging to Ecotourism--&gt;
Esprit Rafting was selected as the 'second best outfitter on Earth' by ''[[National Geographic Adventure (magazine)|National Geographic Adventure]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sudbury Star]]: [http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/Archive.aspx?text=Esprit+rafting "Que. whitewater outfit among world's best"], 11-10-2007, 375 words&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities, education, certification &amp; training==
In addition to rafting trips and canoeing outfitting services provided in the region, Esprit Lodge is the only hostel accommodation in Canada offering [[Wilderness first aid]] (Kayak) and [[Swiftwater rescue]] courses and accreditation. Students from around the world travel here to learn hands-on techniques about [[sustainable tourism|sustainable travel]] through instructors and staff who encourage an adherence to the principles of [[Leave No Trace]].

Some rivers used for training, education and exploration purposes include the [[Ottawa River]], [[Petawawa River|Petawawa]], [[Magnetawan River|Magnetawan]], [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]] and [[Kipawa River|Kipawa]].

Specific levels of instruction and certification programs include: [[Wilderness First Responder]], Whitewater Rescue Technician (WRT 1) - Level 1, [[Swiftwater rescue|Swiftwater Rescue]] Level 1 (SRT 1) and Level 2 (SRT 2), [[Riverboarding]], Guide Training Level 1 and ORCA Moving water.

==History==
Esprit Rafting launched in 1992, having received a loan from ''Société d'aide au développement des collectivités'' (S.A.D.C.) as part of a regional effort to promote economic development in Canadian rural areas through business loans.&lt;ref&gt;The Equity: [http://www.theequity.ca/ "Esprit rafting to be featured in commercial"], Wednesday, May 14th, 2008, print edition&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, Esprit has become internationally known for [[adventure travel]] expeditions throughout the Ottawa River system, [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]] and other destinations.

The proprietors of Esprit Lodge operate several [[microphilanthropy|micro-philanthropy]] ventures in [[Jalcomulco]], Mexico, concentrating on promoting the core values of [[ecotourism]]. Locally, the Hermanos project has resulted in the establishment of the first community [[Internet café]], a photo business, a rafting company along with Esprit's winter operation employing local adventure [[guide]]s and a [[museum]].

Esprit Lodge has hosted numerous significant adventure races, including one of the first [http://www.raidthenorth.com Raid the North] [[adventure racing|adventure races]] in 1999, the Canadian Adventure Racing Championship in 2005, and many other events in partnership with [[Frontier Adventure Sports &amp; Training|Frontier Adventure Sports]], Canada's leading adventure race provider.

==Transportation==
Travel to Esprit is via the provincial [[Quebec Route 148]], the [[Cycloparc PPJ]] bicycle trail or by the Ottawa River itself.

'''Fondation Chirezi''' ('''FOCHI''') is a local non-governmental organisation established in the [[African Great Lakes]] Region by Floribert Kazingufu Kasirusiru (Flory Zozo). The core objective of FOCHI is to build a campaign for a non-killing society in the Great Lakes Region - eastern parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) which has suffered both the [[Second Congo War]] and terrible waves of [[genocide]] in both [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Since the early 1990s the African Great Lakes region –  defined here as the Democratic Republic of Congo  (DRC), Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania – has  been convulsed by genocide, civil wars, inter-state  conflict and flawed democratic transitions.    With UN-sponsored peace processes underway in  DRC and Burundi and projects of state and societal  reconstruction apparently advancing in Rwanda and  Uganda, there are hopes that the epoch of violence  and exploitation in the African Great Lakes region is  finally drawing to an end."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-051.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

FOCHI is a local non-governmental initiative and has so far conducted seminars of ministers of religion and teachers, to create awareness and shift entrenched attitudes. FOCHI, with priority concern for women and children, is building local projects. The first is [[Farm of Hope School]] for orphans and children of single parent families at [[Kiliba]], DRC, a border crossing town on the [[Ruzizi River]], near the [[Burundi]] capital of [[Bujumbura]].  FOCHI's second project is a Women's Trauma and Care Centre in [[Bukavu]], the capital of [[Sud-Kivu]] Province in the DRC, managed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928073430/http://ourcongo.net/women/bukavu/index.htm Women Against Violence]. The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo#Status of women|situation of women in and around Bukavu]] has become perilous in the period of the [[Second Congo War]] and its aftermath.

In July 2007 three communities working under the FOCHI umbrella - Kiliba [[Farm of Hope School]], the Bukavu Women's Trauma and Care Centre, and Nyangezi (seeking community radio for youth) formed a [https://web.archive.org/web/20111001213706/http://www.ourcongo.net/documents/070801jointcommunities.doc Self-Empowering Network (SEN)] to define their approach to development and mutual help.

Studies have shown that Fooya is able to induce children and young adults to improve their dietary choices&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicinex.stanford.edu/conf/submission/view/343|author=[[Stanford]] MedicineX|date=6 July 2015|title=Neuropsychology based Behavior Design through Mobile Health Gaming|publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2014.obesityweek.com/wp/uploads/2014/10/TOS-Posters.pdf|publisher=[[The Obesity Society]]|author1=Johnston, Craig | author2=Moreno, Jennette |title=A Nutrition Education Mobile Game Impacts Snack Selection in Middle School Students|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for overall positive effects on their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/print-edition/2013/05/31/friendslearn-shows-food-fights-can-be.html?page=all|title=FriendsLearn Show Food Fights can be Educational|publisher=[[Silicon Valley]] [[American City Business Journals]]|date = 31 May 2013|author=Cromwell Schubarth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/feeding-health-tips-through-gaming/article5068544.ece|title=Feeding Health Tips through Gaming|publisher=[[The Hindu]] Business Line|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following peer review, evidence of statistically significant health outcomes measured during two [[Randomized experiment|randomized]] [[Scientific control|controlled]] [[clinical trial]]s conducted by researchers at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] Children's Nutrition Research Center and of one longitudinal trial, by researchers from [[Kaiser Permanente]] and the [[Bernard A. Harris]] Foundation, have been presented at leading academic medical conferences. Results of the underlying mechanisms in Fooya have been presented at the 2015 MedicineX Conference at the [[Stanford School of Medicine]],&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt; 2015 Biennial Childhood Obesity Conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childhoodobesity2015.com/docs/COC15-ProgramGuide-v1.pdf|publisher=2015 Childhood Obesity Conference|title=Impact of a Neuropsychology based approach to behavior design through mobile gaming (pg 68)|date=28 June 2015|author=Childhood Obesity Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 Child Health Bay Area Conference at [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] School of Medicine and the 2014 [[The Obesity Society|ObesityWeek Conference]]&lt;ref name="obesityweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2014.obesityweek.com/wp/uploads/2014/10/TOS-Posters.pdf|publisher=[[The Obesity Society]]|author=2014 ObesityWeek Abstract Book|title=A Nutrition Education Mobile Game Impacts Snack Selection in Middle School Students|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior design==
Fooya is designed to deliver health outcomes through behavior as a result of underlying theoretical models from [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].

Innovations within Fooya as it pertains to 'learnified' gaming were presented at the 2014 [[Stanford]] MedicineX Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicinex.stanford.edu/conf/a/medx2014/conference/event/425|publisher=[[Stanford School of Medicine]]|title=Scalable Behavior Design through Mobile Gaming|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a session titled "Scalable Behavior Design through Mobile Gaming". The session focused on scientifically validated mobile content platforms as possible solutions for global health issues, as well as a case study of Fooya and lessons learned for digital health gaming. The impact of Fooya among 6th grade students from [[YES Prep Public Schools]] in [[Houston]] ([[Texas]]), was measured through a study by Scientists at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]]'s Children's Nutrition Research Center.

{{Glossary of education-related terms TOC}}P

==S==

* '''[[Sail training]]:''' From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when [[maritime nation]]s would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see [[Outward Bound]]), sail training provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water.  Through the unique environment of the [[sea]], contemporary sail trainees learn that what they are doing is important and that their efforts are essential to the operation and safety of the ship.
* '''[[School]]:''' A place designated for [[learning]]. The range of [[institution]]s covered by the term varies from [[country]] to country.
* '''[[School bus]]:''', A [[bus]] used to transport [[children]] and [[adolescents]] to and from [[school]]. The first school bus was horse-drawn, introduced in 1827 by [[George Shillibeer]] for a Quaker school at [[Abney Park Cemetery|Abney Park]] in [[Stoke Newington]], [[London]], and was designed to carry twenty-five children. Since then, school buses of many types have become widespread, and motorised, and are used in all parts of the world.
* '''[[School counselor]]:''' A practitioner who meets the needs of students in three basic educational domains: academic development, career development, and personal/social development. This is accomplished through the implementation of a comprehensive school counseling program that promotes and enhances student achievement through a guidance curriculum, individual planning strategies, responsive services and comprehensive school counseling program support/advocacy.
* '''[[School discipline]]:''' A form of [[discipline]] found in [[school]]s. The term refers to students complying with a code of behaviour often known as the school rules.  Among other things these rules may set out the expected standards of [[clothing]], timekeeping, social behaviour and work ethic.  The term may also be applied to the punishment that is the consequence of transgression of the code of behaviour.  For this reason the usage of ''school discipline'' sometimes means ''punishment for breaking school rules'' rather than behaving within the school rules.
* '''[[School psychologist]]:''' A practitioner who applies his [[psychology|psychological]] training to assess and help school children.
* '''[[Science education]]:''' The field concerned with sharing [[science]] content and process with individuals not traditionally considered part of the scientific community.  The target individuals may be children, college students, or adults within the general public.  The field of science education comprises science content, some [[sociology]], and some teaching [[pedagogy]].
* '''[[Science fair]]:''' Generally a competition where contestants create a project related to [[science]] or some scientific phenomenon. Science fairs usually are involved with [[children]] and [[school]]ing; however, the term can be used to describe science fairs independent of the age of the contestants involved. They are often also combined with competition in [[mathematics]] or [[history]].
* '''[[Secondary education]]:''' is a period of [[education]] which, in most contemporary [[educational system]]s of the world, follows directly after [[primary education]], and which may be followed by [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "post-secondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g., [[university]]). In [[Australia]] and other countries ''secondary schools'' is the official term for institutions offering this period of education. In other parts of the English-speaking world, [[secondary school]] is often used synonymously with secondary education.
* '''[[Self-concept]]:''' (or '''self-identity''') The [[mind|mental]] and conceptual awareness and persistent regard that [[Sentience|sentient]] beings hold with regard their own [[being]]. Components of a being's self-concept include [[physical science|physical]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[sociology|social]] attributes; and can be influenced by its [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[habituation|habit]]s, [[belief]]s and [[idea]]s. These components and attributes can each be condensed to the general concepts of [[self-image]] and the [[self-esteem]].
* '''[[Self-efficacy]]:''' The belief that one has the capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to manage prospective situations. Unlike [[efficacy]], which is the power to produce an effect (in essence, [[Skill|competence]]), self-efficacy is the belief (however accurate) that one has the power to produce that effect.
:It is important here to understand the distinction between [[self-esteem]] and self efficacy. Self-esteem relates to a person’s sense of self-worth, whereas self efficacy relates to a person’s perception of their ability to reach a goal. For example, say a person is a terrible [[rock climber]]. They would likely have a poor efficacy in regard to [[rock climbing]], but this wouldn’t need to affect their self-esteem; most people don’t invest much of their self-esteem in this activity.

* '''[[Self-esteem]]:''' (or '''self-worth''') Includes a person's subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative to some degree.
* '''[[Service learning]]:''' A method of teaching, learning and reflecting that combines academic classroom curriculum with meaningful [[youth service]] throughout the [[community]].  As a teaching methodology, it falls under the category of [[experiential education]]. More specifically, it integrates meaningful community service with instruction and [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, encourage lifelong [[civic engagement]], and strengthen communities.
* '''[[Sex education]]:''' [[Education]] about [[sexual reproduction]] in human beings, [[sexual intercourse]] and other aspects of [[human sexual behavior]].
* '''[[Situated learning]]:''' [[Education]] that takes place in a setting functionally identical to that where the learning will be applied.
* '''[[Skill]]:''' An ability, usually [[learning|learned]], to perform actions.
* '''[[Social constructionism]]:''' A [[sociological theory]] of [[knowledge]] developed by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] with their 1966 book, ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.  The focus of social constructionism is to uncover the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the creation of their perceived reality.  As an approach, it involves looking at the ways social phenomena are created, institutionalized, and made into [[tradition]] by humans.  Socially constructed reality is seen as an ongoing, dynamic process; reality is re-produced by people acting on their [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s and their knowledge of it.
* '''[[Sociology of knowledge]]:''' The study of the social origins of ideas, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. (Compare [[history of ideas]].)
* '''[[Sociology of scientific knowledge]]:''' ('''SSK''') Closely related to the [[sociology of science]], considers social influences on [[science]].  Practitioners ([[sociology|sociologists]], [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]], [[history of science|historians of science]], [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[computer science|computer scientists]]) have engaged in controversy concerning the role that social factors play in scientific development relative to [[Rationality|rational]], [[empirical]] and other factors.
* '''[[Socratic method]]:''' (or '''method of elenchos''' or '''Socratic debate''') A [[dialectic]] method of inquiry, largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts and first described by [[Plato]] in the ''[[Socratic Dialogues]]''. For this, [[Socrates]] is customarily regarded as the father and fountainhead for [[ethics]] or moral philosophy.
:It is a form of [[philosophy|philosophical]] enquiry.  It involves two or more speakers, usually with one as the master (or wise one) and the others as students or fools.  The method is credited to [[Socrates]], who began to engage in such discussion with his fellow [[Athens|Athenians]] after a visit to the [[Delphic Sibyl|Oracle of Delphi]].

* '''[[Special education]]:''', describes an [[alternative education|educational alternative]] that focuses on the [[teaching]] of students with academic, behaviorial, health, or physical needs that cannot sufficiently be met using traditional educational programs or techniques.
* '''[[Sphere of knowledge]]:''' A unified body or collection of knowledge regarding a specific subject, interest or otherwise area of expertise possessed by an individual.
* '''[[STEM fields]]:''' The '''Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields''' are collectively considered core technological underpinnings of an advanced society.  In many forums (including political/governmental and academic) the strength of the STEM workforce is viewed as an indicator of a nation's ability to sustain itself.  Maintaining healthy levels of its citizenry well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the [[United States of America]] at all levels, and substantial lobbying is underway in [[Washington, DC]] to raise awareness of STEM education issues.
* '''[[Stipend]]:''' A form of payment or salary, such as for an [[intern]]ship or [[apprenticeship]]. Stipends are usually lower than what would be expected as a permanent salary for similar work. This is because the stipend is complemented by other benefits such as instruction, work experience, food, accommodation, and personal satisfaction. Universities usually refer to monies paid to graduate research assistants as a stipend, rather than as wages, to reflect complementary benefits.
* '''[[Student]]:''' [[etymology|Etymologically]] derived through [[Middle English]] from the [[Latin]] [[Latin conjugation#Active|second-type]] [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] [[verb]] "stŭdērĕ", which [[Meaning (linguistic)#linguistic approaches|means]] "to direct one's zeal at"; hence a '''student''' is one who directs zeal at a subject. Also known as a [[Apprenticeship|disciple]] in the sense of a religious area of study, and/or in the sense of a "discipline" of learning.  In widest use, ''student'' is used to mean a [[school]] or [[school|class]] attendee. In many countries, the word ''student'' is however reserved for higher education or [[university]] students; persons attending classes in primary or secondary schools being called pupils.
* '''[[Student activism]]:''' A form of youth-led [[community organizing]] that is specifically oriented towards engaging students as [[activists]] in order to create change in the educational system.
* '''[[Student-centered learning]]:''' An approach to [[education]] focusing on the needs of the students, rather than those of others involved in the educational process, such as teachers and administrators.  This approach has many implications for the design of curriculum, course content, and interactivity of courses.
* '''[[Student voice]]:''' the distinct perspectives and actions of young people throughout schools focused on education itself.
* '''[[Student loan]]s:''' [[Loan]]s offered to students to assist in payment of the costs of professional [[education]]. These loans usually carry lower interests than other loans, and are usually issued by the [[government]].
* '''[[Student organization]]:''' A voluntary [[Voluntary association|association]] of students at institutions of [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education]] for a specific legal purpose. Such organizations are often sponsored through and receive funding from a [[student government]].
* '''[[Syllabus]]:''' (plural '''''syllabi''''' or '''''syllabuses''''') A [[document]] with an [[Outline (list)|outline]] and summary of topics to be covered in a [[education|course]]. It is often either set out by an [[exam]] board, or prepared by the [[professor]] who teaches the course, and is usually given to each student during the first class session.
* '''[[wikt:Synthesis|Synthesis]]:''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] σύν (with) and θεσις (placing), is commonly understood to be an integration of two or more pre-existing elements which results in a new creation.

The '''Hellenic Naval Academy''' ({{lang-el|Σχολή Ναυτικών Δοκίμων}}, abbr. ΣΝΔ ('''SND'''), lit. "School of Naval Cadets") is a military university  and has the responsibility to educate and suitably train competent Naval Officers for the [[Hellenic Navy]]. Its full name is ''Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy'' and was founded in 1845. The academy is one of the oldest educational institutions in [[Greece]].

The academy educates Deck and Engineering Naval [[cadet]]s. It may also educate Supply Officer cadets as well as Coast Guard Officer cadets. Foreign nationals are also accepted to study as naval cadets in the academy.

==History==
The academy has a long history in naval education. Its presence is closely associated with the foundation and evolution of the Hellenic Navy, covering a period of 150 years of educational work. The Academy was founded in 1845 as a naval training school on board the HN corvette {{Ship|Greek corvette|Loudovikos||2}}. For 50 years, it operated unofficially on board various combat ships, stabilizing its position and improving its work.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SND22.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy. {{puic|Image:Orkomosia.jpg|log=2008 July 13}}]] --&gt;

In 1884, the academy was officially reorganized by the Greek State and new facilities were built to house its operations. At the time, the academy's quarters were on board the HN corvette ''Hellas''.

In 1905 it was transferred to [[Piraeus]], where it has remained ever since. The academy's base was transferred to a new and permanent installation beside the harbour of Piraeus, by the entrance of the main port. The operating conditions were greatly improved by the new quarters and this better facilitated its operation. New cadets were accepted and new Navy ships were appointed to help in the educational process.

Since then, during its 150 years of operation, the Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy has evolved into one of the most prestigious institutions in Greece. More than 5,000 Naval Officers have graduated and led the Hellenic Navy, while many others have distinguished themselves in science, technology and politics. The organization and structure of the academy has made great reforms, always according to the needs of the Hellenic Navy.

==Structure==
{{Hellenic Navy}}
The Academy's organization is divided into two main branches. The first branch deals with education and training and includes four Directorates: The Naval Cadet Administration, the Nautical and Military training, the Athletics and the Academic Studies direcrorate. The second branch is responsible of base support and everything that needs to be done for the academy's proper function.

The academy is commanded by an officer of the higher naval ranks. Issues involving academic studies are examined by the Superior Educational Council, a body formed of academy professors and naval officers under the chairmanship of the Academy Superintendent.

==Admissions==
The screening procedure for the selection of new cadets is based on the established system of national examinations, undertaken by all university candidates in Greece. The Hellenic Naval Academy runs additional health, intelligence and athletic tests on its candidates. About 400 cadets study in the Academy each year. All lessons are taught in Greek and basic training lasts for 4 years.

Greek nationals are admitted to the Hellenic Naval Academy following both: successful participation to the preliminary examination that includes gymnastics, physical and psychological tests and, successful participation to the annual national examinations, operated by the Ministry of Education. The number of admissions is decided by the [[Hellenic Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]], which issues an annual call for applications and always according to the Navy needs.

Foreign nationals are selected primarily by their governments, following bilateral agreements with the [[Greece|Greek state]]. Candidates must provide confirmation, issued by their government, that they have been selected for the particular military academy and must hold a [[birth certificate]], a health certificate and a certificate of education equivalent to the ''Greek Secondary Education Certificate'', required for admission to any ''Highest Educational Institution'' ([[University]]) in Greece.

Upon arrival, the foreign students attend one-year preparatory courses.  The beginners level teaching is conducted in [[Arabic]], English and French. During that year, students take [[Greek language]] courses, [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] fundamental courses and undergo [[military training]]. After the preparatory year, the foreign cadets join the full academic and military 4-year course, following the same program and obligations as their Greek colleagues. The costs of education are covered by [[scholarship]]s and include accommodation, tuition, training and clothing expenses, but not travel costs, to and from Greece.

==Education==
[[Image:20081004-Piraeus-HNA A233-0033.jpg|thumb|right|Sloop A233 of the Hellenic Naval Academy sails with a crew of naval cadet officers.]]
The Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy offers a 4-year course. Aim of the education offered is to provide graduates (both deck officers and engineers) with adequate skills and knowledge to perform their duties as Navy Officers and keep up with evolving developments in [[naval science]], [[strategy]] and [[technology]] of [[naval warfare]].

The day at the academy begins at 6.00 am. For five days every week the cadets attend an intense training program (academic, athletic and marine) while the afternoon is available for the rest of the academy activities as well as various cultural, athletic and social events. The academic year is divided in two semesters.

During the winter term, cadets attend academic courses, professional military courses and naval training courses (off board). In addition, they receive practical courses by participating in short training voyages on various naval ships. During the Summer term, cadets of the first three classes embark for a two months training cruise, until recently on board the training ship HN ''Aris'' and for the past few years usually on board a Frigate and a General Support Ship. The trip includes approaching at ports of various countries. Conditions for cadets to familiarize themselves with the profession and duties of an officer, are provided through instractions on professional matters, on board training and application of the theory taught, together with drills carried out during the cruise.

==Graduation==
Cadets graduate from the academy provided they have concluded successfully all years and courses (academic and practical). Upon their graduation, all naval officers are commissioned to combat units of the Hellenic Navy fleet. During the graduation ceremony the flag of the Hellenic Naval Academy, following tradition, is handed over by new Navy Officers to the 3rd year cadets.

In the beginning of their career, officers serve in battle-ships and attend certain specialized schools. These schools have as goal to enhance their expertise and make them familiar with the battle-ship operations and function during peace and war.

More specifically, officers are trained along the following lines:

Immediately after they graduate, officers attend a four to six-month school where they receive additional theoretical and practical training and learn about system and equipment of their appointed battle-ships, as well as their duties as officers on those ships. During the first stages of their career, officers may also choose to serve in [[submarine]]s, [[helicopter]]s, marine patrol aircraft and underwater demolition (Special Forces), after being trained in their respective training schools.

Furthermore, when promoted to ''Lieutenant Junior Grade'', they go through a training stage lasting nine to eleven months. There they follow training held by various specialization departments of the Navy. According to the department they choose (or are appointed according to Navy needs), they take a degree of specialization to one of the following subjects: [[gun]]nery, [[navigation]], [[Telecommunication|communication]]s and [[electronic engineering]].

Lieutenant officers attend the ''Navy Staff Officers School'' and the ''Naval War School'' for 3 to 4 months on each school, where they obtain a ''Staff Officer'' degree. An officer may then serve as staff officer in various departments of the Hellenic Navy.

Finally, officers ranked ''Lieutenant Junior Grade'' and ''Lieutenant'', may be educated abroad (in [[Europe]] or in the United States) in schools such as [[Naval Postgraduate School|NPS]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], the [[University of Michigan]] etc., thus  becoming further specialized in fields such as [[electronics]], [[weapon systems]], [[computers]], [[operation research]], [[marine architecture]] etc.

The '''Hochschule für Musik Nürnberg''' (formerly ''Hochschule für Musik Nürnberg-Augsburg'') is a [[College or university school of music|music conservatoire]] based in [[Nuremberg]] (with a secondary building in [[Augsburg]]), [[Germany]].

==The Hochschule==
The Hochschule für Musik Nürnberg is the result of the merging of the ''Meistersinger-Konservatoriums'' in Nuremberg and the ''Leopold-Mozart-Konservatorium'' in Augsburg in 1998.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The History of the Nuremberg School of Music | url=http://www.hfm-n-a.de/metanavigation/english.htm| date= |publisher= | accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Meistersinger-Konservatorium dates back from 1821 when Johannes Scharrer founded the ''Städtische Singschule'', which later became the State Music School (1883) and from 1972 as the "Fachakademie für Musik und Meistersinger-Konservatorium".

==The courses==
The hochschule offers degrees and postgraduate qualifications in all orchestral instruments, jazz, popular music, singing, opera, music education, conducting and composition.&lt;ref name="web" /&gt;

==Background==

John Lawrence Childs was born in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]].  He graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison with a Journalism degree in 1911.  He also began working with the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) then.

==Career==

From 1912 to 1915, Childs headed the YMCA's Midwest chapter in [[Kankakee, Illinois]].  In 1916, he worked in [[Peking, China]] as a YMCA missionary.  John Dewey stayed at Childs' home during his own visit to China. In 1922, Childs returned to the U.S..  In 1923, he began graduate studies at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] (UTC): one of his professors at the Teachers College was [[W. H. Kilpatrick]].  In 1924, he went back to China.  In 1927, he returned to States to study for a doctorate.

In 1931, Dr. Childs joined the faculty of Teachers College.  In 1935, he became associate professor and, in 1938. 

In 1935, Childs also joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) but in 1937 resigned due to rise in Communist influence.  (His departure followed election of [[Jerome Davis (sociologist)|Jerome Davis]], a colleague at UTC and in the YMCA.) 

In 1944, he was elected state chair of the [[Liberal Party of New York]].  On January 5, 1947, he resigned to give more time to his job as director of education at Columbia's Teachers College.  At the time of his resignation, the Liberal Party of New York was expected to become the political agency of [[Americans for Democratic Action]], whose formation was announced days before Child's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;

kabul University of medical science([[Pashto language|Pashto]] د کابل طبي پوهنتون / [[Persian language|Dari]]: پوهنتون طبي کابل) formerly known as '''Kabul Medical Institute''') is located in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] on the campus of [[Kabul University]]. The medical institution was initially maintained by collaboration with the Turkish and French sponsors. KMF developed into a single autonomous University in 2005. It currently graduates professionals in fields of Curative [[Medicine]], [[Pediatric]], [[Stomatology]], [[Dentistry|Dental]] and [[Nursing]]. All subjects are taught in [[Persian language|Dari]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] but most medical terms are in English.

Currently, more than 25 medical schools are known to exist in Afghanistan but KMU is known to be the top leading medical school in the country.

Up to the beginning of the 1980s, Afghan Medical Schools were under Kabul University and the Ministry of Education; however, after Russian occupation, all Medical Schools came under the jurisdiction of the [[Afghan Ministry of Public Health|Ministry of Public Health]] and later on the Ministry of Higher Education.

During the days of the Taliban, women were not allowed to study medicine at Kabul Medical University, not even under the cover of the  burka.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2006/05/14-160506.htm RFE/RL Afghanistan Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Manitoba]]'s medical school along with University of Nebraska Medical Center helped the Kabul Medical University rebuild its library after the war. University of Nebraska Medical Center provided KMU with scholarships for KMU lectures and students as well as provided it with up-to-date medical technology and research based institutions like Cardiac Research Center. Manitoba put together a basic collection of 672 medical textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=5648 Students help rebuild ailing medical library in Kabul - Express News - University of Alberta]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Kabul Medical University cooperated with the [[King Edward Medical University]] of [[Lahore]] [[Pakistan]] in training students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohe.gov.af/?lang=en&amp;p=news&amp;nid=72 King Edward University of Lahore cooperates with Kabul Medical University]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kindergarten readiness''' refers to the developmental domains that contribute to children's ability to adapt to the [[kindergarten]] classroom, which is often a new and unfamiliar environment. There is no single agreed upon definition of Kindergarten readiness. The domains often included in the definition include, academic skills (e.g., early [[literacy]] and [[mathematics]] understanding, etc.), social-emotional development (e.g., [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial behaviour]], etc.), and physical development (e.g., motor development, sensory development, etc.). In addition to these competencies, the child's environment and opportunities for learning should also be considered. This includes the child's home environment and their interactions with [[teacher]]s and peers.

== Academic Skills ==
When assessing children's readiness for kindergarten, much of the discussion is focused on the emergence of basic academic skills, including [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], and [[arithmetic]], which are commonly referred to as the “three Rs” ([[United States Department of Education]], 2001). This is likely because upon entering kindergarten, academic skills—such as literacy and numeracy—predict later academic success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Promoting school readiness and early learning : implications of developmental research for practice|last=Michel|first=Boivin|last2=L.|first2=Bierman, Karen|date=2014-01-01|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=9781462511457|oclc=874774990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Reading ===
Reading is an important skill as reading ability during primary school predicts academic achievement and later success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, particular emphasis is usually placed upon the development of literacy skills for preschool and kindergarten students to prepare them for the future. Children are not expected to read upon entering kindergarten. However, they are expected to have phonemic and phonological awareness, as well as a knowledge of print.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Tankersley, K. (2003). Threads of reading: Strategies for literacy development. Alexandria, Va: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phonemic awareness]] is the first step in learning to read; it refers to the ability to hear and manipulate the smallest forms of language known as phonemes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Phonemic awareness upon entering kindergarten is the strongest predictor of reading success.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once a child understands phonemes, the next step is to develop [[phonological awareness]], which is the ability to recognize that there is a relationship between sounds and letters, and letters and words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Phonological awareness strongly predicts the development of literacy skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Upon entering kindergarten, children should also be able to recognize their own name in print, know how to handle a book, recognize letters, and identify words that rhyme. These are all predictors of literacy success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another important aspect of reading development is the understanding of narrative structures, which lends to better comprehension skills.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Pinkham, A. M., Kaefer, T., &amp; Neuman, S. B. (2012). Knowledge development in early childhood: Sources of learning and classroom implications. New York: The Guilford Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Vocabulary development is closely associated with comprehension skills; those with weaker vocabularies may have difficulties following narratives.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Writing ===
Upon entering Kindergarten, children typically make attempts to write their own name and letters that have been dictated, and are able to master some of the letters (NCLD, Pianta). In order to write letters, children must be able to integrate auditory information (what sound the letter makes) and orthographic skills (knowledge of letters and print convention). Children's developing ability to write letters is related to later literacy outcomes such as reading compression and [[spelling]] (Pianta). However, during the transition into Kindergarten the primary focus in terms of relevant writing skills involves the physical ability to draw (i.e., motor skills). Kindergarten aged students can typically draw pictures of themselves and their families and use a variety of different sized lines and shapes in their drawings (NCLD).

=== Arithmetic ===
In general, children are expected to have knowledge of numbers to demonstrate kindergarten readiness. Children generally should be able to count to at least 10, count about 5 objects, demonstrate knowledge of adding or taking away objects, and identify basic shapes, such as triangles, circles, and squares (NCLD, 2006). Recent studies in [[Australia]] have suggested that children know much more mathematics than kindergarten teachers would expect upon beginning kindergarten.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In general, children should demonstrate [[Problem solving|problem-solving]], [[Spatial–temporal reasoning|spatial reasoning,]] and [[calculation]] abilities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Children engage in nonverbal calculation at early ages; however the transition from nonverbal to verbal calculation does not take place until approximately five and half years of age (Mix, Huttenlocher, &amp; Levine, 2002). Therefore, preschool children, including those entering kindergarten, should have a sense of quantitative reasoning. The transition to verbal problem-solving does not occur until they  become familiar with conventional symbols (p.&amp;nbsp;112).

Mathematical knowledge during preschool predicts later school success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Perry, B., MacDonald, A., &amp; Gervasoni, A. (2015). Mathematics and transition to school. ''International perspectives''.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, preschool and kindergarten students in low-income settings have been shown to have significantly less developed mathematical skills than students from middle-income homes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, particular attention has been given to developing math interventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== Social Emotional Well-being ==
The transition to Kindergarten often requires children to adapt to a new and different environment. This new environment is typically more structured and filled with more prolonged social engagement than their home environment. Children use their social and emotional abilities in order to navigate this new and unfamiliar environment. Although social and emotional skills are sometimes not included in definitions of Kindergarten readiness, focus groups surveys indicate that teachers often advocate that developed social skills are more important than academic skills as children enter school.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladd|first=Gary W.|last2=Herald|first2=Sarah L.|last3=Kochel|first3=Karen P.|date=2006-01-03|title=School Readiness: Are There Social Prerequisites?|journal=Early Education and Development|volume=17|issue=1|pages=115–150|doi=10.1207/s15566935eed1701_6|issn=1040-9289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social skills function as tools to help children learn more quickly and promote peer acceptance, contributing to a more positive outlook on school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Social and Emotional Development ===
Between the ages of 3-6 children undergo dramatic development in their social and cognitive abilities. The development of these skills provides them with the tools to navigate the social context of a kindergarten classroom. These developments become obvious during children's social interactions that transform from playing alongside of their peers, to more complex and coordinated play amongst peers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; This transformation in social abilities comes about not only from an increase in language abilities, and increasing self-regulation abilities, but also from the quickly developing ability to consider other people's perspectives.&amp;nbsp; Perspective taking allows children to take into account others’ points of view, and to appreciate that others’ points of view may be different from their own. This ability develops rapidly between ages 3–6 and continues to develop throughout adolescence. Not only is it important for children entering kindergarten to be able to take into account their peers’ points of view, it is also important for them to be able to consider their teacher's perspective

The ability to consider others’ perspectives also gives way to the development of social empathy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Readiness in Early Childhood Education - Springer|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137485120|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-349-50359-9|last1 = Iorio|first1 = Jeanne Marie|last2=Parnell|first2=Will}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children begin to appreciate that other people can experience emotions that are different from their own, and that their actions towards others can affect their emotions. This developing understanding, paired with their increasing self-regulation abilities, enables children to interact and develop meaningful relationships, as well as the ability to successfully manage conflicts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to promoting positive peer relationships, successfully managing the social environment of the kindergarten classroom also contributes to more positive academic outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Through more positive social interactions, children are better able to access the resources that they need to thrive in the classroom setting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, if the child is able to appropriately and effectively interact with the teacher, the child is more likely to receive assistance and attention when necessary. Additionally, if the child is able to engage and participate with her peers, it is more likely that she will be included and form more meaningful relationships, thereby associating school with positive experiences.

=== Parent's Role ===
Children's development does not occur in a vacuum. They are constantly being influenced by the environments that they are surrounded by. At the same time, children's behaviours and reactions have an effect on their environments as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U., &amp; Evans, G. W. (2000). Developmental science in the 21st century: Emerging questions, theoretical models, research designs and empirical findings. ''Social development'', ''9''(1), 115-125.
&lt;/ref&gt; During the preschool years, children spend the majority of their time surrounded by their immediate family. Therefore, the family environment will significantly influence how a child develops during this age period. Therefore, parents play an important role concerning their child's readiness for the kindergarten classroom. In fact, children have better academic skills when their relationship with family is characterized as warm, accepting, involved and when parents value education (Hill, 2001). Furthermore, parent-child interactions that are structured and responsive are positively related to school readiness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A key aspect in this type of parent-child interaction is being sensitive to the child's skill level in order to provide the appropriate amount of support when guiding the child's learning. This type of guidance is known as scaffolding, in which the level of support given to the child decreases as the child's skill level increases on a given task. Just as scaffolding around a building is removed as the building gets nearer to completion, the amount of help that is provided to the child decreases as the child begins to master a certain task. The decreasing amount of support allows the child to have more autonomy which gives them the opportunity to practice their newly developing skills. Scaffolding can be implemented in any type of learning, but is especially helpful in the preschool age-range to teach about conflict resolution in social settings, emotion regulation, and problem solving.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Teacher's Role ===
When children enter Kindergarten, they experience a shift from the family acting as a primary influence on the child's development, to an increased influence from their classroom environment. An important factor that contributes to how well a child adapts to the Kindergarten environment is his/her relationship with the teacher.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When children form a close relationship with their teacher, they appear better adjusted within the kindergarten context compared to when a conflictual relationship is developed. Children feel more comfortable approaching their teacher, as well as expressing their thoughts and feelings when a warm and open relationship is developed. This allows the child to effectively use the teacher as a means for support. This support can come in the form of social, emotional, or academic assistance which ultimately contributes to promoting the child's opportunities for success in the Kindergarten classroom.

The teacher-child relationship has also been shown to be affected through intervention strategies. For example, the Chicago School Readiness Project trained teachers in classroom behaviour management strategies in order to promote greater emotional support in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children in classrooms whose teachers’ received the intervention showed better self-regulation, fewer behaviour problems, and better academic skills compared to children in classrooms whose teachers had not received the training.

== Motor and Sensory Development ==
Upon entering kindergarten most children should have passed certain developmental milestones in their motor and sensory development. Fine motor development, which involves manipulating small objects and forming pencil grips are necessary for the development of other academic skills. For example, by age five, children usually possess the fine motor skills to allow them to print some letters, draw a person with a head, a body, legs, and arms, as well as other shapes, such as triangles, squares, and circles. Similarly, they can also manipulate scissors to cut a straight line, use a fork and knife effectively, and tie their shoelaces.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Different learners : what parents can do to help|last=1945-|first=Goldberg, Stan|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195167542|oclc=57575536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine motor skills upon entering kindergarten are associated with academic performance in reading and writing in later grades (QLSCD 1998-2010), as well as academic achievement in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Pivik, Jayne (2012). ''Environmental Scan of School Readiness for Health: Definitions, Determinants, Indicators and Interventions''. Vancouver, BC, Canada: Human Early Learning Partnership with the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health. 
&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Developmental milestones for gross motor development include learning to skip, catching a ball, jumping over small objects, and walking down stairs using alternate feet and a handrail.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The peak period of development for motor skills occurs from birth to age five.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As such, children entering kindergarten can walk, run, jump, and climb and are developing control of their bodies.

Sensory developmental milestones are also used as indicators of kindergarten readiness. For example, by age five, children should know their colours, count using their fingers, manipulate a book and read it from left to right, and draw pictures that represent animals, objects, or people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== Oral Language Development ==
Oral-language development involves the development of receptive language, which is the ability to understand when spoken to, and expressive language, which is the ability to produce language. Kindergarten readiness requires development in both. For example, students are expected to have a vocabulary of approximately 2000 words by age five;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Canadian Language &amp; Literacy Research Network, 2009). Similarly, they are expected to be using approximately five to eight words in a sentence. In general, however, children entering kindergarten are expected to understand instructions and communications from adults and peers (Pivik, 2012). They are also expected to communicate their needs and ideas in a way that can be understood by others. Simply stated, they must be able to use language as a tool to be functional within the kindergarten setting.

Oral language is of particular importance for children entering kindergarten as it is a predictor and necessary requirement of literacy development (Hill, 2011). However, the transition from oral-language development to literacy is not clearly defined and hierarchical. Rather, it is a multidimensional and complex transition (p.&amp;nbsp;52). Nevertheless, oral language development provides the framework and opportunity for children to develop literacy skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children are able to build upon their previously mastered oral skills or vocabulary to help them learn new skills, such as reading or writing.

Oral language can be taught explicitly and implicitly through play. For example, dramatic play can allow for the child to take on different roles and use language as a tool in different contexts (Hill, 2011). Play also has a positive impact on literacy, self-regulation, and social-understanding (Van Reet, 2012). For example, play is strongly related to language development in the form of procedural knowledge, such as how to apply proper grammar, which occurs through observation and exposure, as opposed to direct instruction (p.&amp;nbsp;20).&amp;nbsp;

== Inhibitory Control and Attention ==
In order to learn and engage in a classroom environment, children must be able to direct their attention effectively. Specifically, children need to be able to extract the important messages from the surrounding noise or distractions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Adults are much more adept at blocking out distracting information in their environment compared to children. Therefore, the distractions that might impact a child's ability to focus his or her attention may be difficult for an adult to appreciate. Distractions can present themselves in the form of auditory sounds, such as other children talking in the classroom, noise from a television, cars driving by outside, etc. However, visual information can also be distracting to children, hindering them from properly focusing their attention. For instance, if a child is attempting to concentrate on a given task in a room where there are many interesting things around her, the abundance of visual information will make it harder for her to concentrate on the task at hand. The more distractions that are present in the child's environment, the more effortful it will be for the child to effectively focus her attention.

Another important aspect of learning involves the ability to discern what is relevant from what is not. In everyday conversation we are continuously picking out the important parts of what is being said in order to commit the relevant information to memory.&amp;nbsp;This skill is particularly important for children to be able to learn and follow instructions in a classroom environment. When young children listen to someone speaking, such as instructions from a teacher,&amp;nbsp; it is important for them to be able to pick out the important information so that they are able to do what has been asked.

Another area in which children often show difficulty is engaging in a new task. This is a necessary skill in kindergarten given the continuous switching of activities that happens throughout the day. Many children have little trouble focusing on a particular activity, but when asked to switch, have difficulty on the next. This can decrease their performance on the new task, or hinder their ability to learn from it.

The cognitive ability that is implicated in these situations is known as inhibitory control (IC). Inhibitory control is known as the ability to inhibit a prepotent (or initial) response, and instead respond with a more appropriate action.&amp;nbsp; This term is used somewhat interchangeably with related terms such as, self-regulation, effortful control, attentional control, etc. However, the divide between the terms is not substantive (Allan et al. 2014).

&amp;nbsp;The preschool age marks a time of rapid development of inhibitory control, and not surprisingly, plays an important role in children's adjustment to kindergarten. Although there is marked development, the relationship between IC and other developmental outcomes (e.g., academic, social, etc.) remains intact. Inhibitory control is important in many aspects of kindergarten readiness but is particularly relevant to children's academic outcomes. Although IC is implicated in both literacy and math skills, is it particularly important for math.

IC has been measured using a variety of methods. Namely, researchers typically use behavioural methods, in which children are asked to complete short tasks that require the use of IC. Researchers also use reports in the forms of surveys from parents and teachers. Typically, behavioural methods and teacher reports have the closest relationship to children's academic outcomes. Both of these methods can reveal important information when investigating the relationship between IC and academic performance as they lend information from different contexts, with behavioural methods providing information about the child's objective abilities, and teacher reports providing information about the subjective classroom experience. Together these methods provide a more complete understanding of the relationship.

&amp;nbsp;An important consideration is that difficulties that children may have in regards to focusing their attention becomes amplified when they are experiencing strong emotions. It is also important to rule out physical problems (hearing and vision) as they may present themselves as an attention problem but can be easily remedied with heading or visual aid

== At-risk Children ==
There are four key risk factors that are associated with educational disadvantages upon entry into kindergarten in the United States. They include having a mother with less than a high school education, living in a family that receives food stamps or welfare, living in a single-parent home, and having parents whose native tongue is other than [[English language|English]] (United States Department of Education, 2001). Individuals with a single risk factor are likely to lag in reading or writing skills; those with multiple risk factors have a 50% chance of scoring in the bottom quartiles in reading, mathematics, or general knowledge. For example, those with multiple risk factors are less likely to know the [[alphabet]] or be able to count to 20 before beginning kindergarten, which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison to other students without risk factors (p.&amp;nbsp;21). Families who live in [[poverty]] are generally less able to provide learning opportunities, such as books or toys to their children.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Lack of school readiness has been linked with later school dropout.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, longitudinal studies in Quebec suggest that social-emotional and social skills training can help some students improve their academic paths and eventually graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parents and family environments can play a protective role against the risk of educational disadvantage.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the home and family environments have the greatest impact on whether or not a child is ready to begin school (Pivik, 2012). For example, parents have many roles in preparing children for kindergarten, including providing the child with proper [[nutrition]], health care, and opportunity for growth. Families can also act as advocates, teachers, and providers for their children.

== New Types of Learning ==
Recent discussions have moved from the traditional focus of developing the “three R’s” to considering skills that are inherent to the digital age. For example, through exposure to tablets, children are learning traditional skills in new ways. As opposed to manipulating books and toys, many children spend their time learning via technology. Literacy apps, videos, and games are most commonly used. However, the manipulation of the iPad itself lends to a different type of motor development than traditional paper instruction, such as swiping, touching, and tapping (Burnett &amp; Daniels, 2016). Nevertheless, children may have similar interactions when reading with adults using tablets as they might when using printed materials (Burnett &amp; Daniels, 2016).

Many efforts by large television networks has been directed at developing media content for pre-schoolers with the aim of fostering healthy social-emotional development (Nikolayev, Clark, &amp; Reich, 2016). However, the online games that are targeted for social-emotional development among pre-school students are mostly focused on recognition of one's own emotional skills, relationships with adults, cooperative play with peers, or formation of self-identity (Nikolayev, Clark, &amp; Reich, 2016). Most games also focus on modeling appropriate social behaviour as opposed to having children practice their own skills through the game.&amp;nbsp;

== Assessment ==
The Kindergarten Behaviour and Academic Competency Scale (KBACS):

The KBACS is a questionnaire that is completed by a child's teacher in order to assess the child's readiness for school. The teacher rates the child across a variety of domains such as following classroom rules, completing work, etc. using a 5-point scale (ranging from poor to excellent). Studies have shown that the KBACS is associated with other measures of school readiness, and has excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .82; Granziano et al. 2015).

The Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA):

The BSRA is a widely used kindergarten readiness test that measures a child's exposure to concepts that support learning at school. It contains five subtests assessing knowledge of colours, letters, numbers/counting, size/comparisons, and shapes. Unlike a questionnaire, the BSRA is structured as a set of tests to be completed with the child. The BSRA is used in some public and private schools to determine eligibility for gifted and talented programs. Studies have shown that children's scores on the BSRA are predictive of their later academic outcomes (Panter &amp; Bracken, 2009).

The Early Development Instrument (EDI):

The EDI is a questionnaire that is completed by a child's teacher. It was designed to measure children's school readiness and has been described as a holistic, or multidimensional approach as it includes measures outside of the academic domain. It contains 104 items and measures five domains including, physical health and well-being (e.g., gross and fine motor skills, physical independence, etc.), social competence (e.g., responsibility and respect, approaches to learning, etc.), emotional maturity (e.g., prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity and inattention, etc.), language and cognitive development (e.g., basic numeracy, basic literacy, etc.), and communication skills and general knowledge (e.g., ability to communicate needs, ability to tell a story, etc.) (Janus &amp; Offord, 2007). Studies have shown that the EDI is a good predictor of children's early school achievement, especially with children on the extreme ends of the rating scale (i.e., exceptionally low scores or exceptionally high scores.) (Boivin &amp; Bierman)

The Diagnostic Screening Test of School Readiness – Revised

The Diagnostic Screening Test of School Readiness is commonly known as the Lollipop test and is a measure of school readiness that focuses on academic components of readiness. It contains four subtests including, identification of colours and shapes and copying shapes, spatial recognition, identification of numbers and counting, and identification of letters and writing. These subtests are administered to a child individually. The test was designed to be quick and easy to administer and studies have shown that children's scores on the Lollipop test are associated with other measures of school readiness, and is predictive early school achievement (Chew 1987, Boivin &amp; Bierman).

==Early life and education==
Bridges-Adams was born at [[Maesycwmmer]], [[Bedwas]], [[Monmouthshire]], south Wales,&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; the daughter of a Welsh engine-fitter William and his wife Margaret.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; The family later moved to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and after working at schools in Newcastle, Bridges-Adams studied at the [[University of London]] and in 1882 was awarded a distinction at [[Bedford College, London]], in Greek and Maths.&lt;ref name="C&amp;C"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Jane Bridges-Adams and the Plebs League|url=http://www.classicsandclass.info/product/41/|website=Classics &amp; Class|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Walter Bridges-Adams on 22 October 1887.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

==Career==
Bridges-Adams's early career was as a teacher in schools in Birmingham and in London, and she was also the headmistress of a board school (a type of free [[elementary school]] established by the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]]).&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; In 1894 she stood for election to the [[London School Board]], representing the [[Greenwich]] division, supported by the [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]], trade unions (the [[National Union of General Workers (UK)|Gas Workers' Union]], the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Society of Engineers]]) and the London Nonconformist Council.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Jane|title=Mary Bridges Adams and Education Reform, 1890-1920: an ethics of care?|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|date=2004|volume=13|issue=3|pages=467–487|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612020400200395|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She failed to be elected, but was successful three years later, and was re-elected in 1900 as the sole [[Independent Labour Party]] candidate, with an increased majority,&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; remaining a member of the board until its abolition.&lt;ref name="C&amp;C" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Jane|title=Adams, Mary Jane Bridges- (1854–1939)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/53681|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[School boards in England and Wales|school boards]] were then one of the few elected bodies of the United Kingdom on which women could serve.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sakr|first1=Mona|title=Recovering Lost Voices: An interview with Professor Jane Martin (in full)|url=https://blue-stocking.org.uk/2007/03/24/recovering-lost-voices-an-interview-with-professor-jane-martin/|website=Bluestocking|accessdate=21 January 2017|date=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, she was involved in the opening of a [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel-influenced]] free "[[kindergarten]]" in [[Woolwich]], London; this was the first such educational establishment in England.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; With the closing of the school boards, she became secretary to [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]], and with her continued campaigning.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; In 1905, the two led a motor tour of the country to promote the concept of free school meals.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Bridges-Adams founded the first 'Open Air School for Recovery' (which aimed to show the "therapeutic effects of open air and regular meals on debilitated children") in [[Bostall Woods]], London in 1907 and another on [[Shooter's Hill]], London, the following year.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

She supported adult education for workers through the [[Plebs League]] and the [[Central Labour College]], and founded the [[Working Women's Movement]].&lt;ref name="C&amp;C" /&gt; Outside of her education-related campaigning, Bridges-Adams was also involved in other causes. She fought for improved living conditions of working class women: as a member of her local [[Woolwich]] [[Women's Co-operative Guild]], she campaigned for improved housing and sanitation, and for the building of cultural facilities such as a picture gallery and a free library.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; In 1917, alongside [[Joseph King (MP)|Joseph King]] (a Member of Parliament) and [[Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley|Lord Edward Stanley]] (a peer and former member of the London School Board), she campaigned for the continuation of the [[right of asylum]] for refugees from the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Personal life==
On 22 October 1887, the then Mary Daltry married Walter Bridges Adams, the son of [[William Bridges Adams]]. Together they had one son, [[William Bridges-Adams]] (1889–1965). Her husband predeceased her, dying in 1902.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

Her husband's family paid for her son to attend [[Bedales School]], a progressive [[private school]]. Though this may have conflicted with her own views about education, sending her son to a fee-paying [[boarding school]] was likely the only way she could have continued her activism as a single-parent.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

'''Michael Maule''' (31 October 1921 – 15 March 2017) was an [[United States|American]] ballet dancer and instructor.

==Early life and training==
Born in [[Durban]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Horst Koegler, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet'', 2d ed. (Oxford University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Maule was a descendant of Scottish immigrants who had settled in the province of Natal, on the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hanks, ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Family Names'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; His early training in ballet took place in [[Pietermaritzburg]] and Durban, first under Nancy Hooper-Graham and then, from age fourteen, under [[Eileen Keegan]] and Dorothea McNair,&lt;ref&gt;Marina Grut, ''The History of Ballet in South Africa'' (Cape Town: Human &amp; Rousseau, 1981), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; all teachers of the [[Cecchetti method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicb.org/pioneers/pioneers-nancy-hooper-graham/ |title=Cecchetti Pioneers: Nancy Hooper-Graham |publisher=Cecchetti International |accessdate=March 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221123206/http://www.cicb.org/pioneers/pioneers-nancy-hooper-graham/ |archivedate=February 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left South Africa and moved to London in the late 1930s, when he was still a teenager. Upon the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Royal Navy and served on sea duty for five years. When peace returned to Europe, he moved again, to New York City, where he resumed his ballet training with [[Vincenzo Celli]], also a disciple of [[Enrico Cecchetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Billie Mahoney, interview with Michael Maule for the public access cable television series Dance On, taped 18 July 1982, in New York City. http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34942094.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Once established in New York, Maule made his professional debut in the United States in the original Broadway production of [[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|''Annie Get Your Gun'']] (1946), a long-running hit starring Ethel Merman singing the songs of Irving Berlin. Maule remained with the show for an entire year, dancing the choreography of [[Helen Tamiris]]. Over the following two decades, his illustrious career included time served as principal dancer with the [[American Ballet Theatre]] (1947), the [[Cuban National Ballet]] (1948–1949), the [[New York City Ballet]] (1950–1953), Great Moments of Ballet (1954), and the [[English National Ballet|London Festival Ballet]] (1955). He was a guest artist at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the summers of 1951, 1953, and 1954.

Maule was not a bravura dancer, but he possessed a sound classical technique, and his fine Scottish looks—a sturdy figure, handsome head, pale complexion, and light red hair—added to his strong stage presence. Particularly noted for his gracious partnering, he often appeared as cavalier and partner to leading ballerinas of his day, including [[Maria Tallchief]], [[Alicia Markova]], Patricia Wilde, [[Alexandra Danilova]], [[Alicia Alonso]], [[Belinda Wright (dancer) | Belinda Wright]], and Marilyn Burr, among others. 

With the New York City Ballet. Maule danced many works in the repertory choreographed by [[George Balanchine]] and [[Jerome Robbins]]. He originated roles in two major works by Robbins—the First Intruder in ''The Cage'' (1951) and one of the two Trumpets in ''Fanfare'' (1953)—and was a member of the original ensemble of Balanchine's ''Scotch Symphony'' (1952). On Broadway, he danced Balanchine's choreography again in the 1957 revival of ''The Merry Widow'', partnering Mary Ellen Moylan.&lt;ref&gt;George Dorris, interview with Michael Maule for the Popular Balanchine project of the George Balanchine Foundation, videotaped at the foundation office, 26 May 2002, in New York City. New York Public Library for the Performing Arts catalog number b19683002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Maule was first choice for the role of Charlie Chisholm Dalrymple, the bridegroom in the movie version of ''Brigadoon'' (1954), a romantic fantasy of an enchanted village in the Scottish Highlands. His chance at Hollywood stardom came to naught, however, when he was replaced by Jimmy Thompson before filming started.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Griffin, ''A Hundred or More Hidden Things: The Life and Films of Vincente Minnelli'' (Boston: Da Capo Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; On television, he danced on ''The Bell Telephone Hour'' in 1962 and on ''Camera Three'' in 1965. Subsequently, he choreographed ballets for Great Moments of Ballet and London Festival Ballet.&lt;ref name="Linda Graham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gratisbooks.com/pchapdet.php?chapter_id=32872 |title=National Academy of Dance / National Academy of Arts: A Brief Historic Overview |first= Linda |last= Graham |publisher=Gratis Books |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After retiring from the stage, Maule taught ballet technique in numerous schools and venues, including the American Ballet Theatre School, the [[Joffrey Ballet|Robert Joffrey School]], and the National Academy of Dance in Champaign, Illinois, where he served as the first director of dance (1972–1976), having been recommended for the job by [[Margot Fonteyn]].  He also taught at the [[Juilliard School's Dance Division]], at the Melissa Hayden studio, and in his own studio in an upper floor of Carnegie Hall. Abroad, he was an invited guest teacher at schools and studios in the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan, and the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Linda Graham" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Maule became a permanent resident of the United States in 1956. For several years prior to his death he lived in Vero Beach, Florida, with his second wife, Katherine, who is the mother of ballet dancer John Gardner. He died on 15 March 2017 at the age of 95.

'''Mondialogo''' is an initiative launched by [[Daimler AG]] and [[UNESCO]] that seeks to promote intercultural dialogue and exchange among young people.
The global initiative is based on three pillars: the Mondialogo School Contest, the Mondialogo Engineering Award and the Mondialogo Internet Portal, which serves as a platform for dialogue and communication.

==The initiative==
Mondialogo was initiated by [[Daimler AG]] and [[UNESCO]] in October 2003. The global initiative aims to bring together young people with different cultural backgrounds from all over the world to promote mutual understanding and inspire in them a long-term enthusiasm for intercultural exchange. Mondialogo is primarily addressing pupils, students and teachers worldwide. The writers [[Henning Mankell]] and [[Paulo Coelho]] are ambassadors for Mondialogo.

==Pillars of the Initiative==
=== Mondialogo School Contest ===
The Mondialogo School Contest is the world’s largest international contest for pupils between the ages of 14 and 18. All registered school teams are given a partner team previously unknown to them from a different region of the world. The teams establish contact, get to know each other and then develop a mutual project that should deal with topics such as peace, fair play, preventing discrimination, a sustainable future, identity, respectfulness toward cultural diversity or emigration/immigration.

At the end of a 6-month work phase the results of the teams are judged by an international jury. The top 25 entries are chosen and the teams get invited to a symposium lasting several days. This is an opportunity for pupils and teachers from all over the world to meet and get to know each other in person.

Two rounds of the Mondialogo School Contest have already been completed: 25,000 pupils from 126 countries took part in the 2003/2004 contest. The awards were given out in 2004 in Barcelona. The second contest saw the participation of 35,000 pupils (in 2,600 teams) from 138 countries. The symposium took place in Rome in 2006. The third round is finished and the symposium took place in Beijing in 2008.

===Mondialogo Engineering Award===
The Mondialogo Engineering Award calls for engineering students from developed and developing countries to form international project team and enter project proposals addressing the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] – proposals that are capable of advancing the quality of life in the developing countries.

The first two rounds had 3,600 young engineers from 113 countries in 1,500 project teams participating in the Mondialogo Engineering Award. After a six-month project work phase the teams entered project proposals that are judged by an international jury of experts. The top 30 entrees are awarded prizes given out during a symposium lasting several days. The symposia took place in Berlin and Mumbai, respectively. The awards are endowed with a prize money of altogether €300,000, intended to help get the project proposals realised.

===Mondialogo Internet Portal===
The Mondialogo Internet Portal is the initiative's communications and information platform. In five languages, it offers a global online-community of over 26,000 members from 174 countries many features that allow them to communicate, interact, and network.

Teams participating in the [[Mondialogo School Contest]] and the [[Mondialogo Engineering Award]] here have virtual project offices that allow them to jointly work on their projects.

Details about the contests, news surrounding intercultural dialogue, and the Mondialogo Magazine are also provided on the portal, as well as all the latest about current developments and former projects, which can be found in the Inside Mondialogo Blog, written by members of the team and former participants.

==Awards==
Since being founded in 2003, Mondialogo has been awarded several prizes for furthering intercultural dialogue. Among those are:

* Clarion Award 2005 by the International Visual Communication Association (IVCA), London
* Preis für Freiheit und Verantwortung 2005 (Freedom and Respondibility Award 2005, Germany)
* PR News CSR Awards 2006
* Best Global Website Award 2005
* WebAward 2006 (Outstanding Community Website)
* International Business Award 2007 (Best CSR Program in Europe)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7714">[[File:2-Dice-Icon.svg|frameless|right|alt=Two dice]]
A '''''{{Lang|de|Musikalisches Würfelspiel}}''''' (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using [[dice]] to randomly '[[generative music|generate]]' [[music]] from [[music composition|precomposed]] options. These 'games' were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different [[game]]s were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely 'choosing a [[random]] [[number]].'

The earliest example is [[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Der allezeit fertige Menuetten- und Polonaisencomponist}}'' (German for "The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer") (1757 [1st edition; revised 2nd 1783]).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples by well known composers include [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Einfall, einen doppelten Contrapunct in der Octave von sechs Tacten zu machen, ohne die Regeln davon zu wissen}}'' (German for "A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules") (1758) and [[Maximilian Stadler]]'s ''{{Lang|fr|Table pour composer des minuets et des Trios à la infinie; avec deux dez à jouer}}'' (French for "A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice") (1780).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

In the early 20th century the Kaleidacousticon System, using arbitrarily combinable [[playing card]]s, was unsuccessfully marketed in the Boston area as a [[parlour game]].&lt;ref&gt;Nierhaus (2009), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
According to Lawrence Zbikowski, "In truth, chance played little part in the success of the music produced by such games. Instead, what was required of the compilers...[was] a little knowledge about how to put the game together and an understanding of the formal design of waltzes, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski, Lawrence M. (2002). ''Conceptualizing Music: Cognitive Structure, Theory, and Analysis'', pp. 142–143. {{ISBN|9780195187977}}. Quoted in Berkowitz, Aaron (2010). ''The Improvising Mind: Cognition and Creativity in the Musical Moment'', p. 65. {{ISBN|9780199590957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen Hedges, "The 'galant' middle class in Europe was playing with mathematics. In this atmosphere of investigation and cataloguing, a systematic device that would seem to make it possible for anyone to write music was practically guaranteed popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Stephen A. (1978). "Dice Music in the Eighteenth Century", pp. 184–185, ''Music and Letters 59'': 180–87. Quoted in Berkowitz (2010), p. 65n60.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Leonard Meyer]], "Eighteenth-century composers constructed musical dice games while nineteenth century composers did not. ... [W]hat constrained the choice of figures [in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music] were the claims of taste, coherent expression and propriety, given the genre of work being composed, rather than the inner necessity of a gradually unfolding, underlying process [as in nineteenth century music]".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Leonard (1989). ''Style and Music: Theory, History, and Ideology'', p. 193. {{ISBN|9780226521527}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[musical development]].

The way these games work may be understood in analogy to [[generative grammar|sentence construction]].
 1 The cow   ran    past    the field.
 2 The pig   walked through the yard.
 3 The sheep ran    into    the marsh.
One rolls one&lt;!--three sided--&gt; die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 1 2 3 1 2 3 one is given, "The pig ran past the marsh." Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight [[variation (music)|variations]] rather than being entirely different.

== Alleged musikalisches Würfelspiel ==

The most well-known was published in 1792, by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s publisher [[Nikolaus Simrock]] in Berlin ([[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 294d or K. Anh. C 30.01). The game was attributed to Mozart, but this attribution has not been authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, David (1996). ''Experiments in Musical Intelligence'', p. 7. Madison, Wisconsin: A–R Editions, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0895793379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dice rolls randomly selected small sections of music, which would be patched together to create a musical piece. This game is capable of producing 11&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45,949,729,863,572,161 different yet similar waltzes.&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski (2002), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measures have only one possibility no matter what the roll of the dice (measure 8/16) while other measures have a different possibility for each roll (measure 1/16).&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz (2010), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart's manuscript K. 516f, written in 1787, consisting of numerous two-[[bar (music)|bar]] fragments of music, appears to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions and there is no evidence that dice were involved.

The titles of the supposed Mozart compositions are:&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Walzern so viele man will vermittelst zweier Würfel, ohne etwas von der Musik oder Composition zu verstehen}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition")
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Polonaisen...}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of polonaises...")

[[Robert Xavier Rodríguez]] composed his ''Musical Dice Game'' for string orchestra based on K. 516f.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.schirmer.com/default.aspx?tabid=2420&amp;state_2874=2&amp;workid_2874=25473 Robert Xavier Rodríguez: Musical Dice Game]", Schirmer.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''{{Lang|it|Gioco filarmonico o sia maniera facile per comporre un infinito numero de minuetti e trio anche senza sapere il contrappunto}}'' (Italian for "The game of harmony, or an easy method for composing an infinite number of minuet-trios, without any knowledge of counterpoint") has also not been authenticated.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

{{cleanup reorganize|date=November 2012}}
The '''National Academic League''' ('''NAL''') is a popular  in [[middle school|junior high schools]] (middle schools) around the [[United States]].  In participating schools, two coaches and anywhere from at least fifteen to approximately forty students compete with other schools in the same [[school district|district]].  Students study [[mathematics|math]], [[science]], [[geography]], [[world history]], and [[english studies|language arts]].  In the game, students prepare presentations about current events, and/or answer questions from any of the above listed categories.  If a championship is won, it is possible to compete all the way to a national level.  Most games are played with the two teams, judges, and coaches meeting in person, but in the national competition video conferencing may be used.

There are also four quarters or rounds in a game.  Each quarter is different from all the others in some way which will be explained below.  The buzzer team competes in the first, second, and fourth quarters, but the buzzer team members may be different from quarter to quarter.  The presentation team competes in the third quarter, and some may compete in the fourth quarter.

==Game structure==

===Tip Off Question===
The game begins with a tip off question.  The captains of each team are asked a question, and the first captain to answer correctly wins the tip off.  They now have the choice of going first or second in the first quarter, or first or second in the third quarter.  Captains almost always choose to go first in the first quarter, because it gives the team a decisive advantage. The captain of the other team then chooses whether to go first or second in the remaining

===First Quarter===
The [[buzzer]] team competes in first quarter.  First quarter lasts for exactly ten minutes with fifteen seconds (maximum) for each question. (Until recently, the quarter lasted twelve minutes.) Five members sit in the front row and five in reserve.  The first question goes to chair one, the captain.  If (s)he answers correctly, two points are added to the team's score.  The second question will go to chair two.  If (s)he also answers correctly, two more points are added to the score and the question goes to chair three.  If (s)he also answers correctly, two more points are added, ''but the team does not get another question.''  After three correct answers, the questions go to the opposing team.

If one of the questions are answered incorrectly, the other team is given a chance to steal.  If they answer correctly, the series of questions goes to the other team and one point is added for a steal.  They then have a chance to score up to six points (Three two-point questions), starting with the player who got the steal.

If any team member answers wrongly, they are given a foul.  After two fouls, the first reserve player in line takes the fouled-out player's seat, and the fouled-out player moves to the back of the reserve line.

===Second Quarter===
In second quarter, five members of the [[buzzer]] team work as a team to answer lengthy questions.  There is a back row of five reserve players, but this reserve used only at the discretion of the team coach, who can substitute any or all backup players for any or all active players.  This quarter lasts ten minutes with 60 seconds (maximum) for each question. The questions are printed on a card, which is carried to the team by a player of the opposite team, the "runner".  When the judge says "Drop", each runner drops the card down on the table. The time starts when the judge reads the question aloud. Players are allowed to talk with each other and write down answers, and collaborate. Although communication is a prime skill in second quarter, no other team member may speak after the captain has buzzed in.  Each correct answer is worth three points.

===Third Quarter===
In third quarter, the [[presentation]] team gives a presentation on the question they were given after the tip off question.  The third quarter team will have been given a topic one week before the day of the game. This topic is more broad than the question received at the beginning of the game; the topic only gives the presentation team a range of information to research and study before the game day. At the game, they take the question from the judge and a bucket of supplies, including posterboard, construction paper, markers, pencils and paper, and each team works separately in a room for about thirty minutes- until 2nd quarter is over. A parent, teacher or sponsor will give each team a five-minute warning, letting the teams know they have five minutes left before they present. When second quarter is over, the teams present in the order determined by the captains after tip-off. The two judges over the match judge on paper the presentation, on basis of eye contact, memorization, quantity and quality of information, vocabulary, shown interest in the subject, charisma, enthusiasm in speaking, etc.  The team must take at least three minutes, but no longer than five in their presentation, or three points are deducted from the team's score.  The two scores (each out of a possible 25) are averaged out and added to the team's score.

===Fourth Quarter===
There can be a mix of the [[buzzer]] team and the [[presentation]] team participates in fourth quarter.  Five players sit at the buzzers with an additional five in reserve.  The first question is given to both teams with members in seat one. the preceding questions continue down to seat two, three, and so forth. When a question is given to seat one, for example, no one but seat one may answer.  The students must wait until the judge calls on them.  If a student answers correctly, they are awarded two points.  If the answer is wrong, however, one point is deducted from the score and a foul is given to the player.  If a student does not know the answer, they may pass.  This means they receive a foul, but no point deduction.  If both students pass, answer wrongly, or time runs out and the right answer has still not been given, the judges declare "Free for all".  The student must wait until the judge finishes saying "Free for all."  Anyone on either team at this point has five seconds (or the remaining time in the 30 seconds, whichever is longer) to buzz in and answer.

===End of the Game===
At the end of the game, the judges verify the score, and the team with the highest cumulative score wins. If there is a tie, there is a short 2 minute overtime played under fourth-quarter rules.

== Sample Topics ==
Students in NAL study a broad range of topics in preparation, including [[mathematics|math]], [[science]], [[geography]], [[world history]], and [[english studies|english]].  These are the main topics that are studied in each category:

'''Math:''' [[Greatest common factor|GCF]], [[Least common multiple|LCM]], [[probability]], [[Roman numerals]], area, and [[perimeter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21493">'''Open educational resources in Canada''' are the various initiatives related to [[open educational resources]] (OER) and [[open education]] established nationally and provincially in Canada, and with international collaboration.

In Canada, education is exclusively a provincial or territorial responsibility, though the federal government can intervene in areas relevant to open education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002443/244365e.pdf|title=Open educational resources: policy, costs, transformation|last=McGreal|first=Rory|last2=Anderson|first2=Terry|last3=Conrad|first3=Dianne|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100158-1|editor-last=Miao|editor-first=Fengchun|location=|pages=75–83|editor-last2=Mishra|editor-first2=Sanjaya|editor-last3=McGreal|editor-first3=Rory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives ==
The [[open educational resources]] (OER) movement in [[Education in Canada|Canada]] can be categorized in different ways, from type of initiative to geographical location to institutional initiative. The initiatives described below are categorized accordingly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pan-Canadian initiatives ===

==== Open data ====
The Canadian government initiated an [[open data]] pilot project in 2012 using an open government licence, similar to the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] (CC) attribution non-commercial licence (CC BY-NC), allowing for remixing and non-commercial uses. In April 2014 [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|Industry Canada]] launched Digital Canada&amp;nbsp;150, which aims to support "connecting, and protecting Canadians, economic opportunities, digital government and Canadian content."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[CANARIE]] is a federally funded corporation that manages and develops digital research infrastructure for research and education, operating the backbone network of Canada's National Research and Education Network. Along with the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]]'s (NRC) Knowledge Management and the [[Canadian Association of Research Libraries]], CANARIE supports Research Data Canada in meeting researcher needs in the coordination and promotion of data management. The strategy includes developing [[open science]] and open data to facilitate easy and open access to publications and related data resulting from federally funded research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Creative Commons Canada ====
The creation and use of OER benefits from the development and use of Creative Commons licences, which provide the legal framework to share these resources. A non-profit organization, Creative Common Canada (CC Canada) supports a legal and technical infrastructure for openness. It has created a set of free licensing tools permitting authors and developers to share, re-use and remix materials with an explicit "some rights reserved but others clearly allowed" approach to copyright. As an affiliate of the larger body, CC Canada is a collaborative initiative made up of the [[Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic]] (CIPPIC) at the [[University of Ottawa]], BCcampus, and [[Athabasca University]] (AU).

In addition to helping users choose licences and find Creative Commons-licensed work, CC Canada is a proponent of [[open government]] and the philosophy that government data should be accessible, shareable and reusable under open licences by everyone. It is actively involved in this pursuit, studying how CC licences can be used by governments to make data freely available for public use. Another CC Canada project is being spearheaded by its legal team at CIPPIC, which is researching the development of user-friendly tools that will provide comprehensive knowledge on how to analyse and use different open licences. CC Canada has also launched a series of conferences across the country to raise awareness of Creative Commons and its potential for educators, writers, artists, and others. In May 2014, Ryan Merkley, a Canadian, was appointed CEO of Creative Commons worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Council of Ministers of Education of Canada ====
The Council of Ministers of Education of Canada (CMEC) is an organization of 13 provincial and territorial ministries of education. In response to [[UNESCO 2012 Paris OER Declaration|UNESCO's 2012 Paris Declaration on OER]], CMEC first discussed OER at a national meeting in 2012. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to open access and to adapt educational practices to the new realities of information sharing. After further discussions in 2013, the ministers unanimously endorsed the Paris Declaration. This has played an important role in the growing support for OER across Canada and has been instrumental in the establishment of OER initiatives in the western provinces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Tri-agency open access policy ====
The three Canadian research-funding agencies&amp;nbsp;– the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR), the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada]] (NSERC) and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council|Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]] (SSHRC)&amp;nbsp;– have agreed on a draft policy supporting open access in scholarly publications. These agencies strongly support knowledge sharing and research collaboration, both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== National and international initiatives ===
Several OER initiatives in Canada feature national and international collaboration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== OER universitas ====
[[OER Universitas|OER universitas]] (OERu) offers free online university courses in collaboration with Canadian partners, offering formal credentials from the partner institutions. OERu is a consortium of more than 36 institutions and several organizations on five continents. It is dedicated to widening access and reducing the cost of post-secondary education for learners by providing OER pathways to achieve formal credentials.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R., Mackintosh, W., &amp; Taylor, J. (2013). Open Educational Resources university: An assessment and credit for students' initiative. In R. McGreal, W. Kinutha, &amp; S. Marshall (Eds.), ''Open Educational Resources: Innovation research and practice''. Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.col.org/PublicationDocuments/&lt;/nowiki&gt; pub_PS_OER-IRP_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven members of the OERu in Canada: three universities (Athabasca in Alberta and [[Thompson Rivers University|Thompson Rivers]] and [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University|Kwantlen]] in British Columbia); one community college ([[Portage College]] in Alberta); and three organisations (BCcampus, eCampus Alberta, and [[Contact North]] in Ontario).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== BCcampus ====
BCcampus, arguably the most-active collaborative Canadian organization in the open practices arena, is a publicly funded service that has turned to open concepts and methods to create a sustainable approach to online learning for the public post-secondary institutions of British Columbia (BC). BCcampus was created to enhance students' ability not only to identify, choose, register for and take courses, but also to apply any academic credits earned to credentials at a selected home institution. It was intended to benefit institutions through the rationalization of demand for academic opportunities from students with the supply of online courses from BC's public post-secondary institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

BCcampus has been the leader in Canada in promoting OER with CMEC. BCcampus played a major role in the decision by the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology to support and implement the Open Textbook Project, which started with a commitment to provide 40 [[open textbook]]s at the post-secondary level and is now committed to 60.&lt;ref&gt;BCcampus. (2014, February 20). 5 questions with Mary Burgess on our Open Textbook Project and the future of open education. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://bccampus&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ca/2014/02/20/5-questions-with-mary-burgess-on-our-open-textbook-project-and-the-future-of-open-education/&lt;/ref&gt; BCcampus hosted a working forum on OER for senior post-secondary institution representatives in Vancouver in October 2012, with the objective of developing a common understanding of what OER could mean for the province and of building a shared vision of how to develop and use the resources. The session also studied ways that BC could take advantage of the promise of OER and, specifically, of open textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The BCcampus Shareable Online Learning Resources repository (SOL*R) enables the licensing of, contribution to, and access to free online teaching and learning resources. Other BCcampus initiatives are also underway in support of OER, incluidng: the implementation of an initiative around apprenticeships for the trades, in partnership with BC's Industry Training Authority; and work with the North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO) to build on the success of the Remote Web-based Science Laboratory (RWSL) and open educational science courseware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Alberta OER====

The Campus Alberta Open Educational Resources (ABOER) Initiative was a 3-year $2&amp;nbsp;million government-funded initiative designed to assist with reducing the costs of a post-secondary education for students; and to provide students and faculty members with flexibility, offering updated, relevant content for learning. In March 2013, the Alberta Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BC and Saskatchewan to collaborate on the development of common OER within their respective advanced-education sectors, recognizing the benefits of sharing existing OER with a focus on mutual areas of interest. This MOU was foundational to the establishment of the ABOER Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://albertaoer.com/content/aboer-projects|title=Campus ABOER Initiative {{!}} oer.ualberta.ca|website=albertaoer.com|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through partnerships with BCcampus, the initiative launched an ABOER Collection within SOL*R for open educational resources created or adapted by Albertans.

The ABOER Initiative funded over forty grant projects in Alberta across 31 publicly funded post-secondary institutions. In March 2017, program evaluation reported $482,000 in cost savings after one term (fall 2016) of open textbook adoption and forecasted cost savings of $5.5&amp;nbsp;million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9wIdVxGbvSdZkFzM25GanFuNmM/view?usp=sharing|title=Campus Alberta OER Initiative Program Evaluation|last=McNutt|first=Krysta|last2=Brailey|first2=Michelle|date=March 31, 2017|website=www.albertaoer.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broader evaluation of cost savings including the adoption of ABOER-funded OER development and results of awareness initiatives remains to be evaluated. The report indicates an estimated one year of OER adoption to recuperate the investment of resource development.

eCampus Alberta (closed March 2017) funded the development of an OER awareness course&lt;ref&gt;[https://moodle.gprc.ab.ca/course/view.php?id=6979 Open Educational Resources Awareness Course]&lt;/ref&gt; and peer review of BCcampus OER.

The work of the ABOER Initiative and eCampus Alberta continued through a provincial OER Community of Practice (CoP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertaoer.com/community Alberta OER Community of Practice (CoP)]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to encourage open educational practices in Alberta. In May 2017, [[University of Alberta]] hosted the first Alberta OER Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBt3v5tRR6evuvBJJN63fuhwJKYQMS6RFhGb31qs7Iw/view Alberta OER Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

====eCampus Ontario====

eCampusOntario.ca is the primary face of the Ontario Online Learning Consortium (OOLC), a not-for-profit corporation whose membership is composed of all publicly-funded colleges and universities in Ontario, and whose funding comes from the Government of Ontario. {{As of|2016|September|12|df=US|post=,}} eCampus Ontario is led by CEO, David Porter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecampusontario.ca/news/bcit-associate-vice-president-dr-david-porter-selected-as-new-ceo-of-ecampusontario|title=eCampus Ontario|website=eCampus Ontario|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a background in leading the open education movement in British Columbia with SFU, BCcampus, and BCIT, eCampus Ontario has already begun to bring OER and practices to the forefront of Ontario's education system. OER initiatives from eCampus Ontario include $2.6&amp;nbsp;million in open research and innovation funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecampusontario.ca/news/ecampusontario-awards-26-million-in-research--innovation-funding|title=eCampus Ontario|website=eCampus Ontario|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open textbook library, and a collaborative project with [[Ryerson University]] to create an open publishing platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecampusontario.ca/news/ecampusontario-ryerson-university-to-create-open-publishing-infrastructure-for-ontario-post-secondary-educators-learners|title=eCampus Ontario|website=eCampus Ontario|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutional initiatives ===

==== Athabasca University ====
There has been, and continues to be, significant OER activity at [[Athabasca University]] (AU). It was the first university in Canada to join the [[OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare Consortium]] (now the Open Education Consortium [OEC]) and, as of 2014, remains the only Canadian institutional member. The Province of Alberta and AU hosted the 2015 OEC conference in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], with over 250&amp;nbsp;delegates from more than 26&amp;nbsp;countries. AU was also given an OEC ACE Award in 2014 for its highly visible OER research website, the OER Knowledge Cloud.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

AU is home to the Technology Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute (TEKRI) and the [[UNESCO]]/COL/ICDE Chair in OER, both of which promote research into, and the implementation of, OER at institutional, national, and international levels. The OER Chair is also a member of the board of the OER Foundation, which hosts the OER universitas (OERu).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

AU's adoption of open access began with the creation of the scholarly journal ''International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning'' (IRRODL) in 1999, and continued in 2005 with the implementation of AUSpace, a [[DSpace]] repository of scholarly articles, theses and other documents produced within the AU community. AUPress was the first open access university press in Canada, starting in 2010, and offers over 100 volumes. Other AU open initiatives include participating in workshops and conferences, conducting a mapping of open educational activities with POERUP (policies for OER uptake) and eMundus Europrojects, and supporting GO-GN, the Global OER Graduate Network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Thompson Rivers University Open Learning ====
Thompson Rivers University (TRU) houses the former BC Open University as its distance education wing, called [[Thompson Rivers University, Open Learning|TRU Open Learning]]. It is working with several OERu partner institutions to provide initial prototype courses to be released as OER. TRU Open Learning has a robust system for [[prior learning assessment and recognition]] (PLAR) that includes challenge examinations and transfer of credit. This makes it a key partner for OER initiatives nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== OCAD University ====
The [[Inclusive Design Research Centre]] (IDRC), a research and development centre at [[OCAD University]] (formerly the Ontario College of Art and Design), consists of an international community of open practice advocates. The learning technologies and products that have been developed at by IDRC are distributed under the [[GNU General Public License|GNU General Public Licence]]. This means that the code is [[Open-source software|open source]] and requires users to share products under the same liberal licensing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A key project, FLOE (Flexible Learning for Open Education), is currently one of the IDRC's biggest initiatives. It has received substantial funding from the [[Hewlett Foundation]] and the [[European Commission]]. FLOE takes advantage of the fact that the centre has a set of curricula that is openly licensed and can be repurposed and re-used to make content accessible. This makes FLOE heavily dependent on OER, which presents an optimal learning environment to meet the needs of all learners, including those with disabilities. FLOE advances the strengths and values of open education and encourages pedagogical and technical innovation. It also promotes OER for content portability, ease of updating, internationalization and localization, content re-use and repurposing, and more efficient and effective content discovery. FLOE's work is international and broad. For example, to support adoption in Africa and other areas where mobile devices are more prevalent than Internet access, FLOE creates tools and services for delivery as OER via audio, text messages, and the small screens found on popular cellphones. These same tools and services are intended to support accessibility through inclusive design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Contact North ====
[[Contact North]] (CN) is Ontario's distance education and training network. It provides programming from public colleges, universities and schools with a focus on smaller towns, rural and remote communities. In 2011, Contact North published "Open Educational Resources (OER) Opportunities for Ontario", a major position paper stating the case for a provincial OER initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Contact North. (2011, October). ''Open educational resources (OER) opportunities for Ontario''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://oerknowledgecloud.org/?q=content/open-&lt;/nowiki&gt; educational-resources-oer-opportunities-ontario&lt;/ref&gt; Contact North has also published an OER primer as a video series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Téléuniversité du Québec (TÉLUQ) ====
[[TÉLUQ]]'s policies on the dissemination of educational resources were presented in "Politique de gestion de la di usion des ressources d'enseignement et d'apprentissage" (REA). These policies relate to learning content in general and could include OER, but are also designed for proprietary content. Because TÉLUQ faculty retain the intellectual property of all original material they produce for teaching, institutional policy has limited impact on what professors do with their material. Laboratoire en Informatique Cognitive et Environnements de Formation (LICEF) is a research centre at TÉLUQ, and hosts the Banques des ressources éeducatives en réseau (brer), a repository of French-language OER.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Massive open online courses ==
{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are Canadian in origin. The name dates to an experimental course led by [[George Siemens]] at the University of Manitoba and [[Stephen Downes]] at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 2008 (Tamburri, 2014). They taught a regular online university credit course, "Connectivism and Connective Knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;Downes, S., &amp; Siemens, G. (2008). Connectivism and connective knowledge. The Daily Archives. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://connect.downes.ca/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with 25 students; and more than 2,200 additional learners joined the course online. As Siemens reports, this course, delivered in 2008, was the first MOOC to combine open content with open teaching. This concept was developed from the idea of an open wiki pioneered by [[David A. Wiley]] at Utah State University and a 2007 open-boundary graduate course facilitated by Dr. Alec Couros at the University of Regina, in which 20 registered students were joined by approximately 200 non-credit international students.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, G. (2012). MOOCs are really a platform. ''Elearnspace''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/07/25/moocs-are-really-a-&lt;/nowiki&gt; platform/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Pancasila University''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Universitas Pancasila'') is a private university located in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. Its main campus is located in [[Jagakarsa]], [[South Jakarta]] while its postgraduate campus is located in [[Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]].

The university was founded in 1966, following the merger of the old Pancasila University (founded in 1963) and Bung Karno University. The university has produced in excess of 50,000 alumni, with an annual graduating class of over 1,500.

==History==
The university was declared on 28 October 1966, following the merger of the older Pancasila University which was itself founded in 1963 and the Bung Karno University which was founded in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yani|first1=Achmad|title=Djanuari s|publisher=Pusat Penerangan Angkatan Darat|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAc5AQAAIAAJ|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be mistaken with another identically named university founded in 1999), partially due to the pressure from the [[Suharto]] government against symbolism of the [[Sukarno|former president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MD|first1=Isfandiari|last2=Rasta|first2=Iwan|title=Bung: Memoar Tentang Mahbub Djunaidi|date=2017|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9786024335342|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHA5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ph"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://english.univpancasila.ac.id/index.php/2013-01-05-07-03-7/sejarah|publisher=Pancasila University|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amir Murtono]] acted as the first rector of the university until 1978.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite web|title=REKTOR UNIVERSITAS PANCASILA KE-6 DILANTIK|url=http://www.univpancasila.ac.id/index.php/seluruhberita/272-pelantikan-rektor-universitas-pancasilaperiode-2014-2018|publisher=Pancasila University|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, it received a grant from the Indonesian [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] in form of 10,160 square meters of land in [[Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]], and later on the university moved its undergraduate location to its newly constructed Faculty of Economics building in [[Jagakarsa]] on 1988.&lt;ref name="ph"/&gt;

On 2015, the university put forth a proposal to nationalize the university, claiming that they were willing to hand over Rp 40 trillion (USD 3 billion) in assets to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Purnama|first1=R Ratna|title=Peralihan UP Jadi PTN Ditargetkan Selesai Akhir Tahun|url=https://nasional.sindonews.com/read/978842/144/peralihan-up-jadi-ptn-ditargetkan-selesai-akhir-tahun-1426757864|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Sindonews|date=19 March 2015|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lantara|first1=Feru|title=Siswono : Aset Universitas Pancasila Mencapai Rp40 Triliun|url=https://megapolitan.antaranews.com/berita/24573/siswono--aset-universitas-pancasila-mencapai-rp40-triliun|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=ANTARA|date=6 October 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposal fell out with the provost citing the lack of land in the university's possession as a primary cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Universitas Pancasila Batal Jadi Perguruan Tinggi Negeri|url=http://www.viva.co.id/berita/nasional/950893-universitas-pancasila-batal-jadi-perguruan-tinggi-negeri|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=VIVA|date=28 August 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 50th anniversary of the university in 2016, 1,711 scholars graduated from the university, which had a total of 13,000 active students and over 52,000 alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanjaya|first1=Dwi Putra|title=Tepat 50 Tahun Universitas Pancasila, 1.711 Mahasiswa Di Wisuda|url=http://www.suaraekonomi.com/wisuda-50-tahun-universitas-pancasila/|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Suara Ekonomi|date=6 October 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tempo]], the university's Faculty of Law is one of the favorites in Indonesia among other private universities such as [[Pelita Harapan University]] and [[Islamic University of Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apa Saja Fakultas-fakultas Favorit, Simak Detilnya|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/740129/apa-saja-fakultas-fakultas-favorit-simak-detilnya|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Tempo|date=28 January 2016|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current rector is Wahono Sumaryono, who will serve until 2018.&lt;ref name="pr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2555">A '''reptile centre''' (or '''reptile center''') is typically a facility devoted to keeping living [[reptiles]], educating the public about reptiles, and serving as a control centre for collecting reptiles that turn up in populated areas. Most are public-access, run as private business or state-sponsored.  Some centres work with venomous reptiles as [[venom]] research labs. Others are simply privately run zoos devoted to solely to reptiles or are incorporated into larger zoos or organizations.

One example is the reptile centre in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]], Australia, devoted to [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] reptiles. Many are collected from local homes, yards, or from areas about to be burned under the controlled burning program to keep summer grass fires from threatening the local homes. Most of the reptiles end up being relocated to uninhabited areas. The Alice Springs centre also doubles as a snake call centre, with the owner and staff coming out to homes to remove venomous snakes from inconvenient places.

In [[United States|America]], Black Hills Reptile Gardens is the nation's largest collection of [[reptile]]s. It is located at [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] in the heart of the [[Black Hills]]. It was founded in 1937.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reptile-gardens.com/history/ Reptile Gardens History] retrieved on December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the United States, the [[St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park]] is the only complete collection of the world's crocodilians. In 1893 the St. Augustine Alligator Farm started as a small facility, displaying the American Alligator. It is accredited with the AZA ([[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6561">'''Maria del Rosario “Rosie” Castro''' (born 1947) is a [[Mexican-Americans|Mexican-American]] [[civil rights activist]] and educator from [[San Antonio, Texas]], who has been involved in several prominent groups, such as the Young Democrats of America, the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]], the Committee for Barrio Betterment, and the [[Raza Unida Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Latinas in the United States : a historical encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=Indiana University Press |last=Ruíz |first=Vicki |last2=Sánchez Korrol |first2=Virginia |isbn=0253111692 |location=Bloomington |oclc=74671044}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the mother of [[Julian Castro]] and [[Joaquín Castro]]. 
== Early life and education ==
Born to Victoria and Victor Castro, Rosie was raised by her mother and a guardian, Marcia Garcia, in San Antonio. Growing up in the San Antonio barrio, Castro cited the beginning of her interest in social justice in witnessing the racial and economic boundaries that affected her family, especially her mother.&lt;ref name="chicanas" /&gt;

With a scholarship from her valedictorian title and other financial means, she successfully enrolled at [[Our Lady of the Lake University]], intending to become a teacher, before earning a degree in Spanish in 1971. At OLLU, she joined with the Catholic Youth Association, but took issue with the organization's lack of minority membership.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressnews.com/150years/people/article/Rosie-Castro-community-and-political-activist-6153232.php|title=Castro twins' mom pretty impressive herself|date=2015-03-27|work=ExpressNews.com|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at OLLU that Castro first became involved in student activism through the Young Democrats, and organizing the campus-required Young Republicans chapter in response.&lt;ref name=chicanas&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chicanas in charge : Texas women in the public arena |last=Gutiérrez |first=José Angel |date=2007 |publisher=AltaMira Press |last2=Meléndez |first2=Michelle |last3=Noyola |first3=Sonia Adriana |isbn=9780759113947 |location=Lanham |oclc=648584387}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Career and activism ==
Rosie first worked as a volunteer for [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon B. Johnson’s]] 1964 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="chicanas" /&gt;  Later she joined with the Mexican American Unity Council. With MAUC, she participated in and helped to organize the organization’s boycott of the San Antonio Savings Association, a savings and loan operation headed by former San Antonio Mayor Walter McAllister.&lt;ref name="chicanas" /&gt;

Rosie was active during the "[[Angela Davis|Free Angela Davis]]" Campaign of 1971, and during this period she was under observation by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Joseph S. Stroud |url=https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/FBI-file-on-Rev-Black-is-chapter-in-city-s-689365.php |title=FBI file on Rev. Black is chapter in city's history |date=October 5, 2010 |work=San Antonio Express-News |access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro worked with the [[Raza Unida Party]]'s 1970s initiative to field Mexican-American candidates in Texas, serving as the [[Bexar County]] party chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.uta.edu/tejanovoices/interview.php?cmasno=123|title=Tejano Voices {{!}} Interviews|last=Arlington|first=State of Texas, University of Texas at|website=library.uta.edu|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the RUP worked alongside the San Antonio Committee for Barrio Betterment to pursue positions in the city.  With the CBB, Castro herself became a candidate in 1971 for the [[San Antonio City Council]], finishing second among four candidates.&lt;ref name="chicanas" /&gt; 

Castro received a Master's Degree in Public Administration from [[The University of Texas at San Antonio]] and worked at [[Palo Alto College]], where she served as Interim Dean of Student Affairs from 2008 until she retired in 2013.&lt;ref name=express /&gt;

== Personal life and legacy ==
Castro continues to be involved in community and national organizations such as Latinas Represent, the Texas Organizing Project, and [[AARP]]. 

In 2015, she was elected to the San Antonio Women’s Hall of Fame,&lt;ref name=express /&gt; and in 2017 she was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Our Lady of the Lake University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therivardreport.com/rosie-castro-to-be-awarded-honorary-doctorate-on-mothers-day/|title=Rosie Castro to be Awarded Honorary Doctorate on Mother’s Day|work=Rivard Report|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro is also a published poet, contributing four pieces to the anthology, ''Entre Guadalupe y Malinche: Tejanas in Literature and Art'', published by the [[University of Texas Press]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Entre Guadalupe y Malinche : Tejanas in literature and art |last=Hernández-Avila |first=Inés |last2=Cantú |first2=Norma E. |isbn=9781477307960 |edition= First |location=Austin |oclc=913469871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Joaquin Castro and Julian Castro have cited Rosie's activism as the foundation for their political careers. Julian noted in his keynote address that "my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Josh Baugh |url=https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/From-political-matriarch-Rosie-Castro-the-sons-3905913.php |title=From political matriarch Rosie Castro, the sons also rise |date=September 30, 2012 |work=San Antonio Express-News|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later interview with [[Texas Monthly]], Julian also noted “Maria del Rosario Castro has never held a political office ... However, today, years later, I read the newspapers, and I see that more Valdezes are sitting on school boards, that a greater number of Garcias are now doctors, lawyers, engineers and, of course, teachers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Balli |first=Cecilia |date=October 2002 |title=Twins Peak |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/twins-peak/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |volume=30 |issue=10 |page=153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Royal Bailey Farnum''' (11 June 1884 – 28 August 1967) was an American art educator who served in administrative roles in various public and private educational institutions in Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island during the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ohles | first = Frederik | last2 = Ohles | first2 = Shirley | publication-date = 1978 | title = Biographical Dictionary of Modern American Educators | edition = 1 | publication-place = [[Westport, Connecticut]] | publisher = Greenwood Press | isbn = 978-0-8371-9893-4 | oclc = 3447005 | year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:Fearnhame.jpg|thumb|''Fearnhame'', Farnum's vacation and later retirement home in [[Hampton, Connecticut]]]]
He was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] to Daniel Stoddard Farnum and Flora L. Bailey. He married the former Adeline Burnett on 19 December 1907 and raised three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Dr. Farnum, 83, Dies; Famed in Art World | newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]] | publication-place=[[Providence, Rhode Island]] | date=1967-08-29 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design|Massachusetts Normal Art School]] in 1906 and took a job as the Director of the Normal Department of the [[Cleveland Institute of Art|Cleveland School of Art]], while simultaneously teaching art in the Cleveland Public School District. In 1909, he became the Director of Art Education for the State of New York.

Farnum was initially hired to be the Superintendent of the Department of Applied Arts at the [[Rochester Athenæum and Mechanics Institute]] in 1918, but rose to the presidency the next year, serving until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Saffran | first = Michael | publication-date = March 2007 | title = RIT's presidential history | periodical = RIT news &amp; events | publication-place = [[Henrietta, New York]] | publisher = Rochester Institute of Technology | volume = 39 | issue = 11 | url = http://www.rit.edu/~930www/NewsEvents/2007/Mar02/t6.html | accessdate = 2008-01-18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080124094806/http://www.rit.edu/~930www/NewsEvents/2007/Mar02/t6.html | archivedate = 2008-01-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farnum, faced with state-mandated raises for secondary school teachers and enrollment swollen with veterans of [[World War I]], embarked on a fund-raising campaign  to boost the compensation of the Institute's faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gordon | first = Dane R. | publication-date = 2007 | title = Rochester Institute of Technology:  Industrial Development and Educational Innovation in an American City, 1829–2006 | edition = 1 | publication-place = [[Henrietta, New York]] | publisher = RIT Press | page = 117 | isbn = 978-1-933360-24-9 | oclc = 80360669 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also considered proposals to merge with the [[University of Rochester]] or to take over the University's old buildings as it moved to its [[University of Rochester#River Campus|River Campus]], ideas that were opposed by both [[George Eastman]] and Carl Lomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gordon | first = Dane R. | publication-date = 2007 | title = Rochester Institute of Technology:  Industrial Development and Educational Innovation in an American City, 1829–2006 | edition = 1 | publication-place = [[Henrietta, New York]] | publisher = RIT Press | page = 118 | isbn = 978-1-933360-24-9 | oclc = 80360669 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farnum also served on the [[Memorial Art Gallery]] Board of Managers from 1920 to 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Brayer | first = Elizabeth | title = MAGnum Opus:  The Story of the Memorial Art Gallery | edition = 1 | year = 1988 | publisher = [[Memorial Art Gallery]] | location = [[Rochester, New York]] | isbn = 978-0-918098-02-3 | oclc = 18496839 | page = 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, he returned to the Massachusetts Normal Art School to serve as its Principal and as Director of Art Education for the state of Massachusetts.

==The Rhode Island School of Design==
[[File:Farnum Hall oblique.jpg|left|thumb|Farnum Residence Hall on Congdon Street, [[Providence, Rhode Island]]]]
In 1929, he took a job as Educational Director for the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] and was subsequently promoted to Executive Vice President in 1937.

He served as president of the National Association for Art Education from 1936–1938, the National Association of Schools of Design from 1925–1936, and the Federal Council on Art Education from 1925–1936.

During [[World War II]], he helped the war effort by assisting in the development of color schemes for optimal camouflage.

Farnum was bestowed with an honorary [[Doctor of Arts|Art D.]] from [[Brown University]] in 1935 and received the Michael Friedsam Medal in 1942. RISD's Farnum Hall is named after him. He retired from RISD in 1946 and died in [[Plainfield, Connecticut]] in 1967.

'''SimpleDL''' is digital collection management software that allows for the upload, description, management and access of digital collections and is UTF-8 compatible. SimpleDL is not limited by format and is capable of handling documents, [[PDF]]s, images, videos, audio files, and data only objects. In addition to simple digital files, SimpleDL can also connect content so multipage documents, scores, or books can be uploaded and organized into chapters, books or by page number. SimpleDL can also combine any number of images into one display object. SimpleDL is mostly used by libraries, archives, museums, government agencies, universities, corporations, historical societies, and other organizations that wish to host a digital collection.

==Design==
SimpleDL is standards-based and supports numerous industry standards including [[Unicode]], Qualified Dublin Core, XML, and OAI-PMH.  The [[metadata]] is based on [[Dublin Core]], a flexible extensible metadata standard created by [[OCLC]] in 1995.  Dublin Core has been accepted as an [[NISO]] standard (NISO Standard Z39.85-2001).

==The Process: How It Works==
Digital items can be added to a SimpleDL digital collection through standard web browsers and standard web interfaces. Items can be added one at a time or in batches. The digital collections reside on a SimpleDL Server, either installed locally or on an SimpleDL-hosted server.

Additional collection management functions are available such as creating and editing metadata templates, administering the use of [[controlled vocabularies]], importing metadata (tab-delimited text), exporting [[metadata]] in [[XML]], generating [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] during the import export using the OCR Extension, and viewing statistical reports.

==Framework==
Searching abilities are provided by a custom [[Solr]] build, permanent storage is provided by [[MySQL]] database engine, and pages are served through the [[Apache HTTP Server]] and [[PHP]].  SimpleDL also has an option to store and deliver the digital documents with [[Amazon S3]] to provide high durability of files. SimpleDL hosted collections are hosted using Amazon EC2 servers.

The '''Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge''' ('''SPCK''') is the oldest [[Anglican]] [[Christian mission|mission]] organisation, and the leading publisher of Christian books in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipg.uk.com/independent-publishing-awards|title=IPG Independent Publishing Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=ipg.uk.com|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1698 by [[Thomas Bray]] (an Anglican priest), and a small group of friends including Lord Guilford, Sir Humphrey Mackworth, Mr Justice Hooke, and Colonel Maynard Colchester. The emphasis was on setting up schools. The SPCK was influential in setting up church schools across Britain, when there were few schools for poor childen.  In the 21st century, the SPCK is most widely known for its publishing of Christian books.

The Society was founded to encourage Christian education and the production and distribution of Christian literature. SPCK has always sought to find ways to communicate the basic principles of the Christian faith to a wider audience, both in Britain and overseas.  A related Scottish society was founded in 1709. It sent missions to Scotland's Highlands, and a handful to Indians in the American colonies.

==Education==
In its first two hundred years, the Society founded many [[charity school]]s for poor children in the 7 to 11 age group. It is from these schools that the modern concept of [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] has grown. The Society also provided [[teacher training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Schooling before the 19th Century| work =Living Heritage| publisher =UK Parliament| url =http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/livinglearning/school/overview/before19thcentury/| accessdate =1 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SPCK continues to support education in the UK by provide free assembly resources via its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblies.org.uk/|title=Assemblies.org.uk|website=|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
Thomas Bray believed passionately in the power of the printed word. From its earliest days, the SPCK commissioned tracts and pamphlets, making it the third-oldest publishing house in England. (Only the [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Press]]es have existed longer.)

Throughout the eighteenth century SPCK was by far the largest producer of Christian literature in Britain. The range of its output was considerable—from pamphlets aimed at specific groups such as farmers, prisoners, soldiers, seamen, servants and slave-owners, to more general works on subjects such as baptism, confirmation, Holy Communion, the Prayer Book, and private devotion. Increasingly, more substantial books were also published, both on Christian subjects and, from the 1830s onwards, on general educational topics as well. At present, key authors for SPCK include Anglican New Testament Scholar [[N. T. Wright]], former Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]], [[Paula Gooder]], and [[Alister McGrath]]. Recent exciting additions to SPCK's list include [[Guvna B]], and Ben Cooley, founder of [[Hope for Justice]].

In the early 21st century, SPCK's publishing team produces around 80 titles per year, for audiences from a wide range of Christian traditions and none. Books range from the academic to the popular, from devotional literature and works on spirituality to books addressing contemporary issues in the Church and society. SPCK also raises funds for and project manages a number of charitable programs, including books for prisoners via Diffusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diffusionbooks.org.uk/|title=Diffusion Books|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of mission. Recent publishing innovations include the launch of a fiction imprint, Marylebone House, in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marylebonehousebooks.co.uk/about-us|title=Marylebone House - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a move to support the InterVarsity Press UK (IVP) in 2015/16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/ivp-and-spck-partner-314290|title=IVP and SPCK Partnership revealed|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution (bookshops) ==
SPCK's early publications were distributed through a network of supporters who received books and tracts to sell or give away in their own localities. Large quantities of Christian literature were provided for the Navy, and the Society actively encouraged the formation of parish libraries, to help both clergy and laity. By the nineteenth century, members had organized local district committees, many of which established small book depots—which at one time numbered over four hundred. These were overseen by central committees such as the [Committee of General Literature and Education]. In 1899 the addresses of their 'depositories' in London were given as Northumberland Avenue, W.C.; Charing Cross, W.C. and 43 Queen Victoria Street, E.C.&lt;ref&gt;"The Dawn of Day", 256th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later in edition 331 the depository was closed at Charing Cross, but a new one added Brighton: 129, North Street.

In the 1930s a centrally co-ordinated network of SPCK Bookshops was established, offering a wide range of books from many different publishers. At its peak, the SPCK bookshop chain consisted of 40 shops in the UK and 20 overseas. The latter were gradually passed into local ownership during the 1960s and 1970s.

Holy Trinity Church, Marylebone, Westminster, London is a former Anglican church, built in 1828 by Sir John Soane. By the 1930s, it had fallen into disuse and in 1936 was used by the newly founded Penguin Books company to store books. A children's slide was used to deliver books from the street into the large crypt.

In 1937 Penguin moved out to Harmondsworth, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) moved in. It was their headquarters until 2004, when they relocated to [[Diocese of London|London Diocesan House]] in Causton Street, Pimlico. The bookshop relocated to Tufton St in 2003.

On 1 November 2006, St. Stephen The Great Charitable Trust [SSG] took over the Bookshops but continued to trade under the SPCK name, under licence from SPCK. That licence was withdrawn in October 2007. However, some shops continued trading as SPCK Bookshops without licence until the SSG operation was closed down in 2009. After October 2006, SPCK no longer owned or operated any bookshops.

== Overseas mission (worldwide) ==
SPCK has worked overseas since its foundation. The initial focus was the British colonies in the Americas.  Libraries were established for the use of clergy and their parishioners, and books were frequently shipped across the Atlantic by sail throughout the eighteenth century. By 1709 SPCK was spreading further afield: a printing press and trained printer were sent to Tranquebar in East India to assist in the production of the first translation of the Bible into [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. This was accomplished by the German [[Lutheran]] missionaries [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg]] and [[Heinrich Pluetschau]] from the [[Danish-Halle Mission]]. For its time this was a remarkably far-sighted example of ecumenical co-operation. The SPCK has continued to work closely with churches of many different denominations, whilst retaining a special relationship with churches within the Anglican Communion.

As the British Empire grew in the nineteenth century, so SPCK developed an important role in supporting the planting of new churches around the world. Funds were provided for church buildings, for schools, for theological training colleges, and to provide chaplains for the ships taking emigrants to their new homes.

During the twentieth century SPCK's overseas mission concentrated on providing free study literature for those in a number of ministerial training colleges around the world, especially in Africa. It also supported translation in India through its sister organisation there, ISPCK. Today, SPCK is working with a number of partner institutions across Africa to assist in funding and launching an African Theological Network Press, designed to facilitate the writing and distribution of contextual African theology.

It was intended to counter the threat of Catholic missionaries achieving "a serious landslide to Rome" and of growing Highland [[Jacobitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew Porter |title=Religion Versus Empire?: British Protestant Missionaries and Overseas Expansion, 1700–1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldQxO_yIPSEC&amp;pg=PP9 |year=2004 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their schools were a valuable addition to the [[Church of Scotland]] programme of [[education in Scotland]], which was based on a tax on landowners to provide a school in every parish. Some — but by no means all — Society schoolmasters were inferior in comparison to burgh and parish schools, however, "particularly in [their] acquaintance with the Evangelical System" rather than more pragmatic literacy, numeracy and teaching ability.&lt;ref name="Mason 1954"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25526234 |title=Scottish Charity Schools of the Eighteenth Century |author=John Mason |journal=Scottish Historical Review |volume=33 |issue=115 |pages=1–13 |date=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Hechter |title=Internal Colonialism: The Celtic Fringe in British National Development, 1536–1966 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aGO5ZxnjDMC&amp;pg=PA113 |year=1977 |pages=113''ff'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the SSPCK avoided using the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic language]], with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anthony W. Parker |title=Scottish Highlanders in Colonial Georgia: The Recruitment, Emigration, and Settlement at Darien, 1735–1748 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xNydb93XUMC&amp;pg=PA33 |year=2010 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSPCK rules from 1720 required the teaching of literacy and numeracy "but not any [[Latin]] or Irish"&lt;ref name="Tanner 2004"/&gt; (then a common term for Gaelic on both sides of the [[Irish Sea]]), and the Society boasted "that barbarity and the Irish language ... are almost rooted out" by their teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Our Gaelic Bible |journal=The Celtic Magazine |date=1879 |location=Edinburgh |volume=4 |page=43 }} Cited in Tanner (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1753 an act of the Society forbade students "either in the schoolhouse or when playing about the doors thereof to speak Erse, under pain of being chastised".&lt;ref name="Mason 1954"/&gt; 

In 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic–English vocabulary, then in 1767 introduced a New Testament designed with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth MacKinnon |authorlink=Ken MacKinnon |title=Gaelic: A past and future prospect |publisher=Saltire Society |year=1991 |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with more success. In 1766 they allowed their Highland schools to use Gaelic alongside English as languages of instruction.&lt;ref name="Mason 1954"/&gt; In 1790, a Society preacher still insisted that English monolingualism was a Society goal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J Macinnes |title=The Evangelical Movement in the Highlands of Scotland, 1688 to 1800 |location=Aberdeen |date=1951 |page=244 }} Cited in Tanner (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and a decade later Society schools continued to use [[corporal punishment]] against students speaking Gaelic.&lt;ref name="Tanner 2004"/&gt; In the early 19th century the Society's activity declined. Its educational work was taken over by the [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic Societies of Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow Gaelic School|Glasgow]] and [[Inverness]].

'''Teachers' Union of Ireland''' (TUI; {{lang-ga|Aontas Múinteoirí Éireann}}) is a trade union representing teachers in post-primary schools and lecturers in third level Universities, Colleges and Institutes of Technology. The TUI is affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions ([[ICTU]]) and is represented on various education governmental bodies such as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the Further Education and Training Awards Council [[FETAC]], the Higher Education and Training Awards Council [[HETAC]] and the Vocational Education Committees. The [[Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland]] (the A.S.T.I.) is the other trade union representing post-primary teachers within the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==History==
The union was founded in 1930 as the '''Vocational Educational Officers' Organisation''', and it joined the [[Irish Trades Union Congress]] the following year.  In 1955, it renamed itself as the '''Vocational Teachers' Association''', and then in 1973 it became the "Teachers' Union of Ireland".&lt;ref name="smethurst"&gt;{{cite book |first1=John B. |last1=Smethurst |first2=Peter |last2=Carter |title=Historical Directory of Trade Unions |volume=6 |page=377 |isbn=9780754666837 |lccn=80-151653 |date=June 2009 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Farnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Princeton Review''' is a [[college admission]] services company offering [[test preparation]] services, tutoring and admissions resources, online courses, and books published by [[Random House]].  The company has more than 4,000 teachers and tutors in the United States and Canada and international franchises in 14 other countries. The company is headquartered in [[New York, NY]], and is privately held. It is not associated with [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/corporate/about-us Princeton Review website, history]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate history ==
The Princeton Review was founded in 1981 by [[John Katzman]], who—shortly after leaving college—taught [[SAT]] preparation to 15 students in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/corporate/about-us Princeton Review website, history]&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as CEO until 2007, and was replaced by [[Michael Perik]].  In March 2010, Perik resigned and was replaced by John M. Connolly.  In April 2010, the company sold $48&amp;nbsp;million in stock for $3 per share, and a short time later was accused of fraud in a class action suit filed by a Michigan retirement fund, which claimed The Princeton Review leadership exaggerated earnings to boost its stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investor Accuses Princeton Review Of Fraud |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/261409/investor-accuses-princeton-review-of-fraud |accessdate=9 August 2016|newspaper=360Law|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the company was acquired by [[Charlesbank Capital]], a private equity fund, for $33&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tutor.com Acquires Princeton Review |url=ps://www.edsurge.com/news/2014-07-29-tutor-com-acquires-princeton-review |accessdate=9 August 2016|newspaper=EdSurge.com|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 1, 2014, the Princeton Review brand name and operations were bought for an undisclosed sum by [[Tutor.com]], an [[IAC (company)|IAC company]], and [[Mandy Ginsburg]] became CEO.

== Criticisms ==

===General===
Test preparation providers have been criticized in the past on the grounds that their courses claim larger score increases than they deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Hechinger |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124278685697537839 |title=SAT Coaching Found to Boost Scores – Barely |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=May 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ranking schools===
College rankings, including those published by the Princeton Review, have been criticized for failing to be accurate or comprehensive by assigning objective rankings formed from subjective opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Strauss. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/16/AR2007081602537.html "U.S. News’s College Rankings Face Competition and Criticism"], ''The Washington Post'', 17 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton Review officials counter that their rankings are unique in that they rely on student opinion and not just on statistical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college/college-rankings.aspx|title=Robert Franek – author of The Best 377 Colleges|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/best-colleges/video|title=Best 380 Colleges Videos - The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 an [[American Medical Association]] affiliated program, A Matter of Degree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/program_results_reports/2009/rwjf69648 A Matter of Degree: Reducing High-Risk Drinking Among College Students](pdf), [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], March 23, 200&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], criticized the Princeton Review list of Best [[Party school#Criticism of party school lists|Party Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/26/earlyshow/living/parenting/main519804.shtml End of Top Party School's Ranking?]. ''[[The Early Show]]''. [[CBS News]]. August 27, 2002. Retrieved on October 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[USA Today]]'' published an editorial titled "Sobering Statistics"&lt;ref&gt;USA TODAY OPED Staff,[http://inthenews.unt.edu/sites/default/files/PDF/2002/8/20/08_20_2002_USAT_Sobering.pdf "Sobering Statistics"], ''[[USA Today]]'', Aug. 20, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; in August 2002 and stated, "the doctor's group goes too far in suggesting that the rankings contribute to the problem (of campus drinking)."  The editorial noted the fact that among the schools the AMA program was then funding as part of its campaign against campus drinking, six of 10 of those schools calling for The Princeton Review to "drop the annual ranking...had made (Princeton Review's) past top-party-school lists: many times for some.  That's no coincidence."  The editorial commended The Princeton Review for reporting the list, calling it "a public service" for "student applicants and their parents".

Rankings for [[LGBT]]-related lists have also been criticized as inaccurate due to outdated methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/society/education/2009/08/13/princeton-reviews-approach-outdated|title=Princeton Review's Approach is Outdated - Advocate.com|date=2015-11-17|website=www.advocate.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Princeton Review bases its LGBT-Friendly and LGBT-Unfriendly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schoollist.aspx?id=707|title=School Rankings|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; top twenty ranking lists, which asks undergraduates: "Do students, faculty, and administrators at your college treat all persons equally regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identify/expression?"  The Princeton Review also publishes ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Guide to College Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/princetonreview/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307945013|title=The Princeton Review|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/lgbtq/college-guide.aspx Guide to College for LGBT Students].

===Privacy concerns===
In 2016, the company was criticized by privacy rights advocates who worry that a company that owns online dating and college preparation services could amass data and exploit it in a way that preys on unsuspecting consumers, particularly younger people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_29762266/ken-mceldowney-consumer-data-online-needs-be-protected [[The Mercury News]], April 15, 2016, editorial by Ken McEldowney]&lt;/ref&gt;   "Do parents know that when their underage kids enroll for exam prep or tutoring, personal information may be shared with hookup sites that could then target their kids to become customers?" asked one critic, who concluded that the company "makes no guarantee that data sharing among its entities will not include those customers whose sole aim is to improve their grades and test scores."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/lindachavez/2016/01/08/violating-privacy-is-bad-business-n2101280|title=Violating Privacy Is Bad Business|date=8 January 2016|publisher=Townhall.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, another critic points out that The Princeton Review "policy states 'we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit our site'—information like data 'regarding your academic and extracurricular activities and interests.' That information can be used to 'send you email notices and offers; perform research and analysis about your use of or interest in our products, services or products or services offered by others; [and] develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-alexander/recent-online-dating-comp_b_9307742.html |title=Recent Online Dating Company IPO Raises Questions About Privacy |date=24 February 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
