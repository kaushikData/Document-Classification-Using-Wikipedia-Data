In [[Hopi mythology]], '''Ahöl Mana''' is a Kachina Mana, a maiden spirit, also called a [[kachina]]. She is represented as a standard Kachin Mana; it is because she arrives with [[Ahöla]] that she is called Ahöl Mana. During the Powamu ceremony, she goes with Ahöla as he visits various kivas and ceremonial houses. On these visits Ahöl Mana carries a tray with various kinds of seeds.

'''Aliza Olmert''' ({{lang-he|עליזה אולמרט}}; born 1946) is an Israeli artist, photographer, author and social worker. She is married to former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Aliza olmert 1.jpg|thumb|right|Laura Bush welcomes Aliza Olmert]]

Aliza Olmert was born in a [[displaced persons camp]] in [[Eschwege]], [[Germany]]. Her parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Łódź]], [[Poland]]. She immigrated to Israel with her family in 1949, grew up in [[Ramat Gan]], and served as an instructor in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981971.html |title=That Midas touch |work=Haaretz}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met her husband, [[Ehud Olmert]], at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where she was studying social work.&lt;ref name=Shabi&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |title=The unlikely first lady |author=Rachel Shabi |date=5 May 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/05/israel1 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmerts live in Jerusalem's [[Katamon]] neighborhood. They have five children (including [[Shaul Olmert]]), one of them adopted.&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

=== Art career ===
In 1985–1988, at the age of 40, Olmert studied environmental design at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]]. In Israel, Olmert has exhibited at the Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem, the Museum of Israeli Art in Ramat Gan, the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv and the Tel Aviv Artists' House.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; Her work has also been exhibited in Japan, Uruguay, Italy, Britain, Poland, Argentina and New York.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; In March 2008, she was awarded the Steiger Prize in Germany.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

===Politics===

Olmert espouses left-wing politics, and has been accused of influencing her husband's political views. Olmert dislikes the political limelight, and says that their most difficult period as a couple was 1993–2003, when Ehud was mayor of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

She is said to support [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Berger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/international/middleeast/13israel.html How a Zionist Hawk Grew His New Dovish Feathers], ''New York Times'' (13 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social welfare ===
Olmert is active in social programs promoting child welfare. She is the chairman of Or Shalom and Tlalim, which aid children at risk and families with homebound sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nir Magal |date=14 May 2006 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3250714,00.html |publisher=Ynet |script-title=he:עליזה אולמרט: לא אוותר על הבריחות לתל אביב |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Aliza Olmert: I will not give up on escapes to Tel Aviv |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olmert is also a member of the Action Committee for Children of Foreign Workers.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

'''Babalon''' {{IPAc-en|'|b|æ|b|æ|l|ən}} (also known as the '''Scarlet Woman''', '''Great Mother''' or '''Mother of Abominations''') is a goddess found in the occult system of [[Thelema]], which was established in 1904 with English author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]'s writing of ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', her name being later given in other works. In her most abstract form, she represents the female sexual impulse and the liberated woman. In the [[creed]] of the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]] she is also identified with [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]], in her most fertile sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Helena|author2= Tau Apiryon| title = The Invisible Basilica: The Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church: An Examination| accessdate = 2009-08-09| url = http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/creed_egc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Crowley believed that Babalon had an earthly aspect in the form of a spiritual office, which could be filled by actual women—usually as a counterpart to his own identification as "[[Therion (Thelema)|To Mega Therion]]" (The Great Beast)—whose duty was then to help manifest the energies of the current [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon of Horus]]. He believed in his life the Lady of Babalon was personified as Lady Leah Hirsig, who, after several portraits, was consecrated, taking the name Alostrael.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leah Hirsig]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}}

Babalon's consort is [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], the "Father of Life" and the male form of the [[Creative Principle]]. Babalon is often described as being girt with a sword{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} and riding the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]]. She is often referred to as a [[religious prostitution|sacred whore]], and her primary symbol is the [[Chalice (cup)|Chalice]] or [[Holy Grail|Graal]].

As Crowley wrote in his ''[[The Book of Thoth (Crowley)|The Book of Thoth]]'', "she rides astride the Beast; in her left hand she holds the reins, representing the passion which unites them. In her right she holds aloft the cup, the [[Holy Grail]] aflame with love and death. In this cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]".

==Three aspects==
Babalon is a complex figure, although, within one particular view of Thelemic literature, she is said to have three essential aspects: she is the Gateway to the [[City of the Pyramids]], the Scarlet Woman and the Great Mother.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Gateway to the City of Pyramids===
Within the mystical system of the [[Argenteum Astrum|A∴A∴]], after the adept has attained the Knowledge and Conversation of his [[Holy Guardian Angel]], he then might reach the next and last great milestone — the crossing of the [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]], that great spiritual wilderness of nothingness and dissolution. [[Choronzon]] is the dweller there, and its job is to trap the traveler in his meaningless world of illusion. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

However, Babalon is just on the other side, beckoning. If the adept gives himself totally to her—the symbol of this act being the pouring of the adept’s blood into her graal — he becomes impregnated in her, then to be reborn as a Master of the Temple and a saint that dwells in the [[City of the Pyramids]]. From Crowley's book ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'':

{{quote|[S]he guardeth the Abyss. And in her is a perfect purity of that which is above, yet she is sent as the Redeemer to them that are below. For there is no other way into the Supernal mystery but through her and the Beast on which she rideth.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Magick Without Tears]]'', ch.12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and from ''[[The Vision and the Voice]]'' (12th Aethyr):

{{quote|Let him look upon the cup whose blood is mingled therein, for the wine of the cup is the blood of the saints. Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, that rideth upon the Beast, for she hath spilt their blood in every corner of the earth and lo! she hath mingled it in the cup of her whoredom.{{cite quote|date=July 2014}} }}

She is considered to be a sacred whore because she denies no one, and yet she extracts a great price — the very blood of the adept and his ego-identity as an earthly individual. This aspect of Babalon is described further from the 12th Aethyr:

{{quote|This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of Abominations, and this is the mystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything that liveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. And because she hath made her self the servant of each, therefore is she become the mistress of all. Not as yet canst thou comprehend her glory.

Beautiful art thou, O Babylon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself to everything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For in that union thou didst understand. Therefore art thou called Understanding, O Babylon, Lady of the Night!{{cite quote|date=July 2014}} }}

The concept contained within this aspect of Babalon is that of the mystical ideal, the quest to become one with All through the annihilation of the earthly ego ("For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so is thine heart the universal heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/l418/aetyr5.html |title=The Cry of the 5th Aethyr |publisher=Hermetic.com |accessdate=2010-01-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206081417/http://hermetic.com/crowley/l418/aetyr5.html| archivedate= 6 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The blood spilling into the graal of Babalon is then used by her to "flood the world with Life and Beauty" (meaning to create Masters of the Temple that are "released" back into the world of men), symbolized by the [[Rosy Cross|Crimson Rose of 49 Petals]].&lt;ref&gt;The Vision &amp; the Voice'', 1998, p.54, 61, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sex magic]], the mixture of [[Sexual arousal|female sexual fluids]] and [[semen]] produced in the sexual act with the Scarlet Woman or Babalon is called the Elixir of Life. Another alternative form of this Elixir is the '''Elixir Rubeus''' consisting of the [[menstruation|menstrual blood]] and [[semen]] (abbreviated as ''El. Rub.'' by Crowley in his magical diaries), and is referred to as the "effluvium of Babalon, the Scarlet Woman, which is the menstruum of the lunar current" by [[Kenneth Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Kenneth. ''Nightside of Eden''. London: Frederick Muller Limited. {{ISBN|0-584-10206-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babalon's Daughter===

One of the most extensive descriptions by Crowley of Babalon's Daughter is to be found in ''The Vision and the Voice'', 9th Aethyr, quoted in ''The Book of Thoth'':

{{quote|THE VIRGIN UNIVERSE

[From The Vision and the Voice, 9th Aethyr]

We are come unto a palace of which every stone is a separate jewel, and is set with millions of moons.

And this palace is nothing but the body of a woman, proud and delicate, and beyond imagination fair. She is like a child of twelve years old. She has very deep eyelids, and long lashes. Her eyes are closed, or nearly closed. It is impossible to say anything about her. She is naked; her whole body is covered with fine gold hairs, that are the electric flames which are the spears of mighty and terrible Angels whose breastplates are the scales of her skin. And the hair of her head, that flows down to her feet, is the very light of God himself. Of all the glories beheld by the Seer in the Aethyrs, there is not one which is worthy to be compared with her littlest finger-nail. For although he may not partake of the Aethyr, without the ceremonial preparations, even the beholding of this Aethyr from afar is like the par taking of all the former Aethyrs.

The Seer is lost in wonder, which is Peace.

And the ring of the horizon above her is a company of glorious Archangels with joined hands, that stand and sing: This is the daughter of BABALON the Beautiful, that she hath borne unto the Father of All. And unto all hath she borne her.

This is the Daughter of the King. This is the Virgin of Eternity. This is she that the Holy One hath wrested from the Giant Time, and the prize of them that have overcome Space. This is she that is set upon the Throne of Understanding. Holy, Holy, Holy is her name, not to be spoken among men. For Kore they have called her, and Malkah, and Betulah, and Persephone.

And the poets have feigned songs about her, and the prophets have spoken vain things, and the young men have dreamed vain dreams: but this is she, that immaculate, the name of whose name may not be spoken. Thought cannot pierce the glory that defendeth her, for thought is smitten dead before her presence. Memory is blank, and in the most ancient books of Magick are neither words to conjure her, nor adorations to praise her. Will bends like a reed in the tempests that sweep the borders of her kingdom, and imagination cannot figure so much as one petal of the lilies whereon she standeth in the lake of crystal, in the sea of glass.

This is she that hath bedecked her hair with seven stars, the seven breaths of God that move and thrill its excellence. And she hath tired her hair with seven combs, whereupon are written the seven secret names of God that are not known even of the Angels, or of the Archangels, or of the Leader of the armies of the Lord.

Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, and blessed be thy name for ever, unto whom the Aeons are but the pulsings of thy blood.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vision and the Voice'', 9th Aethyr, quoted in ''The Book of Thoth'' pp.&amp;nbsp;143–144&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Office of the Scarlet Woman===
"This is Babalon, the true mistress of The Beast; of Her, all his mistresses on lower planes are but avatars," said Crowley in ''[[The Vision and the Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Vision and the Voice]]'' 1998, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Crowley often wrote that Babalon and the Scarlet Woman are one, there are also many instances where the Scarlet Woman is seen more as a representative or physical manifestation of the universal feminine principle. In a footnote to ''Liber Reguli'', Crowley mentions that of the “Gods of the Aeon,” the Scarlet Woman and the Beast are “the earthly emissaries of those Gods.” {{Harv|Crowley|1997|loc=Liber V vel Reguli}}. He then writes in ''[[The Law is for All]]:''

{{quote|It is necessary to say here that The Beast appears to be a definite individual; to wit, the man Aleister Crowley. But the Scarlet Woman is an officer replaceable as need arises. Thus to this present date of writing, Anno XVI, Sun in Sagittarius, there have been several holders of the title.{{cite quote|date=July 2014}} }}

====Individual scarlet women====
Aleister Crowley believed that many of his lovers and magical companions were playing a cosmic role, even to the point of fulfilling prophecy. The following is a list of women that he considered to have been (or might have been) scarlet women (quotes are from ''The Law is for All''):

*[[Rose Kelly|Rose Edith Crowley]], Crowley's first wife. —''Put me in touch with Aiwas; see Equinox 1, 7, "The Temple of Solomon the King."  Failed as elsewhere is on record.''
*Mary d'Este Sturges —''Put me in touch with Abuldiz; hence helped with [[Magick (Book 4)|Book 4]]. Failed from personal jealousies.''
*[[Jeanne Robert Foster]] —''Bore the "child" to whom this Book refers later. Failed from respectability.''
*Roddie Minor —''Brought me in touch with Amalantrah. Failed from indifference to the Work.''
*Marie Rohling —''Helped to inspire Liber CXI. Failed from indecision.''
*Bertha Almira Prykrl —''Delayed assumption of duties, hence made way for No. 7.''
*[[Leah Hirsig]] —''Assisted me in actual initiation; still at my side, An XVII, Sol in Sagittarius.''

===Great Mother===
Within the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]], Babalon is mentioned in the Gnostic Creed:

{{quote|And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name BABALON.{{cite quote|date=July 2014}} }}

Here, Babalon is identified with [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] on the [[Tree of Life]], the sphere that represents the Great Sea and such mother-goddesses as [[Isis]], [[Bhavani]], and [[Ma'at]]. Moreover, she represents all physical mothers. Bishops T. Apiryon and Helena write:

{{quote|BABALON, as the Great Mother, represents MATTER, a word which is derived from the Latin word for Mother. She is the physical mother of each of us, the one who provided us with material flesh to clothe our naked spirits; She is the Archetypal Mother, the Great Yoni, the Womb of all that lives through the flowing of Blood; She is the Great Sea, the Divine Blood itself which cloaks the World and which courses through our veins; and She is Mother Earth, the Womb of All Life that we know.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = Red Flame| isbn = 0-9712376-1-1| last = Apiryon| first = T|author2=Helena| title = Mystery of Mystery: A Primer of Thelemic Ecclesiastical Gnosticism| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Origins==

===Whore of Babylon===
[[File:William Blake whore babylon.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Whore of Babylon]]''. Painted by [[Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic Saint]] [[William Blake]] in 1809.]]
The [[Whore of Babylon]] is referred to in several places in the [[Book of Revelation]], a book which may have had an influence on [[Thelema]], as Aleister Crowley says he read it as a child and imagined himself as the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast]]. She is described in Chapter 17:3-6:

{{quote|So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and [[precious stones]] and pearls, having a [[golden cup]] in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her [[fornication]]: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

Aleister Crowley recorded his view of the Book of Revelation in ''The Vision and the Voice''.

{{quote|All I get is that the Apocalypse was the recension of a dozen or so totally disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down to make them into a connected account; and that recension was re-written and edited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining that Christianity could show no true spiritual knowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but miracles, which only deceived the most ignorant, and Theology, which only suited pedants.

So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated the style of John. And this explains why the end of the world does not happen every few years, as advertised.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best of the Equinox, Enochian Magic|author1=Crowley, A.|author2=DuQuette, L.M.|date=2012|publisher=Red Wheel Weiser|isbn=9781609258030|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQeTpvQ3-zUC|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Enochian magic==
Another source is from the system of [[Enochian magic]] created by Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and Sir [[Edward Kelley]] in the 16th century. This system is based upon a unique language, [[Enochian]], two words of which are certainly relevant. The first is BABALOND, which is translated as ''harlot''. The other is BABALON, which means ''wicked''. Some flavour of context in which they appear in can be found in a communication received by Dee &amp; Kelley in 1587:

{{quote|I am the daughter of Fortitude, and ravished every hour from my youth. For behold I am Understanding and science dwelleth in me; and the heavens oppress me. They cover and desire me with infinite appetite; for none that are earthly have embraced me, for I am shadowed with the Circle of the Stars and covered with the morning clouds. My feet are swifter than the winds, and my hands are sweeter than the morning dew. My garments are from the beginning, and my dwelling place is in myself. The Lion knoweth not where I walk, neither do the beast of the fields understand me. I am deflowered, yet a virgin; I sanctify and am not sanctified. Happy is he that embraceth me: for in the night season I am sweet, and in the day full of pleasure. My company is a harmony of many symbols and my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot for such as ravish me, and a virgin with such as know me not. For lo, I am loved of many, and I am a lover to many; and as many as come unto me as they should do, have entertainment.

Purge your streets, O ye sons of men, and wash your houses clean; make yourselves holy, and put on righteousness. Cast out your old strumpets, and burn their clothes; abstain from the company of other women that are defiled, that are sluttish, and not so handsome and beautiful as I, and then will I come and dwell amongst you: and behold, I will bring forth children unto you, and they shall be the Sons of Comfort. I will open my garments, and stand naked before you, that your love may be more enflamed toward me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Printed by D. Maxwell for T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">The '''[[Bishop]] of Chekiang''', exercised episcopal leadership over the Diocese of Chekiang of the [[Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui|Anglican Church in China]]. The diocese, similar in extent to the present-day [[Zhejiang]], was originally established as part of the [[Church of England]].

The first bishop was appointed in 1908 following the resignation of [[George Moule]] as Bishop of Mid-China.

In 1918 [[Tsae-seng Sing]], [[archdeacon]] of Chekiang from 1910 to 1918, was consecrated as assistant Bishop of the diocese, becoming the first ethnic Chinese bishop in the [[Anglican communion]].&lt;ref&gt;'Chinese Bishop' in ''Foreign Missions Year Book of North America, 1919'' (Foreign Missions Conference of North America, 1919), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1958 the last Bishop of Chekiang, [[K. H. Ting]], lost his diocese when all Anglican and Protestant Christian denominations were compulsorily merged into the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]]. However, Ting remained President emeritus of the [[China Christian Council]] until his death in 2012.

According to [[Jeung san do|Jeung San Do]], the universe generates and cultivates life through a cyclic process of birth, growth, harvest, and rest (生長殮藏). This is closely related to the fluctuation and interplay of the two polar energies, [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]] and its cycle appeared in daily, yearly, and cosmically. 129,600 calendar years make up one '''Cosmic year''' and it was discovered by [[Shao Yung]].

== Daily cycle ==
The creative cycle can be seen in the passing of one day. At night, yin is at its strongest. The moon, darkness, stillness, and quietness all have yin nature. Night is a time of rest. When the sun, which has yang nature, rises, it is a time of birth. People tend to follow this flow of energy by sleeping at night and waking up in the morning. As the sun rises, yang becomes stronger and people tend to become more active. The afternoon is a time of growth. Eventually, yang reaches its highest peak, and from that point on, yin starts to regain its influence, and human activity starts to wind down. For many people, the evening is a time of relaxation and entertainment. This is the harvest in which they enjoy what they have worked for. Finally, yin becomes very dominant and things tend to return to the night time state of rest.

== Yearly cycle ==
This process can also be seen in the cycle of one year. Heat is a manifestation of yang, and when the temperature rises in spring, sprouts break through the surface of the ground, dead yellow grass is replaced with new green grass, and new leaves appear on the trees. Spring is a time of birth. As summer approaches, yang continues to rise as yin diminishes. Things grow more rapidly and vegetation becomes lush. Summer is a time of growth. By the time autumn comes, yin has started to regain its influence. Autumn is a time of harvest when things come to fruition, and during autumn, as yin becomes more and more dominant, things return to the winter state of rest. Year after year this cycle repeats.

== Cosmic cycle ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Cosmicyear.gif|frame|Cosmic year 129,600 and Gaebyeok]] --&gt;
According to [[Jeung san do|Jeung San Do's]] teachings, the universe follows the cycle of birth-growth-harvest-rest (生長殮藏) or spring-summer-autumn-winter. This cycle, called the Cosmic Year, repeats every 129,600 calendar years, a number calculated by Chinese scholar [[Shao Yung]]. At the beginning and end of each cycle, the universe is in a yin state of dormancy called the cosmic winter. On our planet, this manifests as an ice age. As the yang energy regains its influence, the cosmic winter changes to spring and new life and a new human species appear on the earth. We call the current stage of humanity homo sapiens sapiens. The time of cosmic spring and summer is one of growth and diversity during which many cultures and civilizations develop. It is also a time of conflict. Cosmic autumn is a time of returning to oneness, a time in which humanity harvests its diverse experiences and accomplishments to create a global civilization of harmony.

At any stage of the cosmic year, the position of the Earth's axis demonstrates the concurrent relationship between [[Yin yang|yin and yang]]. It is generally accepted that in the history of our planet there have been periodic changes in the Earth's poles, magnetism, and orbit.

== Sudden change ==
{{Main|Gaebyeok}}
What is left to debate is whether these changes occur gradually or suddenly. If we examine changes in nature during a calendric year, it becomes obvious that change occurs both suddenly and gradually. An example of this is the cherry blossom, which blooms in March. Gradually, over the course of a few months buds grow on the cherry tree, but suddenly, within a day or so, all of the flowers bloom at once. Finally, with just one strong wind or a heavy rain all of the blossoms fall.

== Cosmic cycles in other traditions ==
In [[anthroposophy]], based on teachings by [[Rudolf Steiner]], a cosmic year represents the [[Platonic year]], a period of 25,920 years. This is the time required for the Sun's position at spring [[equinox]] to traverse the complete [[zodiac]]. So each zodiacal sign covers about 2160 years. The year 747 BCE marked the transition from [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] to [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] and since 1453, the spring equinoctial sun is in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. This cosmic cycle has a considerable influence on humanity in both physical and spiritual respects. For instance, the Aries period covered the Greek/Roman culture period ranging from the foundation of [[Rome]] (753 BCE) to the fall of [[Byzantium]] (1453), whereas the Taurus period marked the Egyptian/Chaldaean era. Another example is human breathing rhythm: an average of 18 cycles per minute represents 18 x 60 x 24 = 25,920 cycles per day. The number of daily sleep-wake-cycles of the conscious mind in an average human lifetime of 72 years adds up to the same platonic figure. [[Shao Yung]]'s cosmic year represents exactly five platonic years (5x25,920=129,600).

Vedic scriptures delineate a cosmic cycle of creation and destruction marked by 4 [[Yugas]]. There is considerable debate on the duration of one Yuga, varying from 1200 to 432,000 or millions years. Swami [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] estimates the duration of two total cycles (an descending and an ascending part) to comprise 24000 years. According to Vamadeva [[David Frawley]] the Yuga cycle relates to the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], thus suggesting a relationship with the platonic year. In the interpretations of these and other vedic scholars, modern times (1700–1900) have witnessed the end of the dark ''Iron Age'' ([[Kali Yuga]]), a notion supported by Rudolf Steiner.

'''Durante degli Alighieri''' ({{IPA-it|duˈrante deʎʎ aliˈɡjɛːri|lang}}), commonly known by his short name '''Dante Alighieri''' or [[Mononymous person|simply]] as '''Dante''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdante|lang}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|eɪ}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|n|t|i|,_|-|t|eɪ}}; {{c.|1265}} – 1321)&lt;!--full dates in infobox--&gt;, was a major [[Italian poetry|Italian poet]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]]. His ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', originally called ''{{lang|it|Comedìa}}'' (modern Italian: ''Commedia'') and later christened ''{{lang|it|Divina}}'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the [[Italian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=The Western Canon|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Prue|title=Reading Dante: From Here to Eternity|date=2014|publisher=Liveright Publishign Corporation|location=New York|isbn=9780871407429|pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[Middle Ages]], most poetry was written in [[Latin]], accessible only to the most educated readers. In ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (''On Eloquence in the Vernacular''), however, Dante defended the use of the [[vernacular]] in literature. He would even write in the [[Tuscan dialect]] for works such as ''[[La Vita Nuova|The New Life]]'' (1295) and the ''Divine Comedy''; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as [[Petrarch]] and Boccaccio would follow. 

Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of [[Italy]], and his depictions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Heaven]] provided inspiration for the larger body of [[Western art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haller |first=Elizabeth K. |editor-first=Lister M. |editor-last=Matheson |title=Icons of the Middle Ages: Rulers, Writers, Rebels, and Saints |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rETxD8KcnUIC&amp;pg=PA244 |volume=1 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA |date=2012 |page=244 |chapter=Dante Alighieri |isbn=978-0-313-34080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human accomplishment : the pursuit of excellence in the arts and sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950|last=A.|first=Murray, Charles|date=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060192471|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=52047270}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is cited as an influence on [[John Milton]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the ''[[terza rima]]'', is attributed to him.  In Italy, he is often referred to as ''{{lang|it|il Sommo Poeta}}'' ("the Supreme Poet") and ''{{lang|it|il Poeta}}''; he, [[Petrarch]], and Boccaccio are also called "the three fountains" or "the three crowns".

==Life==

===Early life===
Dante was born in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], present-day Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the ''[[Divine Comedy]].'' Its first section, the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' begins, ''"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita"'' ("Midway upon the journey of our life"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10&lt;!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 --&gt;, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the ''Paradiso'' section of the ''Divine Comedy'' also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: "As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious" (XXII&amp;nbsp;151–154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 ([[Julian calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;His birth date is listed as "probably in the end of May" by Robert Hollander in "Dante" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]],'' volume&amp;nbsp;4. According to Boccaccio, the poet himself said he was born in May. See "Alighieri, Dante" in the ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: "the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful."&lt;Ref&gt;Holbrook, Richard. "Portraits of Dante from Giotto to Raffael: a critical study, with a concise iconography". 1911. London : P. L. Warner; Boston, New York, Houghton Mifflin company. Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dante alighieri, Palazzo dei Giudici.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Dante, from a fresco in the Palazzo dei Giudici, Florence]]
Dante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (''Inferno'', XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was [[Cacciaguida]] degli Elisei (''Paradiso'', XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alighiero&lt;ref name=Trecc/&gt; or [[Alighiero di Bellincione]], was a White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who suffered no reprisals after the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the middle of the 13th&amp;nbsp;century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Santagata |first=Marco |date=2012 |title=Dante: Il romanzo della sua vita |url= |location=Milan |publisher=Mondadori |page=21 |isbn=978-8804620266 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the [[Papacy]] and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The poet's mother was Bella, likely a member of the Abati family.&lt;ref name=Trecc/&gt; She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.&lt;ref name=Trecc&gt;{{cite book|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-alighieri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Alighieri, Dante|first=S.A|last=Chimenz|language=Italian|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a [[civil law notary|notary]]. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, [[Beatrice Portinari]] (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).&lt;ref name=Trecc/&gt;
[[File:Antonio Cotti - Dante a Verona.jpg|thumbnail|''Dante in Verona'', by Antonio Cotti]]
Dante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289).&lt;ref name="Davenport2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=John|title=Dante: Poet, Author, and Proud Florentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWWKW15MjqMC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0415-7|page=53|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This victory brought about a reformation of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298–1300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.

Gemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only [[Jacopo Alighieri|Jacopo]], Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.

===Education and poetry===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}

Not much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet [[Guido Guinizelli]]—whom in ''Purgatorio'' XXVI he characterized as his "father"—at a time when the [[Sicilian school]] (''Scuola poetica Siciliana''), a cultural group from [[Sicily]], was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan|Provençal]] poetry of the [[troubadours]], such as [[Arnaut Daniel]], and the Latin writers of [[classical antiquity]], including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and especially [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/dante-alighieri|title=Dante Alighieri|last=Alighieri|first=Dante|date=October 29, 2007|website=Dante Alighieri|access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante at the [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
Dante said he first met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of [[Folco Portinari]], at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her "[[Love at first sight|at first sight]]", apparently without even talking with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Delphi Complete Works of Dante Alighieri |edition= Illustrated |volume= 6 |author= Dante Alighieri |publisher= Delphi Classics |year= 2013 |isbn= 9781909496194}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called [[courtly love]], a phenomenon developed in French and Provençal poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the ''[[dolce stil novo]]'' (''sweet new style,'' a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (''Amore''). Love for Beatrice (as [[Petrarch]] would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Names and Naming in Young Adult Literature |volume= 27 |author= Alleen Pace Nilsen, Don L. F. Nilsen |publisher= Scarecrow Press |year= 2007 |isbn= 9780810866850 |page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Convivio]]'' chronicles his having read [[Boethius]]'s ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy|De consolatione philosophiae]]'' and Cicero's ''[[Laelius de Amicitia|De Amicitia]].'' He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in [[Santa Maria Novella]]. He took part in the disputes that the two principal [[mendicant order|mendicant]] orders ([[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. [[Bonaventure]], the latter expounding on the theories of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Paradiso of Dante Alighieri |author= Dante Alighieri |editor= Philip Henry Wicksteed, Herman Oelsner |edition= fifth |publisher= J.M. Dent and Company |year= 1904 |page= 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 18, Dante met [[Guido Cavalcanti]], [[Lapo Gianni]], [[Cino da Pistoia]] and soon after [[Brunetto Latini]]; together they became the leaders of the ''dolce stil novo.'' Brunetto later received special mention in the ''Divine Comedy'' (''Inferno'', XV, 28) for what he had taught Dante: ''Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Critical Companion to Dante |author= Jay Ruud |publisher= Infobase Publishing |year= 2008 |isbn= 9781438108414 |page= 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called ''[[The Rime|Rime]],'' rhymes), others being included in the later ''Vita Nuova'' and ''Convivio.'' Other studies are reported, or deduced from ''Vita Nuova'' or the ''Comedy,'' regarding painting and music.

===Florence and politics===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
{{further information|Guelphs and Ghibellines}}

Dante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph–Ghibelline conflict]]. He fought in the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289), with the Florentine Guelphs against [[Arezzo]] Ghibellines;&lt;ref name="Davenport2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DASM&gt;{{cite web |title=Guelphs and Ghibellines |url=http://www.dantemass.org/html/guelphs-and-ghibellines.html |publisher=Dante Alighieri Society of Massachusetts |accessdate=December 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212042335/http://www.dantemass.org/html/guelphs-and-ghibellines.html |archivedate=December 12, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1294 he was among the escorts of [[Charles Martel of Anjou]] (grandson of [[Charles&amp;nbsp;I of Anjou]]) while he was in Florence. To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.
[[File:Dante Luca.jpg|thumb|Dante Alighieri, detail from [[Luca Signorelli]]'s fresco, [[Chapel of San Brizio]], [[Orvieto Cathedral]]]]

After defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'')—Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi—and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, [[Charles of Valois]], brother of King [[Philip IV of France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.

===Exile and death===
Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [[Cante dei Gabrielli]] da [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[podestà]]'' of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the [[Gherardini family]], was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dino Compagni]], ''Cronica delle cose occorrenti ne' tempi suoi''&lt;/ref&gt; Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Harrison, "Dante on Trial", ''NY Review of Books'', February 19, 2015, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had "suggested" that Dante stay. Florence under the Black Guelphs therefore considered Dante an absconder.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Moore [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dante's-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html "Dante's infernal crimes forgiven"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', June 17, 2008. Retrieved June 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery. Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in ''Purgatorio'', XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to [[Oxford]]: these claims, first occurring in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's ''Immensa Dei dilectione testante'' to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence "beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany" in March 1311.

In 1310, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]] marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote ''[[De Monarchia]]'', proposing a [[universal monarchy]] under Henry VII.

At some point during his exile, he conceived of the ''Comedy'', but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the ''Vita Nuova''; in ''Convivio'' (written c. 1304–07) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.

An early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his ''Documenti d'Amore'' (''Lessons of Love''), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called "Comedy" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/francesco-daccorso-tf/ Bookrags.com] and Tigerstedt, E.N. 1967, ''Dante; Tiden Mannen Verket'' (''Dante; The Age, the Man, the Work''), Bonniers, Stockholm, 1967. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the ''Inferno'' or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier ''Officiolum'' [c. 1305–08], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spolia.it/online/en/argomenti/letterature_romanze/filologia/2003/barberino.htm|title=L′''Officiolum'' ritrovato di Francesco da Barberino|author=Fabio M. Bertolo|year= 2003|work=Spolia&amp;nbsp;– Journal of Medieval Studies|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) We know that the ''Inferno'' had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from [[Bologna]], but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. ''Paradiso'' seems to have been published posthumously.

In Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to ''Arrigo'' (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.

In 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where [[Cangrande I della Scala]] allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76).

During the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr. Nicholas Brunacci OP [1240–1322] who had been a student of [[Thomas Aquinas]] at the Santa Sabina ''studium'' in Rome, and later at Paris.&lt;ref name="aquinatis.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aquinatis.blogspot.com/2008/05/vida-de-santo-toms-de-aquino.html |title=Aquinatis: Vida de Santo Tomás de Aquino |website=Aquinatis.blogspot.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017|date=22 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunacci.it/s--tommaso.html |title=Le famiglie Brunacci |website=Brunacci.it |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Albert the Great]] at the Cologne ''studium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVP3vBmDktQC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=brunacci#v=onepage&amp;q=brunacci&amp;f=false |title=History of Italian Philosophy: VIBS |author=Eugenio Garin |page=85 |website=Books.google.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017|isbn=9789042023215 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunacci became lector at the Santa Sabina ''studium'', forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], and later served in the [[Roman curia|papal curia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frater Nicolaus Brunatii [† 1322] sacerdos et predicator gratiosus, fuit lector castellanus, arectinus, perusinus, urbevetanus et romanus apud Sanctam Sabinam tempore quo papa erat in Urbe, viterbiensis et florentinus in studio generali legens ibidem annis tribus (Cr Pg 37v).

In 1315, Florence was forced by [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante. But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in ''Paradiso'', XVII (55–60), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:
[[File:DanteFresco.jpg|thumb|left|Mural of Dante in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], by [[Andrea del Castagno]], c. 1450]]

shoots first. You are to know the bitter taste
of others' bread, how salty it is, and know
how hard a path it is for one who goes

As for the hope of returning to Florence, he describes it as if he had already accepted its impossibility (in ''Paradiso'', XXV, 1–9):
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|it|Se mai continga che 'l poema sacro
al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra,
sì che m'ha fatto per molti anni macro,

to which both heaven and earth have set their hand
so as to have made me lean for many years

with another voice now and other fleece
I shall return a poet and at the font
of my baptism take the [[laurel wreath|laurel crown]] ...}}

Alighieri accepted Prince [[Guido II da Polenta|Guido Novello da Polenta]]'s invitation to [[Ravenna]] in 1318. He finished ''Paradiso'' and died in 1321 (aged 56) while returning to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission to Venice, possibly of [[malaria]] contracted there. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called [[Basilica of San Francesco (Ravenna)|Basilica di San Francesco]]). Bernardo Bembo, [[praetor]] of [[Venice]], erected a tomb for him in 1483.

{{Seealso|Tomb of Dante}}
The first formal biography of Dante was the ''Vita di Dante'' (also known as ''Trattatello in laude di Dante''), written after 1348 by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04628a.htm|title=Dante Alighieri|publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although several statements and episodes of it have been deemed unreliable on the basis of modern research, an earlier account of Dante's life and works had been included in the ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' of the Florentine chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vauchez|first=André|last2=Dobson|first2=Richard Barrie|last3=Lapidge|first3=Michael|title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|year=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=Chicago|page=1517}}; {{cite book|last=Caesar|first=Michael|title=Dante, the Critical Heritage, 1314(?)–1870|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florence eventually came to regret Dante's exile, and the city made repeated requests for the return of his remains. The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]]. That [[cenotaph|tomb has been empty]] ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta''—which roughly translates as "Honor the most exalted poet". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the ''Inferno,'' depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, ''L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita'' ("his spirit, which had left us, returns"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.

Italy's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named ''[[Italian battleship Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]]'' in honor of him.

On April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, [[Pope Benedict XV]] promulgated an encyclical named ''[[In praeclara summorum]]'', calling him one "of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast" and the "pride and glory of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_30041921_in-praeclara-summorum_en.html "''In praeclara summorum'': Encyclical of Pope Benedict XV on Dante"]. The Holy See. Retrieved November 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a reconstruction of Dante's face was undertaken in a collaborative project. Artists from Pisa University and engineers at the University of Bologna at [[Forlì]] constructed the model, portraying Dante's features as somewhat different from what was once thought.&lt;ref name="nosejob"&gt;{{cite news|first=Philip|last=Pullella|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL1171092320070112|title=Dante gets posthumous nose job – 700 years on|work=Statesman|agency=Reuters|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benazzi | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = The Face of the Poet Dante Alighieri, Reconstructed by Virtual Modeling and Forensic Anthropology Techniques | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 278–283 | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2008.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alighieri - Divina Commedia, Nel mille quatro cento septe et due nel quarto mese adi cinque et sei - 2384293 id00022000 Scan00006.jpg|thumb|''Divina Commedia'' (1472)]]
The ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' describes Dante's journey through [[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Hell]] (''Inferno''), [[Divine Comedy#Purgatorio|Purgatory]] (''Purgatorio''), and [[9 spheres of heaven|Paradise]] (''Paradiso''); he is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and then by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], the subject of his love (and of another of his works, ''[[La Vita Nuova]]''). While the vision of Hell, the ''Inferno,'' is vivid for most modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate. ''Purgatorio'' is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referencing more contemporary poets and artists than ''Inferno''; ''Paradiso'' is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the ''Divine Comedy'''s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: "all'alta fantasia qui mancò possa"—"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe," ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142).

[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|left|Dante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the [[incipit]] ''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'' in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence, 1465.]]
With its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range—both stylistic and thematic—of its content, the ''Comedy'' soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the ''Comedy'' slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.

He wrote the ''Comedy'' in a language he called "Italian", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Britannica|151164|Dante}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the [[Italian language]] was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed ''la langue de Dante''. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in [[Roman Catholic]] Western Europe (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of [[liturgy]], history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, [[John Milton|Milton]] or [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], was a prime example of the "original genius" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.

[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|right|''Dante Alighieri'', attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], in the chapel of the [[Bargello]] palace in Florence. This oldest picture of Dante was painted just prior to his exile and has since been heavily restored.]]
New readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a "comedy". [[Comedy#Etymology|In the classical sense]] the word ''comedy'' refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala]], the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.

[[File:Monument to Dante (Verona).jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Dante Alighieri in [[Verona]]]]
Dante's other works include ''[[Convivio]]'' ("The Banquet"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=2&amp;idlang=UK|title=Banquet|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; ''[[De Monarchia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=4&amp;idlang=UK|title=Monarchia|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K.

The ''Vita Nuova'' contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular—both in the ''Vita Nuova'' and in the ''Convivio''—instead of the Latin that was almost universally used.

One of Eaton's first sermons, a May 1970 critique of Nixon legislation that would allow police to invade homes without knocking, stoked widespread controversy. The sermon, entitled "Take the Blindfold Off the Lady: The D.C. Crime Bill," included the line: "If this legislation is passed, I suggest to you and instruct myself . . . [that] any time persons break into your house unannounced, shoot them!" He went on: "In order to understand true morality, one must understand that oppression must be stopped at all cost."&lt;ref name="UUDB" /&gt;

In 1968, Eaton joined the faculty of [[Federal City College]] as associate dean of community education and assistant professor of philosophy. In later years he served as dean of student services.&lt;ref name="wapo_obit" /&gt;

{{Hindu scriptures}}
The '''''Devīsūktam''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दॆवीसूक्तम्), also popularly called as the '''''Caṇḍīpāṭha''''' (चण्डीपाठ) or the '''''Taṃtroktadevīsūktam''''' (तंत्रॊक्तदेवीसूक्तम्), is a hymnal text that occurs in the 5th chapter of the [[Devi_Mahatmya|''Devīmāhātmyam'']] (दॆवीमाहात्म्यम्), also known as ''Durgāsaptaśatī'' (दुर्गासप्तशती). &lt;ref&gt;Text of Durgasaptashati at Sanskrit Documents: https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/durga700.html?lang=sa&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Devīmāhātmyam'', in turn, forms a part of the ''Sāvarṇikamanvantara'' Section (सावर्णिकमन्वन्तर, Chapters 77 - 90) of the [[Markandeya_Purana|''Mārkaṃḍeyapurāṇa'']] (मार्कंडेयपुराण).&lt;ref&gt;Patanakar, Chandrashekar Bhat (1954). ''Mārkaṃḍeyapurāṇa'': Shri Panchacharya Electrical Press, Mysore, Karnataka, India.  (Published by H.H. Sri Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar Bahadur, King of Mysore, under the Sri Jayachamarajendra Granthamala Series (Vol. No. 57) for free public perusal).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Text of Markandeyapurana at Sanskrit Documents: https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_purana/TOC_Purana/TOC_Markandeya_Purana_-_Khemraj_1910.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Devīsūktam'' eulogises the manifold manifestations of the fierce goddess (''[[Devī]]), [[Caṇḍī]]'' or ''[[Durga|Durgā]]'' (दुर्गा),  in her objective and subjective aspects. This hymn is very popular and is chanted every day in the Devī temples across India, during the morning and evening ritual worship. It is specially recited during the ''[[Navaratri|Śarannavarātri]]'' festival which occurs in the Gregorian months of October - November; &lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica on Navaratri: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Navratri&lt;/ref&gt; it is also recited during the ''Vasantanavarātri''.

This particular ''Devīsūktam'' belongs to the [[Puranic]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] traditions. It is different from, and should not be confused with, the ''[[Devīsūkta]]'' which occurs in the 10th mandala of the ''[[Ṛgveda]]''.

== Text with meaning ==

=== Preamble ===
The Devīsūktam, as stated earlier, belongs to the 5th Chapter of the Devīmāhātmyam. In the preceding (4th) chapter, the Devī, having slain the demon ''[[Mahishasura|Mahiṣāsura]]'' (महिषासुर), assures the gods that she would help them if they come to distress in the future too. 

After some time, two [[Asura|''asura'']] (demon) brothers, [[Sumbha_and_Nisumbha|Śuṃbha and Niśuṃbha]] terrorise the three worlds, usurp the offices and powers  [[Sūrya]], [[Chandra|Caṃdra]], [[Kubera]], [[Yama]], [[Varuṇa]], [[Agni]], [[Vāyu]] and other gods, and establish themselves in their steads. These gods, having been defeated and having lost their power, authority and honour, recall the assurance given by the Devī of alleviating them from their troubles. They decide to pray for her help, and arrive at the [[Himalayas]]. Having assembled there, they begin praising Her, who is also known as Aparājitā (अपराजिता) and Viṣṇumāyā (विष्णुमाया)&lt;ref&gt;Text of Devisuktam at Sanskrit Documents: https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/tantroktadeviisuukta.html?lang=sa&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''''Flugblat''''' ({{lang-yi|פלוג בלאט}}, 'Leaflet') was a [[Yiddish]]-language daily newspaper published in [[Vilnius]] between October 13, 1915 and January, 1916, during the German occupation of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Marten-Finnis, Susanne.

Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales, 1987. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flugblat'' was the first Yiddish newspaper to appear in Vilnius following the July 1915 Russian ban on non-[[Cyrillic]] press.&lt;ref name="fb"&gt;Koss, Andrew Noble ''[https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:wp368wc8732/Diss%20(2)-augmented.pdf World War I and the Remaking of Jewish Vilna, 1914-1918]''. Thesis (Ph.D.)--Stanford University, 2010. pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The issues of ''Flugblat'' consisted of one or two pages containing translations of official telegram wires from the German military for the Eastern Front and decrees from the German authorities to the local population.&lt;ref name="fb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ba"&gt;Bar, Aryeh.

The newspaper was shut down when Feivel Margolin, a known journalist, obtained an exclusive permit to print a new daily Yiddish newspaper for the entire [[Ober Ost]] district, ''[[Letze nayes]]''.&lt;ref name="ba"/&gt; Altogether, 100 issues of ''Flugblat'' were printed.&lt;ref name="yod"/&gt;

'''Hadith of Jesus Praying Behind Mahdi''' ({{lang-fa|حدیث نماز خواندن عیسی به امامت مهدی}}) refers to a collection of [[hadith]] related about the prophecy that [[Jesus]] will follow [[Mahdi]]'s lead in ''[[salat]]'' (prayer) after he descends. Mahdi is the twelfth Imam of the [[Shia muslims]] and salat is the Islamic practice of worship of [[God]] which muslims perform five times a day. The prophecy is narrated in numerous hadith collections. A total of 29 Hadiths relate the return of Jesus, and his prayer with Mahdi's lead.&lt;ref name= "Yahya"&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Adnan Oktar|Harun Yahya]] |duplicate_date=  |title= The Prophet Jesus (as) and Hazrat Mahdi (as) Will Come This Century |url= http://fs.fmanager.net/files/flashpages/index.php?bookid=27681| publisher= GLOBAL PUBLISHING| date= July 2010|edition=First| location= Turkey|accessdate= 9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hadith==
{{Jesus|expanded=in Islam}}
{{QuoteHadith|Abu Hurairah|matn=This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah that I heard the Prophet said:: 'What will be your condition when the son of Mary will come down to you and your Imam will be from amongst you'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = [[Sahih Bukhari]] | at= Kitab Ahadithil Anbiya, Babu Nuzule Isa}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi|Allamah Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi]] quotes the above tradition in his book "Muhammad (S) is the Last Prophet" and concludes:{{quote|This refers to the fact that prophet Jesus (a.s.) will not lead in the prayer, but the Imam of the Muslims who will leading them will lead in the prayers, and prophet Jesus will follow him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi|Allamah Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi]] |date=  |title= Muhammad (S) is the Last Prophet |url= http://www.al-islam.org/muhammad-the-last-prophet-sayyid-akhtar-rizvi/jesus-son-mary|location= Islamic Republic of Iran| publisher= Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania|accessdate= 9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{QuoteHadith|Jabir ibn Abd Allah|matn=This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari that I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: "A group of my Ummah will fight for the truth until near the day of judgment when Jesus, the son of Marry, will descend, and the leader of them will ask him to lead the prayer, but Jesus declines, saying: "No, Verily, among you Allah has made leaders for others and He has bestowed his bounty upon them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = [[Sahih Muslim]] |language = Arabic| page =193, part2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] |language = Arabic| volume = vol. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin al-Suyuti]]|title = Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman |language = Arabic| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abu Ya’ala provides another version of this hadith in his [[Hadith terminology|musnad]] with more clear terms. {{QuoteHadith|Jabir ibn Abd Allah|matn=This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah said: "A group among my Ummah will continue to fight for the truth until Jesus, the son of Marry, will descend, and the Imam of them will ask him to lead the prayer, but Jesus replies: "You have more right to it, and verily Allah has honored some of you over others in this Ummah." &lt;ref&gt;Musnad by Abu Ya'la&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{QuoteHadith|Al-Husayn Al-Ajiri |matn= The traditions of al-Mustafa (S) on the rising of al-Mahdi has been transmitted via numerous authorities and is more than the level of (being sufficient for) Mutawatir, describing that he is of his Ahlul-Bayt, and will fill the earth with justice, and that Jesus (as) will come at the same time and he will assist Jesus for killing al-Dajjal in the land of Palestine, and that he will lead this nation and Jesus will pray behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]]| title= [[Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah]]| page=254, Ch. 11, section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{QuoteHadith|Sa'id ibn Jubayr|matn= It is narrated from Ibne Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (a.s) said, “My Caliphs and successors are twelve persons, first of whom is my brother and the last my great grandson.” He was asked, “O Allah’s Messenger! Who is your brothera” He replied, “Ali bin Abi Talib.” He was asked, “Who is your great grandsona” He replied, “Mahdi, who shall fill the earth with justice and equity like it would be fraught with injustice and oppression. By the One in Whose hands is my life! Even if a day remains for the earth, the Almighty Allah will prolong this day till my son, Mahdi reappears and Isa bin Maryam descends to the earth and recites prayer behind His Eminence. The earth shall be illuminated from the east to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Fara'id al-Simtayn]] | page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interpretation==
There is a belief among Shia Muslims that Jesus and the Mahdi will be both present at the same time, that the leaders who will carry out their commands will be  from the [[Quraysh tribe]], and that afterward Jesus will be the [[Vizier]] of the Mahdi. It's also believed that he will perform the prayer behind Mahdi and follow him.&lt;ref name= "Yahya" /&gt; [[Al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin al-Suyuti]] writes in his [[Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman | last= [[Al-Suyuti|Jalaluddin al-Suyuti]] | page= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; that:
{{quote|I have heard some of the deniers of (truth) deny what has been conveyed about Jesus that when he descends will pray the Fajr prayer behind al-Mahdi. They say, Jesus has higher status than to pray behind a non-Prophet.
This is a bizarre opinion since the issue of prayer of Jesus behind al-Mahdi has been proven strongly via numerous authentic traditions from the Messenger of Allah, who is the most truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project Team |date=  |title= A Shi'ite Encyclopedia |url= http://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team|location= Islamic Republic of Iran|accessdate= 9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Religious significance ==
{{religious text primary|section|date=December 2017}}
Shia sources quote several hadiths from the Shia Imams and Prophet Muhammad that highlight the importance of pilgrimage to the shrine. A hadith from the Islamic Prophet reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;One of my own flesh and blood will be buried in the land of Khorasan. God the Highest will surely remove the sorrows of any sorrowful person who goes on pilgrimage to his shrine. God will surely forgive the sins of any sinful person who goes on pilgrimage to his shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.al-islam.org/uyun-akhbar-ar-ridha-volume-2-shaykh-saduq/chapter-66-reward-visiting-shrine-imam-ali-ibn-musa-ar|title=Uyun Akhbar al-Ridha|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
Dar-ul-Imarah (Royal Residence) or the garden of [[Humayd ibn Qahtaba|Humayd ibn Qahtaba al-Ta'i]] was a fortress in the village of [[Sanabad]]. It dates back to the era before the [[Islam]] religion. It had been placed at the fork road of Sanabad, [[Neishabour]], [[Sarakhs]], [[Tus, Iran|Toos]] and [[Radkan, Razavi Khorasan|Radkan]]. In fact, this fortress has been a place for the frontier guards to take position and establish the security of these roads and regions. After the demise of [[Harun al-Rashid]], he was buried in this place. Due to this historical event, the Dar-ul-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of [[Harun al-Rashid|Haruniyyeh]]. The original inner building of Dar-ul-Imarah has been in fact a temple used by the [[Zoroastrians]] to worship. This building was demolished by the order of [[al-Ma'mun]], and then it was reconstructed according to the special architecture of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Four plain and short walls, covered with a low-slope dome, were constructed around the building. Afterwards, the name of the mausoleum (Haruniyyeh) was changed and known as the Mashhad-ur-Reza, due to the Holy Imam. Mashhad literally means a place where a martyr has been buried.&lt;ref name="mashreghnews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Look at the history of Imam Reza's burial ground (Persian)|url=https://www.mashreghnews.ir/news/93954/%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B4%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84-%D8%AF%D9%81%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B9|agency=mashreghnews|date=24 January  2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martyrdom of Ali al-Ridha===
[[File:Imam Reza shrine before development.jpg|thumb|Imam Reza shrine before development]]
In 818, [[Imam]] [[Ali al-Ridha]] was murdered by the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (ruled 813–833) and was buried beside the grave of al-Ma'mun's father, [[Harun al-Rashid]] (r. 786–809).&lt;ref name="Dungersi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dungersi|first1=Mohamed Raza|title=A Brief Biography of Imam Ali bin Musa (a.s.): al-Ridha|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1502834249|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VU9kAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=death%20Imam%20Ali%20al-Ridha}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this event, the location was called as Mashhad al-Ridha ("the place of martyrdom of al-Ridha"). [[Shias]] and [[Sunnis]] began visiting his grave on [[Ziarat|pilgrimage]]. By the end of the 9th century a dome was built on the grave and many buildings and [[bazaars]] sprang up around it. For the next thousand years, it has been devastated and reconstructed several times.&lt;ref&gt;Zabeth (1999) pp. 12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrated Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] visited Mashhad in 1333 and reported that it was a large town with abundant fruit trees, streams and mills. A great dome of elegant construction surmounts the noble mausoleum, the walls being decorated with colored tiles. Opposite the tomb of the Imam is the tomb of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, which is surmounted by a platform bearing chandeliers.&lt;ref name="Imam Reza"/&gt; However, the tomb of Harun al-Rashid is not considered sacred, as he was responsible for the murders of the 6th and 7th Shia Imams.

===Ghaznevid era===
By the end of the third [[Hijri]] century, a dome was built on the grave of Imam Reza and many buildings and bazaars sprang around the holy shrine. In 383 A.H. / 993 A.D., [[Sebuktigin]], the [[Ghaznevid]] sultan devastated Mashhad and stopped the pilgrims from visiting the holy shrine of Imam Reza. But in 400 A.H./ 1009 A.D., [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (born 971, ruled, 998-1030 A.D.,) started the expansion and renovation of the holy shrine and built many fortifications around the city.&lt;ref name="Petrushevski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petrushevski|first1=Ilia Pavlovich|title=Islam in Iran|date=1970|publisher=ketab.com|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4WCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT273#v=onepage&amp;q=%D8%BA%D8%B2%D9%86%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%20%D9%88%20%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7%20%D8%B9%20%D8%B3%D8%A8%DA%A9%D8%AA%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saljug era===
[[File:ImamReza06.jpg|thumb|A picture from second sanctuary]]
[[Sultan Sanjar]] (b. 1086 A.D., r. 1097-1157 A.D.), after the miraculous healing of his son in the holy shrine of Imam Reza, renovated the sanctuary and added new buildings within its precincts. At the time of Sultan Sanjar Saljuqi, after Sharaf al-Din Abu Tahir b. Sa'd b. Ali Qummi repaired the shrine, he began to construct a dome over it.&lt;ref name="ISNA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=How the shrine of  Imam Reza was built?|url=http://www.isna.ir/news/92101406673/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B9-%DA%86%DA%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF|accessdate=4 January 2014|agency=Iranian student's news agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 612 A.H./ 1215 A.D., as borne out by inscriptions on certain tiles, Allaudin Khwarezm Shah carried out renovations on the shrine.&lt;ref name="ISNA"/&gt;

===Mongol invasion===
During [[Khwarazm-Shah]]s period, Razavi Shrine was paid much attention and some repairment and decoration were made in it.&lt;ref name="ISNA"/&gt; In this era(612/1215), two very glorious embossed [[Thuluth]] (a large Naskh handwriting) inscriptions in form of square tile work were fixed on both sides of the shrine entrance-by the side of Dar al-Huffaz porch—in which the names and descent of Imam Reza back to [[Imam Ali]] were written. Some other inscriptions and three mihrabs (a special place for prayer-leader in mosques) belonging to this age exist in this holy complex.
During the [[Mongol]] invasion in 1220 AD (617 A.H.), [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] was plundered by the invading hordes and the survivors of this massacre took refuge in Mashhad and settled around the holy shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q=Mongol%20invasion%20Imam%20Reza%20shrine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan Muhammad Khudabandeh Iljaitu (b. 1282 AD), the Mongol ruler of Iran, converted to Shi'ism and ruled Iran in 703–716 A.H (1304–1316 AD), once again renovated the holy shrine on a grand scale.&lt;ref name="Petrushevski"/&gt;

===Timurid era===
The glorious phase of Mashhad started during the reign of [[Shahrukh Mirza]] (b. 1377 A.D., r, 1405-1447) son of [[Tamerlane]] and reached its zenith during the reign of [[Safavid]] kings who ruled Iran from 1501-1786 A.D. Shahrukh Mirza, whose capital was [[Herat]], regularly visited Mashhad for the pilgrimage of the holy shrine of Imam Reza (A.S.). In the 15th century, during the reign of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] [[Shahrukh Mirza]], Masshad became one of the main cities of the realm. In 1418, his wife Empress [[Goharshad]] funded the construction of an outstanding [[mosque]] beside the shrine, which is known as the [[Goharshad Mosque]].&lt;ref name="Zabeth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zabeth|first1=Hyder Reza|title=Landmarks of Mashhad|publisher=Fundation of Astan Quds Razavi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbZJS_lcAkQC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=Zabeth%20hyder%20Reza%201999%20Mashhad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safavid era===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Main Gate of Imam Riza, Mashhad, Iran-1850s.jpg|thumb|right|Main Gate of Imam Riza, Mashhad, Iran-1850s. Photo possibly by Luigi Pesce (Italian, 1818–1891)]]
With the emergence of the Safavid dynasty in 1501 A.D. and their declaration of the Shi'ite school as the state religion, Mashhad reached the peak of its development and soon became one of the greatest sites of pilgrimage. However, since Khorasan was a border province of the Safavid Empire, Mashhad consequently suffered repeated invasions and periods of occupation by the Uzbek Khans - Muhammad Khan, Abdullah Khan Shaibani, Muhammad Sultan and especially Abdul - Momen Khan. These invasions continued up to 996 A.H./ 1586 A.D., the time of [[Shah Abbas I]], who finally drove out the [[Uzbeks]] from Khourasan.

Sahn Atiq was extended in the time of Shah Abbas I, and still, during the Safavids era, great efforts were made for its improvement. Shah [[Tahmasp I]] began to repair and gild the minaret near the dome and in 932/1525, precious tiles covering the dome were changed into gold-coated bricks. After they were plundered during Abd al-Mu'min Khan Uzbeg invasion, the gold-coated bricks were rebuilt by Shah 'Abbas in 1010/1601, the details of which was written on an enamelled inscription by Ali Reza Abbasi. Shah Abbas also began to establish northern porch, rooms, chambers, facades, as well eastern and western porches. It is said that Mullah Muhsin Fayd Kashani ordered to establish Tawhid Khanah portico in the north side of the Shrine. Allahverdikhan portico, porch in the north side of Dar al-Ziyafah (reception chamber) and Hatam Khani portico, all were built in the time of great princes of Safavids, Allahverdikhan and Hatam Beq Ordoobadi.

[[Shah Abbas II]] commanded to repair and tile Sahn Atiq and Shah Sulaiman also ordered the repair of the Holy Shrine Dome which had been split because of the earthquake; this can be read in an erected inscription. He also commanded to establish several Madrasahs (Islamic Seminaries). The northern porch of [[Goharshad Mosque]], the Holy Shrine entrance, along with [[Musallah]] (place of prayer) located in Payeen Khiyaban (lower street) were repaired and tiled by a skillful [[Isfahan]]i mason called Ustad Shuja'.

===Afsharid and Qajar era===
[[File:ImamReza10.jpg|thumb|Complex's main garden in 1910]] 
[[File:Teh st - Mashhad - 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Shrine's view from Tehran street, 1956]] 
[[Nadir Shah Afshar]] (b. 1688, r. 1736-1747 A.D.) and the [[Qajar]] kings who ruled Iran from 1779-1923 illuminated, beautified and expanded the various courtyards (Sahn), porches (Riwaq) and places in the holy shrine. The golden porch of Sahn Atiq and the minaret on its top were repaired and gilded, the minaret of north porch was erected and illuminated; and Sangab (a vessel or container made of single block of marble) in Ismail Tala'ee Saqqa Khanah (a public place for drinking water) was built in Sahn Atiq. All these happened during [[Nadir Shah Afshar]]'s monarchy.

There have also been some improvements in Holy Shrine complex during Qajar period, including new courtyard establishment and gilding its porch, both of them started in the time of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]] and ended in [[Nasir al-Din Shah]]'s era. The porch and northern façade of Sahn Atiq, as written in the inscription of its top, were also repaired during [[Muhammad Shah]]'s rule. Tawhid Khanah was repaired in 1276/1859 in the time of Adud al-Mulk's custodianship. He had the fine paintings and tiles of the Shrine decorated with mirrors in 1275/1858. Nasir al-Din Shah, too, had the gold-coated bricks put up on the walls, from dado up to the top of western proch of the new courtyard and its stalactite-shaped ceiling. So it was called "Nasiri Porch". There was also some repairment in both courtyards, the old and the new one during [[Muzaffar al-Din Shah]]'s monarchy.

Following the coup in December 1911, Russian artillery shelled revolutionaries that had taken refuge in the holy shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Axworthy, ''A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind'', (Basic Books, 2010), 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole complex was greatly damaged in 1911, but it was repaired again after a while by Hussein Mirza Nayyir al-Dawla, Khorasan's governor.

===Modern era===

[[File:Imam Reza shrine.jpg|thumb|Imam Reza shrine at night, 2012]]
[[File:ضریح حرم امام رضا.jpg|thumb|A view of the existing sanctuary]]
There happened some essential changes round the complex in 1347/1928, when Falakah (round open space with the radius of 180 meters from the top of the Dome was established. Then they began to build the Museum, the library and the Hall for ceremonies. Old Falakah was extended up to a radius of 620 meters before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, and an important part of Holy Buildings' historical structure was demolished without considering its antiquity and elegance.

On 11th Rabi al-Thani 1354 A.H. /13 July 1935, the armed forces of [[Reza Shah]] (b. 1878, r. 1925-1941 A.D.), the founder of [[Pahlavi dynasty]] in Iran, invaded the holy shrine and massacred people gathered in the [[Goharshad Mosque]]. The people there were protesting against the anti-Islamic rule of [[Reza Shah]] for banning Hijab (headscarf) for women in Iran. During the days of [[Islamic revolution]], on 21 November 1978 [[Mohammad Reza Shah]]'s (b. 1919, r. 1941-1978 A.D.) troops of the Shah killed a large number of people within the holy shrine of Imam Reza.

The shrine is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Iranian 100 [[Iranian rial|rials]] coin, issued since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.ir/default_en.aspx Central Bank of Iran].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4444">'''Gen. Inocencio Junquera''' ([[Gran Canaria]] 1831 – [[Santillana del Mar]], 1911) was a civil and political governor of [[Cebu province|Cebu]], [[Philippines]], from 1893 – 1895. He left a legacy to [[Cebuano culture]] by establishing the '''Teatro Junquera''', the most important theater of Cebu in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Junquera's governorship was marked by protests from the Spanish friars, who saw Junquera as a liberal because he supported [[church-state separation|separation of Church and State]].

==The Teatro Junquera==

===Construction===
In 1894 the residents of the district of Parian (in what is now [[Cebu City]]) staged a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] play titled ''El Alcalde Interino''. The play was performed in the convent of the old church of Parian (destroyed in 1878 because of misunderstandings between the residents and the Spanish friar assigned to the parish). The special guest was Junquera.

Junquera, who was also interested in the theater, commented that the convent is too small for a theater. He suggested to prominent residents Florentino Rallos and Francisco Sales that Cebu must have its own "real" theater and a Colegio de Artes y Oficios. After a few months, Junquera called for a meeting and discussed his plans to create a college with an attached theater in the same place were the old church of Parian was.

But Junquera was not popular with the friars, because of his support for church-state separation. His plans were blocked. When Martin Garcia Alcocer, the [[Archdiocese of Cebu|bishop of Cebu]], knew the Junquera's plans, he immediately ordered the construction of a religious monument in the lot where the theater was to be constructed. He announced that the monument could not be removed because it has been blessed and therefore holy. The friars also spread rumors that Junquera would tax the residents to support his construction project. In the face of opposition, Junquera did not push through his plan for a theater in Parian.

Junquera found a suitable place in barangay Kanipaan (now the commerce center of the city), the lot of Rafael Veloso. He used his own money to finance the project. Other prominent individuals helped. Marcelo Regner and Rafael de Ocampo designed the [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] style; Francisco Sales recruited carpenters and painters for the project.

The theater was finished in 1895, a year before Junquera left Cebu. It was, not surprisingly, called Teatro Junquera. On December 16 of the same year, before Junquera left Cebu, a Spanish play was performed by the Cebuanos to honor him. However, the formal inauguration of the theater was on April 19, 1896.

===Transfers of ownership===
The theater was later bought by Pedro Royo, a Spanish businessman and a filmmaker. Then it was bought by Leopold Falek and Pedro Rivera-Mir, and finally, by Don Jose Leon Avila (1884&amp;ndash;1959), whose family still own the lot where the original theater was located. It was during Avila's ownership when the name was changed to '''Teatro/Cine Oriente'''. As years pass by, the Cebuanos stopped calling it Teatro/Cine Oriente but just '''Cine Oriente'''.

{{No footnotes|date=December 2013}}
A '''jengu''' (plural '''miengu''') is a water [[spirit]] in the traditional beliefs of the [[Sawa (ethnic group)|Sawa]] ethnic groups of [[Cameroon]], particularly the [[Duala people|Duala]], [[Bakweri]], and related Sawa peoples. Among the Bakweri, the name is '''liengu''' (plural: '''maengu'''). Miengu are similar to [[Mami Wata]] spirits. 

The miengus appearance differs from people to people, but they are typically said to be beautiful, [[mermaid]]-like figures with long hair and beautiful gap-teeth. They live in rivers and the sea and bring good fortune to those who worship them. They can also cure disease and act as intermediaries between worshippers and the [[Spirit|world of spirits]]. For this reason, a jengu [[cult]] has long enjoyed popularity among the Duala peoples. Among the Bakweri, this cult is also an important part of a young girl's [[rite of passage]] into womanhood.

==Jengu as a single spirit==

Jengu may refer to a single spirit, as well. In some traditions, this spirit replaces the class of miengu spirits, while in others, it acts as their leader. Among the Isubu, for example, this spirit is called Jengu.

Bakweri belief talks of a female spirit named Mojili or Mojele. Mojili became the progenitor of the miengu when she lost a bet with Moto, the ancestor of mankind, over who could build the longer-lasting fire. Moto won the right to stay in the village, but Mojili was forced to flee to the sea. The Bakweri still worship Mojili as the ruler of the miengu. In fact, her name is so powerful, that many believe that children under seven may die if they hear it uttered. By extension of this tale, the miengu are said to be the wives of the rats, as the ancestor of the rats also lost the bet and fled to the forest.

Another Bakweri tradition names this spirit Liengu la Mwanja and makes her the consort of [[Efasa-Moto]], spirit of [[Mount Cameroon|Mount Fako]] (Mount Cameroon). Long ago, the two formed an understanding that Efasa-Moto would live on the mountain, while Liengu la Mwanja would inhabit the sea. When lava from Mount Fako's 1992 eruption made it all the way to the ocean, many hailed it as a sign that the spirit was visiting his wife.

==Jengu cult==

The Duala and related groups hold the jengu cult in high importance. The cult may have originated with peoples further west, possibly the [[Ijaw people|Ijo]], and then passed from people to people, reaching the [[Grand Batanga|Batanga]] at its most eastward extent. In the earliest days, jengu-worship centred on the water spirits as the source of four boons: [[crayfish]], the end of the rainy season in one of the world's wettest regions, victory in the [[pirogue racing|pirogue races]], and protection from [[epidemic]]s of disease. Among the Duala proper, membership was originally reserved to "free" (pure-blooded) Duala, a stipulation that even excluded members of the prestigious Akwa clan due to one of their ancestors being a [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]] woman. Observations by European traders and explorers prove that jengu-worship was well established by the early 19th century. Early [[missionary|missionaries]] largely failed in their attempts to suppress it.

The cult is still active in Cameroon's [[Littoral Province, Cameroon|Littoral]] and [[Southwest Province, Cameroon|Southwest Province]]s. Both males and females are eligible to join, though this openness may be a fairly recent development. Jengu-worship is primarily male among the Duala proper, but among the Bakweri, on the other hand, the cult is primarily for women.

===Ceremonies and rituals===

Jengu worship centres on a [[secret society]] led by an individual known as the ''ekale''. This person traditionally wears a [[mask]] at all meetings, though this practice all but died out by the mid-20th century. Anyone can supplicate the miengu, however, and the simplest [[ritual]]s involve nothing more than [[prayer]]s or [[sacrifice]]s to the deities before [[fishing]] or traveling by water.

Early jengu worshippers performed rituals in pirogues on the [[Wouri River]], its tributaries and [[Wouri estuary|estuary]], and on nearby islands. The person would first dress in ceremonial garb, a cape, skirt, and headdress of [[raffia]] fronds, and carry palm fronds and wooden paddles. He would then summon the miengu and offer them oblations of food and drink. He might also visit a jengu [[shrine]] further up the Wouri.

Much jengu worship is related to [[healing]] and [[traditional medicine|medicine]], and the miengu are called upon when mainstream healing fails. For example, a jengu doctor can treat a patient by first sacrificing a cock and goat. He then administers a vomit-inducing medicine and waves a small stool over the patient's head. The one treated must then follow a series of [[taboo]]s. Among the Bakweri, this rite is known as ''Liengu la Vafea''. 

The highest-profile miengu ceremony today is the annual [[Ngondo]] celebration in [[Douala]], first held in 1949. The night before the fête's culmination, members of the jengu cult hold a private ceremony at Jebale Island on the Wouri. There they sacrifice to the water spirits and prepare a package of gifts. The next day, this offering is presented to the miengu during a public ceremony on a beach near Douala. One cult member dives into the sea with the gift and stays down as long as possible. Afterward, he returns with a message from the miengu about the year to come.

The climax of the ngondo festival is the jengu cult. Wherein the traditional diver goes into the river under supervision of the traditional rulers. This undisclosed custodian of tradition, accompanied by a woman and two men, embarks on a ritual boat. He will then submerge himself in the middle of the river and stay underneath the water for three to ten minutes. It is believed that he visits the kingdom of their ancestors (spirits) beneath the waters. He returns with news of the successor of the ngondo presidency and a coded message from the gods of the land in a calabash. One mystery of this ritual is that the calabash, which the diver holds as he re-emerges from underneath the river, is dry.

===Induction===

The rites observed by the Bakweri people of Mount Cameroon serve as an example of similar rituals among other coastal groups. 

Toward the coast, the Bakweri practice two major induction rituals. In the ''Liengu la Ndiva'', cult members take a [[seizure]] or collapse as a sign that a young girl is ready for induction. A cult member then speaks to her in a [[Ceremonial language|secret liengu language]], and if she seems to understand any of it, a traditional healer begins the [[initiation]] rites. The girl must live in seclusion for several months, during which she must follow a strict set of taboos and may see [[vision (religion)|visions]] of spirits. She also receives a [[secret name]] and teaching in the secret liengu language. Eventually, the healer releases her into the custody of a group of strong men and a number of women singing in the liengu language. The men take turns carrying her until she reaches the middle of a stream. There, the healer plunges her in, inducting her into the cult. Meanwhile, other cult members attempt to capture a crab from the waters, as this animal represents the liengu spirit. The new member's taboos remain, however, and she must live in seclusion for several more months. Finally, the cult holds a [[festival|feast]] in her honour, and the initiation comes to an end. The entire process takes the better part of a year.

An alternate Bakweri initiation ritual is the ''Liengu la Mongbango''. If a young girl disappears into the bush, her female relatives try to track her down by singing to her in the liengu language and carrying cult insignia made of wicker. When they find her, they hide her away for several months (outsiders may visit, however). Afterward, the cult prepares a feast for the girl. She and her sponsor then go alone into the forest. The initiate dresses in traditional regalia of fern fronds and rubs her body with red [[camwood]]. She is then led back to the village tied to the middle of a long rope. Two groups play a [[tug of war]] over her until the rope breaks, and she collapses. The cult members call to her nine times in the liengu language, which causes her to stand back up. After a few more weeks of taboos, a traditional healer bathes her in a stream, and her initiation ends. This process also takes most of a year.

They are also known as Jhaunwar.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 633 to 637 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Jhamar are an occupational [[Hindu]] [[caste]] traditionally associated with basket makers. According to some traditions, the word Jhamar is a corruption of the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] word ''jhaua'', which means a basket. The Jhamar themselves claim to be [[Lodh]]as, who took up the occupation of basket making. Over time this change of occupation led to the formation of a distinct community. The Jhamar are involved in the making of baskets from the twigs of the Arhar plant. They are a small community, found mainly in the districts of [[Barabanki District|Barabanki]], [[Lucknow District|Lucknow]] and [[Unnao District|Unnao]]. The Jhamar speak [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] among themselves and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] with outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 633 to 637 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present Circumstances ==
The Jhamar are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]] and practice clan [[exogamy]]. They are a landless community, with basket making still their principle occupation. A significant number of Jhamar are now daily wage labourers, involved in occupations such as [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] pulling. Each Jhamar settlement also contains a biradari [[panchayat]], an informal caste association, which acts as an instrument of social control.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 633 to 637 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Mysians are understood as a people who originally from Asia Minor, but those living in Thrace have become confounded with the Getae, according to Strabo.&lt;ref name=strabo/&gt; As such, some commentators refer to them as [[Dacians|Dacian]] priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ustinova |first=Yulia |author-link=Yulia Ustinova|title=Caves and the Ancient Greek Mind|publisher=OUP Oxford |year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TA4UDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cannabis==
{{Fringe section|date=January 2018}}
The interpretation that the "smoke-walkers" refer to cannabis smokers have been pushed by some authors, who think that the practice also extends to the ethnography of the [[Scythian]]s. These authors imagine that the Kapnobatai must have burned [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] flowers to induce a state of [[trance]].&lt;ref name="urlThe Scythians"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Scythians | author = Chris Bennet | url = http://www.lost-civilizations.net/scythians.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that as cannabis slowly spread westward, these peoples were introduced to it by the ancient [[Aryan]]s, of whom in turn were introduced to it by the ancient [[Assyria]]ns, and them by the ancient [[Hindu]]s. These past cultures were some of the very first to [[smoking|smoke]] cannabis for [[recreational drug use|recreational]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

Korra appears in ''The Legend of Korra'' books ''Revolution''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution|publisher=Random House Books for Young Readers|isbn=978-0449815540|year=2013|first=Erica|last=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Endgame'', two novels that together adapt the first season of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Endgame|publisher=Random House Books for Young Readers|isbn=978-0449817346|year=2013|first=Erica|last=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and conception==
Bryan Konietzko's interest in martial arts influenced him to draw inspirations from various female MMA fighters for the design of Korra's character, one inspiration being [[Gina Carano]]. In addition, she was indirectly inspired by one of Bryan Konietzko's sisters. Korra was also designed to be an inversion of [[Aang]], the title character of the preceding story ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. Instead of the young, spiritual Aang, Korra is a more physical character who has trouble grasping the spiritual side of being the Avatar while being able to already bend three elements at the age of four. In contrast, Aang takes a while to master each of the elements, but connects with the spirit world instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/06/22/the-legend-of-korra-creators-answer-your-questions/| title=‘The Legend of Korra’ Creators Answer Your Questions|date=2012-06-22|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korra's name was settled long after her character was imagined. Konietzko and DiMartino couldn't agree to a name for her until they learned "Cora", the name of a hotel operator's dog. The name was kept, and only changed in spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/legend-of-korra-nickelodeon-creators-preview-312068| title='Legend of Korra' Creators: 5 Things You Didn't Know About the New 'Avatar' (Guest Blog)|date=2012-04-13|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creators felt the second season was built around Korra becoming more in-tuned with her spiritual side, reinforcing their belief that a giant spirit version of herself would be the "ultimate manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/11/21/legend-of-korra-creators-talk-about-book-2-spirits-finale-and-book-3-change/?KEYWORDS=korra|title=‘Legend of Korra’ Creators Talk About Book 2 ‘Spirits’ Finale and Book 3 ‘Change’|first=Christopher John|last=Farley|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=The Washington Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiMantino wrote that Korra's lack of usage of the Avatar State during the third season was purposefully done to show her connection with Raava as being full-fledged, her developed understanding that type of power should be reserved for the "most extreme circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael Dante|last=DiMartino|title=''The Legend of Korra—The Art of the Animated Series, Book Three: Change''|pages=175|year=2015|isbn=978-1616555658|publisher=Dark Horse Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Asami Sato, Korra is half of the first major acknowledged LGBT couple in western [[Children's television series|children's animation]].&lt;ref name="KAfirstcanon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farokhmanesh|first1=Megan|title=The Legend of Korra achieved more in under a minute than most shows do in their lifetime|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/12/23/7439921/the-legend-of-korra-series-finale-asami-couple|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=Polygon|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Korra's [[bisexuality]], Konietzko admitted that the idea of a romantic relationship between Korra and Asami had been discussed by the creators during production of season one, but had not been given much weight due to assumptions that the show would not be permitted to openly depict a same-sex relationship. As development of the last two seasons went on and Korra and Asami’s friendship progressed, "the more the idea of a romance between them organically blossomed for [the creators]," and so the show started hinting at the possibility of such a relationship. In the end, Konietzko and DiMartino chose to openly depict Korra and Asami's relationship in the series finale because they didn't want to regret not doing so after the series ended. While still having limits on what could be shown, Nickelodeon was supportive of the relationship when approached.&lt;ref name="Konietzko"/&gt;

=== Design ===
 [[File:Korra (Season 4) appearance.jpg|thumb|right|Korra as she appears in Book 4.]]
Before drawing the character, Konietzko and DiMartino discussed her athleticism and physicality which factored into the earliest illustrations of Korra. It took the pair and [[Joaquim Dos Santos]]'s combined efforts to finalize her character design.&lt;ref name=DiMartino10-15&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael Dante|last=DiMartino|title=''The Legend of Korra—The Art of the Animated Series, Book One: Air''|pages=10–15.|year=2013|isbn=978-1616551681|publisher=Dark Horse Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pilot (2012) episode "[[Welcome to Republic City]]", Korra is introduced as a teenager wearing Fire Nation attire over her traditional Water Tribe garb. She is briefly seen wearing it again during a flashback in the fourth season. Konietzko thought it was "fun to play with" the familiar Water Tribe outfit. After her defeat of Amon, she underwent an outfit change, gaining an asymmetrical top and sleeves.

Korra for the first three seasons is depicted with long hair that is usually kept in a ponytail, though she has it down on several occasions such as when attending festivities, while entering the Avatar State by the Red Lotus and during her battle with Zaheer shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="Venom of the Red Lotus"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Venom of the Red Lotus|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=313|airdate=2014-08-22|season=4|number=2|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=313|transcript=Transcript for 313 - Venom of the Red Lotus|credits=Director: Mei Zwyer; Writer: Joshua Hamilton &amp; Tim Hedrick|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korra is so rarely seen with her hair down that DiMartino wrote that whenever the character had her hair down, "you know something bad has happened."&lt;ref name=DiMartino106&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael Dante|last=DiMartino|title=''The Legend of Korra—The Art of the Animated Series, Book One: Air''|pages=106|year=2013|isbn=978-1616551681|publisher=Dark Horse Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She maintains the hairstyle for the next three years as she recovers until shortly after regaining her mobility, at which point she cuts it.&lt;ref name="Korra Alone"&gt;{{cite episode|title= Korra Alone|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=402|airdate=2014-10-10|season=4|number=2|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=402|transcript=Transcript for 402 - Korra Alone|credits=Director: Ian Graham; Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hairstyle change was revealed in September 2014 by Konietzko, who wrote that the character was returning to her roots by sporting a bob cut similar to the one she was given by Dos Santos in his original concept for her, Konietzko adding that the alteration was carrying on a tradition in the ''Avatar'' franchise to have hairstyle changes over the course of a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/97302394302/korranation-korra-is-heading-to-new-york-comic|title=Korra's new hairstyle|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hypable.com/check-out-korras-new-look-in-the-legend-of-korra-season-4/|title='The Legend of Korra' season 4: Korra's New Look|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=Hypable|first=Michal|last=Schick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korra's initial clothing in the fourth season is purposely designed to mirror that of her Water Tribe attire in the previous seasons, consisting of a sleeveless shirt and baggy pants, DiMartino finding it paramount that it resemble her prior clothing due to the duration for which she wore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of Korra: The Art of the Animated Series Book Four: Balance|page=26.|year=2015|first1=Michae Dante|last1=DiMartino|first2=Bryan|last2=Konietzko|publisher=Dark Horse Books|isbn= 978-1616556877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korra gains another outfit midway through the fourth season.

=== Voice ===
[[File:Janet Varney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|[[Janet Varney]] voices Korra]]
Korra is voiced by [[Janet Varney]]. Varney stated that she loved the character, describing her as being "complicated" while reasoning that this was due to her age and responsibilities and summarized her experience voicing Korra as having been "such a privilege to be a part of". Varney understood the criticism of her character and felt it was one of the compelling aspects of the series, as Korra was someone that "you're not always looking up to" and mentioned [[Superman]] while saying that a character is more interesting to her when they are flawed. Responding to being questioned about negative reception for the series in general, Varney admitted to preferring to live in a world of "unicorns and rainbows" and only pay attention to the positive feedback she received since she believed she would not "do a better job on the show if my feelings are crushed by someone who’s just angry at me for no reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://comicsalliance.com/janet-varney-david-faustino-legend-of-korra-interview/ |title=Thank God There Was Korra: Actors Janet Varney &amp; David Faustino Talk ‘Legend Of Korra’ [Interview] |first=Juliet |last=Kahn |date=August 11, 2014 |publisher=ComicsAlliance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906125001/http://comicsalliance.com/janet-varney-david-faustino-legend-of-korra-interview/ |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends with [[Grey DeLisle]], who voiced [[Azula]] in the original series ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'', Varney remembered her advice about the fandom where DeLisle told her to be ready for her "life to change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ithe-legend-of-korra-ilead-janet-varney-talks-fun--81654|first=Emily|last=Guendelsberger|date=June 22, 2012|title=The Legend Of Korra lead Janet Varney talks fun with fandom and strong female leads|publisher=The A.V. Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization ==
===Personality and characteristics===
Unlike her predecessor Aang, Korra is described by her creators as "very tough, very headstrong, and not scared to get into a fight." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farley|first=Christopher|title=‘The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra’: The Creators Speak|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/03/08/the-last-airbender-legend-of-korra-the-creators-speak/|work=Speakeasy|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she is talented, her stubborn and hot-headed personality prevents her from easily learning airbending or connecting with the Spirit World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korra / Avatar|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/legend-of-korra/characters/korra-avatar.html|work=The Legend of Korra|publisher=Nickelodeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Avatar traditionally has the greatest difficulty mastering the element diametrically opposed to the Avatar's personality. For instance, Avatar Roku - a firebender - took longer to learn waterbending and Aang - an airbender - took longer to learn earthbending. The waterbender Korra, on the other hand, had little difficulty with firebending but had considerable trouble with airbending, a situation noted to be spiritual and not elemental.

Her best friend and animal guide is a polar bear-dog named Naga, whose strength helps Korra out of many dangerous situations. Although wild polar bear dogs were originally feared and hunted by Water Tribes, Korra is the first person to ever tame one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legend of Korra: Welcome to Republic City|url=http://www.nick.com/games/legend-of-korra-welcome-to-republic-city.html|work=The Legend of Korra|publisher=Nickelodeon|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korra is good friends with her pro-bending teammates, the brothers Mako (her [[Love interest|romantic interest]] in seasons 1 and 2) and Bolin. She also develops a strong friendship, and later romance,&lt;ref name=dimartino-korrasami /&gt; with Asami Sato, a wealthy industrialist. Korra has strong relationships with the family of her previous life: Having learned waterbending from Katara and then airbending from Tenzin, Tenzin's children look up to her as an older sister, and Kya and Bumi regard her as a friend. Korra is generally on good terms with her own parents, but has little contact with her uncle or cousins, whom she considers weird (and her father considers dangerous). Korra is unusual amongst her past lives in that she is technically royalty: her father Tonraq was in line to be the chief of the Northern Water Tribe before being banished and relocating to the South.

Korra's character develops and matures during episodes 11 through 12 of the first season when she is confronted with detachment from her main three bending skills, leaving her only with airbending, which she had unlocked to save Mako from Amon. Later, she connects to her spiritual self through Aang. Once the connection to her Avatar predecessors is established, Aang is able to bestow energybending upon Korra (as well as her main three bending skills lost earlier). Although Korra is able to bend all four elements, while being capable of entering the Avatar State, Korra is still in the process of perfecting her airbending skills as well as having a true connection and understanding of her spiritual self to complete her training as a fully realized Avatar. Combined with the events of seasons 2 and 3 placing her in life and death situations, the former having her no longer able to contact her past lives for advice, Korra begins to suffer [[post traumatic stress]] by the events of ''Book Four: Balance'' while doubting her abilities as the Avatar to maintain balance after those she faced have each disrupted the order she was struggling to protect in massive ways. But ultimately, once able to let go of the pain she went through and realizing the significance to her past suffering, Korra returns to her usual self while becoming a more compassionate person from her ordeals.

=== Abilities ===
Korra has impeccable [[athleticism]] and [[acrobatics]], shown being capable of simultaneously lifting Tenzin and his children with relative ease. She has surprising speed that go along with her agility and reflexes, which make her a skilled combatant in and of themselves. Her physical strength and stamina makes her capable of swimming across large bodies of water for days, or lift and throw significantly larger opponents. She can punch with enough force to break iron pipes or shatter large chunks of ice launched at her. Her dexterity and balance allows her to skillfully dodge a large barrage of projectiles and easily leap across long distances and over high obstacles from a stationary position. She is shown to be quite flexible, able to bend and twist effectively enough to attack from various angles or squeeze through tight spaces.

[[File:Korra firebending.png|right|thumb|300px|Korra firebending.]]
;Bending the elements
As the Avatar, Korra is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire). The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style.&lt;ref name="Kisu"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of the series, Korra is proficient in water, earth and fire, having been able to bend them with ease since she was a young child, but struggles with airbending due to the difficulties of embracing her spiritual side. She uses all elements equally as much but each one for different strategies: airbending mostly for non-lethal purposes, such as gliding and evasive manoeuvres; waterbending for both defensive and offensive manoeuvres; earthbending for strong attacks. She learned metalbending being the first metalbending Avatar. She also tends to use firebending when she is angered or acts with hostility towards an opponent, as she demonstrated when threatening the Red Lotus when expressing outrage with Zaheer for apparently murdering her father.&lt;ref name="Enter the Void"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Venom of the Red Lotus|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=313|airdate=2014-08-22|season=3|number=12|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=312|transcript=Transcript for 312 - Enter the Void|credits=Director: Mei Zwyer; Writer: Ian Graham|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Energybending
After learning energybending following her defeat of Amon, she becomes capable of restoring bending to those who had lost their abilities thanks to his actions. Korra became the second known Avatar to possess the capability. Her duties as Avatar and her personal feelings towards people did come into play with the restoring power, as she did not grant bending abilities back to individuals with backgrounds in crime. She is able to use energybending to connect with her inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.

;Spirituality
As the Avatar, Korra is as a bridge between "[[Nature|Material World]]" and the "[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. As her training under Tenzin progressed, she had slowly reconnected with her spirituality, seeing visions and accessing various memories from her past lives. Korra is able to purify "dark spirits" by balancing the energy within them. Following the events of the Harmonic Convergence in 171 AG, Korra lost her connection to her past lives by being temporarily separated from Raava, who was destroyed. Due to some residual traces of mercury in her body after her battle with Zaheer, Korra lost the ability to contact Raava and was unable to enter the Avatar State for three years.

;The Avatar State
Her most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows her to access bending techniques she would not have learned during her own lifetime but throughout that of her predecessors. In addition, she also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling her to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight her head on. The form is activated by Korra being in a predicament that she will either not be able to combat with her current skills or when her life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Korra's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection. Her weaknesses in the state is that she vulnerable, and if killed, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated.

==Reception==
Korra has been widely praised as a realistic, well-developed and sophisticated character by critics and viewers alike. Her position as a female protagonist, unusual for American animation, caused Nickelodeon to originally suspend production on the series.&lt;ref name="ArirangTV 2 May 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=The INNERview #61 - Yoo Jae-myung (유재명), Animation director|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKhAHeLKsSY|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=[[ArirangTV]]|date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to co-creator Bryan Koniezko, this was because the executives believed that "girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls". Production resumed when ''Korra'' [[test screening|test screened]] well, in particular with young boys.&lt;ref name="NPR 13 April 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|title='Airbender' Creators Reclaim Their World In 'Korra'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/13/150566153/airbender-creators-reclaim-their-world-in-korra|accessdate=15 June 2013|authorlink=Neda Ulaby|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Common Sense Media]] praised Korra as a good role model, citing her dedication to her goals and open-mindedness towards new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Filucci|first=Sierra|title=TV That's Good for Girls|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/tv-thats-good-for-girls|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noel Kirkpatrick felt the character had become unlikeable during the second season, though applauded the show for putting her at the center of its narrative as we saw the character "without a moderating influence, like [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-peacekeepers-review-every-which-way-but-korras-138092087939/|title=The Legend of Korra "Peacekeepers" Review: Every Which Way But Korra's|date=October 5, 2013|first=Noel|last=Kirkpatrick|publisher=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korra's experience with [[post traumatic stress disorder]] during Book Four has been highly praised&lt;ref name="ignrevkorraalone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/10/the-legend-of-korra-korra-alone-review|title=Outside Looking In|publisher=IGN|last=Nicholson|first=Max|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gaygeeksptsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialgaygeeks.com/2014/10/korra-post-traumatic-stress-disorder.html|title=Korra and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=Gay Geeks|date=October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112215721/http://www.officialgaygeeks.com/2014/10/korra-post-traumatic-stress-disorder.html|archivedate=2014-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshowptsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsang.net/korra-alone-kids-show-tackles-ptsd/|date=10 October 2014|last=Tsang|first=Natalie|title=Korra Alone: Kid's Show Tackles PTSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a realistic&lt;ref name="marysueinspwomanptsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-psychology-of-inspirational-women-korra/|publisher=The Mary Sue|title=The Psychology of Inspirational Women: Korra|last=Scarlet|first=Dr. Janina|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach to the subject. Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] wrote that it was "heartbreaking" to see Korra following her battle with [[Zaheer]] "in such a vulnerable, weakened state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/22/the-legend-of-korra-venom-of-the-red-lotus-review|title=The Legend of Korra: "Venom of the Red Lotus"|date=August 22, 2014|publisher=''IGN''|first=Max|last=Nicholson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janet Varney's acting received particular praise, with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' describing it as "an exceptional performance that fully captures the Avatar's pain, fear, and sadness. [Varney's] voice work is essential to bringing a sense of reality to Korra's struggle".&lt;ref name="avclubrevkorraalone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/legend-korra-korra-alone-210332|website=[[The A.V.

Following the conclusion of the series, Zach Blumenfeld of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked Korra as the second-best character from the ''Avatar'' universe, concluding that Korra was more interesting, relatable and inspiring that her predecessor, Avatar [[Aang]].&lt;ref name=pastemag&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/06/the-20-best-characters-from-the-avatar-universe.html|title=The 20 Best Characters From The Avatar Universe|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=June 21, 2016|first=Zach|last=Blumenfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ScreenRant]] ranked Korra #8 on its "30 Best Animated TV Characters Of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-animated-tv-characters-of-all-time/|title=30 Best Animated TV Characters Of All Time|work=[[ScreenRant]]|first=Jason|last=Berman|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Asami Sato===
[[File:The Legend of Korra S04E12 - Asami and Korra holding hands.jpg|thumb|The series' final shot, showing Korra (right) and Asami as a romantic couple, was seen as pushing the boundaries of [[LGBT]] representation in children's television.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title= Creators have confirmed that Korra and Asami are in a relationship through their respective tumblr blogs |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/legend-day-korra-colossus-last-stand-213266|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=AV Club|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Korra's position as a bisexual protagonist, as well as her eventual relationship with Asami Sato have been the subject of many very positive reviews from the media. In light of the finale, [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] called the show "one of the most powerful, subversive shows of 2014",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|title=‘How a Nickelodeon Cartoon Became One of the Most Powerful, Subversive Shows of 2014|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/korra-series-finale-recap-gay-asami/|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=19 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the show "challenged expectations and bravely explored content outside the scope of children’s television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|title=‘Legend of Korra Creators Officially Confirm Your Suspicions About That Ending|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/legend-of-korra-creators-confirm-korrasami-is-canon/|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=22 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[IGN]]'' commended the action-packed and emotional finale, noting that ending was one that "fans will be talking about for a long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Max|title=‘The Legend of Korra: "The Last Stand" Review: Endings.|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/19/the-legend-of-korra-the-last-stand-review/|publisher=IGN|accessdate=19 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' predicted that, in the future, Korra holding Asami's hand and leaping into the Spirit World "will become one of the hallmarks of this series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzales|first=David|title=‘'The Legend of Korra' Finale Literally Made Fan Dreams Come True|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davegonzales/2014/12/19/the-legend-of-korra-finale-literally-made-fan-dreams-come-true/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=19 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Farokhmanesh of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], the series even avoided the error of assuming [[sexual orientation]], as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between "gay" and "straight".&lt;ref name="KAfirstcanon"/&gt; Reviewers have noted that the two characters complement each other well as a couple, with Korra's brashness balancing Asami's levelheadedness.&lt;ref name=vulturelily&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/turf-wars-volume-two-korra-asami-relationship.html|title=How Turf Wars Part 2 Continues Korra and Asami's Relationship|work=Vulture.com|date=January 30, 2018|first=Lily|last=Carollo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegeekiary.com/turf-wars-part-1-review/45424|title=Korra and Asami Are Getting Bi: Turf Wars Part 1 Review|work=The Geekiary|date=August 15, 2017|first=Lauren|last=B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korra and Asami's relationship has also been noted for being a "landmark moment for American and family animation."&lt;ref name=vulturelily/&gt; ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' included Korra and Asami in their 2017 list of "35 LGBT Characters Who Redefined Family TV", noting that the series "ended on a note that changed family television forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/2017/2/02/35-lgbt-characters-who-redefined-family-tv#slide-1|title=35 LGBT Characters Who Redefined Family TV|work=The Advocate|first=Jacob|last=Ogles|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''[[io9]]'' ranked the series finale's reveal of Korra and Asami's relationship #55 on its list of "The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-100-most-important-pop-culture-moments-of-the-last-1822145186|title=The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years: #41-60|work=[[io9]]|date=January 17, 2018|author=io9 Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the critics who viewed the pairing negatively, E. Steven Burnett of ''Christ and Pop Culture'' wrote that the depiction of a same-sex relationship "hijacks Korra’s story in service of social causes to the detriment of its own creative storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=E. Steven|title= Korrasami Bends ‘The Legend of Korra’ In All The Wrong Ways|url= http://christandpopculture.com/korrasami-bends-legend-korra-wrong-ways/|accessdate=8 April 2015|work= Christ &amp; Pop Culture|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Rodrigues-Martin of ''Geeks Under Grace'' agreed that the pairing was a detriment to the characters and the story, opining that there was no foreshadowing of a romantic relationship between the two characters until the series' final moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodrigues-Martin|first=Daniel|title=‘The Legend of Korra' Series Finale: Three Reasons it Didn't Work|url=http://www.geeksundergrace.com/tv/legend-korra-series-finale-three-reasons-didnt-work/|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=Geeks Under Grace|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism that Korra and Asami's relationship was thrown in to appeal to fans who "[[Shipping (fandom)|shipped]]" the two of them together, Konietzko pointed out that any decision they made regarding Korra's romantic life could be interpreted as caving to a specific group of fans who supported Korra being paired with a certain character, and claimed that at the end of the day, the creators went for the relationship that felt right to them. He also suggested that anyone who felt the relationship was not adequately foreshadowed had watched the last two seasons only expecting to see heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Konietzko"/&gt;

The [[Catholicos]] [[Patriarch]] is the head of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], one of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]] and therefore part of the broader [[Catholic Church]].

==St. Sofia churches==
Greek "Hagia Sophia", Italian "Santa Sophia" is often rendered "Saint Sophia" in English even though the reference is to "Holy Wisdom", not to a saint.
This raises the possibility of confusion with churches dedicated to a saint of this name.

Some of his work appeared under the [[pen name]] "Mart Dellon."

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Nodell was the son of Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story| title=Superhero summer: Behind 'Green Lantern' and the rest, an American story|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623172041/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story|archivedate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=no|first=Gloria|last= Goodale|date= June 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2011|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | page= [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story/(page)/2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/n/nodell_martin.htm Martin Nodell] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. This source says Nodell also attended the "Chicago Academy of Art", but no school of that name exists, and the [[Chicago Academy for the Arts]] was not founded until 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1930s, where he attended [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name=lam /&gt;

===National Comics Publications===
Nodell began his illustrating career in 1938, working first as a freelancer. In 1940 he provided some work for [[Sheldon Mayer]], an editor at [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that ultimately merged to form [[National Comics Publications]] (present-day [[DC Comics]]). Interested in gaining more steady employment, Nodell created designs for a new character that would become the Golden Age [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]). The inspiration came in January 1940 at the 34th Street [[Subway (rail)|subway]] station in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; Nodell noticed a trainman waving a lantern along the darkened tracks. He coupled the imagery with elements from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[opera]]tic [[Ring cycle]]&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; as well as [[Chinese folklore]] and [[Greek mythology]]&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; to create the hero.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dionisio |first=Joseph |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zBx0HteF?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070205153908/http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11,0,3651663.story |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |title=Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell, 91 |work=[[Newsday]] |date=December 11, 2006 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11%2C0%2C3651663.story |deadurl=yes |df= }} Additional, June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Nodell himself described in 2000:
{{quote|I picked out the name from the train man on the tracks who was waving a lantern, going from red to green.... Green meant go and I decided that was it. Then I needed a colorful and interesting costume. I was interested in Greek mythology and so the costume took on elements of that. It just all fell into place. When I sent it in, I waited into the second week before I heard the word to come in. I was ushered into [[Max Gaines|Mr. [Max] Gaines]] office, publisher, and after sitting a long time and flipping through the pages of my presentation, he announced, 'We like it!' And then, 'Get to work!' I did the first five pages of an eight page story, and then they called in Bill Finger to help. We worked on it for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Nodell in {{cite web| last=Black| first= Bill| url= http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |title=An Interview with Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell| publisher= AC Comics|year= 2000| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5zBwS4Oy9?url=http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |archivedate= June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first adventure, drawn by Nodell (as Mart Dellon) and written by [[Bill Finger]], appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (July 1940). Nodell continued to use the pseudonym through at least ''[[All Star Comics]]''&lt;!--sp OK with no hyphen--&gt; #2 (Fall 1940).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/martin%20nodell/sort/chrono/ Martin Nodell] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 2000 he had used the pen name since, "Comics were a forbidden literature, culturally unacceptable. It wasn't something you were proud of". Nodell penciled and virtually always self-inked Green Lantern stories in ''All-American'' and ''All Star'' until the character got his own title, the premiere issue cover-dated July 1941. He would continue with it through to #25 (May 1947), very rarely drawing the covers, before being succeeded by a variety of artists including [[Howard Purcell]], [[Irwin Hasen]], and [[Alex Toth]].

===Timely Comics===
[[Image:MarvelTales93.jpg|left|thumb|''Marvel Tales'' #93 (Aug. 1949). Cover art by Nodell.&lt;!--per [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=7756 this page] at the Grand Comics Database--&gt;]]
Nodell left All-American in 1947 and joined [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s–40s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]]), where he drew postwar stories of [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]]. His work there was rarely signed, making idenfication difficult, though comics historians have confirmed that Nodell drew two well-known covers: The first issue of ''[[Marvel Tales]]'', Timely's [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics revamp of the company's flagship series ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''; and the penultimate issue (#74) of Captain America's book, which for its last two issues became the horror-oriented ''Captain America's Weird Tales''.

===Post-1950s career===
In 1950, Nodell left comics to work in advertising and later joined the [[Leo Burnett Agency]] in Chicago as an [[art director]]. In 1965, his design team there developed the long-running [[flour]]-company mascot the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionisio, 2000. Sidebar [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/lantern-s-light-celebrity-fans-flock-to-the-hip-dc-comics-superhero-but-he-still-can-t-get-a-movie-gig-1.477749 "Ring Power vs. Flour Power"].&lt;/ref&gt;

His only known comics work in the interim are penciling the story "The Glistening Death" in the [[Avon Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''City of the Living Dead'' (1952), reprinted two decades later in the [[Skywald]] horror-comics magazine ''Psycho'' #1 (Jan. 1971); and "Master of the Dead" in Avon's ''Eerie'' (1951 series) #14, reprinted in Skywald's ''Nightmare'' #1 (Dec. 1970).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

In the 1980s, Nodell submitted new work to DC, which led to his being rediscovered by comic fans. His first pieces included a 13-page puzzle-and-activity section in ''[[Super Friends|Super Friends Special]]'' #1 (1981), and drawing the Golden Age [[Harlequin (comics)#Molly Mayne|Harlequin]] in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe]]'' #10 (Dec. 1985).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; His final two published pieces of Green Lantern art were a one-page illustration of Golden Age [[Alan Scott]] Green Lantern in the 50th-anniversary issue ''Green Lantern'' vol. 3, #19 (Dec. 1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/50454/ ''Green Lantern'' DC, 1990 Series) #19] at Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-page illustration of the Alan Scott Green Lantern and [[Superman]] in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1 (Dec. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/58075/ ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database. Note: The [http://www.comics.org/issue/91581/ GCD also lists] Nodell among three [[pencilers]] who contributed to the single [[Hal Jordan]] Green Lantern figure on the cover of the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Green Lantern Gallery'' #1 (1996), but this cover is signed only by penciler [[Gil Kane]] and [[inker]] [[Kevin Nowlan]].&lt;/ref&gt; At 80, Nodell penciled his final comic-book work, the whimsical, 10-page [[Harlan Ellison]] adaptation "Gnomebody", scripted by [[John Ostrander]] and Ellison and inked by [[Jed Hotchkiss]], in [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Quarterly'' #1 (Aug. 1996).

===Personal life===
Nodell met his future wife, Carrie, at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in September 1940.&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB9&gt;Dionisio, 2000.

"'''Octave'''" has two senses in [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgical]] usage. In the first sense, it is the eighth day after a feast, reckoning inclusively, and so always falls on the same day of the week as the feast itself.  The word is derived from [[Latin]] ''octava'' (eighth), with ''dies'' (day) understood.  In the second sense, the term is applied to the whole period of these eight days, during which certain major feasts came to be observed.&lt;ref name="ODCC"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church ([[Oxford University Press]] 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Octave''&lt;/ref&gt;

Octaves, not being successive, are quite distinct from [[eight-day week]]s and simply refer to the return of the same day of a [[seven-day week]] in the [[inclusive counting]] system used in Latin (just as the ninth day was a return to the same day of a [[nundinal cycle]], the eight-day week of the pre-Christian Roman calendar).

==Early history==
The "eighth day" or ''octava dies'' was associated with the weekly Christian celebration of the resurrection of Christ every "eighth day", which became a name for [[Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DWdk0AZlzZIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22eighth+day%22+resurrection&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiei9Ct0KnMAhXpBcAKHeh4DpoQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eighth%20day%22%20resurrection&amp;f=false Irénée Henri Dalmais, Pierre Jounel, Aimé Georges Martimort, ''The Liturgy and Time'' (Liturgical Press 1986] {{ISBN|978-0-81461366-5}}), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oF1z7Iy2tQgC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=Sunday+%22eighth+day%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sunday%20%22eighth%20day%22&amp;f=false Kenneth A.

As circumcision was performed on the "eighth day" after birth, the number 8 became associated also with baptism,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7n5KAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=Sunday+%22eighth+day%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sunday%20%22eighth%20day%22&amp;f=false D.A.

The practice of octaves was first introduced under [[Constantine I]], when the dedication festivities of the basilicas at [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon]] were observed for eight days. 
After these one-off occasions, annual liturgical feasts began to be dignified with an octave.  
The first such feasts were [[Easter]], [[Pentecost]], and, in the East, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].&lt;ref name="ODCC"/&gt;  This occurred in the fourth century and served as a period of time for the newly [[baptized]] to take a joyful retreat.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11204a.htm "Octave"], ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of octaves occurred slowly.  From the 4th century to the 7th century, Christians observed octaves with a celebration on the eighth day, with little development of the liturgies of the intervening days.  [[Christmas]] was the next feast to receive an octave.  By the 8th century, Rome had developed liturgical octaves not only for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas, but also for the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and the feast of the [[dedication]] of a church.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;  From the seventh century, saints' feasts also began to have octaves (an eighth-day feast, not eight days of feasts), among the oldest being the feasts of [[feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]], [[Saint Lawrence]] and [[Saint Agnes]].  From the twelfth century,  the custom developed of liturgical observance of the days between the first and the eighth day, as well as the eighth day.&lt;ref name="ODCC"/&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], octaves for various other feasts and saints were celebrated depending upon the [[diocese]] or [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious order]].&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

==Modern history==

===From Pius V to Pius XII===
After 1568, when [[Pope Pius V]] reduced the number of octaves,&lt;ref name="ODCC"/&gt; they were still numerous. Not only on the eighth day from the feast but on all the intervening days, the [[liturgy]] was the same as on the feast itself, with exactly the same prayers and [[Scripture]] readings. Octaves were classified into several types. Easter and Pentecost had "specially privileged" octaves, during which no other feast whatsoever could be celebrated. Christmas, Epiphany, and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] had "privileged" octaves, during which certain highly ranked feasts might be celebrated.  The octaves of other feasts allowed even more feasts to be celebrated.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

To reduce the repetition of the same liturgy for several days, [[Pope Leo XIII]] and [[Pope Pius X]] made further distinctions, classifying octaves into three primary types: privileged octaves, common octaves, and simple octaves.  Privileged octaves were further arranged in a hierarchy of first, second, and third orders.  For the first half of the 20th century, octaves were ranked in the following manner, which affected holding other celebrations within their timeframes:

*'''Privileged Octaves'''
**'''''Privileged Octaves of the First Order'''''
***[[Octave of Easter]]
***Octave of [[Pentecost]]
**'''''Privileged Octaves of the Second Order'''''
***Octave of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]
***Octave of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]
**'''''Privileged Octaves of the Third Order'''''
***Octave of [[Christmas]]
***Octave of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]
***Octave of the [[Sacred Heart]]
*'''Common Octaves'''
**Octave of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Conception BVM]]
**Octave of the [[Saint Joseph's Day|Solemnity of St. Joseph]]
**Octave of the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]]
**Octave of [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Ss. Peter and Paul]]
**Octave of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption BVM]]
**Octave of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]
*'''Simple Octaves'''
**Octave of [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]]
**Octave of [[John the Apostle|St. John the Apostle]]
**Octave of the [[Massacre of the Innocents|Holy Innocents]]
**Octave of [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Lawrence]]
**Octave of the [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity BVM]]

In addition to these, the [[patron saint]] of a particular nation, diocese, or church was celebrated with an octave, on each day of which the Mass and [[Liturgy of the Hours|Office]] of the feast was repeated, unless impeded by another celebration.

Although the feasts of St. Lawrence and the [[Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] officially still had simple octaves, by the 20th century they had all but vanished as higher-ranking feasts were added to the calendar. The octave day alone of St. Lawrence was still commemorated during the mass of [[Hyacinth of Caesarea|St. Hyacinth]]. The entire octave of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was impeded, but [[Holy Name of Mary|The Most Holy Name of Mary]] was celebrated during the octave and [[Our Lady of Sorrows|The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] was celebrated on the former octave day.

===Reduction by Pius XII and Paul VI===
[[Pope Pius XII]] simplified the calendar with a decree dated 23 March 1955: only the octaves of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost were kept, octaves that differed from the others in not repeating the same liturgy daily. All other octaves in the [[Roman Rite]] were suppressed, including those in local calendars. (See [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII#Octaves]].) In 1969 the Roman Catholic Church further revised the Roman Calendar by removing the octave of Pentecost.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first eight days of the Easter Season make up the octave of Easter and are celebrated as solemnities of the Lord, with proper readings and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;''General Norms for Liturgical Year and Calendar'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; Since 30 April 2000, the "[[Octave of Easter|Second Sunday of Easter]]", which concludes the Easter Octave, has also been called [[Divine Mercy Sunday]].

The Christmas Octave is arranged as follows:
*Sunday within the octave: feast of the [[Holy Family]]; celebrated on Friday, December 30 when Christmas is a Sunday
*26 December: feast of [[Saint Stephen]]
*27 December: feast of [[John the Apostle]]
*28 December: feast of the [[Holy Innocents]]
*29-31 December: days within the octave, with assigned readings and prayers, on which the celebration of optional memorials is permitted according to special rubrics (but as noted above, when Christmas is a Sunday, the feast of the Holy Family is celebrated on December 30)
*1 January, octave day of the Nativity; [[solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]]&lt;ref&gt;''General Norms for Liturgical Year and Calendar'', 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Christian usage==
{{main article|Afterfeast}}
Among the Eastern Orthodox and [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], what in the West would be called an Octave is referred to as an '''Afterfeast'''. The celebration of the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]] of the [[Church year#Eastern Orthodox Church|church year]] are extended for a number days, depending upon the particular Feast. Each day of an Afterfeast will have particular hymns assigned to it, continuing the theme of the Feast being celebrated.

Most of these Great Feasts also have a day or more of preparation called a '''Forefeast''' (those Feasts that are on the moveable Paschal Cycle do not have Forefeasts). Forefeasts and Afterfeasts will affect the structure of the services during the [[Canonical hours#Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic usage|Canonical Hours]].

The last day of an Afterfeast is called the '''Apodosis''' (lit. "giving-back") of the Feast. On the Apodosis, most of the hymns that were chanted on the first day of the Feast are repeated. On the Apodosis of Feasts of the [[Theotokos]], the Epistle and Gospel of the Feast are repeated again at the [[Divine Liturgy]].

==Non-liturgical usage==
The term "octave" is applied to some church observances that are not strictly liturgical. For example, many churches observe an annual "Octave of Prayer for [[Ecumenism|Christian Unity]]", which runs from 18 January to 25 January. The octave was established in 1895 by [[Pope Leo XIII]] for the period between [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]]. In 1909, [[Pope Pius X]] approved the transfer of this octave to the period between the former feast of the [[Chair of St. Peter]] and the feast of the [[Conversion of St. Paul]]. In 1968, the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] agreed to jointly publish prayer materials for the occasion under the title "[[Week of Prayer for Christian Unity]]", but it is still often referred to as an octave, especially within the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglo-Catholic]] traditions. The Week of Prayer is observed at various times around the world, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where it is commonly observed from Ascension to Pentecost.

Each year, [[Luxembourg]] holds what is called the [[octave celebration]] from the 3rd to the 5th Sunday after [[Easter]], 15 instead of 8 days, in honour of [[Our Lady of Luxembourg]], patroness of the city.

'''Progressive revelation''' is the concept in [[Christianity]] that the sections of the [[Bible]] that were written later contain a fuller [[revelation]] of God than the earlier sections. For instance, the theologian [[Charles Hodge]] wrote:
{{quote |"The progressive character of divine revelation is recognized in relation to all the great doctrines of the Bible...  What at first is only obscurely intimated is gradually unfolded in subsequent parts of the sacred volume, until the truth is revealed in its fulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ccel.org/h/hodge/ | last = Hodge | first = Charles | title = Systematic Theology | volume = 1 | place = Peabody | publisher = Hendrickson | year = 2003 | page = 446 | ISBN = 1-56563-459-4}} (also available as {{Citation | last = Hodge | edition = abridged | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Gross | title = Systematic Theology | ISBN = 0-87552-224-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ultimate revelation of God is understood to be found in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as revealed in the [[Gospels]]. For example, the [[New Testament]] is to be used to understand and interpret the [[Old Testament]] better. Likewise, all sections of the Bible are believed accurate in [[Evangelicalism]].

Unlike [[seventh-day Sabbatarians]], [[Puritan]] [[Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarians]] practice [[first-day Sabbatarianism]] (Sunday Sabbatarianism), keeping [[Sunday]] as Sabbath and referring to it as the [[Lord's Day]].

==Origins==
{{Puritan history}}
While [[John Calvin]]'s theology of the fourth commandment differed from that of the [[Puritan]]s, he believed that Christians were commanded to cease from labor and recreation in order to devote the entire day to worship.&lt;ref name="Coldwell"&gt;{{cite web | last = Coldwell | first = Chris | year = 2007 | title = Calvin in the Hands of the Philistines: Or Did Calvin Bowl on the Sabbath? | work = Naphtali Press | url = http://www.naphtali.com/articles/chris-coldwell/calvin-in-the-hands-of-the-philistines-or-did-calvin-bowl-on-the-sabbath/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Genevan Consistory]] during the time of Calvin regularly interviewed people for working or engaging in recreation considered inappropriate for spiritual refreshment such as hunting, dancing, banqueting, playing tennis or [[Cue sports|billiard]]s, or bowling [[skittles (sport)|skittles]] on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Manetsch | first = Scott M. | title = Calvin’s Company of Pastors: Pastoral Care and the Emerging Reformed Church, 1536–1609 | page = 131 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2013 | location = New York | series = Oxford Studies in Historical Theology | quote = Between 1542 and 1609, the Consistory frequently interviewed and sometimes reprimanded people for working on Sunday, whether for pruning trees, making lace, selling tripe, unloading boats, hunting birds, or moving furniture. The Consistory also disciplined people for engaging in recreational activities on Sunday that were deemed inappropriate for spiritual refreshment, such as hunting, dancing, banqueting, playing tennis or billiards, or bowling skittles. When Sunday labor was born out of service to the community rather than avarice, the ministers normally showed leniency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vestments controversy|Vestiarian]] controversy, Reformers were spurred to develop the [[regulative principle of worship]], a fundamental article that no corporate worship is permissible that does not have the sanction of Scripture, whether stated explicitly, or derived by a necessary deduction from Scripture.&lt;ref name=dennison&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/the-perpetuity-and-change-of-the-sabbath/|title=The Perpetuity and Change of the Sabbath|first=James|last=Dennison Jr.|publisher=[[Ligonier Ministries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, Puritans had applied the regulative principle to devote [[first-day Sabbath]] entirely to God, indulging in neither the labors nor the recreations common to the other six days.&lt;ref name=dennison/&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Sabbath Breakers.jpg|thumb|left|275px|''The Sabbath Breakers'' by J.C. Dollman.]]
Sunday Sabbatarianism as ''[[Divine law|jure divino]]'' or divinely ordained command, in contrast to [[non-Sabbatarian]] and [[antinomian]] reliance on [[Christian liberty]], thus was a closely linked development to the regulative principle amongst English Protestants over the 17th century.&lt;ref name=dennison/&gt; Stricter observance of Lord's Day arose in England and Scotland, in reaction to the [[Prelatic]] laxity with which Sunday observance was customarily kept, which included recreations classified as lawful. Opposed also by seventh-day Sabbatarians [[John Traske]], [[Theophilus Brabourne]], and the [[Seventh-day Baptists]], some Puritans stated that Sabbath was a proportion (one-seventh) rather than a particular day (either Saturday or Sunday),&lt;ref name=dennison/&gt; while others further specifically identified the first day as Christian Sabbath.&lt;ref name=gi/&gt;

Though there are slight differences between confessional formulations of British and continental European Reformed churches, in the seventeenth century there came to be a consensus among the Reformed that the Sabbath should be devoted primarily to the worship of God.&lt;ref name =Gaffin&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaffin |first= Richard B. Jr. |author-link=Richard Gaffin |chapter=Westminster and the Sabbath |editor-last=Duncan |editor-first=J.

Puritan Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1646), in the [[Calvinist]] theological tradition (Chapter 21, ''Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day'', sections 7-8):&lt;ref name=gi/&gt;

As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him: which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lord’s day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.&lt;br&gt;8. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe a holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations, but also are taken up, the whole time, in the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.}}

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] delivered three sermons on ''The Perpetuity and Change of the Sabbath'' that are central to Puritan tradition.&lt;ref name=dennison/&gt; The first sermon emphasises Sabbath as an immutable, divine natural and positive law (as to proportion), while the second emphasises an alteration of "another law, which determined the beginning and ending of their working days" (as to order); the first day of creation is regarded as unknowable, and the weekday assigned to Sabbath regarded as not revealed until the Exodus.&lt;ref name=dennison/&gt;&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bfRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|first=Jonathan|last=Edwards|authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|title=The Works of Jonathan Edwards|volume=2|pages=93–103|year=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third sermon regards the proper keeping of Sabbath: "We are strictly to abstain from being outwardly engaged in any worldly thing, either worldly business or recreations," because "the sabbath-day is an accepted time, a day of salvation, a time wherein God especially loves to be sought, and loves to be found."&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

[[Reformed]] Sabbatarian theologian [[G. I. Williamson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.equip.org/articles/sabbath-keeping-and-the-new-covenant/|title=Sabbath Keeping and the New Covenant|publisher=[[Christian Research Institute]]|first=Steve|last=Bright|work=Christian Research Journal|volume=26|number=2|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; accordingly suggests that "television, reading of newspapers and magazines, and engaging in sports and excursions ... are not proper to the Sabbath because 'Sabbath' means to cease from these things in order to give one day exclusively to worship and the reading of God's Word, etc." The cessation described entails all engrossing activities of the six days of the week, whether employment or recreations, and thus specifically excludes ceasing only from work while continuing favorite recreations.&lt;ref name=gi&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=G. I.|author-link=G. I. Williamson|title=The Westminster Confession of Faith for Study Classes|year=1978|publisher=Presbyterian and Reformed|pages=170, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson affirms striving toward holiness, calling it a lofty goal to avoid "even thoughts and words about our worldly employments or recreations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=G. I.|author-link=G. I. Williamson|title=The Shorter Catechism|volume=2|year=1977|origyear=1970|publisher=Presbyterian and Reformed|others=Tyson, Thomas, illus|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though modern expression of Puritan Sabbath has been caricatured as being boring, organisations that promote Sabbaths as joyous, delightful appointments include [[Day One Christian Ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olyott|first=Stuart|title=Why Sunday?|url=http://www.lordsday.co.uk/WhySunday.htm|publisher=[[Day One Christian Ministries]]|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historical theologian]] [[R. Scott Clark]] has criticized the idea that distinct "Puritan" and "Continental" views on the Sabbath exist, instead arguing that the Reformed have historically agreed that recreation is prohibited on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Clark | first = R.

In the United States throughout the nineteenth century, Protestant moralists organized the "Sabbath reform" that pushed for stricter Sunday keeping. Their efforts prompted the enforcement of [[Sunday laws]] (often called [[blue laws]]) that legally barred a variety of activities on Sundays. The enforcement of Sunday laws gave rise to substantial church-state debates as well as [[Minority rights|minority-rights]] movements fueled by the resistance of Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, and other religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, Kyle G. (2014). ''Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Law ==
In 1671, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], codified the following law with respect to the Sunday Sabbath in its charter:&lt;ref name="BlakelyColcord1911"&gt;{{cite book|title=American State Papers Bearing on Sunday Legislation|date=1911|publisher=The Religious Liberty Association|language=English|editor=William Addison Blakely, Willard Allen Colcord}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|That whosoever shall profane the Lords-day, by doing unnecessary servile work, by unnecessary travailing, or by sports and recreations, he or they that so transgress, shall forfeit for every such default forty shillings, or be publickly whipt: But if it clearly appear that the sin was profoundly, Presumptuously and with a high hand committed, against the known Command and Authority of the blessed God, such a person therein despising and reproaching the Lord, ''shall be put to death or grievously punished at the Judgement of the Court''.&lt;ref name="BlakelyColcord1911"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2203">'''Randeng Daoren''' ({{zh|s=燃灯道人|p=Rándēng Dàorén|l=Burning Lamp Taoist}}) is a character featured within the famed classic Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. He would be renowned as the Superiorman of Mount Condor, Intuition Cave. His role originated from [[Dipankara|Dipankara Buddha]] of Buddhist lore, who was a past enlightened being before the time of [[Gautama Buddha]].

Following the incident with [[Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun]] and [[Taiyi Zhenren]], [[Nezha]] would once again see an opportunity to strike down his father, [[Li Jing (deity)|Li Jing]] and end his great hatred. Soon enough, Randeng Daoren would see Li Jing and immediately tell him to hide behind him less he be killed. Once Nezha appeared directly before Randeng Daoren, Randeng Daoren would say the words, "''I thought this problem had been resolved in the Cloud Top Cave. It is not good for you to rekindle your revenge again.''"

Soon enough, Randeng Daoren would thrust Li Jing forward to fight. Because Randeng Daoren had already spat on Li Jing's back - which gave him magical powers - Li Jing was a match for Nezha at last. Nezha, who easily saw the trickery, stabbed his spear at Randeng Daoren; Randeng Daoren easily negated his spear by forming a large white lotus from his own mouth. Once Nezha attempted to attack Randeng Daoren once again, Randeng Daoren had no choice but to unleash a purple cloud from his sleeve—a purple cloud that would trap Nezha within a large burning golden tower. Following this, Randeng Daoren could effectively control Nezha. However, he decided it best to give the teach the technique to Li Jing less Nezha rebels again. Thus, Randeng Daoren takes his leave after ensuring the [[Zhou Dynasty]] into the trust of Li Jing, who is now Li, the Pagoda Bearer.

The Burning-Lamp Taoist sometimes appears as a [[door god]] in [[Chinese temple|Chinese]] and [[Taoist temple]]s, usually in partnership with [[Caishen]].

'''Religion in France''' can attribute its diversity to the country's adherence to [[freedom of religion]] and freedom of thought, as guaranteed by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. The [[French Fifth Republic|Republic]] is based on the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' (or "freedom of conscience") enforced by the 1880s [[Jules Ferry laws]] and the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]]. [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], the religion of a now small majority of French people, is no longer the [[state religion]] that it was before the [[French Revolution]], as well as throughout the various, non-republican regimes of the 19th century (the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]], the [[July Monarchy]] and the [[Second French Empire]]).

Major religions practised in [[France]] include the [[Catholic Church]],  [[Islam]], various branches of [[Protestantism]],  [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christianity]], and [[Sikhism]]  amongst others, making it a multiconfessional country. Sunday mass attendance has fallen to 5% for the Catholics, and the overall level of observance is considerably lower than in the past.&lt;ref name=usatraif&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Noelle|title=Religion takes a back seat in Western Europe|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-08-10-europe-religion-cover_x.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=11 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vicaif&gt;{{cite web|title=France – church attendance|url=http://viaintegra.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/france-church-attendance-2/|work=France – church attendance|publisher=Via Integra|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Eurobarometer]] survey conducted in 2010, 27% of French citizens responded that they "believe there is a God", 27% answered that they "believe there is some sort of spirit or life force", and 40% answered that they "do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force". This makes France one of the most [[irreligion|irreligious]] countries in the world.&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER-1&gt;{{cite article|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf|title=Eurobarometer on Biotechnology|work=Special Eurobarometer|number=341|date=October 2010|publisher=European Commission|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survey data ===
In 2017, the [[Pew Research Center]] found in their ''Global Attitutes Survey'' that 54.2% of the French regarded themselves as Christians, with 47.4% belonging to the Catholic Church, 3.6% were Unaffiliated Christians, 2.2% were Protestants, 1.0% were Eastern Orthodox. Unaffiliated people were the 37.8% divided in 24.8% Atheists, 8.2% nothing in particular and 4.8% Agnostics. Muslims were the 5.0%, Jews comprised the 0.4% and members of other religions were the 1.4%. 1.1% was either undecided or didn't answer the question. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/dataset/spring-2017-survey-data/|title=Spring 2017 Survey Data {{!}} Pew Research Center|website=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[Eurobarometer]], a survey funded by the [[European Union]], found that Christianity was the religion of 54.3% of the respondents, with Catholicism being the main denomination with 47.8%, followed by other Christians with 4.1%, Protestants with 1.8% and the Eastern Orthodox with 0.6%. Muslims were found to comprise the 3.3%, Jews were the 0.4% and members of other religions were the 1.0%.

====Religion among the youth====
In 2018, a study by the French polling agency ''OpinionWay'', based on a sample of 1.000, found that 41% of 18 to 30 years old Frenchmen declared themselves as Catholics, 3% as Protestants, 8% as Muslim, 1% were Buddhists, 1% were Jews and 3% were affiliated with other religions, 43% regarded themselves as unaffiliated. Regarding their belief of God, 52% believed that the existence of God to be certain or probable, whilst 28% believed it to be improbable and 19% regarded it as excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.la-croix.com/Religion/Catholicisme/France/Dieu-existe-majorite-jeunes-Francais-2018-03-23-1200925742|title=Dieu existe, pour la majorité des jeunes Français|last=La-Croix.com|date=2018-03-23|website=La Croix|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of France}}
France guarantees [[freedom of religion]] as a constitutional right and the government generally respects this right in practice.  A tradition of anticlericalism led the state to break its ties to the Catholic Church in 1905 and adopt a strong commitment to maintaining a totally secular public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baubérot|first=Jean|url=http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp|title=The Secular Principle|publisher=Embassy of France in the US|date=15 March 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222013645/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp|archivedate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism as a state religion===
Catholicism is the largest religion in France. During the pre-1789 ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', France was traditionally considered the Church's eldest daughter, and the [[King of France]] always maintained close links to the Pope.  However, the "[[Gallicanism]]" principle meant that the king selected bishops.

==== French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) ====
{{Main|French Wars of Religion}}
A strong Protestant population resided in France, primarily of [[Reformed]] confession. It was persecuted by the state for most of the time, with temporary periods of relative toleration. These wars continued throughout the 16th century, with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as its apex, until the 1598 [[Edict of Nantes]] issued by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].

For the first time, [[Huguenots]] were considered by the state as more than mere heretics. The Edict of Nantes thus opened a path for [[secularism]] and tolerance. In offering general [[freedom of conscience]] to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, for instance, amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field or for the State and to bring grievances directly to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Whelan, and Carol Baxter, eds. ''Toleration and religious identity: the Edict of Nantes and its implications in France, Britain and Ireland'' (Four Courts PressLtd, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post–Edict of Nantes (1598–1789) ====
[[File:Protestant France.svg|thumb|Expanse of Protestantism in France during the 16th century. Purple: [[Huguenot]]-controlled domains; purple-lavender: territories contested by Huguenot and Catholic factions; blue-lavender: domains with a large [[Lutheran]] population, then in the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]].]]
The 1598 Edict also granted the Protestants fifty&lt;!--or one hundred?--&gt; places of safety (''places de sûreté''), which were military strongholds such as [[La Rochelle]] for which the king paid 180,000 écus a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (''places de refuge''), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense.  Such an innovative act of toleration stood virtually alone in a Europe (except for the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) where standard practice forced the subjects of a ruler to follow whatever religion that the ruler formally adopted – the application of the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.

Religious conflicts resumed in the end of the 17th century, when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the "Sun King", initiated the persecution of Huguenots by introducing the ''[[dragonnade]]s'' in 1681. This wave of violence intimidated the Protestants into converting to Catholicism. He made the policy official with the 1685 [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]. As a result, a large number of Protestants – estimates range from 200,000 to 500,000 – left France during the following two decades, seeking [[refugee|asylum]] in England, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], Denmark, in the Protestant states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ([[Hesse]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], etc.), and European colonies in [[European colonization of the Americas|North America]] and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson J.|authorlink=Jackson J. Spielvogel|title=Western Civilization – Volume II: Since 1500|edition=5th|year=2003|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1685 revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] created a state of affairs in France similar to that of virtually every other European country of the period, where only the majority state religion was tolerated.  The experiment of religious toleration in Europe was effectively ended for the time being. In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a [[brain drain]], as it lost a large number of skilled craftsmen, including key designers such as [[Daniel Marot]].&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Joutard,  "The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes: End or Renewal of French Protestantism?." in  Menna Prestwich, ed., ''International Calvinism 1541-1715'' (1985): 1541-1715.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
{{further|Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution}}
During the French Revolution, the Catholic Church was stripped of most of its wealth, its power and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Betros, "The French Revolution and the Catholic Church" '' History Review'' (Dec 2010), Issue 68 pp 16-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The early revolutionaries sought to secularize all of French society, an effort inspired by the writings and philosophy of [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Gliozzo,  "The Philosophes and Religion: Intellectual Origins of the Dechristianization Movement in the French Revolution." ''Church History'' (1971). 40#3 275+. [https://www.jstor.org.du.idm.oclc.org/stable/3163003. online]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1789, the new [[National Assembly]] abolished [[tithes]], the mandatory 10% tax paid to the Catholic Church. In November 1789, they voted to expropriate the vast wealth of the Church in endowments, lands and buildings.&lt;ref name=Popkin&gt;Popkin, Jeremy D (2015). ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. Sixth ed. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, the Assembly abolished monastic religious orders. Statues and saints were rejected in a burst of iconoclasm, and most religious instruction ended.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Idzerda, "Iconoclasm during the French Revolution." ''American Historical Review'' (1954) 60#1: 13-26. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1842743 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, put the Catholic Church under state control. It required priests and bishops to be elected by French people, which usurped the traditional authority of the Church.  The Republic legalized divorce and transferred the powers of birth, death, and marriage registration to the state.&lt;ref name=Popkin/&gt;  The Catholic clergy was persecuted by the commune of Paris and by some of the [[Représentant en mission|representatives on mission]]. Most notably, [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]] conducted large-scale drownings of priests and nuns in the river [[Loire]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer,. ''Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution'' (1941) pp 220-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, the government established a secular [[French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar]] to erase memory of Sundays, saint days and religious holidays. Traditionally, every seventh day – Sunday – was a day of rest, together with numerous other days for celebration and relaxation. The government tried to end all that; the new calendar only allowed one day in 10 for relaxation. Workers and peasants felt cheated and overworked. The new system disrupted daily routines, reduced work-free  days and ended favorite celebrations. When the reformers were overthrown or executed, their radical new calendar was quickly abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Sanja Perovic, "The French Republican Calendar: Time, History and the Revolutionary Event." ''Journal for Eighteenth‐Century Studies'' 35.1 (2012): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zerubavel, Eviatar. "The French Republican Calendar: a case study in the sociology of time." ''American Sociological Review'' (1977) 42#6: 868-877. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2094573 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious minorities—Protestants and Jews—were granted full civil and political rights, which represented a shift towards a more secular government to some, and an attack on the Catholic Church to others.&lt;ref name=Popkin /&gt; New religions and philosophies were allowed to compete with Catholicism. The introduction of the prominent cults during the revolutionary period – the [[Cult of Reason]] and the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] – responded to the belief that religion and politics should be seamlessly fused together. This is a shift from the original [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of the Revolution that advocated for a secular government with tolerance for various religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=Stevenson&gt;Stevenson, Shandi (2013). "Religions of Revolution: The Merging of Religious and Political in the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme being in France 1793–1794." Order No. 1524274, California State University, Dominguez Hills, 2013. https://search-proquest-com.du.idm.oclc.org/docview/1461390217?accountid=14608.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Maximilien Robespierre]] favored a religious foundation to the [[French First Republic|Republic]], he maintained a hard stance against Catholicism because of its association with corruption and the [[Counter-revolutionary|counterrevolution]].&lt;ref name=Popkin /&gt;

The cults sought to erase the old ways of religion by closing churches, confiscating church bells, and implementing a new Republican Calendar that excluded any days for religious practice. Many churches were converted into [[Temple of Reason|Temples of Reason]]. The Cult of Reason was first to de-emphasize the existence of God, and instead focus on deism, featuring not the sacred, divine, nor eternal, but the natural, earthy, and temporal existence.&lt;ref name=Stevenson /&gt; To tie the church and the state together, the cults transformed traditional religious ideology into politics. The Cult of the Supreme Being used religion as political leverage. Robespierre accused political opponents as hiding behind God and using religion to justify their oppositional stance against the Revolution. It was a shift in ideology that allowed for the cult to use the new deistic beliefs for political momentum.&lt;ref name=Stevenson /&gt;

Following the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] the persecutions of Catholic clergy ceased and the role of new cults practically ended.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Napoleon and concordat with the Vatican===
{{Main|Concordat of 1801}}

The Catholic Church was badly hurt by the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Betros, "The French Revolution and the Catholic Church." ''History Review'' 68 (2010): 16-21.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1800 it was poor, dilapidated and disorganized, with a depleted and aging clergy. The younger generation had received little religious instruction, and was unfamiliar with traditional worship. However, in response to the external pressures of foreign wars, religious fervor was strong, especially among women.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tombs, ''France: 1814-1914'' (1996) p 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon took control by 1800  and realized that religious divisiveness had to be minimized to unite France.  The Concordat of 1801 was an agreement between Napoleon and Pope [[Pius VII]], signed in July 1801  that remained in effect until 1905. It sought national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics and solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France, with most of its civil status restored. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had then largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized upon during the revolution and sold off. Catholic clergy returned from exile, or from hiding, and resumed their traditional positions in their traditional churches. Very few parishes continued to employ the priests who had accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of the Revolutionary regime. While the Concordat restored much power to the papacy, the balance of church-state relations tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour. He selected the bishops and supervised church finances.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Aston, ''Religion and revolution in France, 1780-1804'' (Catholic University of America Press, 2000) pp 279-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bourbon Restoration (1814-1830)===
With the [[Bourbon Restoration]] and  the Catholic Church again became the [[state religion]] of France. Other religion was tolerated, but Catholicism was favored financially and politically.  Its lands and financial endowments were not returned, but now the government paid salaries and maintenance costs for normal church activities. The bishops had regained control of Catholic affairs.  The aristocracy before the Revolution did not place a high priority on religious doctrine or practice, the decades of exile created an alliance of throne and altar. The royalists who returned were much more devout, and much more aware of their need for a close alliance with the Church. They had discarded fashionable skepticism and now promoted the wave of Catholic religiosity that was sweeping Europe, with a new regard to the Virgin Mary, the Saints, and popular religious rituals such as saying the rosary. Devotionalism and was  far stronger in rural areas, and much less noticeable in Paris and the other cities. The population of 32 million included about 680,000 Protestants, and 60,000 Jews. They were tolerated. Anti-clericalism  of the sort promoted by the Enlightenment and writers such as Voltaire had not disappeared, but it was in recession.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''France under the Bourbon Restoration, 1814-1830'' (1931) pp 99-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elite level, there was a dramatic change in intellectual climate from the dry intellectually oriented classicism to emotionally based [[romanticism]].  A book by [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] entitled ''[[The Genius of Christianity|Génie du christianisme]]'' ("The Genius of Christianity") (1802) had an enormous influence in reshaping French literature and intellectual life.  The book emphasized the power of religion in creating European high culture. Chateaubriand’s book:
:did more than any other single work to restore the credibility and prestige of Christianity in intellectual circles and launched a fashionable rediscovery of the Middle Ages and their Christian civilisation. The revival was by no means confined to an intellectual elite, however, but was evident in the real, if uneven, rechristianisation of the French countryside.&lt;ref&gt;James McMillan,  "Catholic Christianity in France from the Restoration to the separation of church and state, 1815-1905." in Sheridan Gilley and Brian Stanley, eds., ''The Cambridge history of Christianity'' (2014) 8: 217-232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoleon III 1848-1870===
[[Napoleon III]] was a strong supporter of Catholic interest, such as financing, and support for Catholic missionaries in the emerging French Empire. His primary goal was conciliation of all the religious and anti-religious interests in France, to avoid the furious hatreds and battles that took place during the revolution, and that would reappear after he left office.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Isser, "Protestants and Proselytization During the Second French Empire." ''Journal of Church and State'' 30.1 (1988): 51-70. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23917715 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger L. Williams, ''Gaslight and Shadow the World of Napoleon III 1851 1870'' (1957), pp 70-96, 194-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy, he was the leading supporter of the Pope, especially against the anti-clerical Kingdom of Italy that emerged in 1860, took control of parts of the papal states, and sought to take complete control of Rome. The French army prevented that. In Paris, the Emperor was supported the conservative Gallican bishops to minimize the people role inside France, in the liberal Catholic intellectuals who wanted to use the Church as an instrument of reform. Problem came with Pope [[Pius IX]] who reigned 1846 to 1878. He began as a liberal, but suddenly in the 1860s became the leading champion of reactionary politics in Europe, in opposition to all forms of modern liberalism. He demanded complete autonomy for the church and religious and educational affairs, and had the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–70) decree [[papal infallibility]]. Napoleon III was too committed in foreign-policy to the support of Rome to break with the Pope, but that alliance seriously weakened him at home. When he declared war on Prussia in 1870, he brought his army home, and the kingdom of Italy swallowed up the papal domains and the Pope became the prisoner of the Vatican. Vatican statements attacking progress, industrialization, capitalism, socialism, and virtually every new idea not only angered the liberal and conservative Catholic elements in France, but energized the secular liberals (including many professionals)  and anti-clerical socialist movement; they escalated their attacks on church schools.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848-1945: volume II: Intellect, Taste and Anxiety'' (1977) pp 986-1015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Republic (1870–1940)===
{{further|French Third Republic}}
Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic (1870–1940), there were battles over the status of the [[Catholic Church in France]] among the republicans, monarchists and the authoritarians (such as the Napoleonists). The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] middle class, who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The republicans detested the Church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the Church represented the [[Ancien Régime]], a time in French history most republicans hoped was long behind them.  The republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support.  Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals; in 1882, the [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry school laws]] were passed. [[1801 Concordat|Napoleon's Concordat of 1801]] continued in operation, but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=Rigoulot |title=Protestants and the French nation under the Third Republic: Between recognition and assimilation |journal=National Identities |year=2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=45–57 |doi=10.1080/14608940802680961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans feared that religious orders in control of schools—especially the [[Jesuit]]s and [[Assumptionist]]s—indoctrinated anti-republicanism into children. Determined to root this out, republicans insisted they needed control of the schools for France to achieve economic and militaristic progress. (Republicans felt one of the primary reasons for the German victory in 1870 was their superior education system.)

The early anti-Catholic laws were largely the work of republican [[Jules Ferry]] in 1882. Religious instruction in all schools was forbidden, and religious orders were forbidden to teach in them. Funds were appropriated from religious schools to build more state schools. Later in the century, other laws passed by Ferry's successors further weakened the Church's position in French society. Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced, and chaplains were removed from the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Patrick J. |last=Harrigan |title=Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment |journal=Canadian Journal of History |year=2001 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=51–83 |doi= |url=http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/view/10994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leo XIII]] became pope in 1878, he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884, he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner toward the State ('Nobilissima Gallorum Gens'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_08021884_nobilissima-gallorum-gens.html |title=Leo XIII – Nobilissima Gallorum Gens |work=vatican.va }} (full text)&lt;/ref&gt;).
In 1892, he issued an [[encyclical]] advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in republican politics ('Au milieu des sollicitudes'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_16021892_au-milieu-des-sollicitudes.html |title=Leo XIII – Au milieu des sollicitudes |work=vatican.va |accessdate= }} (full text)&lt;/ref&gt;).
This attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the [[Dreyfus Affair]] (1894–1906). Catholics were for the most part anti-Dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal [[La Croix]]. This infuriated republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with [[Masonic lodge]]s. The [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry]] (1899–1902) and the [[Émile Combes|Combes Ministry (1902–05)]] fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals in the years 1903 and 1904, and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs in 1904.

[[Emile Combes]], when elected Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to defeat Catholicism thoroughly. After only a short while in office, he closed down all [[parochial school]]s in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty-four orders in France were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Tallett |first2=Nicholas |last2=Atkin |authorlink2=Nicholas Atkin |title=Religion, society, and politics in France since 1789 |location=London |publisher=Hambledon Press |year=1991 |isbn=1-85285-057-4 |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Combes government worked with Masonic lodges to create a secret surveillance of all army officers to make sure that devout Catholics would not be promoted. Exposed as the [[Affaire Des Fiches]], the scandal undermined support for the Combes government, and he resigned.  It also undermined morale in the army, as officers realized that hostile spies examining their private lives were more important to their careers than their own professional accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |authorlink=Douglas Porch |title=The March to the Marne: The French Army 1871–1914 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-54592-7 |pages=92–104 }}, is the most thorough account in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1905: Separation of Church and State ====
{{Main|1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State}}
Radicals (as they called themselves) achieved their main goals in 1905: they repealed Napoleon's [[1801 Concordat]]. Church and State were finally separated.  All Church property was confiscated. Religious personnel were no longer paid by the State. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. However, in practice, masses and rituals continued to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Larkin, ''Church and state after the Dreyfus affair: The separation issue in France'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] instituted the [[separation of Church and State]] and prohibited the government from recognising, salarying, or subsidising any religion. The 1926 [[Briand-Ceretti Agreement]] subsequently restored for a while a formal role for the state in the appointment of Catholic bishops, but evidence for its exercise is not easily obtained. Prior to 1905, the 1801–1808 [[Concordat of 1801|Concordat]] compelled the State to support the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheran Church]], the [[Calvinist Church]], and the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]], and to fund public religious education in those established religions.

For historical reasons, this situation is still current in [[Alsace-Moselle]], which was a German region in 1905 and only joined France again in 1918. Alsace-Moselle maintains a [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] of pre-1918 statutes which include the [[Concordat in Alsace-Moselle|Concordat]]: the national government salaries  as state civil servants the clergy of the Catholic [[diocese of Metz]] and [[Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], of the Lutheran [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine]], of the [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]], and of the three regional [[consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]], and it provides for now non-compulsory religious education in those religions in public schools and universities.  For also historical reasons, Catholic priests in [[French Guiana]] are civil servants of the local government.

Religious buildings built prior to 1905 at taxpayers' expense are retained by the local or national government, and may be used at no expense by religious organisations.  As a consequence, most Catholic churches, Protestant temples, and Jewish synagogues are owned and maintained by the government. The government, since 1905, has been prohibited from funding any post-1905 religious edifice, and thus religions must build and support all newer religious buildings at their own expense.  Some local governments ''de facto'' subsidise prayer rooms as part of greater "cultural associations".

===Recent tensions===
{{main|2005 civil unrest in France|2009 French riots|Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Charlie Hebdo shooting|November 2015 Paris attacks}}
An ongoing topic of controversy is whether the separation of Church and State should be weakened so that the government would be able to subsidise Muslim prayer rooms and the formation of [[imam]]s.  Advocates of such measures, such as [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] at times, declare that they would encourage the Muslim population to better integrate into the fabric of French society. Opponents contend that the state should not fund religions. Furthermore, the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|state ban]] on wearing conspicuous religious symbols, such as the Islamic female [[headscarf]], in public schools has alienated some French Muslims, provoked minor street protests and drawn some international criticism.

In the late 1950s after the close of the Algerian war, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including some who had supported France ([[Harkis]]), settled permanently to France. They went to the larger cities where they lived in subsidized public housing, and suffered very high unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad and Michael J.

American University professor C. Schneider says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the next three convulsive weeks, riots spread from suburb to suburb, affecting more than three hundred towns....Nine thousand vehicles were torched, hundreds of public and commercial buildings destroyed, four thousand rioters arrested, and 125 police officers wounded.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;Cathy Lisa Schneider, "Police Power and Race Riots in Paris," ''Politics &amp; Society'' (2008) 36#1 pp 133–159 on p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2012, a Muslim radical named [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Mohammed Merah]] shot three French soldiers and four Jewish citizens, including children in [[Toulouse]] and [[Montauban]].

In January 2015, the satirical newspaper [[Charlie Hebdo]] that had ridiculed the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and a neighborhood Jewish grocery store came under [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|attack]] from radicalized Muslims who had been born and raised in the Paris region.  World leaders rally to Paris to show their support for free speech.  Analysts agree that the episode had a profound impact on France.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized the ongoing debate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So as France grieves, it is also faced with profound questions about its future: How large is the radicalized part of the country's Muslim population, the largest in Europe?

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism in France}}

In 2016, ''Ipsos Global Trends'', a multi-nation survey held by Ipsos and based on approximately 1,000 interviews, found that Christianity is the religion of 45% of the working-age, internet connected population of France; 42% stated they were Catholic, 2% stated that they were Protestants, and 1% declared to belong to any Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017" /&gt;

====Catholicism====
[[File:Rampillon Saint-Éliphe 499.JPG|thumb|Saint Éliphe Church in [[Rampillon]], [[Seine-et-Marne]].]]
{{Main|Catholic Church in France}}
[[Early Christianity]] was already present among the [[Gauls]] by the 2nd century; [[Irenaeus]], [[bishop of Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]), detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop [[Saint Pothinus|Pothinus]] and other martyrs during the [[persecution in Lyon]] which took place in 177. The Gaulish church was soon established in communion with the [[bishop of Rome]]. With the [[Migration Period]] of the [[Germanic peoples]], the Gauls were invaded by the [[Franks]], who at first practised [[Frankish paganism]]. Their tribes were unified into a kingdom, which came to be called [[Francia|France]], by [[Clovis I]]. He was proclaimed the [[king of the Franks]] in 509, after having been baptised in 496 by [[Saint Remigius|Remigius]], [[bishop of Reims]]. Roman Catholicism was made the state religion of France. This made the Franks the only Germanic people who directly converted from their paganism to Roman Catholicism without first embracing [[Arianism]], which was the first religion of choice among Germanic peoples in the Migration Period.

In 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]] as the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], forming the unified political and religious foundation of [[Christendom]], medieval European Christian civilisation, and establishing in earnest France's long historical association with the Catholic Church, for which it was known as the "eldest daughter of the church" throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france|title=France|work=Resources on Faith, Ethics and Public Life|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120832/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france|archive-date=10 May 2013}} See drop-down essay on "Religion and Politics until the French Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Revolution]] (1789–1790), which resulted in the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] (1792–1804), involved a heavy persecution of the Catholic Church, within a policy of [[dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|dechristianisation]], which led to the destruction of many churches, religious orders and artworks, including the very influential [[Cluny Abbey]]. During the [[First French Empire]] (1804–1814), the [[Bourbon Restoration]] (1814–1830) and the following [[July Monarchy]] (1830–1848), Roman Catholicism was made again the state religion, and maintained its role as the ''de facto'' majority religion during the [[Second French Republic]] (1848–1852) and the [[Second French Empire]] (1852–1870). ''[[Laïcité]]'' (secularism), absolute neutrality of the state with respect to religious doctrines, was first established during the [[Third French Republic]] (1870–1940), codified with the 1905 Law on the Separation of Church and State, and remains the official policy of the contemporary French republic.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"/&gt;

In a 2016 study sponsored by two Catholic newspapers, the scholars Cleuziou and Cibois estimated that Catholics represented 53.8% of the French population. According to the same study, 23.5% were engaged Catholics and 17% were practising Catholics.&lt;ref name="Bayard-Ipsos2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Une enquête inédite dresse le portrait des catholiques de France, loin des clichés |publisher=Le Monde |author=Cécile Chambraud |date=12 January 2017 |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/religions/article/2017/01/12/une-enquete-inedite-dresse-le-portrait-des-catholiques-de-france-loin-des-cliches_5061270_1653130.html |trans-title=An unprecedented survey portrays Catholics in France, far from clichés |accessdate=15 September 2017 |language=fr-FR}} The researchers are Yann Raison du Cleuziou, senior lecturer in political science at the University of Bordeaux, and Philippe Cibois, professor emeritus of sociology.

====Protestantism====
{{Main|Protestantism in France}}
According to a survey by Ifop, in 2012 770 people out of the 37,743 interviewed (or 2.1%) declared to be Protestants of various types. About 42% of them were [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] ([[Huguenots]]), 21% were [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestants]], 17% were [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and another 20% were affiliated with other Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fourquet|first=Jérôme|date=July 2012|title=Enquête auprès des protestants|trans-title=Inquiry about the Protestants|url=http://www.ifop.fr/media/poll/2074-1-study_file.pdf|publisher=Institut français d'opinion publique|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage rose to 3.1% in 2017, mainly due to recent conversions. Out of 100% of people that have become Protestants, 67% were Catholic and 27% were of no religion.&lt;ref name=reforme2017/&gt;

In a study regarding the various religions of France, based on 51 surveys held by the Ifop in the period 2011-2014, so based on a sample of 51.770 interviewed, there were 17.4% of Protestants in the [[Bas-Rhin]], 7.3% in the [[Haut-Rhin]], 7.2% in the [[Gard]], 6.8% in the [[Drôme]] and 4.2% in the [[Ardèche]].

{{Main|Eastern Orthodoxy in France}}
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in France is represented by several communities and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Traditionally, Eastern Orthodox Christians in France are mainly ethnic Greeks, Russians, Romanians, Bulgarians, Serbs and Georgians, but there are also some ethnic French converts to Eastern Orthodoxy. Different Eastern Orthodox churches have separate jurisdictions and organisations in France, the oldest among them being the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assemblée des évêques orthodoxes de France|url=http://www.aeof.fr/site/239/eveques.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|French Coptic Orthodox Church}}
[[Oriental Orthodox]] Christianity in France is represented by several communities and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Traditionally, Oriental Orthodox Christians in France are mainly ethnic Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians and Syriacs, but there are also French converts. The largest Oriental Orthodox church in France is the [[French Coptic Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eocf.free.fr/eglisep_eng.htm|title=French Coptic Orthodox Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Christians====
[[File:Église Jésus Christ Sts Derniers Jours Gex 3.jpg|thumb|Mormon meetinghouse in [[Gex, Ain|Gex]], [[Ain]].]]
Other Christian groups in France include the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Mormonism|Mormons]], and other small sects. The [[European Court on Human Rights]] reckoned 249,918 "regular and occasional" Jehovah's Witnesses in France&lt;ref name="ECHR"&gt;{{cite article|title=Fédération Chrétienne des Témoins de Jéhovah de France v. France|work=Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2001|volume=XI|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-23238}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to their official website, there are 128,759 ministers who teach the Bible in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/worldwide/FR/|title=France: How Many Jehovah’s Witnesses Are There?|work=JW.ORG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Islam in France}}
A 2016 survey held by Institut Montaigne and Ifop found that 6.6% of the French population had an Islamic background, while 5.6% declared they were Muslims by faith. According to the same survey, 84.9% of the French people who had an Islamic background were still Muslims, 3.4% were Christians, 10.0% were not religious and 1.3% belonged to other religions.&lt;ref name="2016Montaigne-IFOP"/&gt;

In the same year, Ipsos found that just 2% of the working-age, internet connected French declared they were Muslims.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017" /&gt; This gap is most likely due to the difference of the samples, since the survey held by the Institut Montaigne and the Institut français d'opinion publique has a total sample of 15,459 people, while the [[Ipsos]] Global Trends survey has a sample of only about 1,000, so the [[margin of error]] is bigger.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2016, 0.8% of the total population of France, or about 535.000 people, were religious Jews.&lt;ref name="2016Montaigne-IFOP"/&gt; There has been a Jewish presence in France since at least the [[early Middle Ages]]. France was a center of Jewish learning in the Middle Ages, but [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] increased as the Middle Ages wore on, including multiple expulsions and returns. During the late 18th-century [[French Revolution]], France was the first country in Europe to [[Jewish emancipation|emancipate its Jewish population]]. [[Antisemitism]] persisted despite legal equality, as expressed in the [[Dreyfus affair]] of the late 19th century.

During [[World War II]], the Vichy government collaborated with Nazi occupiers to deport numerous French and foreign Jewish refugees to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005429|title=France|encyclopedia=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of the Jewish population in France nonetheless survived the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="bseditions.fr"&gt;{{cite web|website=BS Encyclopédie|url=http://www.encyclopedie.bseditions.fr/article.php?pArticleId=158&amp;pChapitreId=23982&amp;pArticleLib=Le+Bilan+de+la+Shoah+en+France+%5BLe+r%E9gime+de+Vichy%5D|title=Le Bilan de la Shoah en France (Le régime de Vichy)|trans-title=The Report of the Holocaust in France (The Vichy regime)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/yv/en/education/languages/dutch/pdf/article_croes.pdf|last=Croes|first=Marnix|title=The Holocaust in the Netherlands and the Rate of Jewish Survival|journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies|volume=20|number=3|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/hgs/dcl022|pages=474–499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paganism ===
[[File:Le Scouezec.jpg|thumb|[[Gwenc'hlan Le Scouëzec]], Grand Druid of Brittany and France from 1980 to 2008.]]
[[Paganism]], in the sense of contemporary [[Neopaganism]], in France has been described as twofold, on one side represented by ethnically identitary religious movements and on the other side by a variety of witchcraft and [[shamanism|shamanic]] traditions without ethnic connotations. According to the French historian of ideas and far-right ideologies Stéphane François, the term "pagan" (Latin ''paganus''), used by Christians to define those who maintained polytheistic religions, originally meant "countryman" in the sense of "citizen", the "insiders" (inside the cultural tradition or citizenry), and its opposite term was "alien" (Latin ''alienus''), the "others", the "outsiders", which defined Christians. Modern French Pagans of the identitary movements hearken back to this meaning.&lt;ref name=Ducré&gt;{{cite web|last=Ducré|first=Léa|date=26 March 2014|url=http://www.lemondedesreligions.fr/savoir/les-deux-visages-du-neopaganisme-francais-26-03-2014-3797_110.php|title=Les deux visages du néopaganisme français|trans-title=The two faces of French Neopaganism|publisher=Le Monde des Religions|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identitary Pagan movements are the majority and are represented by [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Druidry (modern)|Druidry]] and [[Germanic Heathenry]], many of whom uphold the idea of a superiority of the white race and of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]. They are aligned with the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' political movement, espousing the idea that each ethnically-defined folk has its own natural land and natural religion. The identitary Pagan movement carries within itself a warrior ethic which is concerned with the erosion of French and European culture under growing immigration and [[Islamisation]], so that Jean Haudry, longtime identitary Pagan and professor of linguistics at [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], in a 2001 article entitled ''Païens !'' for the journal of the organisation ''Terre et Peuple'' says that "Pagans will be at the forefront of the reconquest (of Europe)". [[Dominique Venner]], who committed suicide in 2013 inside [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] in protest against the erosion of French culture, was a Pagan&lt;ref name=Ducré/&gt; close to the [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]] (GRECE), an identitary Pagan think-tank founded by the ''Nouvelle Droite'' ideologist [[Alain de Benoist]]. Other politically-engaged Pagans include Pierre Vial, who with other members of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] was among the founders of ''Terre et Peuple''.&lt;ref name=Ducré/&gt;

==Controversies and incidents==
===Growth of Islam and conflict with ''laïcité''===
[[File:Wasselonne carré musulman cimetière catholique.png|thumb|Islamic grave at a French cemetery.]]
In Paris and the surrounding [[Île-de-France]] region French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, and the vast majority of them rejects violence and say they are loyal to France.&lt;ref name="euro-islam.info"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tajuddin|first=Razia|url=http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/city-profiles/paris/|title=Islam in Paris|publisher=Euro-Islam: News and Analysis on Islam in Europe and North America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104112728/http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/city-profiles/paris/|archive-date=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Juan|url=http://www.juancole.com/2015/01/sharpening-contradictions-satirists.html|title=Sharpening Contradictions: Why al-Qaeda attacked Satirists in Paris|website=Informed Comment|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Muslims in Paris, in the early 2010s, 77% disagreed when asked whether violence is an acceptable moral response for a noble cause or not; 73% said that they were loyal to France; and 18% believed homosexuality to be acceptable.&lt;ref name="euro-islam.info"/&gt;

In 2015 there were 2,500 mosques in France, up from 2,000 in 2011. In 2015, [[Dalil Boubakeur]], rector of the [[Grand Mosque of Paris]], said the number should be doubled to accommodate the large and growing population of French Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Tim|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/french-muslim-leader-dalil-boubaker-calls-empty-catholic-churches-be-turned-into-mosques-1506417|title=French Muslim leader Dalil Boubaker calls for empty Catholic churches to be turned into mosques|newspaper=International Business Time|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing to the construction of mosques was a problematic issue for a long time; French authorities were concerned that foreign capital could be used to acquire influence in France and so in the late 1980s it was decided to favour the formation of a "French Islam", though the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law on religions]] forbids the funding of religious groups by the state. According to Salah Bariki, advisor to the mayor of Marseille in 2001, at a Koranic school in Nièvre only three percent of the books were written in French and everything was financed from abroad. She supported the public participation in financing an Islamic cultural centre in Marseille to encourage Muslims to develop and use French learning materials, in order to thwart foreign indoctrination. Even secular Muslims and actors of civil society were to be represented by the centre.&lt;ref name="UA"&gt;{{cite article|last=Maussen|first=M. J. M.|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/124687|title=Constructing mosques: The governance of Islam in France and the Netherlands|publisher=UvA-DARE (Digital Academic Repository), University of Amsterdam|year=2009|pages=155, 186, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities have financed the construction of mosques, sometimes without minarets and calling them Islamic "cultural centres" or municipal halls rented to "civil associations". In the case of the plans to build the Mosque of Marseille, due to protests and tribunal decision by the [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]], the [[National Republican Movement]], and the [[Mouvement pour la France]], the rent of a {{convert|8000|m²|0|abbr=on}} terrain for the mosque was increased from €300/year to €24,000/year and the renting period was reduced from 99 to 50 years.&lt;ref name="UA"/&gt;

===''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting===
After the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|shooting at the ''Charlie Hebdo'']] satirical newspaper by [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|Al-Qaeda's followers]], two million people in Paris, including President Hollande, and more than forty world leaders led a rally of national unity. One teacher in [[Clichy-sous-Bois]], a suburb with many immigrants, reported that three quarters of the students had refused to observe the minute of silence in memory of the victims of the attack.&lt;ref name="NYT2015"&gt;{{cite news|last=De la Baume|first=Maïa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-attack-leads-to-changes-in-french-schools.html|title=Paris Announces Plan to Promote Secular Values|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 January 2015|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been about two hundred incidents in schools after the attack, some of them "glorifying terrorism".&lt;ref name="NYT2015"/&gt; In [[Bobigny]], a suburb of Paris, a couple of students grunted ''[[Allahu Akbar]]'' during the minute of silence, the same words that were shouted by the terrorists during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150112-france-teachers-charlie-hebdo-tragedy-students-challenge/|title=Teachers face difficult test in wake of Charlie Hebdo tragedy|publisher=France 24|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qatar]] is a multi-religious society like most of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]] with waves of migration over the last 30 years, [[Muslims]] form 67.7% of the Qatari population, [[Christians]] make up 13.8% and [[Hindus]] make up 13.8% followed by [[Buddhists]] at 3.1% of the overall population, 0.7% follow other religions and 0.9% are unaffiliated to any religion, Qatar is also home to numerous other religions mostly from the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=pewrel&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Composition by Country|url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-tables.pdf|work=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qatar has also hosted numerous interfaith dialogue conferences.

== Islam ==
{{Main|Islam in Qatar}} 
The state religion in [[Qatar]] is Islam.&lt;ref name="state2007"/&gt; Most Qataris belong to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni sect]] of Islam.&lt;ref name=wahh&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiny Qatar's growing global clout|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13229852|publisher=BBC|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insom&gt;{{cite news|title=Qatar's modern future rubs up against conservative traditions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/27/uk-qatar-modernism-idUSLNE88Q00D20120927|publisher=Reuters | date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=risingreuters&gt;{{cite news|title=Rising power Qatar stirs unease among some Mideast neighbors|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/12/us-qatar-neighbours-idUSBRE91B0R920130212|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 June 2013|date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] comprise around 10% of Qatar's Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/10/Shiarange.pdf|title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population|publisher=Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=October 2009|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious policy is set by the [[Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs (Qatar)|Ministry of Islamic Affairs]] and Islamic instruction is compulsory for Muslims in all state-sponsored schools.&lt;ref name="state2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90219.htm |title=Qatar |publisher=State |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state mosque is the [[Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque |Mohammed Bin Abdul Wahab mosque]], which is located in the [[Lejbailat]] neighbourhood and was designed by renowned Qatari architect Ibrahim Jaidah, drawing on traditional Qatari architecture.

The [[Fanar, Qatar Islamic Cultural Center|Fanar Islamic Center and Mosque]] is located in the [[Al Souq (Doha)|Al Souq]] neighbourhood of [[Doha]], adjacent to [[Souq Waqif]]. The center provides Arabic lessons to beginners and intermediate speakers.

At a tertiary level of education Islamic Studies is taught at [[Qatar University]], and at [[Hamad Bin Khalifa University]]’s (HBKU) Faculty of Islamic Studies where a master's degree is offered. Sheikha [[Moza bint Nasser]], the consort of the Father Emir and mother of current Emir, is the most notable graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/qatar/178/details/438029/class-of-2015-graduates-honoured |title=Class of 2015 graduates honoured |date=6 May 2015|publisher=Gulf Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Education City]] is also home to the Center for Islamic Legislation and Ethics [CILE], a think tank founded in 2012 and headed by [[Swiss]] political philosopher Professor [[Tariq Ramadan]], of [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cilecenter.org/en/about-us/ |title=CILE Center – about us|date=2012|publisher=CILE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam’s role in scientific discovery has also been an area of interest for the [[Qatar Foundation]], and recently, the Society for Muslim Scientists was established with prominent members. In 2010, the joint venture between [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] and Qatar Foundation began, which saw them publish the book, ‘Science in Islam’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/business/pr/bloomsbury-qatar-foundation-664538 |title=Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation publishing and delfina foundation announce winner of Arab writing residency programme|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Al Bawaba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Islam is not a feature of the Qatari system, with an absence of local [[Muslim Brotherhood]] societies.

== Christianity ==
{{Main|Christianity in Qatar}} 
The Christian community  in Qatar is a diverse mix of European, North and South American, Asian, Middle Eastern and African expatriates. They form around 15.8% of the total population (2010).&lt;ref name="Global Religious Landscape"&gt;[http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php Global Religious Landscape]. Pew Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; No foreign missionary groups operate openly in the country. In May 2005, the Qatari Government leased a piece of property on the outskirts of Doha to the representatives of Christian churches in the country for the construction of Church buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006 |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71430.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study estimates some 200 believers in Christ from a Muslim background, though not all of those are necessarily citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane Alexander|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion|date=2015|volume=11|page=17|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hinduism  ==
People of this beliefs are mainly from [[Nepal]], [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] mostly practice [[Hinduism]]. 11.3% of Qatar's population is Hindu.

== Buddhism ==
Buddhism is represented by 3.1% of the population of Qatar, mainly comprising migrant workers from South-East Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9980">An individual's or community's '''religious orientation''' involves [[presumption]]s about the existence and nature of God or gods, religious prescriptions about morality and communal and personal spirituality. Such presumptions involve the study of psychology, ethics, sociology and anthropology.

==Psychology==

According to Whitley and Kite, researchers who were interested in studying the psychological effects of religion on prejudice initially studied the relationship between simple indicators of religiosity such as whether or not a person went to church and the level of prejudice that that person showed. Surprisingly these researchers found that "religious involvement was consistently correlated with a variety of forms of prejudice." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;Whitley, B.E. &amp; Kite, M.E. (2010). The psychology of prejudice and discrimination. Belmont, CA. 	Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally these findings were not well received by religious leaders or the religious community in general. It was at this point that there was a clear shift in the nature of the research. Instead of being concerned with factors such as church attendance and the quantity of religious involvement, researchers were now interested in the quality of religious involvement. As Whitley and Kite said, "These ideas evolved into the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==

[[Gordon Allport|Allport]] &amp; Ross developed a means of measuring  religious orientation. The Extrinsic measures extrinsic religious orientation (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., &amp; Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious orientation and prejudice. Journal of 	Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-443.&lt;/ref&gt; A sample statement from this scale would be “The church is most important as a place to formulate good social relationships” (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010). This scale brought forth a lot of interest in religious orientations and much research has been done over the years. But as more researchers began studying religious orientation, the more problems that arose with the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales measuring what they were supposed to be measuring (Hunsberger &amp; Jacson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; Jackson, L. M. (2005). Religion, Meaning, and Prejudice. Journal of Social Issues, 	61(4), 807-826.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extrinsic==

Extrinsic Religious Orientation is a method of using religion to achieve non-religious goals, essentially viewing religion as a means to an end.&lt;ref name=batson&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first=Daniel|title=Religion and the Individual|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506208-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by people who go to religious gatherings and claim certain religious ideologies to establish or maintain social networks while minimally adhering to the teachings of the religion. People high in external religious orientation are more likely to conform to social norms and demands rather than what the religion requires, and are often prone to twist religious beliefs to serve their own political goals. Gordon Allport stated that people high in external religious orientation use religion, “to provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification” (Allport &amp;Ross, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;434). (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010)&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudice===

Hunsberger &amp; Jackson did a review of studies on religious orientation that had taken place since 1990 (2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Links have been made between prejudice and religious orientation but there have been no agreement on the relationship with intolerance. This is because there are many targets of prejudice, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. Hunsberger and Jackson have found support for the idea that the target of prejudice is important when looking at prejudice and religious orientation relationships. After careful analysis, they have found that extrinsic orientation is positively related to racial/ethnic and gay/lesbian intolerance. People who measure high in extrinsic religious orientation have a utilitarian approach and view religion as a meaningful source of social status. Having high extrinsic religious orientation means you conform to popular trends, such trends including prejudice. The validity of the religious orientation scales have proved debatable, thus relationships to prejudice have either supported or refuted Allport and Ross's theories (Hunsberger &amp; Jackson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a politician who goes to church in order to gain votes.

==Intrinsic==

According to Whitley and Kite, a person with an Intrinsic Religious Orientation sincerely believes in their religion and all its teachings and attempt to live their lives as their religion preaches that they should (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010).&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with what Daniel Batson would say; that while a person with an extrinsic religious orientation sees religion as a means to an end, a person with an intrinsic orientation sees their religion as that end. To them their religion is, "An active directing force, not just a tool used to reach self-serving ends." &lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this orientation find their religion to be the most important aspect of their life and seek to contextualize other aspects of their life through their religion. 

===Prejudice===

Research has found that people who hold an intrinsic religious orientation sincerely believe in and follow the teachings of their religion. They live their religion, and as a result those, "with a strong internal orientation should be unprejudiced to the extent that their religions teach inter group tolerance." Studies have found that these people show either no correlation or a negative correlation for racial prejudice. On the other hand, these same people often show a positive correlation for prejudice against gays.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This effect would be predicted, being that while most religions do not speak ill of other races (racism being due to upbringing rather than any Biblical foundation), they do tend to have little regard for homosexuals. {{Citation needed|reason=show evidence the Bible is not racist or tribalist|date=December 2017}}

While this research appears more favorable than the research that showed a correlation between religious activity and prejudice, some researchers are convinced that these people are merely showing what they believe to be a more socially acceptable bias.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Batson tested this hypothesis by having participants in a study (a study the participants were led to believe was about watching and evaluating a movie) choose whether to sit in a theater with a white confederate, or a black one. There were two conditions in this study, an overt condition in which both theaters were showing the same movie and a covert condition in which each theater was showing a different movie. The researchers believed that a prejudiced person who was attempting to appear unprejudiced would sit with the black confederate when the movie selection was the same in order to appear unprejudiced, but would sit with the white confederate (participants were white) when their choice could be attributed to wanting to watch the different movie. The researchers found that 75% of intrinsically religious participants chose to sit with the black confederate in the overt condition, but only 46% choose to sit with the black confederate in the covert condition. While these results do show that intrinsically motivated people do want to appear racially unbiased, it also shows that they are not racially prejudiced in general. Contrary to the religious orientations theory, extrinsic religiosity was unrelated to prejudice in either condition.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a person who truly believes in their religion and uses this belief to guide them in all other aspects of their life.

==Quest orientation==

A third religious orientation proposed by Batson is the quest orientation. People with this orientation treats their religion not as a means or an end, but a search for truth. As Batson said, "An individual who approaches religion in this way recognizes that he or she does not know, and probably never will know, the final truth about such matters. Still the questions are deemed important, and however tentative and subject to changes, answers are sought."&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Prejudice===

Intuitively, it is logical to assume that people who hold a quest orientation would be low in prejudice because by having this orientation they have already shown that they are open-minded and willing to change. This idea was tested alongside the intrinsic and extrinsic orientations by Batson in his theater experiment (described above in the "Intrinsic Religious Orientation and Prejudice" section). People who scored high in quest orientation choose to sit with the black confederate about half the time in both the overt and covert conditions, indicating both a lack of prejudice and a lack of the attempt to appear unprejudiced. To summarize Whitley and Kite as well as Batson, quest orientation appears to be the source of "universal love and compassion" that has long been sought by both religious scholars and researchers interested in the psychology of religion.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

Examples of people who have attained a quest orientation are [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">'''Johann Rudolf Julius Steck''' (January 18, 1842 - November 30, 1924) was a Swiss reformed [[Theology|theologian]] and writer.

Steck was a pastor of the [[Reformed Church, Dresden]] (1867-1881). From 1881 to 1921 he was Professor of Theology at the [[University of Bern]]. He was influenced by the writings of [[Bruno Bauer]] and was a proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J. C. (1991). ''The Bibleś Authority: A Portrait Gallery of Thinkers from Lessing to Bultmann''. Clark. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Ninian. (1985). ''Nineteenth-Century Religious Thought in the West: Volume III''. Cambridge University Press. p. 169. {{ISBN|0-521-30114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the [[Pauline epistles]] were a case of second century [[pseudepigrapha]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalamet, Christophe. (2005). ''Dialectical Theologians: Wilhelm Herrmann, Karl Barth and Rudolf Bultmann''. Theologische Verlag Zürich. p. 23. {{ISBN|3-290-17324-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steck argued that the Pauline letters were written by a school of people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest DeWitt Burton|Burton, Ernest DeWitt]]. (1988 edition). ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians''. T &amp; T Clark International. p. 70. {{ISBN|0-567-05029-7}} "Rudolf Steck, in ''Der Galaterbrief nach seiner Echtheit untersucht'', Berlin, 1888, maintains the historicity of the apostle Paul, but holds that like Jesus he wrote nothing. The four principal letters ascribed to Paul he maintains to have been written in the order: Romans, I Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, by the Pauline School, the last being based upon the earlier ones."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior, Michael]]. (1995). ''Jesus the Liberator: Nazareth Liberation Theology (Luke 4.16-30)''. Sheffield Academic Press. p. 42. "Rudolf Steck declared Loman to be correct. 'We shall have to get used to the idea that no Apostle wrote anything, any more than Jesus himself did.' The Pauline Letters were written by a school. He concluded that the report in Acts is the fundamental datum for the historical situation."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Sharvara''' ('''Dog of Yama''')  (शर्वर) is an ancient Hindu mythical dog belonging to [[Yama]]. It is one of the two dogs that guard the netherworld. Sharvara is identified with the constellation [[Canis Major]], the other dog with [[Canis Minor]], together they guard the gates of the netherworld, known as [[Pitru Paksha|pitriloka]] or vaivasvataloka, which is the domain of Yama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]|first=[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Bal Gangadhar]]|title=[[The Orion (Book)|The Orion, or, Researches into the Antiquity of the Vedas]]|year=1893|publisher=Mrs. Radhabai Atmaram Sagoon|location=Pune|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''sharvara'' means variegated or spotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tilak|1893|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3S3CBNUD4ggC&amp;pg=PA108 108]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In older Sanskrit, शर्वर is written as कर्वर (karvara).&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier Williams Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Mythology == 
Sharvara can be compared with the Greek [[Cerberus]], the mythological dog of the Greeks with similar characteristics. However, there is no description of Cerberus having a companion, and he is usually depicted with three heads.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apolodorus]] and others indicate that he had three heads, but [[Hesiod]] with poetical hyperbole gives him fifty. {{Cite book|author=Elton, Charles Abraham|year=1812|title=Hesiod, translated from the Greek into English verse, with a Preliminary Dissertation on the Writings, Life, and Æra of Hesiod|publisher=Lackington, Allen and Company|location=London|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hAMyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA267 267]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have concluded that the three heads were a Greek addition to the underlying Indo-Aryan myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elton|1812|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bryant, Jacob|year=1809|title=A new system: or, An analysis of antient mythology|edition=3rd|publisher=J. Walker|volume=2|pages=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89065067670;view=image;q1=Cerberus;start=1;size=100;page=root;seq=132;num=118 118&amp;ndash;119]|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015010301169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shavara can also be compared to Odin's wolves in Norse mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Geri and Freki, "Greedy" and "Voracious" {{Cite book|author=Bloomfield, Maurice|year=1905|title=Cerberus, the Dog of Hades: The History of an Idea|publisher=Open Court Publishing|pages=https://books.google.com/books?id=W79ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 26&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odin (the all-father) just like Yama (the progenitor of all humans) sits on a chair guarded by two dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1905|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W79ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Odin (Woden), the hunter, the wanderer, god of storm and winter, is more comparable to the Vedic [[Rudra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tilak|1893|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3S3CBNUD4ggC&amp;pg=PA138 138&amp;ndash;140]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] dates the Vedic antiquity using the assertion that the Milky Way (path of the dead) used to be guarded by Sharvara and a new year started upon the crossing of Milky Way by the sun. Using internal evidence he dated the timeframe of Vedic antiquity (taittriya samhita) to the time when at the vernal equinox the sun rose in the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of Orion (Mrigashiras).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tilak|1893|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3S3CBNUD4ggC&amp;pg=PA41 41&amp;ndash;60]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presence==
===Kabul===
There were over 20,000 Sikhs in Kabul in the 1980s, but after the start of the [[Afghan Civil War (1992–96)|Civil War]] in 1992, most had fled.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/afghan-hindus-and-sikhs-celebrate-diwali-without-pomp-and-splendour-amid-fear-1.668735&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of Kabul's eight Gurdwaras were destroyed during the civil war. Only [[Gurdwara Karte Parwan]], located in the [[Karte Parwan]] section of Kabul, remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhfoundation.org/people-events/no-home-for-afghanistan-sikhs/|title=No Home for Afghanistan Sikhs – The Sikh Foundation International|website=www.sikhfoundation.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are centered today in Karte Parwan and some parts of the old city.

===Jalalabad===
As of 2001, Jalalabad had 100 Sikh families, totaling around 700 people, who worship at two large [[Gurdwara]]s. Legend states that the older of the Gurudwaras was built to commemorate the visit of [[Guru Nanak Dev]].&lt;ref name="baldauf2001"&gt;[http://www.themodernreligion.com/jihad/afghan/sikh.html Sikhs set example for getting along with the Taliban]. By Scott Baldauf, Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor, 13 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2018, at least 10 Sikhs were killed in a targeted [[suicide bombing]] at the PD1 market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/four-killed-jalalabad-explosion |publisher=[[TOLO News|TOLO]] |title=Suicide Attack Targets Sikhs in Jalalabad, 19 Killed |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/blast-reported-afghanistan-jalalabad-180701120808551.html |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |title=Deadly blast hits Afghanistan's Jalalabad |date=July 1, 2018 |quote=Ghulam Sanayi Stanekzai, Nangarhar's police chief, said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who targeted a vehicle carrying members of the Sikh minority who were travelling to meet the president.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kandahar===
Kandahar has a remarkably small Sikh community, with only about 15 families living there as of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/feature/2002/06/17/focus-hindus-and-sikhs-kandahar|title=Focus on Hindus and Sikhs in Kandahar|website=IRIN|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===Early history===
Some early [[Khatri]] Sikhs established and maintained colonies in Afghanistan for trading purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hew McLeod|first=|title=Sikhism|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-025260-6|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, conflicts between the Sikh [[misl]]s and [[Sikh Empire|empire]] against the Afghan-based [[Durrani Empire]] led to tension. Sikhs also served in the British Empire's military during several operations in Afghanistan in the 19th century.

===Wars===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Peasant festival kabul 1980.png|thumb|200px|left|Sikhs at a peasant festival in Kabul Stadium on April 11, 1980, during [[Babrak Karmal]]'s regime{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 28 April 2018|F7}}]] --&gt;
During the 1980s [[Soviet-Afghan War]], many Afghan Sikhs fled to India, where the Sikh community is well-established; a second, much larger wave followed following the 1992 fall of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Najibullah regime]].&lt;ref name="majumder2003"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3138282.stm | work=BBC News | first=Sanjoy | last=Majumder | title=Sikhs struggle in Afghanistan | date=25 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (temples) throughout the country were destroyed in the Afghan Civil War of the 1990s, leaving only the Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul.&lt;ref name="dnaindia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_sikhs-hindus-reclaim-kabul-funeral-ground_1006343 |title=Sikhs, Hindus reclaim Kabul funeral ground - World - DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2006-01-08 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Taliban]], the Sikhs were a relatively tolerated religious minority, and allowed to practice their religion.&lt;ref name="baldauf2001"/&gt;  However, the Sikh custom of cremation of the dead was prohibited by the Taliban, and cremation grounds vandalized.&lt;ref name="dnaindia1"/&gt; In addition, Sikhs were required to wear yellow patches or veils to identify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/10/world/la-fg-afghanistan-sikhs-20130611|title=Afghanistan Sikhs, already marginalized, are pushed to the brink|last=Magnier|first=Mark|date=2013-06-10|last2=Baktash|first2=Hashmat|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karzai administration===

Sikhs in Afghanistan continue to face problems, with the issue of the Sikh custom of cremation figuring prominently. City development also threatens to destroy the Gurudwara Karte Parwan and adjoining shrine to Guru Nanak.

In September 2013, Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed a legislative decree, reserving a seat in the [[National Assembly of Afghanistan]] for the Hindu and Sikh minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/09/04/1-wolesi-jirga-seat-reserved-hindus-sikhs|title=1 Wolesi Jirga seat reserved for Hindus, Sikhs|work=pajhwok.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
Before the 1990s, the Afghan Sikh population was estimated around 50,000.&lt;ref name="dnaindia1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jethra |first=Aashish |url=http://www.sikhnet.com/news/2-sikhs-afghan-poll-fray-want-be-first-elected-non-muslims |title=2 Sikhs in Afghan poll fray, want to be first elected non-Muslims |publisher=SikhNet |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, they are around 800 families of which 300 families live in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name="Pajhwok"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/07/31/hindus-sikhs-warn-leaving-afghanistan |title=Hindus, Sikhs warn of leaving Afghanistan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh leaders in Afghanistan claim that the total number of Sikhs is 3,000. Many Sikh families have chosen to emigrate to other countries including, [[India]], [[North America]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Pakistan]], and other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/facing-intolerance-many-sikhs-and-hindus-leave-afghanistan-1421124144|title=Facing Intolerance, Many Sikhs and Hindus Leave Afghanistan|last=Stancati|first=Margherita|last2=Amiri|first2=Ehsanullah|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spirit Rescue''' relates to the practice within [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] of assisting [[spirit]] entities who are believed to have failed to make the transition into the afterlife. They are therefore considered by Spiritualists to remain within our physical dimension in a wandering or lost state. The usual causes of this are purported to be sudden or traumatic death, guilt, fear of punishment, restrictive religious beliefs and other emotional conditions that may limit a person's focus and prevent a successful transition.

Spirit Rescue is typically performed by a Spiritualist medium who will attempt to communicate with the discarnate spirit and explain their condition to them, reassure them or explore whatever it is that holds them within the earthly dimension of existence.  
Many of these spirits are considered to display a reduced degree of awareness and consciousness compared to normal human consciousness, and it is a common belief among Spiritualists that the spirit may not even realize they have died, especially as they may exist within a projected reality of their own making, a mental construct conforming to their expectations and emotions. This is allegedly much like a dream state from which a medium may attempt to move the spirit into a higher consciousness. The essence of rescue work appears to be reaching earthbound spirit and attempting to raise their conscious awareness to include other options of reality.

Common rescue methods may involve a medium using clairvoyant abilities, mentally "seeing" or sensing the spirit concerned, or they may employ a trance state of consciousness and channel the spirit, therefore allowing the spirit to speak to others present.

==Skeptical views==
The use of spirit rescue and spiritual releasement therapy remain controversial within the medical community. Considered by many to be a complementary or alternative practice. Practitioners sometimes use diagnoses which are not recognized within the mainline of psychiatric practice.

A '''starving artist''' is an [[artist]] who sacrifices material well-being in order to focus on their artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Chohan, Usman W. [https://theconversation.com/should-artists-pay-their-taxes-in-art-57669 Should artists pay their taxes in art?] ''The Conversation'' July 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; They typically live on minimum expenses, either for a lack of business or because all their [[disposable income]] goes toward art projects. Related terms include '''starving actor''' and '''starving musician'''.

Some starving artists desire mainstream success but have difficulty due to high [[barriers to entry]] in fields such as the [[visual arts]], the [[film industry]], and [[theatre]]. These artists frequently take temporary positions such as [[waiter]]ing or other [[service industry]] jobs while they focus their attention on "breaking through" in their preferred field. [[The Starving Artists Project]] describes these artists as those who have not yet broken into their careers.

Other artists may find enough satisfaction in living as artists to choose [[voluntary poverty]] regardless of their prospects for future financial reward or broad recognition. Virginia Nicholson writes in ''Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900–1939'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifty years on we may judge that [[Dylan Thomas]]'s poverty was noble, while [[Nina Hamnett]]'s was senseless. But a minor artist with no money goes as hungry as a genius. What drove them to do it? I believe that such people were not only choosing art, they were choosing the life of the artist. Art offered them a different way of living, one that they believed more than compensated for the loss of comfort and respectability.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson, ''Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900–1939'', (p. 2); Penguin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
The starving artist is a typical figure of [[Romanticism]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, seen in many paintings and works of [[literature]]. In 1851, [[Henri Murger]] wrote about four starving artists in ''[[Scènes de la Vie de Bohème]]'', the basis for the operas ''[[La bohème]]'' by Puccini and [[La bohème (Leoncavallo)|Leoncavallo]] by Leoncavallo. In 1890, [[Knut Hamsun]]'s novel, ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]],'' depicted a period of a starving artist's life. In 1924, [[Franz Kafka]] wrote a short story called ''[[A Hunger Artist]]'' about a man who is world-famous for his public performances of [[fasting]].

The temple stay program has been operating since the 2002 World Cup game.


== Origin of Templestay ==
Templestay is an experiential program in [[Korean Buddhism]] initiated by the [[Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism]] at the onset of the [[2002 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyunbulnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=126040 "Templestay, the Ambassador of Korean Buddhism"(Hyundae Bulgyo News)]&lt;/ref&gt;
During its 1,700 years of history, Korean Buddhism has preserved and passed down Ganhwa Seon practice, a kind of Seon (Zen) meditation. Every year during the retreat seasons of summer and winter, about 2,500 monastics enter a 100-day meditation retreat in one of the 100 temples nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibulgyo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=98166 "Ven. Hyangbong"(Hyundae Bulgyo News)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a unique Korean tradition in the sphere of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. 

This tradition has influenced the architectural layout of temples and monastic life over the years, and one can attain inner calm and peace of mind and body at any of these temples. In their effort to transform the 2002 World Cup into a cultural opportunity, the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism decided to open their temple gates during the games and allowed both Koreans and non-Koreans to stay in one of their mountain temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalorganic.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=oculture&amp;wr_id=10 "Chamsali"(Organic Life: Templestay)]&lt;/ref&gt;  

As a result, in the 30 days the World Cup lasted (May 31, 2002 to June 30), 1,000 foreigners and 10,000 Koreans experienced the Templestay program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000189317 "Foreign Press, Paying attention to Templestay"(Yonhap News)]&lt;/ref&gt; That was a sizable achievement, but more importantly, Korean Buddhism and the Templestay program became known to the wider world as major international media, including CNN,&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/visit/33-beautiful-temples-enlightenment-857401 "Simply stunning: 33 incredible Korean temples"(CNN)]&lt;/ref&gt; the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/travel/29iht-trkorea.3711483.html?_r=0 "Sampling the lifestyle of a Korean monk - Travel &amp; Dining - International Herald Tribune"(New York Times)]&lt;/ref&gt; BBC&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/other_news/newsid_2016000/2016311.stm "World Cup Diary: Korea"(BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt; and NHK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyunbulnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=123297 "Templestay, the Promotion Ambassador of Korea"(Hyundae Bulgyo News)]&lt;/ref&gt; paid growing attention and reported feature stories about them. 

After the end of the 2002 World Cup, the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism announced the permanent establishment of the Templestay program on July 2, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=001&amp;aid=0000199652 "Permanent Operation of Templestay"(Yonhap News)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Order then established the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism on July 16, 2004 as an operative body to run the Templestay program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhism.or.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=news_01_03&amp;wr_id=17808&amp;DNUX=news_01_03&amp;page=89 "News and Notice"(Korean Website of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism)]&lt;/ref&gt; As the national government promised budget support, the number of temples operating a Templestay program grew from 31 in the first year to 110 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[P71, 2015 사찰음식 학술포럼, March 13, 2015, 2Fl. SETEC Seoul, Hosted by the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism, (Mr. Hongjun Ahn and Mr. Josun Park, the members of National Parliament Korea)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Templestay program is now recognized as one of the major tourist programs in Korea. In 2009, the [[OECD]] selected the Templestay program as one of the five most successful combinations of culture and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=49267&amp;yy=2009 "Templestay, Receiving Praise from Worldwide"(Maeil News))]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to statistics issued by the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism on May 29, 2011, a total of 700,000 people have experienced Templestay in the decade following 2002 when the program began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/culture/2011/05/27/0903000000AKR20110527181200005.HTML "The Participants’ Number Reached over 700,000 on the 10th anniversary of Templestay"(Yonhap News)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 

== Basic Templestay Programs ==

=== Temple Compound Tour ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In most temples this is the very first item on the schedule for Templestay participants. The aim of this guided tour around the temple for first-time visitors is to get to know the age-old traditions and culture of temples as well as the monastic lifestyle of Buddhist monks and nuns. In this way, participants are shown where the temple dining hall and public restrooms are and so they feel more at home. As they are led through the various buildings and structures of the temple, they discover firsthand the beauty of monastic architecture, paintings, handicrafts and landscaping, and so see many things that they might have otherwise missed. The guide often tells ancient stories behind many of the buildings and art as well as the temple itself.  



[[File:국제선센터2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Chamseon]]
=== Seon Meditation (chamseon) ===
[[Korean Seon|Seon]] [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] (chamseon) is similar to other forms of meditation. However, it does differ in one particular respect and that is that chamseon’s goal is to achieve single-minded absorption through the illogical doubt raised by a [[Hua Tuo|hwadu]] (the punch-line to a [[Kōan|koan]]) so that the rambling mind is momentarily quieted. It is one of the most important practices of Korean Buddhism. A chamseon session usually consists of 50 minutes of Seon meditation followed by 10 minutes of slow and fast walking (pohaeng or gyeonghaeng). Depending on the temple and the program, longer or shorter periods of meditation are offered in which participants learn the aim and method as well as correct posture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=1040&amp;wr_id=25 "Meditation"(English Website of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism)]&lt;/ref&gt;



[[File:마곡사2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Conversation over Tea with Monastics]]
=== Conversation over Tea with Monastics (Chadam) ===
Sometime in the afternoon or evening, when monastics are not so busy with daily tasks, one of them invites the Templestay participants to drink tea. For monastics, all aspects of the day are a part of Buddhist practice, and drinking tea is considered an important one. This is the time for participants to enjoy a moment with monastics while asking questions about temples or monastic life or even requesting advice about how to live better. Participants may have the opportunity to view the world through the eyes of Buddhist practitioners and even reassess their own lives and improve their well being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&amp;m=0005002003001&amp;p=02&amp;art_id=39120&amp;lang=en "Templestay: Finding your true self"(Visit Seoul, The Official Travel Guide to Seoul)]&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:월정사2.jpg|thumbnail|left|Formal Monastic Meal]]
=== Formal Monastic Meals (Baru Gongyang) ===
In Korean Buddhism, “gongyang” means “offering.” During a meal one reflects deeply on the countless people and efforts that have brought the food that one receives. In this way, one learns to be grateful for even a single spoonful of rice.

Before the meal, everyone recites a verse which teaches participants how to reflect upon the Buddha’s teachings that are embodied in the act of receiving food. Everyone eats from a set of bowls called “baru” as monastics do, and they are told not to waste a single grain of rice out of respect for the offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=1010&amp;wr_id=95 "Barugongyang"(English Website of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism)]&lt;/ref&gt; 


[[File:약천사4.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buddhist Services]]
=== Buddhist Ceremonies (Yebul) ===
In the daily routine of Korean temples, the most important event is the Buddhist ceremony called yebul. This ceremony refers to paying respect to the Buddhas enshrined in the Dharma halls three times a day and repeating the teachings, usually before dawn, 10 a.m., and in the evening. Yebul is also called the “ceremony of five fragrances (obunhyangnye)” because participants reaffirm the five virtues that practitioners hope to perfect. Yebul is the ceremony that regulates the day and is attended by everyone possible in the temple compound.

Different instruments are used to symbolically call all beings to join the ceremony. First of all the large bell is sounded, next the drum calls all animals, then the wooden fish for the water-dwelling animals and finally the cloud-shaped gong for the animals of the air. The ceremony continues with a re-affirmation of the refuge we take in the various Buddhas, [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattvas]] and generations of Seon Patriarchs. Then follows the recitation of the [[Heart Sutra]] and the Wishes for the welfare of the temple and all people (Barunmoon).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=4010&amp;wr_id=2&amp;sfl=wr_subject&amp;stx=%EC%98%88%EB%B6%88&amp;sop=or "Yebul, Morning and Evening Buddhist Ceremonies"(English Website of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism)]&lt;/ref&gt; 


[[File:묘각사4.jpg|thumbnail|left|108 Prostrations ]]
=== 108 Bows (Baekpalbae) ===
Another major practice of Korean Buddhism is bowing. This practice consists of 3 bows, 108 bows, 1,080 bows or 3,000 bows and aims at ridding the practitioner of greed and attachment. The 108 bows is an act of atonement for one’s recognized ignorance and cravings, and the 108 kinds of afflictions that arise within them. In this respect, the 108 bows symbolize a fresh start as well and so one empties the illusions one has come to believe to make up one’s “self” and earnestly fills the void with new good intentions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://london-zen-centre.weebly.com/bowing-prostrations.html "Bowing, Prostrations"(London Zen Centre)]&lt;/ref&gt; 



[[File:국제선센터3.jpg|thumbnail|right|Making Lotuses]]
=== Making Lotuses ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In Buddhism, [[Lotus Flower|lotus flowers]] symbolize [[Buddha Nature]], the potential to become [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]], which we all possess. Just as lotus flowers are not stained with the mud in which they grow, ignorant sentient beings can reveal their inherent Buddha Nature once awakened.

Korean Buddhism holds the Lotus Lantern Festival every year on the [[Buddha’s Birthday]], which falls on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month. Buddhists handcraft their own lanterns (which are unique to Korean Buddhism), which represent purification and wisdom. The way each petal of thin paper is glued to the paper cup, one by one with great care by Templestay participants, is meant to be a reminder of Buddhists’ fervent wish to persevere in becoming less selfish and more compassionate.

There is also a huge lantern parade through the center of [[Seoul]] and cultural performances until late at night during this national festival.

[[File:PaineAgeReason.png|thumb|alt=Title page from The Age of Reason|Title page from the first English edition of Part I]]
[[File:36-Visiting CFI library-Rare Books.JPG|thumb|Several early copies of ''The Age of Reason'']]

'''''The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology''''' is a work by English and American political activist [[Thomas Paine]], arguing for the philosophical position of [[Deism]]. It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the [[Bible]]. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.

It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic [[revival meeting|revival]]. British audiences, fearing increased [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|political radicalism]] as a result of the [[French Revolution]], received it with more hostility. ''The Age of Reason'' presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the [[Christian]] Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of [[revelation]], leading him to reject [[miracle]]s and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text. It promotes [[natural theology|natural religion]] and argues for the existence of a creator-god.

Most of Paine's arguments had long been available to the [[educated]] [[elite]], but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to [[common people|the masses]]. Originally distributed as unbound [[pamphlet]]s, the book was also cheap, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many [[Freethought|free thinkers]].

==Historical context==

===Intellectual context: eighteenth-century British deism===
Paine's book followed in the tradition of [[deism#The rise of British deism (1690–1740)|early eighteenth-century British deism]]. These deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in ''The Age of Reason''. The most important position that united the early deists was their call for "free rational inquiry" into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on [[freedom of conscience]], they demanded [[religious toleration]]&lt;!--a more specific link to the history of British toleration would be nice – anyone know of one? --&gt; and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a [[Isaac Newton#Effect on religious thought|Newtonian]] worldview, and they believed that all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature.  Without a concept of [[physical law|natural law]], the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of [[miracle]]s. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the [[first cause]] or [[Cosmological argument|prime mover]], had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to (miraculously) intervene in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious truth or "one true faith"; religion could only be "simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal" if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They therefore distinguished between "revealed religions" (which they rejected), such as Christianity, and "natural religion", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (they were, thus, not [[atheism|atheists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, 26–29; see also Claeys, 178–79; Kuklick, xiii. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

While some deists accepted [[revelation]], most argued that revelation's restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power. Moreover, many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable. According to these writers, revelation could reinforce the evidence for God's existence already apparent in the natural world, but more often it led to superstition among the masses. Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles, unnecessary rituals, and illogical and dangerous doctrines (these accusations were typically referred to as "[[Deism#History of religion and the deist mission|priestcraft]]"). The worst of these doctrines was [[original sin]]. By convincing people that they required a priest's help to overcome their innate sinfulness, deists argued, religious leaders had enslaved the human population. Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, 30–39; see also Claeys, 178–79. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political context: French revolution===
[[Image:Cruikshank - The Radical's Arms.png|thumb|alt=A caricature of French revolutionaries, showing two grotesque French peasants celebrating around a guillotine dripping with blood and surrounded by flames.|[[George Cruikshank|George Cruikshank's]] ''The Radical's Arms'' (1819), pillorying the excesses of the French revolution]]

By the time Part I of ''The Age of Reason'' was published in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Reign of Terror]] had begun, [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] had been tried and executed and [[First Coalition|Britain was at war with France]]. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. ''The Age of Reason'' belongs to this later, more radical stage of the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British political reform movement]], one that openly embraced [[republicanism]] and atheism&lt;ref&gt;Paine was not an atheist; nor were other deists.&lt;/ref&gt; and is exemplified by such texts as [[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793). By the middle of the decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: [[Richard Price]], the [[English Dissenters|Dissenting]] minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), had died in 1791, and [[Joseph Priestley]] had been forced to flee to America after a [[Priestley Riots|Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Marilyn. ''Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries: English Literature and its Background 1760–1830''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] (1981), 49; Bindman, 118. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative government, headed by [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], responded to this increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for [[seditious libel]] and [[treason]] in the famous [[1794 Treason Trials]]. Following the trials and an attack on [[George III]], conservatives were successful in passing the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]] (also known as the "Two Acts" or the "gagging acts"). These acts prohibited [[freedom of assembly]] for groups such as the radical [[London Corresponding Society]] (LCS) and encouraged indictments against radicals for "libelous and seditious" statements. Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French revolution, many reformers drifted away from the cause. The LCS, which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers, fractured when [[Francis Place]] and other leaders helped Paine publish ''The Age of Reason''; the society's more religious members withdrew in protest and the LCS lost around one-fifth of its membership.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 148; Claeys, 190. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In December 1792, Paine's ''[[Rights of Man (book written by Thomas Paine)|Rights of Man, part II]]'' was declared [[seditious libel|seditious]] in Britain and he was forced to flee to France in order to avoid arrest.  Dismayed by the French revolution's turn toward secularism and atheism, he composed Part I of ''The Age of Reason'' in 1792 and 1793:
{{quote|
It has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts upon religion. ... The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity and of the theology that is true.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although Paine wrote ''The Age of Reason'' for the French, he dedicated it to his "Fellow Citizens of the United States of America", alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 210; see also Davidson and Scheick, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he says in the preface to Part II:
{{quote|
Conceiving... that I had but a few days of liberty, I sat down and brought the work to a close as speedily as possible; and I had not finished it more than six hours, in the state it has since appeared, before a guard came there, about three in the morning, with an order... for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner, and conveying me to the prison of the Luxembourg. I contrived, in my way there, to call on [[Joel Barlow]], and I put the Manuscript of the work into his hands...}}
According to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick, he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793,&lt;ref name=DS106&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt; but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793.&lt;ref name=Hawke2924&gt;Hawke, 292–94.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793.&lt;ref name=DS106/&gt; François Lanthenas, who translated ''The Age of Reason'' into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified.&lt;ref&gt;See Gimbel for a discussion of one possible copy of the 1793 French text.&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow published the first English edition of ''The Age of Reason, Part I'' in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three [[pence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Doubting Thomas': The Failure of Religious Appropriation in the Age of Reason|page=17|author=Adrianne Wadewitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Paine, considered too moderate by the powerful [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the [[guillotine]] by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, xix–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[James Monroe]], at that time the new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794,&lt;ref&gt;Foot and Kramnick. 1987. ''The Thomas Paine Reader'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine immediately began work on Part II of ''The Age of Reason'', despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 [[Daniel Isaac Eaton]] published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one [[shilling]] and six pence. ([[1794 Treason Trials#Daniel Isaac Eaton|Eaton]] was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, [[Francis Place]] and Thomas Williams&lt;!--do not link - there is no page for this Thomas Williams--&gt; collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.&lt;ref name=Claeys1878&gt;Claeys, 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of ''The Age of Reason'': ''An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ''. Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals, [[Thomas Jefferson]] convinced him not to publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.&lt;ref name=DS106/&gt;

Following Thomas Williams's sentence of one year's hard labor for publishing ''The Age of Reason'' in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when [[Richard Carlile]] included it in an edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom#Common law treatment|blasphemous libel]]. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of ''The Age of Reason'' in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Bronowski, Julius. ''William Blake and the Age of Revolution''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul (1965), 81; Claeys, 190; Wiener, 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and major arguments==
''The Age of Reason'' is divided into three sections. In Part I, Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed. In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible in order to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God.

===Analysis===
[[Image:Thomas Paine.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An oil painting of [[Thomas Paine]] by [[Auguste Millière]] (1880), after an engraving by [[William Sharp (engraver)|William Sharp]], after a portrait by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] (1792)|alt=1/2 length portrait of Thomas Paine. He is turned towards the left and looking inquiringly out towards the viewer. He is wearing a dark red velvet jacket and a white shirt and there are papers next to him.]]
At the beginning of Part I of the ''Age of Reason'', Paine lays out his personal belief:
{{quote|
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.

I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow-creatures happy.

But, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.

I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.

All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.

I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Paine's creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims (miracles are specifically mentioned later in the text); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;As Walter Woll has noted in his book on Paine, there are "remarkable similarities" between Paine's creed and his friend [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's]]; Woll, 138, note 1. Franklin's creed: "I believe in one God, the creator of the universe. That he governs it by his Providence. That he ought to be worshipped. That the most acceptable service we render to him is doing good to his other children. That the soul of man is immortal, and will be treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct in this."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason and revelation===
Paine begins ''The Age of Reason'' by attacking [[revelation]]. [[Revelation]], he maintains, can only be verified by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be "creation".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of ''The Age of Reason'', he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 207–09; Claeys, 181–82; Davidson and Scheick, 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; For example Thomas Paine notes, " The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? "&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas; ''The Works of Thomas Paine'' (2008). ''The Age of Reason''.  pp. 52–53.  Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paine's analysis of the Bible====
After establishing that he would refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible's own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible, analyzing it as one would any other book. For example, in his analysis of the [[Book of Proverbs]] he argues that its sayings are "inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 60–61; see also Davidson and Scheick, 49; and Fruchtman, 3–4, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the Bible as "fabulous mythology", Paine questions whether or not it was revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known (he dismisses the idea that [[Moses]] wrote the [[Pentateuch]] or that the Gospel's authors are known, for example).

{{quote|My intention is to show that those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of them; and still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses, nor till several hundred years afterward; that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred years after the death of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'', Part II, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Paine|title=The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77|year=1898|publisher=Truth Seeker Company|page=77|quote=My intention is to show that those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of them; and still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses, nor till several hundred years afterward; that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred years after the death of Moses, as men now write histories of things that happened, or are supposed to have happened, several hundred or several thousand years ago. (Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U3HlvD-qnSUJ-7Hy2E_b5Nc1Rewnw&amp;ci=130%2C605%2C730%2C413&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;77] at Google Books)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [...] The books called the Evangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...they have been manufactured, as the books of the Old Testament have been by other persons than those whose names they bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Paine|title=The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|year=1898|publisher=Truth Seeker Company|page=143|quote=But exclusive of this the presumption is that the books called the Evangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and that they are impositions. The disordered state of the history in these four books, the silence of one book upon matters related in the others, and the disagreement that is to be found among them, implies that they are the production of some unconnected individuals, many years after the things they pretend to relate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men living intimately together, as the men called apostles are supposed to have done; in fine, that they have been manufactured, as the books of the Old Testament have been by other persons than those whose names they bear. (Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U01N_Q-UujyEOZyigT5vIkE0-y4Sg&amp;ci=115%2C260%2C750%2C418&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;143] at Google Books)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Using methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the nineteenth century, Paine tested the Bible for internal consistency and questioned its historical accuracy, concluding that it was not divinely inspired.

Paine also argues that the [[Old Testament]] must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God. The "history of wickedness" pervading the Old Testament convinced Paine that it was simply another set of human-authored myths.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 207–09; Claeys, 181–82; Davidson and Scheick, 64–65, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; He deplores people's credulity: "Brought up in habits of superstition," he wrote, "people in general know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God." Citing [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31:13–47 as an example, in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women, and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls, at God's behest,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|31:13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine calls the Bible a "book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Vikki J.|title="My pen and my soul have ever gone together": Thomas Paine and the American Revolution|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=75|isbn=978-0-415-97652-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and the state===
[[Image:PaineRightsOfMan.png|thumb|right|180px|Title page from [[Thomas Paine|Paine's]] ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1792)|alt=Title page from the Rights of Man]]
Paine also attacks religious [[Institution|institutions]], indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church's opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 207–09; Claeys, 181; Davidson and Scheick, 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' and ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', stating that "the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue."&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of attack distinguishes Paine's book from other deistic works, which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Hawke2924/&gt; He argues that the Church and the State are a single corrupt institution which does not act in the best interests of the people—both must be radically altered:
{{quote|Soon after I had published the pamphlet "Common Sense," in America, I saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion. The adulterous connection of Church and State, wherever it has taken place ... has so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds, and upon first principles of religion, that until the system of government should be changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world; but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the system of religion would follow. Human inventions and priestcraft would be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As Jon Mee, a scholar of British radicalism, writes: "Paine believed ... a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Mee, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, "an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions."&lt;ref name=DS1819&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's "secular [[millennialism]]" and it appears in all of his works—he ends the ''Rights of Man'', for example, with the statement: "From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of [[Revolution|revolutions]], in which everything may be looked for."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Foner, 216; see also Fruchtman, 157–58; Harrison, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine "transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia," emphasizing the possibilities of "progress" and "human perfectibility" that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 91; see also Fruchtman, 157–58; Claeys, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paine's intellectual debts===
Although Paine liked to say that he read very little, his writings belie this statement;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 135–42.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age of Reason'' has intellectual roots in the traditions of [[David Hume]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Voltaire]]. Since Hume had already made many of the same "moral attacks upon Christianity" that Paine popularized in ''The Age of Reason'', scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 135–42; Davidson and Scheick, 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as "a positive source of harm to society" that "led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant".&lt;ref&gt;Hole, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; More of an influence on Paine than Hume was Spinoza's ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise|Tractatus Theologico-politicus]]'' (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other eighteenth-century deists, most notably [[Conyers Middleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 140–41; Davidson and Scheick, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on ''The Age of Reason'', Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the [[deism#The rise of British deism (1690–1740)|English deists of the early eighteenth century]], such as [[Peter Annet]].&lt;ref&gt;In Annet, Paine is said to have a direct "forerunner" in deistic argumentation, advocacy of "freedom of expression and religious inquiry" and emphasis on "social reforms." Annet even concerned himself with the price of one of his controversial religious pamphlets. Such a concern is worthy of Paine. (Herrick 130–34)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] had argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture, [[Matthew Tindal]] had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]] had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, [[Thomas Woolston]] had questioned the believability of miracles and [[Thomas Chubb]] had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in ''The Age of Reason'', albeit less coherently.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 209; Davidson and Scheick, 60ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric and style==
The most distinctive feature of ''The Age of Reason'', like all of Paine's works, is its linguistic style. Historian [[Eric Foner]] argues that Paine's works "forged a new political language" designed to bring politics to the people, using a "clear, simple and straightforward" style.&lt;ref name=Foner16&gt;Foner, xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine outlined "a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society" and his language reflected these ideals.&lt;ref name=Foner16/&gt; He originated such phrases as "the rights of man", "the age of reason", "the age of revolution", and "the times that try men's souls".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Foner also maintains that with ''The Age of Reason'' Paine "gave deism a new, aggressive, explicitly anti-Christian tone".&lt;ref name=Foner247&gt;Foner, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

He did this by employing "[[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]]" (that is, "low" or "popular") language, an irreverent tone, and even religious rhetoric. In a letter to [[Elihu Palmer]], one of his most loyal followers in America, Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy:
{{quote|
The hinting and intimidating manner of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind [religion], produced skepticism, but not conviction. It is necessary to be bold. Some people can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it. Say a bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Clark, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Paine's rhetoric had broad appeal; his "pithy" lines were "able to bridge working-class and middle-class cultures" and become common quotations.&lt;ref name="Kuklick, xi–xii."&gt;Kuklick, xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of what makes Paine's style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions&lt;ref name="Kuklick, xi–xii."/&gt; in addition to the profusion of "anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and ... appeals to common sense".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of "we" conveys an "illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Vulgar" language===
The most distinctive element of Paine's style in ''The Age of Reason'' is its "[[wikt:vulgar|vulgarity]]". In the eighteenth century "vulgarity" was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity; thus, when Paine celebrates his "vulgar" style and his critics attack it, the dispute is over class accessibility, not profanity. For example, Paine describes [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] this way:

The Christian Mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the Garden of Eden, in the shape of a snake or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is no way surprised to hear a snake talk; and the issue of this tête-à-tête is that he persuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that apple damns all mankind. After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have supposed that the Church Mythologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to the pit: or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him (for they say that their faith can remove a mountain), or have put him ''under'' a mountain, as the former mythologists had done, to prevent his getting again among the women and doing more mischief. But instead of this they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole—the secret of which is that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to stay. They promised him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine-tenths of the world beside, and Mahomet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulness of the Christian Mythology? Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven, in which none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded—put Satan into the pit—let him out again—gave him a triumph over the whole creation—damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, these Christian Mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and Man, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten, on purpose to be sacrificed, because they say that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis Paine's]
}}
The irreverent tone that Paine combined with this vulgar style set his work apart from its predecessors. It took "deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and [brought] it to the people".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, "Introduction," ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 35; see also Foot and Kramnick, 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's rhetorical appeal to "the people" attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Bishop Richard Watson]], forced to address this new audience in his influential response to Paine, ''An Apology for the Bible'', writes: "I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and who are the most likely to be injured by it."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others, it was also the cheapness of Paine's book. At one [[seditious libel|sedition]] trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke's ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'', arguing that "although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Leslie Chard, "Bookseller to publisher: Joseph Johnson and the English book trade, 1760–1810." ''The Library'' (5th series) 32 (1977), 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irreverent tone===
[[Image:WatsonApologycrop.png|right|thumb|Title page from the eighth edition of [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Bishop Watson's]] rejoinder to Paine|alt=Title page from "An Apology for the Bible"]]
Paine's style is not only "vulgar", it is also irreverent. For example, he says that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, "The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason,'' Part II, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, theirs was a [[wit|refined wit]] rather than the broad humor Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the middling ranks, and not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, 52, 61–65, 80–81; Claeys, 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Paine's "ridiculing" tone that most angered Churchmen. As John Redwood, a scholar of deism, puts it: "the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule, for it was ridicule, not reason, that endangered the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Redwood, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, Watson's ''Apology'' directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone:
{{quote|
I am unwilling to attribute bad designs, deliberate wickedness, to you or to any man; I cannot avoid believing, that you think you have truth on your side, and that you are doing service to mankind in endeavouring to root out what you esteem superstition. What I blame you for is this—that you have attempted to lessen the authority of the Bible by ridicule, more than by reason.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Religious influences===
Paine's [[Quaker]] upbringing predisposed him to [[deist]]ic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious [[English dissenters|Dissent]]. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the [[Simplicity in speech|Quakers' esteem for plain speaking]], a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in ''The Age of Reason'', influenced his writing even more. As the historian [[E. P. Thompson]] has put it, Paine "ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; His description of the story of the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] demystifies biblical language: it is "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 156; see also Claeys, 102–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Quaker [[conversion narrative]]s also influenced the style of ''The Age of Reason''; Davidson and Scheick argue that its "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in ''The Age of Reason'', most importantly a [[millenarianism|millennial]] language that appealed to his lower-class readers. Claiming that true religious language is universal, Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 183; Fruchtman, 4, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sermon]]ic quality of Paine's writing is one of its most recognizable traits. [[Sacvan Bercovitch]], a scholar of the sermon, argues that Paine's writing often resembles that of the [[jeremiad]] or "political sermon". He contends that Paine draws on the [[Puritan]] tradition in which "theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God".&lt;ref&gt;Bercovitch, Sacvan. ''The American Jeremiad''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press (1978), xiv; see also Fruchtman, xi.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a [[Methodist]] preacher, although this suspicion cannot be verified.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
''The Age of Reason'' provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.&lt;ref name=DS1819/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 210; Claeys, 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
[[Image:CruikshankPaine.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[George Cruikshank]] cartoon attacking Paine; The caption reads: "The Age of Reason; or, the World turned Topsy-turvy exemplified in Tom Paine's Works!"|alt=A caricature showing the world in flames, people hanged in the background, people burning and attacking a crucifix, a sign reading "No Christianity, No Religion, No King", and scores of people standing upside down.]]

Paine's ''Age of Reason'' sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of [[government]] prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I).&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 187–88; Davidson and Scheick, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a [[Biblical literalism|literal reading of the Bible]], citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks against Paine, describing him "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[English dissenters|Dissenters]] such as [[Joseph Priestley]] who had endorsed the arguments of the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' turned away from those presented in ''The Age of Reason''. Even the liberal ''[[Analytical Review]]'' was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 184–85, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to ''The Age of Reason'', some scholars have argued that [[Constantin Volney|Constantin Volney's]] deistic ''The Ruins'' (translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as [[Thomas Spence|Thomas Spence's]] ''Pig's Meat'' and [[Daniel Isaac Eaton|Daniel Isaac Eaton's]] ''Politics for the People'') was actually more influential than ''The Age of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Mee, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Bindman, ''The Ruins'' "achieved a popularity in England comparable to ''Rights of Man'' itself".&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; One minister complained that "the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication [as ''The Age of Reason''] was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments" (other popular reform causes).&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Claeys, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[Richard Carlile|Richard Carlile's]] 1818 trial for publishing ''The Age of Reason'' that Paine's text became "the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators".&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold in just a few months.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of ''The Age of Reason'' into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have "sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the ''Age of Reason''".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Marsh, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the nineteenth century, points out, "at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself 'abusive' and 'outrageous.' The ''Age of Reason'' struggle almost tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'common,' and 'vulgar' took on a pejorative meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison, but spent six years instead because he refused any "legal conditions" on his release.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's new rhetoric came to dominate popular nineteenth-century radical journalism, particularly that of [[Freethought|freethinkers]], [[Chartism|Chartists]] and [[Robert Owen|Owenites]]. Its legacy can be seen in [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler|Thomas Wooler's]] radical periodical ''[[The Black Dwarf]]'', [[Richard Carlile|Richard Carlile's]] numerous newspapers and journals, the radical works of [[William Cobbett]], [[Henry Hetherington|Henry Hetherington's]] periodicals the ''Penny Papers'' and the ''[[Poor Man's Guardian]]'', the works of the Chartist [[William Lovett]], [[George Holyoake|George Holyoake's]] newspapers and books on [[Robert Owen|Owenism]], and freethinker [[Charles Bradlaugh|Charles Bradlaugh's]] ''New Reformer''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 94; Wilson, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A century after the publication of ''The Age of Reason'', Paine's rhetoric was still being used: [[George William Foote|George Foote's]] "''Bible Handbook'' (1888) ... systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out 'Contradictions,' 'Absurdities,' 'Atrocities,' and 'Obscenities,' exactly in the manner of Paine's ''Age of Reason''."&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' (founded in 1881 by George Foote) argued, like Paine, that the "absurdities of faith" could be "slain with laughter".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Marsh, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
''The Age of Reason'', despite having been written for the French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that "the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article ... of every man's creed who has any creed at all – ''I believe in God''" (emphasis Paine's).&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Claeys, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 88; Claeys, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still in France, Paine formed the [[Theophilanthropy|Church of Theophilanthropy]] with five other families; this civil religion held as its central dogma that man should worship God's wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible. The church had no priest or minister, and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers.  It celebrated four festivals honoring [[Vincent de Paul|St. Vincent de Paul]], [[George Washington]], [[Socrates]], and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Woll 149; Claeys, 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Adams]] articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed "to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Harrison, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The church closed in 1801, when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] concluded a [[Concordat of 1801|concordat]] with the [[Pope|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Image:T Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale 1791 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]], often identified as an American [[deist]]|alt=1/4 length portrait of Jefferson in 1791, showing him with a shock of red hair and wearing a dark-colored jacket, a yellow vest, and a white shirt. He is looking off toward the left, away from the viewer.]]
In the United States, ''The Age of Reason'' initially caused a deistic "revival", but was then viciously attacked and largely forgotten. Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a "filthy little atheist" by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] over one hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the eighteenth century, America was ripe for Paine's arguments. [[Ethan Allen]] published the first American defense of deism, ''Reason, The Only Oracle of Man'' (1784), but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite. Men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] espoused its tenets, while at the same time arguing that religion served the useful purpose of "social control".&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 8; Kuklick, xiii, xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the publication of Paine's more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America. The public was receptive, in part, because they approved of the secular ideals of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 27, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age of Reason'' went through seventeen editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 256; see also Claeys, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elihu Palmer]], "a blind renegade minister" and Paine's most loyal follower in America, promoted deism throughout the country.  Palmer published what became "the bible of American deism", ''The Principles of Nature'',&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia, built Temples of Reason throughout the nation, and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Foner writes that "''The Age of Reason'' became the most popular deist work ever written. ... Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist; now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable."&lt;ref name=Foner247/&gt; Paine presented deism to the masses and, as in Britain, educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many. Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately after this deistic upsurge, the [[Second Great Awakening]] began. George Spater explains that "the revulsion felt for Paine's ''Age of Reason'' and for other anti-religious thought was so great that a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century." By 1796 every student at [[Harvard]] was given a copy of Bishop Watson's rebuttal of ''The Age of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Spater, 10; see also Claeys, 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, [[Parson Weems]], an early American novelist and moralist, published ''God's Revenge Against Adultery'', in which one of the major characters "owed his early downfall to reading 'PAINE'S AGE OF REASON'".&lt;ref name="Qtd. in Samuels, 184."&gt;Qtd. in Samuels, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's "libertine" text leads the young man to "bold slanders of the bible", even to the point that he "threw aside his father's good old family bible, and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!"&lt;ref name="Qtd. in Samuels, 184."/&gt;

Paine could not publish part III of ''The Age of Reason'' in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him. Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the [[American Revolution]], Paine was now lambasted in the press and called "the scavenger of faction", a "lilly-livered sinical {{sic}} rogue", a "loathsome reptile", a "demi-human archbeast", "an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States [Thomas Jefferson]".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Foner, "Introduction," ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 40; see also Claeys, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1805 [[John Adams]] wrote to his friend [[Benjamin Waterhouse]], an American physician and scientist:
{{quote|
I am willing you should call this the Age of Frivolity as you do, and would not object if you had named it the Age of Folly, Vice, Frenzy, Brutality, Daemons, Buonaparte {{sic}}, Tom Paine, or the Age of the Burning Brand from Bottomless Pit, or anything but the Age of Reason. I know not whether any man in the world has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine. There can be no severer satyr {{sic}} on the age. For such a mongrel between pig and puppy, begotten by a wild boar on a bitch wolf, never before in any age of the world was suffered by the poltroonery of mankind, to run through such a career of mischief. Call it then the Age of Paine.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hawke, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Adams viewed Paine's ''Age of Reason'' not as the embodiment of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] but as a "betrayal" of it.&lt;ref&gt;Gaustad, Edwin S. ''Neither King nor Prelate: Religion and the New Nation, 1776–1826''. Grand Rapids, MI: [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] (1993), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul.  Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in ''The Age of Reason'': "pooh, pooh, it is not true. You were not sent with any such impertinent message. ... Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hawke, 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Age of Reason'' was largely ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, among them [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Thomas D. "Mark Twain and Robert Ingersoll: The Freethought Connection". ''American Literature'' 48.2 (1976): 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Moncure Daniel Conway]], who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C03E6D61E31E033A2575AC1A9609C94639ED7CF Review: Conway's Life of Thomas Paine]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 19 June 1892. Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain, did many of Paine's ideas take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Woll, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; As writer [[Mark Twain]] said, "It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the ''Age of Reason''...I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power." Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' (1889).&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, Harvey J. ''Thomas Paine and the Promise of America''. (Hill and Wang, 2005), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's text is still published today, one of the few eighteenth-century religious texts to be widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Its message still resonates, evidenced by [[Christopher Hitchens|Christopher Hitchens's]] statement that "if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason". His [[Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man": A Biography|2006 book on the ''Rights of Man'']] ends with the claim that "in a time ... when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell, John. "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n23/barr01_.html The Positions He Takes]." ''London Review of Books''. 28.23 (30 November 2006). Retrieved on 20 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theophilus (Gottlieb) Siegfried Bayer'''(1694–1738), was a [[Germans|German]] [[Classics|classical scholar]] with specialization in [[Sinology]].&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/75035/enlarge |title= De Eclipsi Sinica, frontispiece |work= sciencephoto.com |publisher= ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY |accessdate= January 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Sinology|Sinologist]] and professor of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman Antiquities]] at [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] between 1726 and 1737.&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/detailp.cfm?NID=11408&amp;DID=&amp;AID=10030.0 |title= Manuscripts - Name Details - Name: Theophilus Gottlieb Siegfried Bayer  |work= special.lib.gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details==

Bayer was a native of [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]]. His father Johann Friedrich was from the German Protestant minority in Hungary, but had moved to East Prussia where he worked as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.12 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youthful T. S. Bayer was an excellent student at the [[University of Königsberg]], studying Latin, Greek and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.13 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of the [[Königsberg Cathedral]] from 1721 to 1726,&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt; and also worked as a librarian at the [[Königsberg Public Library]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

==Bayer collection==
He had a library of more than 200 manuscripts, Chinese and other [[Orient]]al books, including:
* [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Palm-leaf manuscript]]s
* Oriental history and [[philology]]-related notes
* Correspondence with [[Jesuits]] in [[Beijing|Peking]].

After his death in [[Saint Petersburg]] his widow handed over his books and papers to the Academy authorities, receiving the rest of her husband's pay due that year.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.209 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was later sold to a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] in [[London]], Heinrich Walter Gerdes.  William Hunter later purchased the collection from Gerdes' widow.  It finally reached the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1807 with a brief stay in [[London]] with Dr Matthew Baillie, Hunter's nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/specialcollections/collectionsa-z/bayercollection/ |title= Bayer Collection |work= gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/detaila.cfm?AID=2523.0 |title= GB 0247 MS Hunter B - Collection |work= special.lib.gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''warlock''' is a male practitioner of [[Black magic|evil magic]] (distinguished from a [[wiktionary:wizard|wizard]] or [[wiktionary:sorcerer|sorcerer]], whose magic may be [[White magic|benign]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/warlock|title=warlock - Definition of warlock in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly accepted etymology derives ''[[wiktionary:warlock|warlock]]'' from the [[Old English]] ''[[wiktionary:wærloga|wǣrloga]]'' meaning "oathbreaker" or "deceiver".&lt;ref&gt;Old English ''wǽr-loʒa'' weak masculine (="traitor, enemy, devil, Warr etc.") = Old Saxon ''wâr-logo'' weak masculine or Strong War-arg “ The renderer (=? "deceiver") (once, Hêliand 3817, in plural ''wârlogon'' War-renderer’ applied to the [[Pharisees]]). The first element is probably Old English ''wǽr'' strong feminine (="covenant") = Old High German ''wâra'' Warra ‘’(="truth"), Old Norse ''várar'' strong male/feminine plural ("solemn promise, vow") (cf. ''Vǽringi'' = "confederate, Varangian"); cf. Old Slavic. ''věra'' ("faith). This is a derivative from the adjective represented by Old English ''wǽr'' ("true") (once, Genesis 681; ? a. Old Saxon.) = Old Saxon, Old High German ''wâr'' ("true"): - Old Teutonic '
*Pseudo Prussian “,Varrender-Tsar Varren ; pserr~Vender
*wǣro-'': - Pre-Teutonic ''
*wāro-'' = Latin ''vērus''. The second element (an agent-n. related to Old English ''léoʒan'' ("to lie belie, deny") occurs also in the similar comps. ''áþ-loʒa'', ''tréow-loʒa'' (Old Saxon ''treulogo''), ''wed-loʒa'' (Middle English ''wedlowe''), ("an oath-breaker"), etc. - [http://dictionary.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary, (online) 2nd Edition (1989)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. A derivation from the [[Old Norse]] ''varð-lokkur'', "caller of spirits", has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Cleasby, R.,Vigfusson, G. ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'', London, Macmillan, 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen,M.,''Maal Og Minne'', Bymalslaget, Oslo, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewe, M., Blacker, C.''Oracles and Divination'', p.130 ("'Vardlokkur'...is related to the Scots dialect word 'warlock', wizard, and the meaning is thought to relate to the power to shut in or enclose"), London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4123946 |title=h2g2 - Warlock |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2006-01-22 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organisation founded in 2012 by a group from [[London]], [[England]], ''Who is Hussain'' seeks to "[let] the world know about an inspirational man who lived fourteen-hundred years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|publisher=Who is Hussain|url=http://www.whoishussain.org/the-organisation/about-us/|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily through public advertising, including tube posters on the London Underground, billboards in prominent urban areas and leaflet hand-outs, volunteers refer members of the public to the organisation's website.

==Hussain ibn Ali==

Hussain, son of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] and [[Fatimah]] and the grandson of the Islamic Prophet [[Prophet Muhammad|Muhammad]], lived 1400 years ago in [[Saudi Arabia|Arabia]], and is recognized as an important figure in Islam, as he was a member of the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] (the household of Prophet Muhammad) and [[Ahl al-Kisa]], as well as being the third [[Shia Imam]]. He is most well known for his death in the battle of Karbala, 61 [[Higri|A.H.]]/680 AD, in which Hussain and his companions fought the caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid]] and his army of circa 30,000. ''Who is Hussain'' cites this battle as epitomising Hussain's greatest qualities, saying that while Hussain had little or no hope of victory for himself, it was hoped the stand would shake the nation's conscience to battle the injustice and immorality Hussain felt present in Arabia. According to ''Who is Hussain'' the battle of Karbala laid the foundations for the overthrow of the Caliph's dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kathryn Spellman-Poots|last=Dr|title=‘Who is Hussain?’|journal=The Middle East in London magazine|date=June–July 2013|volume=9|issue=3|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation also seek to highlight other stories of Hussain's life to promote compassion, honour and integrity. For example, "a celebrated example was when he and his brother [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]] cared tirelessly for a poor blind man they came upon in their city, in spite of traditional social expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Full Story - Who is Hussain|url=http://www.whoishussain.org/who-is-hussain/|website=www.whoishussain.org|publisher=Who is Hussain|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and event of Karbala===
The event of [[Battle of Karbala|Karbala]] holds a core concern with water shortage, this is why supply of water is provided without considering race or religion. The organization donated 30,000 bottles of water to the [[Red Cross]] in [[Flint Michigan]] during the water contamination crisis in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rahat Hussain| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/17/rahat-husain-muslims-donate-30000-bottles-water-fl/|title= Muslims donate 30,000 bottles of water to Flint, Michigan, during water crisis|publisher= Washington Times| date= January 17, 2016|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar move was also arranged in [[India]] at local level with the motivation that Hussain stands as a timeless example for all irrespective of their faith or color&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= | url=http://en.abna24.com/service/pictorial/archive/2015/10/31/717814/story.html| title= Who Is Hussain' campaign organized in Hyderabad, India / Photos | publisher= Ahlul Bayt News Agency | date= October 31, 2015 | accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Repeating the tradition of water supply, team of volunteers to introduce their campaign distributed the bottles of water tagged with information about Hussain Ibn Ali in [[Seattle]], Washington, US. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= ABNA|url= http://en.abna24.com/service/pictorial/archive/2016/11/09/790795/story.html|title= Photos: Seattle 'Who is Hussain?' team distributes over 200 water bottles in the name of Imam Hussain|publisher= ABNA 24| date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== #TeamGiveBack ==

In November 2014, ''Who is Hussain'' launched a campaign entitled '#TeamGiveBack'. The aim of the campaign was to engage with the public on social media to identify how Hussain ibn Ali inspired them. The public was invited to donate to Iraq Relief Fund (Iraq being the site of Hussain's shrine). ''Who is Hussain'' encouraged individuals to 'give back' to the community. A variety of events were organised by ''Who is Hussain'' global representatives, including the donation of care packages to the homeless and blood donation drives&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Ping Sien Si - 076 Yang Ren (16137879894).jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Yang Ren (Grand Counselor)]]

'''Yang Ren''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 楊任; [[Pinyin]]: Yáng Rèn) is a character featured within the classic Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''.

Yang Ren is a high-ranking official within the [[Shang Dynasty]] and is known through the title of Grand Counselor. Once the [[Jiang Ziya]] "[[suicide]]" incident was at a close, Yang Ren would investigate the reason. Once a messenger headed to [[Chong Houhu]] explained the entire situation with Yang Ren, Yang Ren would discuss the issue with [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]]. As usual, King Zhou grew exceedingly angry over Yang Ren's logic and immediately demanded for his eyes to be gouged out as punishment. Once this process was performed, Yang Ren would lie on the ground in utter shock while covered in his own blood.

To save any further bloodshed from the loyal official, Yang Ren, Superiorman Insouciant of Mount Green Top, Purple Cave would rescue him with his Yellow Kerchiefed Genie. While Yang Ren was being held within the superiormen's arms, he would blow on Yang Ren's eye sockets and effectively awaken him with a pair of hands that had eyes within the palm—rather than a pair of eyes itself. The superiorman would claim that Yang Ren's time has not been allotted as over under the will of heaven, and thus he will remain as a disciple of Insouciant for the remainder of his time.

Yang Ren was appointed as the [[deity]] of Jiazi Taisui Shen (甲子太歲之神) in the end.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' Chapter 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zulu mythology''' contains numerous [[deities]] commonly associated with animals or general classes of natural phenomena.
[[Unkulunkulu]] is the highest God and is the creator of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Sarah|title=The Mythology Bible: The Definitive Guide to Legendary Tales|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=J7-QIwk7ezkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=%22Zulu+mythology%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pqdng-vMFd&amp;sig=bqopfn5fqxA40-TeaJ20XRAWE_E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqvqnOqrbYAhXEvbwKHXV1Cac4ChDoAQhJMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zulu%20mythology%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 January 2018|year=2009|publisher=[[Sterling Publishing]]|isbn=9781402770029|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unkulunkulu  ("the greatest one") was created in Uhlanga, a huge swamp of reeds, before he came to [[Earth]]. Unkulunkulu is sometimes conflated with the [[Sky Father]] [[Umvelinqangi]] (meaning "He who was in the very beginning"), god of [[thunder]] and [[earthquake]]s. Another name given for the supreme being is uThixo.

Other deities include [[Mamlambo]], the [[goddess]] of [[river]]s, and [[Mbaba Mwana Waresa|Nomkhubulwane]], sometimes called the Zulu [[Demeter]], who is a goddess of the [[rainbow]], [[agriculture]], [[rain]] and [[beer]] (which she invented).
