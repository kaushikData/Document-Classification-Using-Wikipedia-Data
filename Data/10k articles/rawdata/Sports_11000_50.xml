      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13001">The XVI edition of the '''[[Caribbean Series]]''' (''Serie del Caribe'') was played in {{baseball year|1973}}.

The format consisted of 12 games, each team facing the other teams twice, and the games were played at [[Central University of Venezuela|UCV Stadium]] in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. The Series was played to honor the memory of [[Roberto Clemente]], who died on December 31, 1972, during a humanitarian mission to assist victims of the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]].

[[Pedro Borbón]] (2-0) led the pitching staff, while OFs [[Jesús Alou]] and [[Manny Mota]] tied in the race for the batting title, with a .500 average (12-for-24).

In Australian sport, the '''best and fairest''', or '''fairest and best''' in some competitions e.g. [[West Australian Football League]], recognises the player(s) adjudged to have had the best performance in a game or over a season for a given sporting club or competition. The awards are sometimes dependent on not receiving a suspension for misconduct or breaching the rules during that season.

In the [[Australian Football League]] (formerly the VFL), the [[Brownlow Medal]] is awarded to the player who, provided he has not been suspended during the season, receives the most votes from the [[umpire (Australian rules football)|umpires]] for being the Fairest and Best player in games during the [[season (sports)|home and away season]]. In each game, the umpires award three votes to the player they judge to be the best afield in that game, two votes to the second-best player and one vote to the third-best player. The votes are counted at a gala function on the Monday preceding the [[grand final|Grand Final]].  The eligibility of suspended or reprimanded players due to minor offences to win the award has frequently been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brownlow shake-up|date=28 September 2011|first=Jesse|last=Hogan|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/brownlow-shakeup-20110927-1kvfv.html#ixzz2SFLJZtcb|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-02-18/only-tweaking-likely-for-brownlow/1521434|title=Only tweaking likely for Brownlow|date=18 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another "best and fairest" honour, the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]], is voted on by the AFL's players and awarded by their [[trade union]], the [[AFL Players Association]]. Unlike the Brownlow, players who have served disciplinary suspensions during the season are still eligible to win this award.

The oldest such award is the [[Magarey Medal]], awarded to the "Fairest and most brilliant" player in the [[South Australian National Football League]]. The award was created by [[William Ashley Magarey]]—then chairman of the league—and was first awarded in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|title=History of the SANFL|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619232001/http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|archivedate=2010-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the 1980s, the 1990s in boxing's popularity focused on all divisions. When 1980s legends [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Thomas Hearns]], as well as others retired, newer superstars filled the void: [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Julio César Chávez]], in the early 1990s, [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Félix Trinidad]], [[Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] in the mid to late 1990s.

As for the heavyweight division, [[Mike Tyson]]'s reign ends prematurely with the upset loss to [[Buster Douglas]]. Former cruiserweight champion, [[Evander Holyfield]] took over as the undisputed champion of the division, and later built a rivalry against former Olympic silver medalist, [[Riddick Bowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/sports/riddick-bowe-and-other-monsters-dominated-a-decade|title=Riddick Bowe and other monsters dominated a decade|author=Warren Tasker More Warren Tasker|work=Edmonton Journal|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later 1990s was dominated by [[Lennox Lewis]] who unified the division in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vCgM4VYsph8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=Boxing+in+the+1990s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bwkw1PbXTF&amp;sig=oxrZyD76hQ7AiwWKVW5Tzh2rP0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWl7P8lt_LAhUBsxQKHTmNBRI4ChDoAQhJMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Boxing%20in%20the%201990s&amp;f=false|title=The 1990s|publisher=|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw the emergence of the battles between the British super middleweight fighters [[Chris Eubank]], [[Michael Watson]] and [[Nigel Benn]], all of whose careers ended in tragedy.

==List of notable fights by year==

===1990===
*February 10 – [[Buster Douglas]] upsets [[Mike Tyson]] by 10th-round KO in Tokyo, to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. Douglas was a 42–1 underdog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/feb/11/mike-tyson-underdog-buster-douglas-boxing-from-the-vault|title=From the Vault: Mike Tyson is knocked out by 42–1 underdog Buster Douglas|author=Paul Campbell|work=the Guardian|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 31 – ''[[Julio César Chávez vs. Meldrick Taylor|Thunder Meets Lightning]]'': [[Julio César Chávez]] defeats [[Meldrick Taylor]] by 12th-round KO, for the WBC-IBF light welterweight unification.

*November 11 – [[Julian Jackson (boxer)|Julian Jackson]] wins by stunning knockout over [[Herol Graham]] by a devastating 4th-round KO for the vacated WBC middleweight title. Graham, ahead in the fight, was knocked out by Jackson by a devastating right hand and was out for five minutes.

===1992===
*June 19 – [[Evander Holyfield]] successfully defends his undisputed heavyweight championship by unanimous decision over [[Larry Holmes]].

*October 1 – [[Lennox Lewis vs. Frank Bruno|Lennox Lewis beats Frank Bruno]] in the seventh round by a technical knockout. [[Lennox Lewis|Lewis]] was defending his WBC Heavyweight title. It was the first time that two British-born boxers had fought for the world heavyweight title.
*November 6 – [[Evander Holyfield]] defeats [[Riddick Bowe]] by majority decision in their rematch for the WBA and IBF heavyweight titles. A man parachutes to the corner of the ring during the fight and starts a mini riot, the fight is later labelled the [[Fan Man|Fan Man Fight]].

===1994===

[[File:Eljuli 02.jpg|thumb|''[[El Juli]]'', a famous bullfighter]]

A '''bullfighter''' is a performer in the sport of [[bullfighting]].  "'''''Torero'''''" ({{IPA-es|toˈɾeɾo|lang}}) or "'''''toureiro'''''" ({{IPA-pt|toˈɾɐjɾu|lang}}) (both from Latin ''taurarius'', bullfighter) are the Spanish and Portuguese words for bullfighter and describe all the performers in the sport of [[bullfighting]] as practised in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Peru, France, and other countries influenced by Portuguese and [[Spanish culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkeurope.org/feature/bullfighting-in-france-brutal-sport-or-national-culture|title=Network Europe|work=Network Europe|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main performer and leader of the entourage in a bullfight, and who finally kills the bull, is addressed as ''maestro'' (master), or with the formal title '''''matador de toros''''' (killer of bulls). The other bullfighters in the entourage are called ''[[subaltern]]os'' and their suits are embroidered in silver as opposed to the matador's more-theatrical gold. They include the ''[[picador]]es'', ''[[rejoneador]]es'', and ''banderilleros''.

In English, a torero is sometimes referred to by the term '''''toreador''''', which was popularized by [[Georges Bizet]] in his opera ''[[Carmen]]''. In Spanish, the word designates bullfighters on horseback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1901r |title=With the World’s Great Travellers |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35632/35632-h/35632-h.htm |editor1-last=Morris |editor1-first=Charles |editor2-last=Leigh |editor2-first=Oliver H.G. |location=Chicago |publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company |volume=III |page=232 |quote=The actors in the bull-fights are of four classes: ''matadores'', ''banderilleros'', ''picadores'', and ''chulos'', their relative importance being in the order named. The word ''torero'' is a general term for bull-fighters on foot, while ''toreador'' is commonly applied to those on horseback.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is little used today, having been almost entirely displaced by ''rejoneador''.

A very small number of [[List of female bullfighters|women have been bullfighters]] on foot or on horseback; one recent example is [[Cristina Sánchez]]. Female matadors have experienced considerable resistance and public hostility from some aficionados and other matadors.

Usually, toreros start fighting younger bulls (novillos or, more informally in some Latin American countries, vaquillas), and are called ''novilleros''. Fighting of mature bulls commences only after a special match, called "the Alternative". At this same bullfight, the novillero (junior bullfighter) is presented to the crowd as a ''matador de toros''.

The act of bullfighting is not called or considered a stand-alone sport but rather a performance art. There is no contest, simple punctuation, nor any formal classification. Further still, bullfighting, historically, started more with nobles upon horseback, all lancing bulls with accompanying commoners on foot doing helper jobs. As time went by, the work of the commoners on foot gained in importance up to the point whereupon they became the main and only act.  Bullfighting on horseback became a separate and distinct act called "[[rejoneo]]" which is still performed today, although less often.

Bullfighting on foot became a means for poor, able-bodied men to achieve fame and fortune, similar to the role of [[boxing]] in many countries. When asked why he risked his life, one famous ''torero'' reportedly answered, ''Más [[cornada]]s da el hambre'' ("[There is] more goring from hunger"). Today, it is common for a bullfighter to be born into a family of bullfighters.

[[File:Matador.JPG|right|250px|thumb|A matador in the Plaza de Toros [[Las Ventas]], [[Madrid]], in the final stage of the bullfight, the ''tercio de muerte'']]

The established term, ''Maletilla''  or ''espontáneo'', is attributed to those who illegally jump into the ring and attempt to bullfight for their sake and glory. While the practice itself is widely despised by many spectators and fans alike, some, such as ''[[El Cordobés]]'', started their very careers this way.

==Types==
===Matador de Toros===
[[Image:MatadorEarly20thCentury.jpg|thumb|Early 20th-century photograph of a matador, showing traditional outfit]]
A ''matador de toros'' (lit. "killer of bulls", from [[Latin]] ''mactator'', killer, slayer, from ''mactare'', to slay) is considered to be both an artist and an athlete, possessing great agility, grace, and co-ordination. One of the most famous matadors was [[Juan Belmonte]] (1892–1962), whose technique in the ring revolutionized bullfighting and remains an established standard by which a great deal of bullfighters are judged. The style and bravery of the matador is regarded as being, at least, equally important as to whether or not he actually kills the bull. The most successful ''matadores'' used to be treated like [[pop stars]], with matching financial incomes, cult followings and accompanied by lurid [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] stories about their romantic conquests with women. 

Currently, however, even today's top matadors earn less, in real terms, than their peers did in the 1960s—and much of mass media coverage is only limited to a handful of matadors known as the "mediáticos", the sum of which do not necessarily include any of the nation's prized bullfighters in [[Spain]].

The great personal danger of bullfighting adds to the performing matador's mystique; matadores are regularly injured by bulls and, concurrently, 533 professional bullfighters have been killed in the arena since 1700.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Fiske-Harrison|Fiske-Harrison, Alexander]]. [https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/533-professional-bullfighters-killed-in-the-ring-since-1700/ '533 professional bullfighters killed in the ring since 1700'], The Last Arena: In Search Of The Spanish Bullfight blog&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous bullfighters in history, [[Manolete]], died this way in 1947. The most recent bullfighter to die this way was the matador Iván Fandiño on 17 June 2017 in [[Aire-sur-l'Adour]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Fiske-Harrison|Fiske-Harrison, Alexander]], [https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/ivan-fandino-we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you/ 'Iván Fandiño: We Who Are About To Die Salute You…'], The Last Arena: In Search Of The Spanish Bullfight blog&lt;/ref&gt; This hazard is said to be central to the nature and appeal of bullfighting.

The American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a bullfighting aficionado. Within his fictional works, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' features a matador and scenes of bullfighting, as do his short stories ''The Capital of the World'' and ''The Undefeated.'' Outside of fiction, he also wrote at length on the subject in ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Dangerous Summer]]'' (1959).

In 1962, Hollywood producer [[David Wolper]] produced "[[The Story Of A Matador]]", documenting what it's like to be a matador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matadorjaimebravo.com/StoryMatador_IntroPage.html|title=Matador Jaime Bravo Official Website -- "The Story Of A Matador"|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215024905/http://matadorjaimebravo.com/StoryMatador_IntroPage.html|archive-date=15 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it was the late Matador [[Jaime Bravo]].

===Picador===
{{Main|Picador}}

[[File:San marcos bullfight 13.jpg|thumb|A "[[picador]]"]]

A picador is a bullfighter who uses a special [[lance]] called ''pica'' while on horseback to test the bull's strength and to provide clues to the matador on which side the bull is favoring. They perform in the tercio de varas which is the first of the three stages in a [[Spanish-style bullfighting|Spanish bullfight]]. The shape of the lance or pica is regulated by Spanish law to prevent serious injury to the bull which was viewed as unfair cheating in the past. The bull will charge the horses in the ring and, at the moments prior to contact, the picador lances the bull in a large muscle at the back of the neck; thus begins the work of lowering his head. The picador continues to stab at the bull's neck leading to the animal's first major loss of blood. During this time, the bull's injured nape will fatigue—however, as a result of the enraged bull charging, the picador's horse will tussle with avoiding the bull throes at trying to lift the horse with its horns.{{clarification needed|date=April 2017}} The enduring loss of blood and exertion gradually weakens the bull further and makes it ready for the next stage.

In order to protect the horse from the bull's horns, the horse is surrounded by a 'peto' – a mattress-like protection. Prior to 1928, horses did not wear any protection and a bull would frequently disembowel the opposing horse during this vulnerable stage.

===Banderillero===

[[File:Padilla-band.jpg|thumb|A "banderillero"]]

The banderillero is a torero who plants the banderillas (lit. ''little flags''). These are colorful sticks, usually colored with the flag of the banderillero's birthplace, with a barbed point which are increasingly placed in the top of the bull's shoulder. Banderilleros attempt to place the sticks while running as close to the bull as possible. They are judged by the crowd on their form and bravery. Sometimes a matador, who was a particularly skillful banderillero before becoming a matador, will place some of the banderillas himself. Skilled banderilleros can actually correct faults in the manner in which the bull charges by lancing the bull in such a way that the bull ceases hooking to one side, and thereby removing a potential source of danger to the matador by limiting the bull's offensive movements.

==Costume==
Because of the decorations and elaborateness of the costume, the Spanish call the torero's outfit as ''[[traje de luces]]'', meaning the "suit of lights". Though undoubtedly flamboyant, matador costume structure provides great ease of movement.

'''CHI Health Center Omaha''' is an [[arena]] and [[convention center]] in the central [[United States]], located in the North Downtown neighborhood of [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Operated by the Metropolitan Entertainment &amp; Convention Authority (MECA), the {{convert|1,100,000|sqft|-3|adj=on}} facility has an 18,975-seat arena, a {{convert|194,000|sqft|abbr=on}} exhibition hall, and {{convert|62,000|sqft|abbr=on}} of meeting space.

The complex opened {{Time ago|2003|spellout=yes}} in 2003 as '''Qwest Center Omaha''', and adopted the name of '''CenturyLink Center Omaha''' on July 15, 2011, as part of a {{nowrap|$22 billion}} buyout of [[Qwest]] by [[List of CenturyLink operating companies|CenturyLink]] (formerly CenturyTel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Name Change Coming For Qwest Center Omaha| last=Sabin| first=Jeff| url=http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Name_Change_Coming_For_Qwest_Center_Omaha_118617114.html| work=[[WOWT]] News| date=March 24, 2011|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news| title=MECA prepares for new CenturyLink Center naming rights contract| first=Roseann| last=Moring| newspaper=[[Omaha World-Herald]]| date=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, [[CHI Health]] bought the naming rights to the arena under a 20-year agreement worth $23.6 million,&lt;ref name="CHI Health deal"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omaha.com/livewellnebraska/health/so-long-centurylink-center-chi-health-buys-omaha-arena-naming/article_6dd7ef51-d7c1-5e39-a284-cf3ca50f7deb.html|title=So long, CenturyLink Center.

Just west of the [[Missouri River]], the [[elevation]] at street level is approximately {{convert|1000|ft|-1|spell=in}} above [[sea level]].

The arena hosts [[basketball]] and [[Ice hockey|hockey]] games, [[professional wrestling]] events, [[concert]]s, and the annual shareholders' meeting of Omaha-based conglomerate [[Berkshire Hathaway]], usually held on the first Saturday of May.

The arena's primary tenant is the [[Creighton University]] [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|men's basketball team]]. Through the 2014–15 NCAA ice hockey season, the [[Omaha Mavericks men's ice hockey|Omaha Mavericks men's ice hockey team]], representing the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]], was also a primary tenant, but the Mavericks moved to the new [[Baxter Arena]] effective with the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref name="UNO arena"&gt;{{cite web |title=UNO Community Arena |url=http://www.unomaha.edu/athletics/arena.php |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Omaha]] |accessdate=February 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219160901/http://www.unomaha.edu/athletics/arena.php |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.omavs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=31400&amp;ATCLID=210447114 |title=Mavericks, Baxter Share Spotlight in 4-2 Win |publisher=[[Omaha Mavericks|Omaha Athletics]] |date=October 23, 2015 |accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, Omaha voters approved a $216 million bond issue to build a new convention center and arena; the remainder of the $291 million project was provided by private organizations and individuals. The facility design was led by architectural firm [[DLR Group]].  Naming rights to the arena were purchased by Qwest.

Qwest Center Omaha opened in September 2003 with an initial [[seating capacity]] of 17,000 for concerts, 15,500 for [[basketball]], and 14,700 for [[ice hockey|hockey]]. In 2006, a $5.7-million expansion of the arena increased capacity by approximately 1,500 seats.

The Qwest Center displaced the 1954 [[Omaha Civic Auditorium]] as the city's premier indoor arena.  The venerable [[Ak-Sar-Ben (arena)|Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum]] closed in 2002 and was demolished in 2005.

==Notable events==
The arena has hosted games in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] four times: first- and second-round games in [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]], [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2012]], and [[2015 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2015]]; and Midwest Regional games (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) in [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]].  The arena also hosted the 2010 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships, and was home to the [[WWE]] [[Judgment Day (2008)|Judgment Day 2008]] pay-per-view, as well as other events from WWE.

===Summer Olympics Swimming Trials===
The center hosted the nationally televised [[USA Swimming]] Summer Olympics trials in [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] and [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]].  The center does not have permanent swimming facilities and a team of 200 workers with oversight by Myrtha Pools constructed them in two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/construction-begins-us-olympic-swimming-trials-pool-venue| title=Construction begins on U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials pool venue| publisher=[[NBC Sports]]| first=Rachel| last=Lutz| date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which specializes in the construction and dismantling of large scale temporary pools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.myrthapools.com/en/types/temporary-pools/| title=Temporary swimming pools construction| publisher=Myrtha Pools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Omaha Fire Department pumped in two million gallons of water from hydrants around the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Fire truck begins filling U.S. Olympic Trials pool| url=http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2016/06/07/olympic-trials-pool-video-fire-truck-swimming-omaha/| first=Nick| last=Zaccardi| date=June 7, 2016| work=NBC Sports| accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=U.S. Olympic Trials Pool in Omaha Begins Construction 3 Weeks Out| url=https://swimswam.com/u-s-olympic-trials-pool-in-omaha-begins-construction-3-weeks-out/| first=Karl| last=Ortegon| date=June 1, 2016| work=Swim Swam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 event averaged more than 12,000 spectators each night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=U.S. Olympic Trials Will Return to Omaha in 2012| url=http://usaswimming.org/ViewNewsArticle.aspx?TabId=865&amp;itemid=2683&amp;mid=2430| publisher=USA Swimming| date=June 25, 2009| accessdate=March 20, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402222645/http://usaswimming.org/ViewNewsArticle.aspx?TabId=865&amp;itemid=2683&amp;mid=2430| archive-date=2015-04-02| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A storm damaged a portion of the roof known as ''The Hat'' on June 27, 2008.  There was no structural damage, but the damage caused water to pour into parts of the Qwest Center, flowed down two sets of arena steps and onto the deck of the competition pool for the [[USA Swimming]] [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic]] Trials.  The schedule for the trials went on as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Severe Storm in Omaha Damages Swimming Arena| first=Beth| last=Harris| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2008-06-27-162924615_x.htm| newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date=June 27, 2008| accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pools were dismantled after the event and moved to other cities for permanent installation with the 2008 pool going to the Poseidon Swimming facility in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Pool naming rights given to longtime swim family| first=Wendy| last=Reuer| date=December 15, 2015| url=http://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/3904233-pool-naming-rights-given-longtime-swim-family| work=West Fargo Pioneer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2012 pool going to Charles River Aquatics in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title=2012 Trials Pool Finds Permanent Home at USA Swimming Club| url=http://www.usaswimming.org/viewnewsarticle.aspx?tabid=0&amp;itemid=3746&amp;mid=8712| date=September 15, 2011| publisher=USA Swimming| access-date=2016-07-24| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814155141/http://www.usaswimming.org/viewnewsarticle.aspx?tabid=0&amp;itemid=3746&amp;mid=8712| archive-date=2016-08-14| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 pool going to the Hulbert Aquatic Facility in [[West Fargo, North Dakota]] (West Fargo bought the pool via a local group of swim enthusiasts called UP Aquatics for $900,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.inforum.com/news/3917371-local-swim-group-purchases-olympic-trials-competition-pool-west-fargo| title=Local swim group purchases Olympic Trials competition pool for West Fargo| first=Wendy| last=Reuer| date=January 6, 2016| work=[[The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
In 2001, construction began on the new convention center and arena, known as the "Omaha Arena and Convention Center". Architectural firm [[DLR Group]] spearheaded the design, while [[Thornton Tomasetti|The Thornton-Tomasetti Group]] served as structural engineer. M–E Engineers, Inc. was the services engineer and a local company, [[Kiewit Corporation]], led general construction. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 1, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theomahachannel.com/oma/news/stories/news-51760720010301-130347.html |title=Arena Plans Take Next Step |date=March 1, 2001 |website=[[KETV]] News |access-date=January 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010303144248/http://theomahachannel.com/oma/news/stories/news-51760720010301-130347.html |archive-date=March 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue was completed in August 2003, with an official opening on September 24, 2003.

In 2006, the MCEA funded a project to expanded the arena and add an additional 1,472 seats to the upper bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/1617996.html |title=Qwest Center To Expand |date=June 9, 2005 |work=WOWT News |access-date=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also included adding restroom facilities and concession stands, as well as updating aesthetics, mechanical systems, and emergency exits. The cost of the project was $6 million. Construction began in May and was completed September 8, 2006.

In 2009, the center saw another renovation with work enveloping the entire building. The $6 million project included new carpet, wallpaper, reupholstered arena seating, and a new scoreboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://omaha.com/article/20091109/NEWS01/711099973 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111161743/http://omaha.com/article/20091109/NEWS01/711099973 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 11, 2009 |title=Qwest ready for face-lift |last1=Tysver |first1=Robynn |date=November 9, 2009 |work=Omaha World-Herald |access-date=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this match broke an attendance record set in 2008, when 17,340 fans watched the [[2008 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament#Final Four – Qwest Center, Omaha, Nebraska|NCAA semifinal]] match between [[Penn State Nittany Lions women's volleyball|Penn State]] and Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=2008 NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship Match Notes| url=http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/w-volley/recaps/122108aac.html| publisher=Pennsylvania State University Department of Athletics| date=December 20, 2008| accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charrua Rugby Clube''' is a Brazilian [[rugby union]] club from the city of [[Porto Alegre]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. Charrua was founded in June 1, 2001 and they are the first [[rugby football|rugby]] club in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

== History ==
At the year of 2000, a group of friends, led by Nilson Taminato (former player of Rio Branco Rugby Clube) and Mauro Croitor, gathered to start practicing rugby, and on June 2, 2001, they officially founded the Charrua Rugby Clube. They first match was against [[Desterro Rugby Clube|Desterro]] and the first Charrua try was scored by Edson Taminato (Nilson's brother). The Club is affiliated to the [[Brazilian Rugby Confederation]]. 

The club's slogan, which uses local and informal terms, is "''Não 'tá morto quem peleia!''" ("''Not dead, he who fights''") and is shouted at the end of each practice, and the beginning and ending of their games. Their colors are a tribute to the city derby [[Grenal]].

Concerned about their social responsibilities to Charrua since its foundation, the club engages in actions such as the Campaign for Food and Sweaters.

[[File:Chin-ups.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A chin-up with palms facing chest, using open grip.]]
The '''chin-up''' (also known as a '''chin''' or '''chinup''') is a [[Weight training|strength training]] exercise. People frequently do this exercise with the intention of strengthening muscles such as the [[latissimus dorsi]] and [[biceps]], which extend the shoulder and flex the elbow, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pullupbar-chinupbar.com/articles/muscles-worked-in-a-pull-up/|title=Muscles worked in a Pull-Up|accessdate=10 July 2014|quote=During a Pull-Up the muscles that are mainly worked are those of the upper body and the arms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a form of [[pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]] in which the range of motion is established in relation to a person's chin.

Both pull-ups and chin-ups are among the best{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} exercises for back and overall upper body conditioning. However, they target the muscles a bit differently. Both exercises will work the latissimus dorsi and biceps, but standard chin-ups&amp;mdash;with an underhand grip&amp;mdash;place more emphasis on the biceps.

==Etymology==
A chin-up is named by bringing the chin up through space, specifically in relation to its position with the bar or other hand grips. This can be either touching the bar (more easily done by extending the neck, though that could be considered cheating) or by bringing the chin over the bar. This exercise is easier for males than females because of the male tendency to have stronger and larger biceps.

This is usually achieved most easily with vertical forearms that are close to the body. For most, bringing the chin this high is most easily achieved with a [[supination|supinated]] (underhanded, palms-toward) grip. Due to this, the phrase "chin-up" has become associated with pulling with this type of grip. Some have delegated the term pull-up to refer to the [[pronation|pronated]] (overhanded, palms-away) grip. In spite of this, many refer to pull-ups with a pronated grip also as chin-ups, and the supine grip is still regularly called a pull-up.

Some organizations such as the [[American Council on Exercise]] have adopted this new terminology, issuing statements such as: "''a chin-up differs from a pull-up in that the puller's hands are facing towards him or her in a chin-up, and away in a pull-up.''"&lt;ref name="ACE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/190/chin-ups |title=Chin-up |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[United States Marine Corps]], however, use the term pull-up interchangeably to refer to both the overhand and underhand grips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/MCO%20P6100.12%20W%20CH%201.pdf |title=USMC fitness PDF Chapter 2 |quote=a command will not mandate that Marines must use the overhand grip when executing pull-ups or flexed-arm hang |date=10 May 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522145154/http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/MCO%20P6100.12%20W%20CH%201.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
A chin-up has a variety of different [[form (exercise)|form]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/BWUnderhandChinup.html exrx.net defines Chin-Up].&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement begins with the arms extended above the head, gripping a hold. It may be fixed, such as a [[chin-up bar]] or moving, such as [[gymnastic rings]] or rotating handles.

The body is pulled up, with the bar approaching or touching the upper chest. A chin-up is considered complete based on a variety of criteria in relation to where the chin should be in respect to the bar, or in respect to the hand grips.

The body is then lowered until the arms are straight but not in a lockout, and the exercise is generally repeated.

Like any pull-up, chin-ups can be performed with a kip, where the legs and back flop around to aid the exercise, or from a dead hang, where the body is kept still. Performing the chin-up correctly can be tricky with a supinated grip, because of the natural tendency to do most of the work with the elbow flexors (largely biceps) rather than the shoulder extensors (largely lats).

Initiating the pulling action with scapular depression may help avoid this problem. The exercise is most effective in stretching the working muscles when the body is lowered down to a full extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://build-muscle-gain-weight.com/back-muscles/how-to-perform-pull-ups-chin-ups.html|title=Build-muscle-gain-weight.com|author=|date=|website=build-muscle-gain-weight.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grip and thumb position==
A closed grip involves the thumb on the opposite side of the bar from the rest of the fingers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Muscles targeted==
Chin-ups, like most pull-ups, target the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] of the back as a shoulder extensor, scapular downward rotator and scapular depressor, in bringing the spine to the humerus. This is assisted by elbow flexors ([[brachialis muscle|brachialis]], [[brachioradialis]], [[biceps brachii muscle|biceps brachii]]) which bring the humerus to the forearm. Chin-ups, unlike pull-ups, also highly target the biceps. That is one of the main differences between [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-ups]] and chin-ups.

The lat's functions are also assisted, both by shoulder extensors ([[teres major muscle|teres major]], posterior [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]], [[infraspinatus muscle|infraspinatus]], [[teres minor muscle|teres minor]]), scapular downward rotators ([[rhomboid muscle|rhomboid]]s, [[levator scapulae muscle|levator scapulae]]), and scapular depressors (lower [[trapezius muscle|trapezius]] and [[pectoralis muscle|pectoralis]] muscles).

Pulling higher with a narrow grip puts the focus on extension rather than adduction of the shoulder.

If one leans back at the top of the movement, the focus is shifted somewhat towards scapular retraction and hyperextension.

The weight of the legs and pelvis are borne by spinal ligaments and various muscles that flex or extend the spine. If the pelvis is tilted anterior and the legs brought behind, the [[erector spinae]] (with aid from the lats) bears more weight. If the pelvis is tilted posterior and the legs brought in front, the [[rectus abdominis]] (with aid from the psoas) bears more.

==Variations==
*{{anchor|Sternum}}'''Sternal chin-ups''' (also called '''sternum chins''')&amp;nbsp;— this variant employs a fuller range of motion at the top, raising beyond the chin and touching the sternum to the bar. The elbows are nearly directly below the shoulders this way. This requires adequate scapular depression. If leaning back (arching the spine) a sternum-up can be done that is not a chin-up, this shifts to requiring scapular retraction.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Gironda-sternum-chins-2.png
Gironda-sternum-chins-1.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

*'''Weighted chin-ups'''&amp;nbsp;— weight is added dangling from a dipping belt or via weighted belt or vest, ankle weights, chains, medicine ball between the knees, dumbbell between the feet or kettlebells on top of the feet.
*'''One-arm chin-ups'''&amp;nbsp;— one hand grips the bar and the other hand does not assist
*'''One-hand chin-ups'''&amp;nbsp;— One hand grips the bar while the other arm assists by grabbing the forearm of the arm hanging onto the bar. These require far less strength than a one-arm chin-up.
*'''Spine chin-ups'''&amp;nbsp;— in the [[supine position]], the arms are held perpendicular to the body as the grip the bar; instead of the chin, the chest is pulled towards the bar. This exercise is performed in the horizontal ([[Anatomical terms of location#Planes|transverse]]) plane, whereas other chin-up variations are performed in the vertical ([[Anatomical terms of location#Planes|coronal]]) plane. As a result, this variation recruits the [[trapezius]] and [[teres major]] muscles much more than a vertical chin-up would, and is more commonly known as the [[supine row]]. Advanced versions popular amongst gymnasts are performed completely off the ground in some type of [[front lever]].
*'''Harrison chin-ups'''&amp;nbsp;— a term coined by powerlifter Dan Harrison, this technique is similar to a normal chin-up but with an arched spine to more effectively{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} target the latissimus dorsi and take strain off the biceps. Though it has become a recent phenomenon on the West Coast of the United States (especially with [[beach]]-goers), it has not yet gained widespread popularity.

==Training and performance==
Specific training is needed in order to increase chin-ups performance.

The performance can be measured in various ways:
*number of repetitions without touching the floor
*number of repetitions in a specified time interval (1/3/30 minutes, 1/6/12/24 hours)
*number of repetitions with a total weight (body weight plus additional weight)

Various organizations like [[Guinness World Records]] maintain lists of world records for chin-ups and [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-ups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/chinups.html|title=World Records for Chin-Ups and Pull-Ups|first=Ralf|last=Laue|date=|website=www.recordholders.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both recordholders.org and [[Guinness World Records]] maintain that pull-ups use a pronated grip, while chin-ups use a supinated grip.

== Chin-ups in fitness assessments ==
The chin-up exercise is used by uniformed services around the world to assess the physical fitness of its members.  In order to be accepted into and remain in a particular service, a candidate may need to carry out a certain number of chin-ups to a prescribed technique.  This number may vary with age and gender.

*for US Rangers, the [[Ranger Physical Fitness Test]] requires candidates to complete at least six chin-ups in two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-special-operations/army-ranger-pft|title=Army Ranger PFT|author=|date=|website=military.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* for the [[United States Secret Service]], candidates are required to execute chin-ups with their arms fully extended in the downwards phase.  No time limit is required.  To achieve a 'fair' rating, male candidates need to complete seven chin-ups (if aged from 20 to 29), six (30 to 39), four (40 to 49) or two (over 50).  Female candidates, irrespective of age, need to complete two chin-ups &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/join/training/fitness|title=Physical Fitness Evaluation|author=|date=|website=www.secretservice.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Australian navy clearance divers and special forces are required to complete six chin-ups (or 'heaves').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/mobile/recruitment-centre/how-to-join/fitness-test.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* Canadian parachutists are required to demonstrate at least seven chin-ups&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cfmws.com/en/AboutUs/PSP/DFIT/Fitness/Correspondence/Documents/Parachutist/PARACHUTIST%20PHYSICAL%20FITNESS%20TEST.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

Chin-up bars are [[playground]] equipment that were once ubiquitous on [[child]]ren's playgrounds. They are still important in the adult equivalent of a playground, the [[Par course]]. A chin-up bar is simply a smooth horizontal metal bar, often a [[plumbing|pipe]], held solidly above ground by a wooden or metal frame. Typical installations include 2 or 3 different heights of bars for people of different heights. Chin up bars are also a part of a home gym setup. Types of chin-up bars include doorway-mounted, wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted and free-standing.

The '''Circuit de Charade''', also known as '''Circuit Louis Rosier''' and '''Circuit Clermont-Ferrand''', is a [[motorsport]] [[race track]] in [[Saint-Genès-Champanelle]] near [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Charade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/europe/france/charade.html |title=Charade |publisher=racingcircuits.info |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedhunters.com/2013/08/the-volcanic-rush-of-clermont-ferrand/ |title=The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand |publisher=speedhunters.com |accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circuit, built around the base of an extinct volcano, was known for its challenging layout which favored the most skillful drivers and motorcyclists.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; It hosted the [[French Grand Prix]] four times and the [[French motorcycle Grand Prix]] ten times.

==Circuit history==
There had been local interest in motorsport racing beginning with proposals in 1908 for a race on a [[street circuit]], although the proposals were never enacted.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt; Efforts were renewed after the Second World War when the President of the Sports Association of the Automobile Club of Auvergne, Jean Auchatraire, and accomplished racer [[Louis Rosier]] designed a course by adapting pre-existing roads around the [[Puy de Dôme]], an extinct [[volcano]] which dominated the city skyline.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Charade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theracingline.net/racingcircuits/archives/Charade/history.html |title=A Brief History of Charade |publisher=theracingline.net |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in May 1957 and the first race was held in July 1958 when an [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]] was won by [[Innes Ireland]] in a [[Lotus Eleven|Lotus 1100]], and a [[Formula Two]] race won by [[Maurice Trintignant]] in a [[Cooper T43]].&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;

Originally, the 8.055&amp;nbsp;km (5.005-mi) long circuit was described as an even twistier and faster version of the [[Nürburgring]].&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Circuit Charade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/france/motorsport/circuit/1285.html |title=Circuit Charade |publisher=espn.co.uk |accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a relentless number of sharp curves and elevation changes and with almost no discernible straights, the circuit was both feared and respected by competitors.&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Circuit Charade"/&gt; The [[Sinuosity|sinuous]] track layout caused some drivers like [[Jochen Rindt]] in the [[1969 French Grand Prix]] to complain of [[motion sickness]], and wore open face helmets just in case.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; Despite the numerous curves, the track was relatively fast with [[Chris Amon]] setting the lap record in a [[Matra MS120]] with a 104&amp;nbsp;mph average during the [[1972 French Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/1972/races/307/france/fastest-laps.html |title=1972 French Grand Prix fastest laps |publisher=formula1.com |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1969 book ''Motor Cycle Racing'', Peter Carrick wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The French Grand Prix circuit at Clermont Ferrand was seen to be in complete contrast to the lap at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], when it was first used in 1959: the longest straight was 650 yards and a variety of really tight corners quickly demonstrated—or exposed—a rider's skill!&lt;ref&gt;Carrick, Peter ''Motor Cycle Racing'' Hamlyn Publishing 1969/70 p.91 {{ISBN|0 600 02506 3}} Accessed 2013-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The venue first gained international prominence when it hosted the [[French motorcycle Grand Prix]] in [[1959 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1959]], won by [[John Surtees]] riding an [[MV Agusta]].&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/Results+Statistics/1959/FRA/500cc |title=1959 French motorcycle Grand Prix |publisher=motogp.com |accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circuit would host the French motorcycle Grand Prix ten times between 1959 and [[1974 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1974]].&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt; In 1959, [[Stirling Moss]] competed on the track for the first time and declared: "I don't know a more wonderful track than Charade".&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Charade"/&gt; Also in 1959, [[Ivor Bueb]] winner of the [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans]], died following a crash at the Charade Circuit.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Charade"/&gt; The death would mark the only driver fatality at the circuit.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Charade"/&gt; The only motorcyclist fatality occurred when Marcelin Herranz was killed on June 1, [[1963 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1963]] during the 250cc race of the French motorcycle Grand Prix.&lt;ref name="herranz"&gt;{{cite news | title=French Cycle Racer Killed in Crash |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 2, 1963 |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1964 Trophées d'Auvergne]] Formula 2 race podium was a sign of things to come: [[Denny Hulme]], [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Jochen Rindt]] showed their skill before the circuit hosted its first [[Formula 1]] race when [[Jim Clark]] won the [[1965 French Grand Prix]] for [[Team Lotus]].&lt;ref name="formula1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula2.net/F264_13.htm |title=GP d'Auvergne |publisher=Formula 2 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/1965/races/228/france/race-result.html |title=1965 French Grand Prix |publisher=formula1.com |accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[John Frankenheimer]] filmed a small part of his movie ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' in front of 3000 locals, who posed as race spectators watching actors like [[Yves Montand]] and [[Françoise Hardy]].&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; In total four Formula One French Grand Prix were held at Charade, in [[1965 French Grand Prix|1965]], [[1969 French Grand Prix|1969]], [[1970 French Grand Prix|1970]] and [[1972 French Grand Prix|1972]].

While the circuit's natural setting created conditions for a sinuous, challenging race course, it also created safety concerns due to the dark, volcanic rocks which fell from the mountain onto both sides of the track.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt; The rocks meant that tire punctures were a perennial hazard at the Charade Circuit, as was shown when 10 competitors suffered punctures during the 1972 French Grand Prix.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; Drivers who skirted the track edge would send rocks flying in the middle of the road and into the path of pursuing competitors. In the most serious incident at the 1972 French Grand Prix, a stone thrown from [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]'s Lotus penetrated the helmet visor of [[Helmut Marko]], blinding him in the left eye and ending his racing career.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; The mountainous topography also left no room to provide safe [[run-off area]]s in the event of competitors losing control of their vehicles and unintentionally leaving the race course.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt;

The venue became increasingly shunned by international racing series as concerns about the public roads' dangerous nature rose.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt; In 1971, the newly-built and much safer [[Circuit Paul Ricard]] held the French Grand Prix for the first time, before becoming the event's permanent home from 1973 to 1990, alternating the French Grand Prix with the Circuit [[Dijon-Prenois]].&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Ricard Circuit History|url=https://www.circuitpaulricard.com/en/page-history-circuit-paul-ricard.html|website=www.circuitpaulricard.com|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to host smaller motorsports competitions such as [[Formula 3]], [[sports car racing]], [[touring car racing]], [[rallying]] and [[hillclimbing]] as well as the Trophées d'Auverne.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt; In 1980, three [[Motorsport marshal|track marshals]] were killed at a touring car race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/query.php?db=ct&amp;q=circuit_a&amp;n=57 |title=Car and truck fatalities by circuit |publisher=Motorsport Memorial |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1984 there was a drivers protest over track safety. Faced with increasing safety issues and with the natural topography preventing any chance of adding run-off areas, the final race on the original 8&amp;nbsp;km track was held on September 18, 1988.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;

== Modernization ==
[[File:Circuit Charade 1989.png|thumb|right|The modern 3.975 km circuit, first used in 1989]]
The [[Departmental councils (France)|General Council]] of [[Puy-de-Dôme]] recognized the importance of the race track to the local economy and financed the building of a new 3.975&amp;nbsp;km (2.47-mi) circuit utilising only the southern portion of the original, with a new link road completing the circuit.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit|url=http://www.charade.fr/infrastructures/circuit/|website=Circuit de Charade|publisher=Conseil départemental du Puy-de-Dôme|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Circuit de Charade opened in 1989 hosting national championship races in the [[1994 French Supertouring Championship]] and the 1998 [[FFSA GT Championship]].

Currently, the venue holds events such as [[track day]]s, driving courses as well as [[historic motorsport]] events.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; In 2000, the roads were closed to the public, with the track becoming a truly permanent facility with new [[Pit stop|pit garages]] and a widened pit lane.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt; The original sections of the 8&amp;nbsp;km street circuit are still in use as public roadways.&lt;ref name="Charade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Volcanic Rush of Clermont Ferrand"/&gt;

'''Fifth Third Field''' is a [[minor league baseball]] stadium in [[Dayton, Ohio]], which is the home of the [[Dayton Dragons]], a [[Midwest League]] team and a Single-A affiliate of the nearby [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The naming rights are owned by [[Fifth Third Bank]], based in [[Cincinnati]]. In 2011, the Dragons broke the all-time professional sports record for most consecutive sellouts by selling out the stadium for the 815th consecutive game, breaking the record formerly held by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragons Break All-Time Sports Sell-Out Record|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110709&amp;content_id=21669014&amp;vkey=pr_t459&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t459|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=July 9, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723085318/http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110709&amp;content_id=21669014&amp;vkey=pr_t459&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t459|archive-date=2015-07-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dayton Dragons Break Sellout Record |url=http://www.whiotv.com/news/news/dayton-dragons-break-sellout-record/nDLZ8/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209055154/http://www.whiotv.com/news/news/dayton-dragons-break-sellout-record/nDLZ8/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |work=[[WHIO-TV|WHIO]] |location=Dayton |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=March 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With two-deck seating and large [[Luxury box|skyboxes]], some compare it to [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Field|first=Brian|last=Merzbach|url=http://www.ballparkreviews.com/dayton/dayton.htm|work=Ballpark Reviews|accessdate=March 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211145706/http://www.ballparkreviews.com/dayton/dayton.htm|archive-date=2013-12-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Dayton Dragons]] played their first baseball game at Fifth Third Field on April 27, 2000. In attendance was [[Cincinnati Reds]] Hall of Famer [[Johnny Bench]], who caught the ceremonial first pitch.

In their inaugural season, the Dragons managed to sell-out every home game of the 2000 season before the season even started.

Fifth Third Field has hosted the [[Midwest League]] All Star Game twice: in 2001 and 2013.

In 2005, 2007, and 2009, the venue hosted the [[Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Tournament]]. In 2005, [[Rhode Island Rams baseball|Rhode Island]] won the tournament, in 2007, [[Charlotte 49ers baseball|Charlotte]] won, and in 2009 [[Xavier Musketeers baseball|Xavier]] won.&lt;ref name=A10tourney&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Record Book |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/atl10/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/Baseball_Records_thru2011.pdf |publisher=Atlantic 10 Conference |accessdate=February 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65VOAPx1L?url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/atl10/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/Baseball_Records_thru2011.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 |pages=12–3 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 field renovation===
In the 2011–2012 offseason, a new Kentucky Blue Grass playing surface was installed at Fifth Third Field as well as new drainage and irrigation systems.

===2014-2015 video enhancements===
In 2014, over $1.2 million was spent upgrading Fifth Third Field's entertainment control room and adding HD cameras throughout. In 2015, the existing video board was replaced in the off-season with a new 2,054 foot 13HD video board that was three times brighter than the previous board, twice the height and 2½ times the width. Described as featuring the clearest picture ever used on any board in a Minor League Baseball stadium, the board, at the time of installation, was the tallest and widest in a single A facility and in the top five in terms of size for any Minor League Baseball stadium. As of 2015, only three out of 30 Major League Baseball stadiums sported a board of this type.&lt;ref name="videohd"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/redsblog/2015/02/11/dayton-dragons-giant-high-definition-video-board/23237821/|title=Dayton Dragons getting giant HD video board|first=David|last=Clark|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=June 4, 2015|publisher=Cincinnati.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110173900/http://www.cincinnati.com/story/redsblog/2015/02/11/dayton-dragons-giant-high-definition-video-board/23237821/|archive-date=2016-01-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2600">Game Bike is an interactive fitness bike that requires the user to exercise in order to play their [[video games]]. The user must pedal the bike in order for the character to accelerate and must turn the handlebars to steer. The Game Bike allows users to control the character in their game while getting [[exercise]].

==History==
Game Bike is the name of an interactive fitness device first invented and patented by Edward H. (Ted) Parks, M.D. in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent # 6,126,571&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Parks sold the rights to his patent to Cateye Co Ltd, a Japanese company with expertise in electronic bicycle accessories, such as bike lights and speedometers.  Cateye's initial embodiment of Parks' design used a traditional bicycle attached to what they referred to as their GB100 system. The front tire was placed into a turn style platform that was used to read direction. Sensors were placed of the rear wheel which was mounted in a bicycle trainer to measure the speed. Cateye Co Ltd. first started production of the Game Bike in the GB100 form.

The project was then handled by a group in New Jersey that redesigned the product to be a single package incorporated into a stand-alone indoor exercise bike. The GB200 was born. An immediate need for a commercial version was soon covered by the introduction of the popular GB-300 Game Bike.

Late in 2008 Cateye Co Ltd. stopped all international distribution of the fitness line. Game Bike Production was then done by Source Distributors Inc. out of [[Dallas, Texas]]. Source Distributors produced the bike and made modifications to the unit to improve the controller serviceability. The Game Bike is a popular product within the school and YMCA markets. Thousands of bikes were sold in since the start of 2003.

Game Bike is now owned by Hudson Fitness LLC. Game Bike is currently available and Hudson Fitness LLC continues supporting the Game Bike service.

'''Gibraltar Phoenix FC''' are a football club from [[Gibraltar]] who, as of the 2017-18 season, play in the [[Gibraltar Premier Division]] after winning the [[2016–17 Gibraltar Second Division]].

==History==
Gibraltar Phoenix was first founded in 2011 by Club President Nicholas Gaiviso and was officially registered as a Gibraltar Football Associated member in 2012.

The club is made up of individuals who are passionate about football and about playing in a team. This allows the team to pursue their passion for football, but also help with their widely recognised skills such as teamwork.

The clubs aim is to not only be successful and compete at the highest level, but to also enjoy their football and create relationships with the fans, players and coaching staff.

They have, however, the distinction of having competed in their domestic league while failing to score a single draw, never mind a single victory, during a league season.

During the 2013–2014 Phoenix were relegated from the Premier Division and so started 2014–2015 in the Second Division. They finished this season in 4th place 14 points behind the 2nd-place finish which would have secured them promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt.

After a rebrand, Gibraltar Phoenix finished 3rd in the Second Division during the 2015–2016 season one place and six points behind Mons Calpe in second place who were promoted via the playoff and Europa Point who topped the division a further 3 points ahead. The side lost their first two games of the 2016–17 season due to forfeits on account of the new Home Grown Player rule in effect in Gibraltar. Their first game, a 4-1 victory against [[F.C. Hound Dogs|Hound Dogs]], was overturned in Hound Dogs' favour while their second game, against title rivals [[F.C. Magpies|Bruno's Magpies]], was awarded to Magpies without the match taking place. After filling their quota for domestic players, Phoenix saw a turnaround in form which included a club record 20-1 defeat of [[Angels F.C.|Angels]], sitting joint-top of the Second Division at the turn of the year. Phoenix secured the title on the penultimate week of the season after an 11-0 victory over [[College 1975 F.C.|College 1975]], returning to the top flight after a 3-year absence. They finally achieved their first ever top flight points on the opening fixture of the season, in a 2-1 win over [[Mons Calpe S.C.|Mons Calpe]].

The '''Grosser Preis von Berlin''', formerly known as the '''Deutschland-Preis''', is a [[Conditions races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[Germany]] open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged three years or older. It is run at [[Hoppegarten]] over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July or August.

==History==
The event was established in 1888, and it was originally staged at Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin. It was initially contested over 2,000 metres, and was extended to 2,200 metres in 1897. It was transferred to [[Grunewald]] and increased to 2,400 metres in 1909. A new distance of 2,600 metres was introduced in 1927.

The race returned to Hoppegarten in 1934, and it was renamed the Grosser Preis der Reichshauptstadt in 1937. From this point it was run over 2,400 metres, and it reverted to 2,600 metres in 1943.

The event switched to [[Düsseldorf]] and was renamed the Grosser Preis von Nordrhein-Westfalen in 1947. That year's running was over 2,400 metres, and it returned to 2,600 metres in 1948. Its current period over 2,400 metres began in 1965.

The present race grading system was introduced in Germany in 1972, and the Grosser Preis von Nordrhein-Westfalen was classed at Group 1 level. Its original title, the Grosser Preis von Berlin, was restored in 1977.

The event became known as the Deutschland-Preis in 1996. It was held at [[Horner Rennbahn|Hamburg]] and merged with the [[Hansa-Preis]] in 2010. It returned to Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin in 2011.

'''Huish Park''' is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Yeovil]], Somerset, England. The stadium has been home to [[Yeovil Town F.C.]] since its completion in 1990, following their relocation from [[Huish Athletic Ground|Huish]]. Huish Park has a capacity of 9,565 (of which two stands are all-seated, totalling 5,212 seats) with terraces behind each of the goals.&lt;ref name="Capacity" /&gt;

==History==
In January 1985, Yeovil started negotiations to sell the [[Huish Athletic Ground]] and move to a new stadium in the Houndstone area of [[Yeovil]] on the site of an old army camp. Negotiations commenced between the club and Bartlett Construction regarding moving from Huish to a new site at Houndstone Camp, with the first meeting taking place on 12 November 1985 when an offer of £1.3m was made for the Huish site. Following further meetings and more detailed plans being studied the offer was raised to over £2m early in 1986, when the directors agreed in principle for the move to go ahead. A company, Collier &amp; Madge, who specialised in buying and selling supermarket sites was engaged to advise the club and to ensure the best possible price was obtained.

On 15 December 1986 the club was informed by its advisors, Collier and Madge, that the offer of £2.4m now on the table was about as much as they could hope to receive. It was revealed that the new proposed site for the club was 20.75 acres of [[Freehold (law)|freehold land]] at Houndstone Camp with a further 4.2 acres being made available on a 999-year lease. The directors agreed in principle to the deal and [[Tesco]] were insisting that contracts should be exchanged by the end of March 1987 with the building contractors having vacant possession by July 1988. Further discussions took place with [[South Somerset|South Somerset District Council]] regarding developing the new site for recreational use, and they set aside money to purchase the land.

At an [[extraordinary general meeting]] held on 25 August 1987, shareholders gave the go-ahead to "conclude negotiations with F. R. Bartlett Limited for the sale of Huish and to negotiate the development of the Houndstone site". The voting was 14,431 for and 1,356 against, giving a majority of 13,075, representing 91% in favour. On 15 September 1987, the Public Inquiry began which was to delay the proposed move for a long time; two days later the final agreement was signed.

On 21 March 1989, and after a wait of just over 20 months, the result of the Public Inquiry was made known. The Department of the Environment granted planning permission to develop Huish, therefore the move to Houndstone was now on. The first work at the new ground got underway in May 1989 when boreholes were drilled. A month later it was revealed that the cost of the new development had risen to £3.5m and that Bartletts had come forward with a further £400,000 bringing the total for the sale of Huish to £2.8m. On Sunday 1 April 1990, over 500 supporters viewed the new stadium at Houndstone, and it was announced the new stadium would be called '''Huish Park'''.

The new Huish Park Stadium was opened with a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 4 August 1990, ending in a 2–1 defeat in front of a crowd of 5,093. The first competitive match followed on 18 August 1990 with a [[Football Conference]] match against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], the 2–0 win for Yeovil resulted in Mickey Spencer scoring Yeovil's first competitive goal at the new ground. The first season at the new ground resulted in an average attendance of 2,639, an increase of 17.6%,&lt;ref name="Avg Attendances"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciderspace.co.uk/ASP/statistics/average_attendances.asp |title=Yeovil Town Average Attendances |publisher=Ciderspace |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the season finished with an U18 international match between [[England national under-18 football team|England]] and [[Wales national under-18 football team|Wales]] attracting a bumper 6,153 crowd.

The [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000 season]] saw a proposal for the erection of a roof over the home terrace. The work eventually took place in early 2001, with the roof being completed for the match against [[Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C.|Rushden &amp; Diamonds]] with a then record crowd of 8,868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/apr/23/match.sport12 |title=No resolution at Yeovil summit |publisher=The Guardian |date=23 April 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Yeovil's promotion to [[the Football League]], crowds increased by 30% to an average of 6,197 in the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04 season]],&lt;ref name="Avg Attendances" /&gt; and on 25 April 2008 Yeovil's match against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] saw the record attendance at the ground of 9,527.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7358705.stm |title=Yeovil Town 0–1 Leeds United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stands==
The ground is made up of four stands:
* '''Tamburino Stand''' (Main Stand), is a cantilevered covered single tiered stand that is all-seated. The stand has executive boxes running across its back and bar areas, the dug outs and players' tunnel, a small simple electric scoreboard, and it houses the ticket office and club shop.
* '''[[Screwfix]] Community Stand''' (East Stand), similar to the Main Stand in style with a Press Box beneath its roof.
* '''[[Thatchers Cider|Thatchers Gold]] Stand''' (Home Terrace), similar style covered cantilevered terrace for home fans.
* '''Radio Cabs Stand''' (Away Terrace), smaller uncovered terrace with a large electric scoreboard behind.

'''Sportivo Huracán Fútbol Club''', usually known simply as '''Huracán''' and sometimes called as '''Huracán del [[Paso de la Arena]]''', is an [[Uruguay]]an [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Montevideo]]. It was founded in 1954.

==History==
Huracán Fútbol Club was founded on August 1, 1954 through the merger of two clubs composed mainly of young students: the "Club Atlético Charrúa" and "La Esquinita Football Club". The new team's name was inspired by a former club "Huracán" that participated in Uruguayan leagues during early of 20th century. Colors adopted from [[Club Nacional de Football]], because Huracán founders were fans of this Uruguayan giant.

Club was affiliated to the [[Uruguayan Football Association|AUF]] in 1962. Their highest performance was in 1991, when Huracán fought for promotion to [[Uruguayan Primera División]]. However, in the final game at home they lost 0:4 to [[Liverpool Fútbol Club|Liverpool]], while their opponents [[Club Atlético River Plate (Uruguay)|River Plate]] won in [[La Paz (Uruguay)|La Paz]] against [[Club Oriental de Football|Oriental]], achieving promotion.

In 2010 Huracán achieved promotion from Segunda División Amateur (third level) and returns to the Professional Second Division of Uruguay.

From May to August 2011 Huracán merged with [[Club Atlético Torque]] and named ''Huracán Torque'', but later this merge was dissolved. Huracán Torque never played in official games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huracanfc.com/?p=227 Se disolvió la fusión Huracán Torque F.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Intake Ground''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Doncaster]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] between 1885 and 1919, and is still used today as a football field.

==History==
Doncaster Rovers started playing at the Intake Ground in 1885, with their first match against Elsecar on 26 April 1885.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p70, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the sole spectator facility was a small wooden stand, which had to be rebuilt following storm damage in 1891.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

Doncaster Rovers were elected to the Second Division of [[the Football League]] in 1901, by which time the ground had a 1,000-seat main stand on the western touchline, a covered enclosure on the eastern touchline and [[duckboards]] around the perimeter of the pitch. The first Football League game at the Intake Ground played on 7 September 1901 being a 3–3 draw with [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]] in front of 2,000 spectators. The record League attendance at the ground of 6,000 was set on 28 March 1902 for a game against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

Doncaster were voted out of the League at the end of the [[1902–03 Football League|1902–03 season]]. Although the club returned to the League a year later, they were voted out again at the end of the season. The last Football League match at the ground was a 2–0 defeat by [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] on 24 April 1905.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

During [[World War I]] the Intake Ground was requisitioned by the [[British Army]]. In 1919 Doncaster Rovers moved to the Bennetthorpe ground, taking the main stand with them.

'''Long Island Arena''' (also commonly known as the '''Commack Arena''') was a 4,000-seat [[indoor arena]] in [[Commack, New York]] from 1959 until 1996. The [[Long Island Ducks (ice hockey)|Long Island Ducks]] of the [[Eastern Hockey League]], a popular team in the small community, called the Arena home from 1959 until the league folded in 1973, one year after the [[New York Islanders]] came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Teaford |first=Elliott |title=Mighty Ducks '93-94: Premiere Season |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 3, 1993 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-03/news/ss-42595_1_long-island-ducks |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levin |first=Dan |date=March 31, 1969 |title=If You Like Hockey, Basketball And Fierce Fighting Fans, Go Out To Commack, L.I. |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082250/index.htm |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Long Island Cougars]] (an affiliate of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]]'s [[Chicago Cougars]]) also played at the Long Island Arena from 1973 through 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gold |first=Eli |last2=Roberts |first2=M.B. |title=From Peanuts to the Pressbox |year=2009 |publisher=Thomas Nelson |location=Nashville |isbn=1-4016-0436-6 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968–1969, the Commack Arena briefly served as the home of the [[New York Nets]] of the [[American Basketball Association]]. Before the team's move to Long Island, the then-New Jersey Americans had scheduled a game against the [[Kentucky Colonels]] at the Commack Arena on March 23, 1968.  The Americans and Colonels were tied in the standings, and a "play-in" game to determine who would qualify for the playoffs.  The Americans were forced to move the game at the last minute because their normal home, the [[Teaneck Armory]], was booked with the circus. However, when the Colonels and Americans arrived at the arena, they found the court full of holes and laden with condensation from a Ducks hockey game the previous night.  The court was also unstable.  The Colonels refused to take the court under these conditions.  The league ruled that the Americans had failed to provide acceptable facilities and forfeited the game to the Colonels, 2-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=American's Playoff Game in Commack Is Called Off |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D10FE3A5910738DDDAD0A94DB405B888AF1D3 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 24, 1968 |accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Twenty-Five Years Later, Boe Makes Up for Mistake |last=Wojnarowski |first=Adrian |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2003/story?id=1562700 |work=ESPN.com |date=June 3, 2003 |accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Long Island Ducks (basketball)|Long Island Ducks]] of the [[Eastern Basketball Association]] also spent one season playing at Long Island Arena during 1977–1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life Is Grim in the Boondocks of Basketball |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/01/archives/life-is-grim-in-the-boondocks-of-basketball-eyes-on-the-nba-life-is.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 1, 1978 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with hockey and basketball, the Long Island Arena was used for ice skating, the circus, the Suffolk County Fair and concerts.

[[Peter Frampton]] recorded part of his 8x platinum double album, ''[[Frampton Comes Alive]]'', at the arena.

[[John F. Kennedy]] made a visit to the arena on November 6, 1960 while campaigning for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kennedy to Attend a Rally in Suffolk |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 6, 1960 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/11/06/archives/kennedy-to-attend-a-rally-in-suffolk.html |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Long Island Arena housed a large, indoor flea market until the facility closed on July 31, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hernandez |first=Carol |title=Vendors Say Goodbye to the Arena |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |location=Long Island |date=July 14, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shopping center, consisting of [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Hobby Lobby]], and a [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]] supermarket scheduled to open in 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parrish|first=Tory|title=Whole Foods moves forward with new LI locations|url=https://www.newsday.com/business/whole-foods-garden-city-1.17516330|accessdate=2018-05-19|work=[[Newsday]]|date=March 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other stores and restaurants, now stands on the former site of the arena, which was located on the south side of [[New York State Route 454|Veterans Highway]] just west of the [[Sunken Meadow State Parkway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commack NY: Veterans Memorial Plaza - Retail Space - Kimco Realty|url=http://properties.kimcorealty.com/properties/0575|website=properties.kimcorealty.com|accessdate=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Madagascar]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Sydney]]. Its sole representative, [[Aina Onja]], was a blind sprinter who ran the men's 100m sprint in the T11 category. His time of 13.98 was the slowest in the heats, and he did not advance to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=MAD&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Madagascar at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The country was absent from the [[2004 Summer Paralympics|2004 Games]], but returned to the Paralympics in [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]], represented by a single male swimmer. [[Josefa Harijaona Randrianony]] swam in the 50m freestyle (S9 category), and finished last of his heat in 38.06s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=MAD&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Madagascar at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Premier Leagues Northern NSW''' is a regional Australian semi-professional [[association football]] league comprising teams from Northern [[New South Wales]]. As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues]], the league sits at Level 1 on the Northern New South Wales league system (Level 2 of the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian league system]]). The competition is administered by [[Northern NSW Football]], the governing body of the sport in the northern region of the state (the southern region governed by [[Football NSW]]). Prior to 2014, the league was formerly known as the Northern NSW State Football League.

==History==
The league originally started with 12 teams, all with a first grade, reserve grade and youth grade team. The league was then downsized to 10 teams still with all three grades. For the 2009 season it was decided by [[Northern New South Wales Football]] (the governing body) to downsize the league once again to 8 teams in order to improve the quality and give local players a chance to enter the [[A-league]] through the competition. The teams competing in the 2009 season were decided on the second of September 2008, with [[Highfields Azzurri FC]] and Lake Macquarie City Roosters FC being relegated to the [[NewFM Football League]].

Teams were judged on criteria which included facilities/ground (30%), financial status (25%), management (20%), playing strength/coaching staff (15%) and development program (10%). An independent body, chaired by former NSW gaming minister Richard Face, was assigned to make the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/soccer/azzurri-lake-macquarie-dumped-in-soccer-shakeup/1260885.aspx |title=Azzurri, Lake Macquarie dumped in soccer shake-up] |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |publisher=[[The Newcastle Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 2017 season onward the competition once again expanded to 11 teams with [[Lake Macquarie City FC|Lake Macquarie]] being promoted from the [[NewFM Football League]].

==Format==
The competition consists of 11 teams from around the Newcastle and Hunter area who each have a 1st-division side, a reserve team, a youth division team and an U/17 side. A season takes place over 18 rounds, with each team playing each other at home and away. The team that finishes 1st at the end of 18 rounds is declared the minor premier. The top 4 teams at the end of 18 rounds contest the finals series, a home and away knockout system played with the away goals rule (1st v 4th, 2nd v 3rd) with the winners meeting in the grand final. The winner of the grand final is crowned as the major premier.

Nominally the 11th-placed team each year is relegated to the [[NewFM Football League|NewFM Division]], however promotion/relegation has been placed on hold until the 2020 season.

The following 11 clubs are competing in the National Premier Leagues Northern NSW during the 2017 season.

'''Olimpia Basketball Club''', mostly known as '''Olimpia de Venado Tuerto''' ({{IPA-es|oˈlimpja ðe βeˈnaðo ˈtweɾto}}) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[basketball club]] based in the city of [[Venado Tuerto]], [[Santa Fe Province]].

== History ==
The club was established on August 26, 1940 in Barrio San Martín of [[Venado Tuerto]]. In 1991 the team promoted to  [[Liga Nacional de Básquetbol]], the top division of basketball league system. In the 1994–95 Olimpia reached the finals, being finally beat by [[Club Sportivo Independiente]]. 

Olimpia won its first LNB title in 1995–96. The roster for that season was: [[Alejandro Montecchia]], Walter Guiñazú, Federico Helale, [[Jorge Racca]], [[Leonardo Gutiérrez]], [[Lucas Victoriano]], Sebastián Uranga, [[Todd Jadlow]], Andrés Rodríguez, Carlos López Jordan, Alejandro Burgos, and Michael Lamont Wilson. The team was coached by Horacio Seguí while Jorge Racca was named league's [[MVP]]. That same year, Olimpia also won the [[South American Basketball League|South American League]] after defeating [[Brazil|Brazilian]] team [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista (basketball)|Corinthians]] at the final. 

The club also competed in the [[1996 FIBA Intercontinental Cup|1996 edition]] of the [[FIBA Intercontinental Cup]].

Nevertheless, the club then entered into a crisis, due to financial problems. By 2009, Olimpia had a debt of [[Argentine Peso|$]]1.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=467430&amp;seccion=Deportes&amp;fecha=25/06/2009 "Olimpia, del esplendor a la oscuridad"], Ambito Financiero, 2009-06-25&lt;/ref&gt; and due to that critical situation, the basketball team disaffiliated itself from the top Argentine League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-region/Olimpia-orgullo-histoacuterico-de-Venado-Tuerto-busca-salvar-su-presente--20090524-0018.html "Olimpia, orgullo histórico de Venado Tuerto, busca salvar su presente"], La Capital, 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Posterized''' is North American slang&lt;ref&gt;"NBA: Season of the Brick," The Washington Times, November 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; derived from an action in the game of [[basketball]], in which the offensive player "[[slam dunk|dunks]]" over a defending player in a play that is spectacular and athletic enough to warrant reproduction in a printed poster.&lt;ref&gt;"Great Shot! Jordan's Best Amazingly Goes One Better", Washington Post Jun 7, 1991 https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/nba/longterm/jordan/articles/layup91.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originated from [[Julius Erving]], whose high-flying style of play inspired the term.

One of the most famous examples of a player being 'posterized' occurred during the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympics]]. 6-foot-6 [[Vince Carter]], playing for [[United States men's national basketball team|Team USA]], dunked over 7-foot-2 [[Frédéric Weis]] of [[France national basketball team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/13713188/after-15-years-saw-vince-carter-leap-frederic-weis-sydney-believe-witnessed |title=In a Single Bound |first1=Michael |last1=Wallace |first2=Rob |last2=Peterson |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=25 September 2015 |accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posterize used in a sentence: "CJ posterizes fools at Thursday night basketball"

Posterized is also used infrequently to describe similar events in other sports&lt;ref&gt;"Jaguars, Brunell Stand on Wobbly Foundation", Chicago Tribune, Jan 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and has made its way into business writing.&lt;ref&gt;"Team Lucent Tries To 'Be Like Mike'," Communications Today, August 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberts Stadium''' is a 2,356 seat [[soccer-specific stadium]] located on the [[campus]] of [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. It is the home to the [[Princeton Tigers#Soccer|Princeton Tigers men's and women's soccer teams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SportsShorts|volume=108|url={{Google books|hCJbAAAAYAAJ|title=SportsShorts|53|plainurl=yes}}|publisher=Princeton Alumni Weekly|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is named in honor of Thomas S. Roberts '85, a former Princeton goal keeper. The stadium's natural [[grass]] game field, '''Myslik Field''', is named in memory of Robert H. Myslik '90, a soccer alumnus and assistant coach who died in 2003.&lt;ref name="Roberts Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberts Stadium • Home of Princeton Soccer|url=http://www.goprincetontigers.com/facilities/?id=6|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's [[artificial turf]] practice field, Plummer Field, is adjacent to the stadium.&lt;ref name="Roberts Stadium"/&gt;

Roberts Stadium opened September 2, 2008, and was formally dedicated October 4, 2008, following a doubleheader with [[Dartmouth College]]. The stadium replaced the former Lourie-Love Field, which stood on the same grounds. Lourie-Love Field was named after Princeton [[American football|football]] [[alumni]] [[Donold B. Lourie]] and [[George H. Love]], both 1922 graduates. 

In May 2010, the [[United States men's national soccer team]] held a week-long pre-[[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] [[training camp]] at Roberts Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goprincetontigers.com/news/2010/5/27/204951756.aspx|title=THE TIES THAT BIND: THE U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM AND PRINCETON|publisher=goprincetontigers.com|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, the [[United States women's national soccer team]] held a two week-long training camp at the stadium to prepare for an [[international friendly]] against the [[China women's national football team|Chinese women's national football team]] at [[Talen Energy Stadium]] in [[Chester, PA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goprincetontigers.com/news/2012/6/28/205499382.aspx|title=U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM'S VISIT, FROM A PLAYER'S VIEW|publisher=goprincetontigers.com|date=June 28, 2012|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''skatemill''' is a practice utility machine for [[ice hockey]] professional players to improve their [[Ice skating|skating]] techniques, which is very important to achieve the level of skating ability to play on an [[NHL]] team.

Skatemills resemble standard runners' [[treadmill]]s, but wider, longer, and rather than a gripping rubber belt, skatemills have specially designed surfaces that allow players to practice skating techniques on a surface that resembles ice. Skatemills have variable speeds, usually topping out at between 20 and 30 miles per hour, and can also be set to varying inclines to add to the difficulty for the person training. Often, skatemills will include handgrips and a harness system to keep the players from falling while on the skatemill.

Skatemills are currently only commonly found in the training facilities of [[National Hockey League|NHL]] teams; for example, there is a skatemill in [[Vancouver]] for the players of the [[Vancouver Canucks]], and one in [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], Michigan for the benefit of the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. The skatemill has yet to be introduced widely to European hockey players.

Skatemills are becoming very common in hockey training centers on North America as well as in fitness centers. Some companies have created low profile commercial fitness models. These models can be found in fitness centers and gyms around North America.

As of today there are more than 100 skating treadmills around the world.

[[File:Pontiac Woodie.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pontiac]] [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]], used by early surfers.]]

'''Surf culture''' includes the people, language, fashion, and lifestyle surrounding the sport of [[surfing]]. The [[history of surfing]] began with the ancient [[Polynesians]]. That initial culture directly influenced modern surfing, which began to flourish and evolve in the early 20th century, with its popularity spiking during the 1950s and 1960s (principally in [[Hawaii]], [[Australia]], and California). It has affected music, fashion, literature, film, art, and youth [[jargon]] in popular culture. The number of surfers throughout the world continues to increase as the culture spreads.

Surfers' desire for the best possible waves to ride make them dependent on conditions that may change rapidly, given the unpredictable nature of weather events and their effect on the surface of the ocean. Because surfing was limited by the geographical necessity of an ocean coastline with beaches, the culture of beach life often influenced surfers and vice versa. The staff of ''[[Surfer Magazine]]'', founded in the 1960s when surfing had gained popularity with teenagers, used to say that if they were hard at work and someone yelled "Surf's up!" the office would suddenly empty. Localism or territorialism is a part of the development of surf culture in which individuals or groups of surfers claim certain key surfing spots as their own.&lt;ref name=X17TV/&gt;

==Big Wave culture==
[[File:Surfer in california 2.JPG|A surfer in Santa Cruz, [[California]]|thumb|left]]
A non-competitive adventure activity involving riding the biggest waves possible (known as "rhino hunting") is also popular with some surfers.  A practice popularized in the 1990s has seen [[big wave surfing]] revolutionized, as surfers use [[personal watercraft]] to tow them out to a position where they can catch previously unrideable waves (see [[tow-in surfing]]). These waves were previously unrideable due to the speed at which they travel. Some waves reach speeds of over 60&amp;nbsp;km/h; personal watercraft enable surfers to catch up to the speed of the wave, thereby making them rideable. Personal watercraft also allow surfers to survive wipeouts. In many instances surfers would not survive the battering of the "sets" (groups of waves together). This spectacular activity is extremely popular with television crews, but because such waves rarely occur in heavily populated regions, and usually only a very long way out to sea on outer reefs, few spectators see such events directly.

Though surfers come from all walks of life, the basis of the [[#Surf terminology|beach bum]] stereotype comes from that great enthusiasm that surfers can have for their sport. Dedication and [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] are also qualities that surfers bring to what many have traditionally regarded as a commitment to a lifestyle as well as a sport.&lt;ref name=Tune/&gt;

For specific surf spots, the state of the ocean tide can play a significant role in the quality of waves or hazards of surfing there. Tidal variations vary greatly among the various global surfing regions, and the effect the tide has on specific spots can vary greatly among the spots within each area. Locations such as Bali, Panama, and Ireland experience 2-3 meter tide fluctuations, whereas in Hawaii the difference between high and low tide is typically less than one meter.
[[File:Surfing on the Gold Coast.jpg|thumb|right|Surfing on the [[Gold Coast, Australia]]]]
Each [[surf break]] is different, since the underwater topography of one place is unlike any other. At beach breaks, the sandbanks can change shape from week to week, so it takes commitment to get good waves.

The saying "You should have been here yesterday," became a commonly used phrase for bad conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I should have been here yesterday.|url = http://soul-surfing.co.uk/i-should-have-been-here-yesterday/|website = SoulSurfing.co.uk|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, however, [[surf forecasting]] is aided by advances in information technology, whereby mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells moving around the globe.

The quest for perfect surf has given rise to a field of tourism based on the surfing adventure. Yacht charters and [[surf camps]] offer surfers access to the high quality surf found in remote, tropical locations, where [[tradewinds]] ensure offshore conditions.

Along with the rarity of what surfers consider truly perfect surf conditions (due to changing weather and surf condition) and the inevitable hunt for great waves, surfers often become dedicated to their sport in a way that precludes a more traditional life. Surfing, instead, becomes their lifestyle.

The goals of those who practice the sport vary, but throughout its history, many have seen surfing as more than a sport, as an opportunity to harness the waves and to relax and forget about their daily routines. Surfers have veered from even this beaten path, and foregone the traditional goals of [[first world]] culture in the hunt for a continual '[[wikt:stoked|stoke]]', harmony with life, their surfing, and the ocean. These "[[Soul Surfer]]s" are a vibrant and long-standing sub-group.&lt;ref name=Tune&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rSoBAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Soul+surfing |title= Soul surfing: tune in your power to live the movie of your life |author= Dawnea Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qeVN8DJuHxIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Soul+surfing#v=onepage&amp;q=Soul%20surfing&amp;f=false |title= Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board |author1=Bethany Hamilton |author2=Sheryl Berk |author3=Rick Bundschuh |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Encyclopedia of Surfing |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-DWQSYRx4MUC&amp;pg=PA552&amp;dq=Soul+surfing#v=onepage&amp;q=Soul%20surfing&amp;f=false | publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | author= Matt Harshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive surf culture, centered around surf contests and endorsement deals, and [[Surf localism|localism]]'s disturbance of the peace, are often seen in opposition to this.&lt;ref name=Tune/&gt;

==Localism==

Even though waves break everywhere along a coast, good surf spots are rare. A surf break that forms great surfable waves may easily become a coveted commodity, especially if the wave only breaks there rarely. If this break is near a large population center with many surfers, territorialism often arises. Regular surfers who live around a desirable surf break may often guard it jealously, hence the expression "locals only." The expression "locals only" is common among beach towns, especially those that are seasonally encroached upon by vacationers who live outside the area. Localism is expressed when surfers are involved in verbal or physical threats or abuse to deter people from surfing at certain surf spots. It is based in part on the belief that fewer people mean more waves per surfer.
[[File:BoardmastersFistralPre2010.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Fistral Beach]] showing the beach bar setup ready for the 2010 [[Boardmasters Festival]]]]
Some locals have been known to form loose [[gang]]s that surf in a certain break or beach and fiercely protect their "territory" from outsiders.&lt;ref name=X17TV&gt;{{cite video | title = Malibu Surfers Fight Paparazzi | medium = internet video | publisher = X17online.com | date = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/celebs/malibu-surfers-fight-paparazzi-webcastr.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080714053913/http://webcastr.com/videos/celebs/malibu-surfers-fight-paparazzi-webcastr.html | archivedate = 2008-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These surfers are often referred to as "surf punks" or "surf nazis." The local surfer gangs in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and on [[Hawaii]], known as [[Da hui (surfing)|da hui]], have been known to threaten tourists with physical violence for invading their territory. In Southern California, at the [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]] and [[Santa Monica]] beaches, local surfers are especially hostile to the surfers from the [[San Fernando Valley]] whom they dub "vallies" or "valley kooks". The expression "Surf Nazi" arose in the 1960s to describe territorial, aggressive, and obsessive surfers, often involved in surf gangs or surf clubs. The term "Surf Nazi" was originally used simply to denote the strict territorialism, violence and hostility to outsiders and the absolute obsession with surfing that was characteristic in the so-called "surf nazis." However, some surfers reclaimed and accepted the term, and a few actually embraced Nazism or Nazi symbolism. Some surf clubs in the 1960s, particularly at [[Windansea]] in La Jolla, embraced the term by using the swastika symbol on their boards and identified with Nazism as a counterculture (though this may have just been an effort to keep out or scare non-locals and may have been a [[tongue-in-cheek]] embrace of the "surf nazi" label as a form of rebellion). The "locals only" attitude and protectionism of the Santa Monica surf spots in the early 1970s was depicted in the movie ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', which was based on the documentary ''[[Dogtown and Z-Boys]]''.

Localism often exists due to socioeconomic factors as well. Until relatively recently, surfers were looked down upon as lazy people on the fringe of society (hence the term "beach bum.") Many who surfed were locals of beach towns who lived there year-round, and were from a lower economic class. For that reason as much as any other, these groups were resentful of outsiders, particularly those who were well-to-do and came to their beaches to surf recreationally rather than as a way of life. Australia has its own history where surfers were openly treated with hostility from local governments in the sport's early days, and the tension never really went away, despite the sport's enormous increase in popularity. [[Maroubra Beach]] in Australia became infamous for localism and other violence chronicled in the documentary film ''[[Bra Boys]]'' about the eponymous group, although the surfers in the film maintain they are not a "gang."

===Surf gangs===

Surf gangs often form to preserve cultural identity through the protection of beach towns and [[shoreline]]s. If known territory is trespassed by members of another surf gang, violence usually occurs. [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] is home to one of the oldest and biggest surf gangs, called "Longos." Some surf gangs have been known to not only claim land territory, but also claim specific surfing waves as territory. Surf gangs have gained notoriety over the years, especially with the production of ''[[Bra Boys]]''.

The [[Lunada Bay Boys]] (in [[Palos Verdes Estates, California]]) became the subject of a class action lawsuit in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20161220072047/https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/331684-lunada-bay-boys-surfers-criminal-street-gang-class-action/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wolfpak====

The Wolfpak was originally composed of a few select surfers from [[Kauai, Hawaii]] who believed in respecting [[Surf localism|localism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Matt|title=Rough Waves, Tougher Beaches|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/sports/othersports/23surfing.html?pagewanted=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 22, 2009|date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kauai, according to a Wolfpak member, is a place where one is raised to honor the value of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Surfermag|title=Kai Garcia-The Surfer Interview|url=http://www.surfermag.com/features/kaiborgintvw/|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This value is what led to the group's effort to manage the chaos associated with North Shore surfing. Some notable members have been pro surfers [[Andy Irons]] and [[Bruce Irons (surfer)|Bruce Irons]], as well as the reality show 808 star and [[Blue Crush]] actor, Kala Alexander.&lt;ref name="Borow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Borow|first=Zev|title=Surf N' Turf|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/magazine/archives/news/story?page=magazine-20050606-article39|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfpak began in 2001 when leader [[Kala Alexander]] moved to [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] in search for job opportunities, and found disorganization and lack of respect in the surf lineup at surf reef break, [[Banzai Pipeline|Pipeline]]. Alexander found it necessary to dictate organization in who would surf the Pipeline to both preserve the value, and also protect surfers from the reef's potentially life-threatening waves.&lt;ref name="Borow"/&gt;

The waves at Pipeline can reach over 20 feet and its powerful disposition has taken the lives of professional surfers. If a visiting surfer collided with another surfer, this could result in serious harm or death. These observations led to the Wolfpak's proactive enforcement on the [[North Shore, California|North Shore]].&lt;ref name="Melekian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melekian|first=Brad|title=Rough Justice|url=http://outsideonline.com/outside/culture/200811/surfing-hawaii-1.html|publisher=Outside Online|accessdate=November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920144131/http://outsideonline.com/outside/culture/200811/surfing-hawaii-1.html|archivedate=2010-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wolfpak's territorial enforcement has drawn attention because of its violent means. In an incident where a tourist cut off a friend of Alexander's in a dangerous six-foot swell, the Wolfpak leader assaulted the tourist.&lt;ref name="Melekian"/&gt; Comments from anonymous locals show that the presence of Wolfpak is well perceived, if not intimidating. Some locals{{who|date=July 2017}} who hold similar values of cultural respect support what the members are trying to do.&lt;ref name="Borow"/&gt;

Alexander does not view Wolfpak as a gang, but says they look out for every local [[Culture of Hawaii|Hawaii]]an. They attempt to preserve their way of life and realize the implications that a lack of respect can have on [[Hawaiian culture]].&lt;ref name="Melekian"/&gt;

====Bra Boys====

The [[Bra Boys]] are a popular surf gang founded in [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]], a beachside suburb in the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. They established international fame and attention in 2007 with the release of ''[[Bra Boys: Blood is Thicker than Water]]'', a documentary about the bonds and struggles of the many gang members.  The [[Bra Boys]] name originates both from the slang word for brother, and as a reference to the gang's home suburb, Maroubra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=Sydney's notorious surf gang turns tide of violence into big-screen adulation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/sydneys-notorious-surf-gang-turns-tide-of-violence-into-bigscreen-adulation-440840.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=March 19, 2007|location=London|date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang members tattoo "My Brothers Keeper" across the front of their chests and the Maroubra area code across their back.

Many of the [[Bra Boys]] came from impoverished homes and families torn apart by drug use. Brothers Sunny, [[Jai Abberton|Jai]], [[Koby Abberton|Koby]] and Dakota Abberton, came from an especially difficult upbringing. To them the Bra Boys were much more than a gang, they were a group of friends, a family of their own that loved to surf and always stood up for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing Gangs|url=http://surfinggangs.host56.com/|publisher=SurfingGangs.TK|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[documentary]], written and directed by the gang members themselves, showed the raw gritty side of a surf life previously glamorized by Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bra Boys breaks box office record|publisher=ABC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in surfing ==
Like men, women started surfing in ancient [[Polynesia]]. This was especially documented in the waters around Hawaii. Until the 1830s these women were actively engaged in surfing. This changed when American missionaries came to the islands and told them that it was not proper for women to be surfing. Women did not begin surfing around the Hawaiian islands again until the late 1800s. By the end of World War II surfing would have a major revival that increased its popularity and participating membership.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Citation|last=Franklin|first=Roslyn|title=Making waves: Contesting the lifestyle marketing and sponsorship of female surfers|publication-date=April 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were encouraged to take up surfing by two of the early board designers, in part because these men believed that surfing would help women to keep their feminine figure.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[File:Women's_team,_Coffs_Harbour_Jetty_Surf_Life_Saving_Club_(2867346990).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Women's_team,_Coffs_Harbour_Jetty_Surf_Life_Saving_Club_(2867346990).jpg|thumb|1 January 1931. Coffs Harbour, the first fully equipped women’s surf life saving competition team in the world, 1931 / photographed by Sam Hood]]There would be another rise in the popularity of women's surfing just a decade later as they were increasingly a part of surfing films. One example of this are the ''[[Gidget]]'' movie trilogy and TV series based on the book by the same title. In spite of this it was still believed that women should be the viewers rather than the participants of surfing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Due to the negative reactions women received because of their involvement in surfing, being labeled as 'masculine' or 'tomboys', women began to take ownership of their participation. This is seen in their working together to organize surfing competitions for women. There had been competitions for women held in the 50s and 60s but these were amateur events. The 70s and 80s saw a shift in this as women entered into the world of professional surf competitions. This caused a change in the style with which women surfed at the time by focusing more on their power and speed as athletes rather than being aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. Today, professional female surfers continue to have a difficult time being recognized as athletes, and must deal with the continued objectification and sexual gazes from spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-15/female-surfers-call-for-end-to-sexist-culture-in-sport/7329932|title=Female pro surfers pushing for end to 'sexualised' culture|date=2016-04-15|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional female surfers have also noted that they face pay inequality when compared to their male counterparts. Women do not win the same amount in prize money as men do. These women have also indicated that the issue of pay equality arises when it comes to corporate sponsorships by surf brands. There is a prioritization here for the brands to hire surfers who appear more conventionally attractive but not be the most talented of surfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-15/female-surfers-call-for-end-to-sexist-culture-in-sport/7329932|title=Female pro surfers pushing for end to 'sexualised' culture|date=2016-04-15|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surf terminology ==
{{main|Glossary of surfing}}
{{Wiktionary pipe|Appendix:Glossary of surfing|Surf slang}}
Surfing (particularly in Southern California) has its own sociolect, which has comingled with [[Valleyspeak]].  Words such as "dude", "tubular", "radical", and "[[gnarly]]" are associated with both and [[Northern California]] created its own unique surf terms as well that include "groovy", "hella", and "tight". One of the primary terms used by surfers around the world is the word "stoked". This refers to a mixed feeling of anxiety and happiness towards the waves breaking. Surfers have often been associated with being [[slackers]] or 'beach bums' (with women being known as 'beach bunnies').

===Beach bunny===
[[File:Beach bunnies.jpg|thumb|beach bunnies]]
A '''beach bunny''' is  general [[North America]]n popular culture term for a young woman who spends her free time at the beach. In surf culture it may also refer to a female surfer. Beach bunnies are known for the amount of time they spend sun tanning and are usually represented wearing bikinis, see [[Muscle Beach Party]] and [[Gidget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-how.com/how_2087486_be-beach-bunny.html |title=How to Be a Beach Bunny |author=eHow Sports &amp; Fitness Editor |website=EHow |publisher=eHow, Inc. |accessdate=13 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues affecting surfers==
Environmental damage, and increasing riparian development may continue to increase pressure on the sport. [[Oil spill]]s and [[red tide|toxic algae growth]] can threaten surfing regions.

Some of these stresses may be overcome by building of [[artificial reef]]s for surfing. Several have been built in recent years (one is at Cables in Western Australia), and there is widespread enthusiasm in the global surfing community for additional projects. However, environmental opposition and rigorous coastal permitting regulations is dampening prospects for building such reefs in some countries, such as the United States.

==Surfing and environmentalism==
Surfing, as a sport, is heavily dependent on a healthy environment.  As a result, interest groups have blossomed to influence the utilization of coastal properties relevant to surfing. There is conflict between surfers and other user groups over the allocation of coastal resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarfe|first=B.E. |author2=T.R. Healy |author3=H.G. Rennie |author4=S.T. Mead|title=Sustainable Management of Surfing Breaks: Case Studies and Recommendations|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|year=2009|volume=25|issue=3|pages=684–703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common to most disputes are two issues, disposal of sewage and toxic waste into near shore waters and the formation of harbors, breakwaters and jetties.  Sewage and toxic waste almost always affects mammals in a negative way. Coastal construction and engineering projects can have either good or bad effects on surf breaks.
While some sources suspect the effectiveness of surfing environmentalist groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheaton|first=B|title=Identity, Politics, and the Beach: Environmental Activism in Surfers Against Sewage|journal=Leisure Studies|year=2007|volume=26|issue=3|pages=279–302|doi=10.1080/02614360601053533}}&lt;/ref&gt; notable victories have been achieved by surfers championing their issues. Some examples of these victories include:
* In 1991 the [[Surfrider Foundation]] and the EPA won, at the time, the second largest [[Clean Water Act]] lawsuit in history.  A $5.4 million lawsuit against two paper mills, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation and the Simpson Paper Company resulted in the creation of the Humboldt Area Recreation Enhancement and Water Quality Fund and $50 million was spent by the mills to reduce ocean discharges at their facilities near Eureka, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paddock|first=Richard|title=Surfers Force Pulp Mills to Halt Ocean Pollution: Suit brings about precedent-setting accord.

* In 2008 the U.S. Department of Commerce upheld a [[California Coastal Commission]] decision to deny the $1.3 Billion extension of [[California State Highway 241]] that would have impacted the popular and world-renowned surf site [[Trestles]] near San Clemente, California. This decision was a victory for surf environmentalists who led a grassroots campaign to "Save Trestles, Stop the Toll Road." At the time federal officials received 35,000 written statements on the issue, most in support of upholding the decision of the CCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenblatt|first=Susannah|title=Federal officials struggle to maintain order at toll road hearing|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tollroad23-2008sep23,0,523143.story|accessdate=July 24, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A global example can be found in the case of the newly formed World Surfing Reserve at Ericeira Portugal that was dedicated in October 2011 and endorsed by Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva.  President Silva "acknowledged the significance of preserving the surfing coastline ... for the vitality of Portugal's economy, the health of the coastal and marine environment, and maintaining a high quality of life for the residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ericeira, Portugal Dedicated as World Surfing Reserve|url=http://www.savethewaves.org/news/ericeira-portugal-dedicated-as-world-surfing-reserve/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104050607/http://www.savethewaves.org/news/ericeira-portugal-dedicated-as-world-surfing-reserve|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 4, 2011|publisher=Save the Waves Coalition|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The preservation of this pristine surf spot was accomplished by the Save the Waves Coalition and its [[World Surfing Reserves]] program whose goal is to, "proactively identifies, designates and preserves outstanding waves, surf zones and their surrounding environments, around the world...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspire.

The surf industry is a billion dollar industry whose popularity as a recreational sport has gained momentum in many coastal areas around the world over the past decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/surfing_surfboards/surfing_apparel/prweb8581431.htm |title=Global Surfing Market to Reach $13.2 Billion by 2017, According to New Report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc |publisher=Prweb.com |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the publicizing of new surf destinations through television, movies, magazines, and the Internet, and other media, as well as greater access to traveling accommodations, surf tourism has created large impacts on local communities and environments in developing countries as well as in established areas around the world.&lt;ref name="mentawai.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentawai.org/surfing-industry/surfing-tourism-mentawai/#_Toc500731592 |title=Managing the Mentawai Surfing Tourism Industry |publisher=Mentawai.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tourism is not always the main reason for fast expansion in developing countries, but under those circumstances groups of activists and non-profits such as [[Surfrider Foundation]], [[SurfAid]], IJourneyGreen, Surf Resource Network, [[World Tourism Organization]], NEF, and [[UNESCO]] have begun working with locals and their governments to minimize the negative impacts of tourism upon host communities’ environments and maximize and equitably distribute the positive impacts of tourism.&lt;ref name="mentawai.org"/&gt;  Some of the negative impacts of tourism relevant to surf dominant communities are:
* Failure to create adequate levels of employment and income 
*Loss of local skills and failure to provide skilled jobs for local population
*Labor exploitation
*Inequitable distribution of the costs and benefits of tourism 
*Fast, unstable development of infrastructure which can cause beach erosion and safety and health problems
*Improper waste disposal and pollution 
*Lack of political will to pursue sustainable tourism
*Lack of resources both human and economic
*Central and local government corruption 
*Short-term focus undermining long-term goals for development &lt;ref name="Brohman, J pp 48-70"&gt;Brohman, J. 1996 “New Directions in Tourism for Third World Development”, Annals of Tourism Research, Vol 23, No 1: pp 48-70&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the positive impacts of tourism relevant to surf dominant communities include: 
* The extent of linkages to the domestic economy
*The creation of employment
*Fostering of genuine appropriate technology transfer
*Generation of jobs for skilled labor as well as local managers, technicians, and personnel
*Equitable social, sectorial and regional distribution of costs and benefits
*Coordination of government policies and programs for locals and foreign visitors
*Infrastructure and incentives &lt;ref name="Brohman, J pp 48-70"/&gt;

==Spirituality==
{{Original research section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Surfer memorial service 2.PNG|thumb|left|A surfer memorial service, Huntington Beach Pier, Orange County, California.]]
Many surfers combine their love of the sport with their own religious or spiritual beliefs. In [[Huntington Beach, California]] for example, a local [[Christian]] [[non-denominational]] [[Church body|church]] occasionally meets on the beach for Sunday early-morning services. After the closing [[prayer]], the [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] and [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] paddle out for a morning session. Many surfing communities organize and take part in memorial services for fallen surfers, sometimes on the anniversary of passing such as the [[Eddie Aikau]] memorial service held annually at [[Waimea Bay]], [[Hawaii]].

Participants in the memorial service paddle out to a suitable location with flower [[lei (Hawaii)|leis]] around their necks or with loose flowers (sometimes held between their teeth). The participants then get into a circular formation, hold hands, and silently pray. Sometimes they will raise their clasped hands skyward before tossing their flowers or leis into the center of the ring. Afterward, they paddle back toward the beach to begin their surf session. Often these services take place at sunrise or sunset. In locations with a [[pier]], such as Huntington Beach, [[Orange County, California]], the service can take place near the end of the pier so that any non-surfers, such as elderly relatives, can watch and participate. Often the participants on the pier will throw down bouquets of flowers into the center of the ring.

==Surfing art==

===Surf graphics===
"Surf graphics" is the art style associated with the surfing subculture in posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos. It is heavily influenced by skate art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Surf Graphics|date=2012|publisher=Korero Press|isbn=9781907621086|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kustom Kulture]] and [[tiki culture]]. Popular artists in the genre are [[Drew Brophy]], Damian Fulton, [[Rick Griffin]], Bill Ogden and Jim Phillips.

===Surf music===
{{Main|Surf music}}
Surf culture is reflected in [[surf music]], with subgenres such as surf rock and surf pop. This includes works from such artists as [[Jan and Dean]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Surfaris]] ("[[Wipe Out (Surfaris song)|Wipe Out]]!"), [[Dick Dale]], [[The Shadows]], and  [[The Ventures]]. The music inspired dance crazes such as [[The Stomp]], [[The Frug]], and [[The Watusi]].  While the category surf music helped popularize surfing, most surfers at the time, such as Miki Dora, preferred R&amp;B and blues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  A newer wave of surf music has started in the acoustic riffs of artists such as [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Donavon Frankenreiter]], who are both former professional surfers.

==Fashion==
[[File:Bethany Hamilton 20070311.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Bethany Hamilton]] wearing surfwear.]]

'''Surfwear''' is a popular style of casual clothing, inspired by surf culture. Many surf-related [[brand name]]s originated as [[cottage industry]], supplying local surfers with [[boardshorts]], [[wetsuits]], [[surfboard]]s or [[leash]]es, as well as other hardware.

An early Australian surf fashion company was Kuta Lines, founded by Tony Brown after visiting Bali in 1973. Brown adapted Indonesian textiles and designs for his surfwear. From the 1980s, Kuta Lines used traditional [[ikat]] weaving and dyeing techniques, adapted to a heavier, fleecy fabric for cool climate surfing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/australian_journeys/gallery_highlights/slideshow_7_6.html#slideTop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329135840/http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/australian_journeys/gallery_highlights/slideshow_7_6.html#slideTop|date=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other clothing brands include [[O'Neill (brand)|O'Neill]], [[Rip Curl]], [[Quiksilver]], [[Town &amp; Country Surf Designs|Town &amp; Country]], [[Ocean Pacific]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]], [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]], [[DaKine]], [[Reef (company)|Reef]], [[Roxy (clothing)|Roxy]], [[Volcom]], [[Element Skateboards|Element]], [[Hurley International|Hurley]], [[Von Zipper]], [[Golden Breed]] and [[RVCA]].

=== Bikini ===

The [[bikini]] is an iconic piece of swim clothing. It was popularized in Europe initially but then was popularized in the United States after it was seen being worn by famous Hollywood stars. Based on this popularity films used the bikini to market their movies. The bikini created a connection between sexuality and the exoticism that was seen in the people and culture of the [[Pacific Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutsky|first=R. L.|date=1999|title=Surfing the Other: Ideology on the Beach|jstor=1213771|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=52|issue=4|pages=12–23|doi=10.2307/1213771}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years women did not have the option to not wear the bikini as there were not other pieces of surf wear being tailored to their need. This changed as the style of surf clothes was adopted by those who were not part of the culture. Companies began to create board shorts specifically for women's bodies, thus giving them an option besides the bikini to wear while surfing in competitions.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; This is beneficial for both the female surfers and the brands as it gives women more clothing options and creates more revenue for the companies.

==Events==
[[International Surfing Day]] celebrates the sport and lifestyle on June 20.

===Surfing contests===
Competitive surfing is a comparison sport. Riders, competing in pairs or small groups, are allocated a certain amount of time to ride waves and display their prowess and mastery of the craft. Competitors are then judged according to how competently the wave is ridden, including the level of difficulty, as well as frequency of maneuvers. There is a professional surfing [[world surfing champion]]ship series held annually at surf breaks around the world.

Although competitive surfing has become an extremely popular and lucrative activity, both for its participants and its sponsors, the sport does not have its origins as a competitive pursuit. It is common to hear debate rage between purists of the sport, who still maintain the ideal of "soul surfing", and surfers who engage in the competitive and, consequently, commercial side of the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s10600.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203083201/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s10600.htm|date=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organisation called the [[Spirit of Surfing]] has chosen not to accept surf label sponsorship, since an association of that sort could detract from the sentiment they wish to promote.

==Spin-offs &amp; influences==

===Boardsports===

Surfers developed the [[skateboarding|skateboard]] to be able to "surf" on land. Later came [[wind surfing|windsurfing]] (also known as ''sailboarding''), [[bodyboarding]], [[wakeboarding]], [[wakesurfing]], [[skimboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[riverboarding]], [[kitesurf|kiteboarding]], [[sandboarding]], [[mountainboarding]], [[carveboarding]] all now competitive sports.  Another fast growing boardsport is [[skurfing]] a mix of surfing and more conventional water sports in which the participant is towed behind the boat. [[Pineboarding]] and sandboarding are recreational boardsports.

==Surfing in multimedia==

===Films about surfing===
{{Main|Surf film}}
The surf culture is reflected in film. Bruce Brown's classic movie ''[[The Endless Summer]]'' glorified surfing in a round-the-world search for the perfect wave. John Milius's homage to the Malibu of his youth in ''[[Big Wednesday]]'' remains a poignant metaphor for the similarities between the changing surf and life.  The 1980s cult classics ''[[North Shore (film)|North Shore]]'' and ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' serve as mainstream introductions to teenage, light-hearted, superficial surf life (from the "heyday").  Beach movies such as the [[Gidget]] series, and ''[[Beach Party]]'' films such as ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' are less reverential depictions of the culture. ''[[Liquid Time]]'' (2002) is an avant-garde surf film that focuses solely on the fluid forms of tubing waves. ''[[Blue Crush]]'' (2002) is a film about [[surfer]] girls on [[Hawaii]]'s [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]]. The sequel, ''[[Blue Crush 2]]'' (2011) is a film about a California rich girl who travels to South Africa to find out more about her mother and herself. The 1991 film ''[[Point Break]]'' involves a group of bank robbers who are also surfers. The 1987 comedy film ''[[Surf Nazis Must Die]]'' features surfer gangs in the wake of an earthquake that destroys the California coastline. ''[[Soul Surfer (film)|Soul Surfer]]'' is a biopic about real-life surfer [[Bethany Hamilton]] in  Hawaii.

Some film events include the [[Sydney Fringe Festival]], [[Bondi Beach]], Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/29/1067233249351.html?from=storyrhs |title= Baiting Bondi's fringe | publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | first= Richard |last=Jinman |date= October 30, 2003}} Nude Night Surfing&lt;/ref&gt; the Surf Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfilmfestibal.com/ |title=Surfilmfestibal 12. 5-8 Junio 2014 |publisher=Surfilmfestibal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfilmfestibal.com/2009/expoviewer/index.html |title=AutoViewer |publisher=Surfilmfestibal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Jean de Luz]] Surf Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestivals.com/servlet/JSCRun?obj=FichePro&amp;CfgPath=ffs&amp;Cfg=search.cfg&amp;id=4221] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407001623/http://www.filmfestivals.com/servlet/JSCRun?obj=FichePro&amp;CfgPath=ffs&amp;Cfg=search.cfg&amp;id=4221|date=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wavescape Surf Film Festival]] in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wavescape.co.za/ |title=Surfing in South Africa |publisher=Wavescape |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NYSurfFilmFestival|New York Surfing Film Festival]].

==== Conceptual metaphor ====
The word "surf" is [[Polysemy|polysemous]]; having multiple, related meanings. "Surfing" the [[World Wide Web]] is the act of following [[hyperlink]]s. The phrase "surfing the Internet" was first popularized in print by [[Jean Armour Polly]], a librarian, in an article called "Surfing the INTERNET", published in the Wilson Library Bulletin in June 1992.

'''The Valley''' is a 27,000 -capacity sports [[stadium]] located in [[Charlton, London]], [[England]] and is the home of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic Football Club]].

==History==
In Charlton's early years, the club had a nomadic existence using several different grounds between its formation in 1905 and the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914. The ground dates from 1919, at a time when Charlton were moderately successful and looking for a new home. The club found an abandoned sand and chalk pit in Charlton, but did not have sufficient funds to fully develop the site. An army of volunteer Charlton supporters dug out a flat area for the pitch at the bottom of the chalk pit and used the excavated material to build up makeshift stands. The ground's name most likely comes from its original valley-like appearance. The club played its first game at the ground before any seats, or even terraces, were installed; there was simply a roped-off pitch with the crowd standing or sitting on the adjoining earthworks. The unique circumstances of the ground's initial construction led to an unusually intense bond between the club's supporters and the site that exists to this day. In the 1923&amp;ndash;24 season, Charlton played at [[the Mount stadium]] in [[Catford]] but in a much more highly populated area. A proposed merger with Catford South End FC fell through and thus Charlton moved back to the Valley.

In 1967, Len Silver the promoter at Hackney made an application to open Charlton as a British League speedway club, and plans were put forward to construct a track around the perimeter of the football pitch. The application to include speedway at the Valley was enthusiastically supported initially, but was eventually ruled out on the grounds of noise nuisance.

For many years, the Valley was one of the largest [[Football League]] grounds in Britain, although its highest maximum capacity of 75,000 was only half the capacity of Glasgow's [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref name="Details about Charlton Athletic"&gt;{{cite news| title = Details about Charlton Athletic| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/18/charlton_athletic_team.shtml| publisher = BBC London| date =
| accessdate =17 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Charlton's long absence from the top level of English football prevented much-needed renovation. Eventually, the club's debts led to bankruptcy administration. A consortium of supporters successfully acquired the club in 1984, but the Valley remained under the ownership of the club's former owner. However, the club was unable to finance the improvements needed to make the Valley meet new safety requirements. Shortly after the start of the 1985-86 season, Charlton left the Valley, entering into an agreement with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to share the latter's [[Selhurst Park]] facilities, the first official [[Groundshare|groundsharing]] arrangement in the Football League in 36 years.&lt;!-- Manchester United and Manchester City shared the latter's Maine Road stadium from 1945-1949 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Charlton7645Gallery.jpg|225px|thumb|Valley In disrepair|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 13 February 2009}}]] --&gt;
In 1988, the ownership of the club and the Valley was again united, and in a "grass roots" effort that harkened back to the ground's initial construction, thousands of supporters volunteered to clean the ground, eventually burning the debris in a huge bonfire on the pitch. By this time, however, the large terraces were no longer seen as desirable or safe. Charlton Athletic supporters then proposed a brand-new stadium to surround the original pitch. However, the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] Borough Council overwhelmingly turned down plans to renovate the ground. Club supporters formed their own local political party, the Valley Party, in response to the council's decision. The party ran candidates for all but two Greenwich Council seats, sparing the two councillors who had approved the new stadium plans. The party won almost 15,000 votes in the 1990 elections,&lt;ref name="Details about Charlton Athletic"/&gt; successfully pressuring the council to approve the plans for the new stadium.

In 1991, construction began on the new Valley, and the club moved from Selhurst Park to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham's]] [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. The modern stadium opened in December 1992. Since Charlton's return to the Valley in 1992, the ground itself has undergone some remarkable changes. The north, east and west sides of the ground have almost been completely rebuilt, giving the ground a capacity of over 27,000. The club have ambitions to extend the ground's capacity to over 40,000 by expanding the east side and completely rebuilding the south side,&lt;ref name="Expansion plans underway"&gt;{{cite news|title = Expansion plans underway|url = http://www.cafc.co.uk/newsview.ink?nid=21303&amp;newstype=n|publisher = Charlton Athletic F.C.|date = 29 November 2004|accessdate = 17 July 2007|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175927/http://www.cafc.co.uk/newsview.ink?nid=21303&amp;newstype=n|archivedate = 27 September 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains uncertain if or when the plans will be implemented after the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2007 and from the Championship two years later.

In 2004 the [[Unity Cup]] was held at the Valley with [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] winning the competition.

On 21 May 2017, the second annual [[Sidemen (YouTube group)|Sidemen]] charity match was held there, with Sidemen FC taking on the "[[YouTube]] All Stars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Youlton|first1=Clive|title=Charlton Athletic: Your chance to see YouTube stars at The Valley|url=http://www.kentlive.news/charlton-athletic-your-chance-to-see-youtube-stars-at-the-valley/story-30201762-detail/story.html|website=KentLive|publisher=Local World|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kent|first1=Mike|title=YouTube Secure Streaming Rights for Annual Sidemen Charity Football Stream|url=http://www.dexerto.com/news/2017/03/17/youtube-secure-streaming-rights-sidemen-charity-football-stream/|website=Dexerto|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "YouTube All Stars" won the match 2-0 over Sidemen FC. The Sidemen also held their third annual match at the same venue on 2 June 2018, with Sidemen FC beating the "YouTube All Stars" 7-1.&lt;ref name="sidemen-fc-3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Mike|title=Sidemen FC vs YouTube Allstars Charity Match - Match Report and VoD - KSI, FaZe Adapt and more!|url=https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/sidemen-fc-vs-youtube-allstars-charity-match-teams-and-livestream-ksi-keemstar-faze-adapt-and-more|website=Dexerto|accessdate=3 June 2018|date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stands==

===The Covered End===
Capacity: 9,000
[[File:The Valley Charlton North Stand.jpg|thumb|left|The North Stand]]
The North Stand was built as a replacement for the 'covered end', and is still called by this name. It was built during the 2001&amp;ndash;02 season as part of the developments to bring the Valley's capacity to 26,500 after promotion to the Premier League in 2000. The North Stand houses what is considered the most vocal supporters in the ground, along with restaurants and executive suites. It is also the home of the club's band, which includes drummers and [[trumpeters]].

===East Stand===
Capacity: 6,000
[[File:East Stand,The Valley (London).jpg|thumb|right|The East Stand]]
The East Stand was constructed during the 1993&amp;ndash;94 season and fully completed in 1994. As part of the first development to the ground since the return in 1992, it replaced the massive east terrace, which had remained closed and prohibited from use since the mid-1980s after the [[Bradford City stadium fire]]. The East Stand consists of a single tier of seats and houses the television gantry, and also has numerous executive boxes. Occasionally, for [[FA Cup|FA]] and [[League Cup]] matches, part of the East Stand is used to house away supporters if the demand for away team tickets is high.

===West Stand===
Capacity: 9,000
[[File:West Stand,The Valley (London).jpg|thumb|left|The West Stand]]
The West Stand was built in 1998 after Charlton's first promotion to the Premier League and is also two tiered. This is the main stand at the Valley with the largest capacity, and also houses the club's offices, as well as the director's box, board room dug-outs, changing rooms and the commercial centre (ticket office). There are also many conferencing rooms in this stand which are used for official and community events. There is a large statue of [[Sam Bartram]], (considered to be Charlton's finest player) at the entrance of the West Stand.

===Jimmy Seed Stand===
Capacity: 3,000
[[File:The Jimmy Seed Stand (South Stand),The Valley (London).jpg|right|thumb|The Jimmy Seed Stand]]
The Jimmy Seed (or South) Stand is the oldest part of the ground, and dates from the early 1980s. This stand is named after Charlton's manager, [[Jimmy Seed]] &amp;ndash; with whom Charlton won the [[FA Cup]] in 1947. This stand has a capacity of around 3,000 and hosts the away supporters at games. It is also the only part of the Valley with a supporting pillar.

[[File:TrackSpikeInstalled.jpg|right|thumb|Track spike]]

'''Track spikes''', or just '''spikes''', are racing shoes used by athletes when racing on the track. Some spikes are designed for longer-term training on tracks, but generally the shoes are used for racing. The term "spikes" can also refer to track shoes featuring such protrusions, though these are technically called '''pins'''. Spikes are similar to studs, which are used for team sports, although generally smaller and with a sharp point.

[[File:Old running spikes side view.jpg|thumb|Old running spikes]]
Track spikes had become popular in England by the 1860s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A history of American amateur athletics and aquatics: with the records|last= Janssen|first=Frederick William|year= 1888|oclc=38503721|publisher=[[Outing (magazine)|Outing company]]|location= |isbn= |page= 126|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=spike+shoe+running&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nFB2Tc6vEcmx0QH4xpHlBg&amp;ved=0CDoQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=bks%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1850%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1900&amp;tbm=#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=bks:1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1850%2Ccd_max%3A1889&amp;q=%22everybody+agreed+that+if+they+were+in+common+use+by+English+athletes%2C+they+must+be+desirable+for+Americans%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.&amp;fp=f6f1bcc041db8b52|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept of spikes in shoes to give running traction has been around much longer. As written in the 1852 publication of ''Calmet's Dictionary of the Holy Bible'' regarding military arms at the time of [[Paul the Apostle]] (c. 5 – c. 67):{{quote|text="Having the feet shod with the ''preparation'' of the gospel of peace;" not iron, not steel; but patient investigation, calm inquiry; assiduous, laborious, lasting; if not, rather, with ''firm footing'' in the gospel of peace. Whether [[Paul the Apostle|the apostle]] here means stout, well-tanned leather, leather well prepared, by his "preparation of the gospel of peace" or shoes which had spikes in them, which, running into the ground, gave a steadfastness to the soldier who wore them, may come under remark hereafter. We shall only add, that [[Moses]] seems, at least according to our rendering, to have some allusion to shoes, either plated, or spiked, on the sole, when he says, ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0533.htm Deut. xxxiii. 25.]) "Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days shall thy strength be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Calmet's Dictionary of the Holy Bible, as published by the late Mr. Charles Taylor, with the fragments incorporated|last= Calmet|first=Augustin |authorlink=Augustin Calmet|editors= [[Charles Taylor (engraver)|Charles Taylor]], [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]|edition=9 |year= 1852|oclc=12301476|publisher= [[Crocker &amp; Brewster]]|location= |isbn= |page= 100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZlBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For pioneering the use of spikes, [[J.W. Foster and Sons]]'s revolutionary running pumps appear in the book, ''Golden Kicks: The Shoes that changed Sport''.&lt;ref name="Coles"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colea|first1=Jason|title=Golden Kicks: The Shoes that Changed Sport|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began distributing shoes across the United Kingdom and were worn by British athletes.&lt;ref name="Coles"/&gt; They were made famous by 100m Olympic champion [[Harold Abrahams]] (who would be immortalized in the Oscar winning film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'') in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Coles"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny86&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/15/business/market-place-the-surging-reebok-stock.html|title=Market Place; The Surging Reebok Stock|author=Vartanig G. Vartan|date=May 15, 1986|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[American football]] player and coach [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] recommended them for running events in his widely distributed book, ''"Pop" Warner's book for boys.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Track+spike%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NPl1TZzCAqOI0QHLp5zWBg&amp;ved=0CDYQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=bks%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1850%2Ccd_max%3A1860&amp;tbm=#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=bks:1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1900%2Ccd_max%3A1934&amp;q=%22track+spike+shoes%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.&amp;fp=f6f1bcc041db8b52|title="Pop" Warner's book for boys|last=Warner|first=Glenn Scobey|publisher=R.M.

Additionally, Adolf Dassler, the founder of Adidas, assisted in the development of track spikes for multiple events. In an effort to enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to attempting to utilize canvas and rubber. He carved them by hand and were eventually worn during the 1936 Olympics by Jesse Owens. People began to take notice, and Owens inherently helped popularize Dassler's design. Track spikes continued to gain notable recognition when Emil Zatopek, a distance runner from Czech Republic, wore them during the 1952 Olympics in Helesinki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freelapusa.com/the-history-of-track-spikes/|title=The History of Track Spikes|date=2014-02-15|work=Freelap USA|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;!-- In 2012, a field research study was conducted by personal trainer and running expert, Ray Mellam.  Dr. Mellam's study argued that track spikes can slow a runner down when participating in certain events, particularly the 400m hurdles. This discovery has yet to be peer reviewed.--&gt;
== Design ==
[[File:SpikePlate.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Spike plate with spikes removed]]
The front of the sole features a rigid or semi-rigid spike plate containing between 3 and 9 threaded holes called spike wells. Spikes can be screwed into each well using a spike [[wrench]]. Recently, some individuals have attempted to add a "through hole" at the bottom of the spike to make them easier to tighten, remove, and install. &lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Newsroom. http://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/stories/9613&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shoes have permanent or "fixed" spikes which are not meant to be removed. Spikes may break during competition. 

Track shoes are exceptionally light, some shoes weighing less than five ounces (142 grams) each, half the weight of many standard running shoes.

In most track shoes, the toe region bends up to allow space for protruding spikes and to encourage athletes to run on their toes. This upward angle, known as "taper," varies widely depending on the intended use of the shoe, and the taper angle can be rigid or flexible. Shoes with a large taper are said to be "aggressive."

Importantly, it should also be noted that this shoe design may cause harm to the athlete if worn for extended periods of time outside of competition. Injury may occur when walking in a leisurely fashion, as the athlete is not on his or her toes, which is the manner in which the shoes were meant to be worn. &lt;ref&gt;Greensword, Marlon (2010). [http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-03142010-223313/unrestricted/BiomechanicalEvaluationofModifiedTrackShoes_GreenswordM.pdf BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION OF MODIFIED TRACK SHOES]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of shoes ==
[[File:Nieuwespikes2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Air Zoom Distance]]
There is considerable variation among track shoes depending on their intended use within the sport of [[track and field]].

[[Sprint (running)|Sprint]] spikes generally have a very stiff spike plate with the greatest number of spike wells. The taper is highest and most rigid in sprint spikes, maximizing the efficiency of energy transfer with each stride. Very little heel support is needed because sprinters spend most or all of their time on their toes. Sprint spikes may have a zip-up cover instead of or in addition to laces to improve aerodynamics. Sprint spikes should fit tightly but they should not be too tight to the point that the runners toes are cramping and they should not be too loose that will result in the runner losing power and speed. They should fit tighter than regular athletic shoes yet still comfortable enough to perform in.

[[Distance running|Distance]] shoes have a more flexible spike plate with less taper and fewer spikes. Because of the longer race distances, support through the mid-foot and heel is as important as efficiency with distance spikes. This means that distance spikes generally have a softer, more durable sole, particularly through the heel region. Although still "glove-like," the fit for distance spikes is generally slightly looser than for sprint spikes, given the longer race duration.

Middle distance spikes are a hybrid of a sprint shoe and a distance shoe, featuring an intermediate level of taper, spike plate rigidity, cushioning and support. Certain middle distance spikes are also popular among hurdlers because they have a relatively steep taper for sprinting and a cushioned heel for landings.

[[cross country running|Cross country]] spikes usually have no more than six spike points and are similar to distance spikes in many respects. However, given the wide range of terrain encountered off-track, cross country spikes have a more durable rubber sole and supportive mid-foot to provide a level of cushioning and stabilization not required on a track. Depending on race length, surface types and personal preference, cross country spikes may be abandoned in favor of [[racing flats]].

Shoes for field events and specialty events vary widely depending upon the specific requirements of each event. For example, [[long jump]] shoes are most similar to sprint spikes to provide good top speed, [[high jump]] shoes have flat bottoms and heel spikes to allow energy transfer through the entire foot, and [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] shoes are predominantly a water-resistant mesh for exceptional ventilation. While shoes for [[shot put]], [[discus throw|discus]] and [[hammer throw]] have flat rubber soles with no spikes, they may still occasionally be referred to as "track spikes."

Notable spike manufacturers include [[Adidas]], [[ASICS|Asics]], [[Brooks Sports, Inc.|Brooks]], [[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]], [[New Balance]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Puma AG]], [[Reebok]] and [[Saucony]].

== Types of spikes ==
[[File:TrackSpikesWithWrench.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Tin lid has twelve counted out spikes for screwing in. A spike wrench, a bag of new 1/4" pins, and "blanks" (flat stubs which fill an unused spike point) are visible.]]
While most spikes are between 3/16 inch (5&amp;nbsp;mm) and 1/2 inch (12&amp;nbsp;mm) long, the most common is 1/4 inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm). Additionally, there are various specialty lengths, as well as minimal "blank" spikes (also called studs) used to cover a spike well. Spikes are generally metal or ceramic and come in three main types: the pyramid, the needle (pin), and the compression tier (Christmas tree). Pyramids are conical spikes that taper to a sharp point. They normally have a maximum diameter nearly equal to the diameter of the threads of the spike. Needles also have a sharp point, but a thinner cone diameter. Track spikes create traction by penetrating the track surface. Some tracks do not allow pin spikes and limit the length of pyramid spikes to minimize damage to the track. A variation for synthetic tracks is the Christmas tree spike. It uses a terraced cone shape with a flat end to compress rather than penetrate the track below it and use the track's reaction force to return energy to the runner, increasing the runner's speed. Since it does not penetrate the track surface, it reduces wear on the track. Since the end is flat rather than pointed, it is less harmful to other runners in the event of being "spiked." Lastly, there are Tartan spikes that are dull that are most commonly used for rubber tracks.

On Monday, March 7, 1983 the [[Michigan Panthers]] opened their 1983 schedule with a 9-7 win at [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] against the [[Birmingham Stallions|Stallons]]. The game marked the first professional football game ever to be broadcast on [[ESPN]]. [[Novo Bojovic]] of Serbia hit the winning field goal from 48 yards out in the waning moments to preserve the Panthers' road win.

===Sponsors===
ABC claimed to have made a profit from its coverage of USFL during the 1983 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisistheusfl.com/1984%20halftime.htm This is the USFL Halftime 1984&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular season 30-second spots were priced at [[United States dollar|$]]30,000; playoff spots at $35,000. Thirty second spots for the championship game between the [[Michigan Panthers]] and the [[Philadelphia Stars (football)|Philadelphia Stars]] played on July 17 sold for $60,000. Major sponsors throughout the season included [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery|Gallo]], [[Anheuser Busch]], [[Buick]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Dodge]], [[Honda]] and [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]].

Major USFL sponsors for ESPN in 1984 included [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Anheuser Busch, [[American Motors]], [[DuPont]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Mattel]], [[Michelin]], [[Nissan]], [[Noxema]], [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] and [[A.C. Delco]].

===Ratings===
According to an ABC spokesman, the network averaged a 6.0 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/scimini/Articles/Sacked.htm The key to survival was winning television money. At first the new league had modest success, starting with $18 million from ABC and an additional $8 million from ESPN cable. But U.S.F.L. fans never showed up in force. The average game attendance dropped by 3,000 last season, to 27,000. More ominous, TV ratings fell almost 30%. By the end of its third season, the league had dwindled to eight clubs, with total losses of around $200 million.]&lt;/ref&gt; for their first USFL season. This was slightly better than the network's coverage of the first [[American Football League]] football season back in [[American Football League seasons#1960 [1]|1960]]. In its second year, AFL games on ABC averaged a 6.1 rating, and in 1962, the third year, a 6.5. The coverage was nonetheless quite low for a [[Big Three television network]], with a June 17 prime-time regular season game between Chicago and Birmingham finishing as the lowest-rated prime time broadcast of the week, with a 4.8 rating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025131128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121063/index.htm As for the ratings, the two semifinal playoff games drew a so-so 5.0 and 5.9, and the championship pulled overnights of 7.4 in New York, 8.7 in Chicago and 9.9 in Los Angeles, disappointing for prime time. On Black Friday, June 17, ABC aired a prime-time game between Chicago and Birmingham. It finished 72nd out of 72 shows that week with a rating of 4.8, the worst prime-time number of the year. Some advertisers who bought time this season seem skittish about reenlisting.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, ESPN averaged a 3.3 rating for its USFL coverage, a 3.0 for Saturday games and a 3.5 for the Monday night&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfl.info/outlaws/trivia.html The Oklahoma Outlaws played fewer than half of their games on Sundays in 1984. 8 of the team's games were scheduled for Saturdays, 2 for Friday evenings, and one (a June 18 game against the defending USFL champion Michigan Panthers) was slated for ESPN's Monday night telecast.]&lt;/ref&gt; coverage. "We are pretty pleased with the results", said an ESPN spokesman, who noted that the network's overall USFL rating average was almost 50[[Percentage|%]] higher than its prime time average for their entire fourth quarter of 1982.

===The end of the USFL itself===
ABC offered the USFL a 4-year, $175 million TV deal to play in the spring in 1986.  ESPN offered $70M over 3 years, regardless of the time of year. By this point, the league had driven out most of the owners who would have been willing to accept those terms.  The owners in the league walked away from what averaged out to $67 million per year starting in 1986 to pursue their big picture—merger with the NFL.

In 1984, the league began discussing the possibility of competing head-to-head with the NFL by playing its games in the fall beginning in 1986. The idea was to force a merger in which the NFL would be forced to admit some USFL teams.  Despite the protests of many of the league's "old guard," who wanted to stay with the original plan of playing football in the spring months, the voices of incoming Chicago owner [[Eddie Einhorn]] (who would never field his team in the league and did not even plan on doing so in 1986) and Generals owner [[Donald Trump]] and others would eventually prevail. Trump sold a majority of the other owners on the gamble that if a merger did occur, their teams would instantly be worth the $70 million or so NFL franchises were worth at that time --- tripling, quadrupling, or more their cash investment.

On October 18, 1984, the league's owners voted to go along with Einhorn and Trump's idea and begin playing a fall season in 1986. The fourteen remaining owners reiterated this intention in a second vote on April 30, 1985. The spring advocates had lost and the fall advocates would accept nothing less than victory vs. the NFL, either by forcing a merger or winning a sizeable settlement and securing a TV network for fall broadcasts.  Spring football had been replaced with an incredibly risky gamble for a huge return. The spring football advocates promptly threatened to leave the league (among them the [[Pittsburgh Maulers]], who immediately folded, the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], who intended to continue in the spring without the USFL, and the [[Denver Gold]], who were considering joining the Bandits but had not yet made a firm commitment). The illness and death of the Bandits' owner derailed the efforts to maintain a presence of professional football in the spring. Others that were sharing markets with the NFL (such as the [[New Orleans Breakers]] and [[Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars|Philadelphia Stars]]) were forced to relocate, which combined with the smaller markets that had received USFL teams in 1984 but had no other major league franchises at the time (Jacksonville, Birmingham, Memphis and Oklahoma) undermined the league's contention that it was a major league and discouraged the major networks from carrying their games.

The other major factor in the networks' lack of interest in the USFL was the [[College Football Association]]. The CFA had successfully sued the [[NCAA]] in the lawsuit ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma]]'', gaining control of its member colleges' television rights. Whereas the NCAA handed its exclusive rights to one network (CBS in 1983), the CFA offered packages to both CBS and ABC, and ABC also acquired rights to the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] and [[Big Ten Conference]]s. With ABC now once again having college football to air on Saturdays, and the network reluctant to give up weeknight prime time, they no longer needed the USFL.

In another effort to keep themselves afloat while at the same time attacking the more established [[National Football League]], the USFL filed an [[antitrust]] [[lawsuit]] against the older league, claiming it had established a [[monopoly]] with respect to television broadcasting rights, and in some cases, to access of stadium venues.

The USFL claimed that the NFL had bullied ABC, [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] into not televising USFL games in the fall. It also claimed that the NFL had a specific plan to eliminate the USFL, the "Porter Presentation."  In particular, the USFL claimed the NFL conspired to ruin the Invaders and Generals. The USFL sought [[damages]] of $567 million, which would have been [[Treble damages|tripled]] to $1.7 billion under [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]. It hoped to void the NFL's contracts with the three major networks.  The USFL proposed two remedies: either force the NFL to negotiate new television contracts with only two networks, or force the NFL to split into two competing 14-team leagues, each limited to a contract with one major network.

Lack of an over-the-air broadcast partner aside, ESPN still offered to carry 22 USFL games on its channel for the fall [[1986 USFL season|1986 season]]: a [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|game of the week on Sunday nights]], three playoff games and the championship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19860805&amp;id=o3dIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=f2ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3524,4438904&amp;hl=en ESPN, minus USFL, has 66 hours to fill]. ''Associated Press'' via St. Petersburg Times (August 5, 1986). Retrieved January 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, ESPN gave this time slot to the NFL, establishing that league's first cable presence.

==Franchises most affected by the television coverage==
ABC's contract&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065704/index.htm These failings aside, Byrne's observations on the league's extraordinary capacity for self-destruction are right on target. He painstakingly details the myriad problems: the overly restrictive TV contract with ABC in which the USFL was left powerless; the egregious overspending on salaries for ''name'' players like Herschel Walker, Steve Young and Doug Flutie; and Donald Trump's obsession with forcing the league to play in the fall and thus bring about a possible merger with the NFL.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfl.info/invaders/ Taube was the first USFL owner to notice the rather stringent clauses in the league's television contract with ABC, and fought hard over the league's three years to get them renegotiated.]&lt;/ref&gt; with the league required that, at the very least, there had to be franchises in the [[Chicago Blitz|Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfl.info/express/ Having already taken control of the Chicago Blitz and deciding to fold that franchise, the USFL's ownership faced a dilemma - if both the Blitz and Express were folded, ABC would be able to trigger an escape clause in the league's network television contract - something that, giving the nature of the ABC/USFL relationship, was a very real possibility.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles]], and [[New Jersey Generals|New York]] markets.  Not coincidentally, these markets were home to ABC's best-performing owned-and-operated stations--[[WLS-TV]] in Chicago, [[WABC-TV]] in New York and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles.

===Chicago Blitz===
{{Main|Chicago Blitz}}
Before the end of the 1984 season, it was announced that the Blitz would be shut down. [[Chicago White Sox]] part-owner [[Eddie Einhorn]] was awarded a new Chicago franchise.  While it was stressed that this new franchise was not the Blitz, Einhorn retained all player contracts. A strong proponent of the USFL's planned move to the fall in 1986, he opted not to field a team in 1985. ABC had no objections to this move, probably due to the USFL's anemic ratings in Chicago.

===Denver Gold===
{{Main|Denver Gold}}
Just after [[Mouse Davis]] took over as head coach, the USFL announced that it would switch to a fall schedule for the 1986 season. Local support for the Gold practically vanished. While the Gold had been one of the USFL's attendance leaders, fans in the Denver area were not about to abandon the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]] in favor of the Gold. Despite finally getting into the playoffs with an 11-7 record, the Gold's attendance crashed to 14,400 fans per game. As a result, despite finishing second in the Western Conference, they were forced to play on the road against the lower-seeded [[Memphis Showboats]] under pressure from ABC. The network, who had considerable influence over the USFL due to the structuring of the league's television contract, did not want the embarrassment of having a game played in a near-empty [[Mile High Stadium]].

===Los Angeles Express===
{{Main|Los Angeles Express (USFL)}}
The Express never drew well at the cavernous [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfl.info/generals/trivia.html Though attendance at the game was over 30,000, those watching the game on television got the impression the game was poorly attended, due in large part to the size of the L.A. Coliseum, which held well over 90,000 fans when filled.]&lt;/ref&gt; even in their breakthrough 1984 season. The low attendance figures began to prove very embarrassing and frustrating both to the league and ABC, which had hoped for a more credible product to emanate from the nation's second-largest media market. The team had to play its last home game at [[Los Angeles Pierce College]], a small [[junior college]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]].

The [[Arizona Wranglers]], despite having the worse record of the two participating teams, got to host the 1984 Western Conference championship game because the Coliseum was being prepared for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. To accommodate Arizona's oppressive summer heat, as well as the [[ABC Sports]] television schedule, the game kicked off at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern time]].

The league took over the team for the 1985 season, which was an unmitigated disaster.  Unable to find a new owner, the USFL announced that the Express would suspend operations for the first fall season in 1986.  It couldn't simply fold the team due to the contract's stipulation that there had to be a team in Los Angeles.

'''Wyoming County International Speedway''' is an [[asphalt]] speedway located in [[Perry (town), New York|Perry]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States|USA]]. The speedway was built in 1960 as a dirt race track called Perry Speedway. The speedway was paved in 1968, and the concrete retaining wall constructed. In 1985, the [[macadam]] was once again covered with a layer of dirt for a time period of 13 years. In 1998, under new ownership, WCIS returned to the highly competitive SST asphalt racing surface. Racing occurs every Saturday night at the Bullring.

"'''You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee'''" is the sixteenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 25)|25th season]] of the American [[animated sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the 546th episode of the series. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 30, 2014. It was written by [[Michael Price (writer)|Michael Price]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-simpsons-2014/episode-16-season-25/you-dont-have-to-live-like-a-referee/100521 |title=The Simpsons Episode Guide 2014 Season 25 - You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee, Episode 16 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine soccer broadcaster [[Andrés Cantor]] guest-stars as himself.  The title is from the [[refrain]] "don't have to live like a refugee" from the 1980 song "[[Refugee (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Refugee]]" by [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]].  Homer also sings a parody of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s 1981 song "[[Juke Box Hero]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-simpsons/you-dont-have-to-live-like-a-referee-3021997/ |title=The Simpsons - Season 25, Episode 16: You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee |publisher=TV.com |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/sports/soccer/the-simpsons-springfield-to-brazil.html |title=‘The Simpsons’: Springfield to Brazil |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At the [[Springfield Elementary|school]] assembly, [[Principal Skinner]] presents a skit about living [[history]]. The kids begin heckling them and the assembly devolves into a disaster. Chalmers suggests holding a speech contest on the students' heroes.

After Martin beats her to the punch using her first idea, [[Marie Curie]], Lisa changes her speech to one on [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. Lisa wins over the crowd and both kids' speeches are posted online. Lisa's goes [[viral video|viral]], so much so that Homer is called to [[Referee (association football)|referee]] games in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in Brazil]].

At the World Cup, Homer referees honestly, but soon gangsters attempt to [[bribery|bribe]] him. Wanting to retain Lisa's respect (and the fact that he is utterly disinterested in the game), Homer refuses. He continues to be an honest referee despite the players trying to bribe him when he gives them [[Red card (sports)#Red card|red cards]].

Homer admits to Bart that it is hard to turn down the bribes, but knowing that Lisa chose him as her hero, he has no other choice. Bart decides to tell him the truth about Lisa’s speech; that he never really was her first choice as a hero. Homer is so devastated he decides to accept the bribes.

During the World Cup Final ([[Germany national football team|Germany]] vs. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]) Homer has been bribed to fix the game so that the [[Brazil]]ians win. Lisa tells him that his integrity as a referee has impressed her so much he is her real hero now. A Brazilian player known as "El Divo" (a parody of [[Neymar]]) goes down in the game and appears to be hurt. Homer, listening to Lisa, thinks he is guilty of [[Diving (association football)|diving]]. Homer calls "no penalty", denying Brazil the penalty kick and the [[Germany|Germans]] win the World Cup.

The betrayed gangsters are just about to kill Homer when Marge begs them in fluent Portuguese (which she has been attempting to learn throughout the episode) to forgive him. The gangster's mother happens to be a lady on the plane that Lisa traded seats with so the gangster's mother could watch premium [[HBO]]. She intercedes to allow the Simpsons to go free.

The Simpsons are later seen in the middle of the marsh lands and rivers of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] enjoying all the beauty of the nature as Homer admires a [[deforestation|clearing of a section of rainforest]] in order to make way for a [[Krusty Burger]].

==Reception==
Dennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a C, saying "Going into tonight’s episode “You Don’t Have To Live Like A Referee,” there was a lot of potential comic ammo to go around. For one, it’s the Simpsons’ first trip back to Brazil since the infamous season 13 episode “[[Blame It on Lisa]]” which angered the Brazilian tourist board so badly that there was a lawsuit in the works. Throw in some of the old reliable Homer/Lisa relationship dynamic (ever the most dramatically evocative on the show), and all the pieces were there to assemble a memorable episode. That what eventually emerged was one of the most perfunctory of the season is genuinely a bummer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins |first=Dennis |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/simpsons-you-dont-have-live-referee-202845 |title=The Simpsons: “You Don't Have To Live Like A Referee” |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teresa Lopez of ''TV Fanatic'' gave the episode three out of five stars, saying "Aside from a touching story, the episode featured some hilarious scenes and sight gags. For one, Kearney placing an "admire me" note on Homer's back (instead of the usual "kick me" sign) during Lisa's speech was nice touch. But that one paled in comparison to the montage of creative bribe offers in Brazil. It was an amusing way to make fun of the rampant corruption found in World Cup competitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/03/the-simpsons-review-you-dont-have-to-live-like-a-referee/ |title=The Simpsons Review: Lisa's Hero |publisher=TV Fanatic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received a 1.9 rating and was watched by a total of 3.91 million people, making it the second most watched show on [[Animation Domination]] that night, beating ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' but losing to ''[[Family Guy]]'' with 4.17 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/01/sunday-final-ratings-the-good-wife-resurrection-crisis-60-minutes-the-mentalist-adjusted-down/249706/ |title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘The Good Wife’, ‘Resurrection’, ‘Crisis’, ’60 Minutes’ &amp; ‘America’s Funniest Home Videos’ Adjusted Up; ‘The Mentalist’ Adjusted Down |publisher=Tvbythenumbers |date=2014-03-23 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, after [[2015 FIFA corruption case|a corruption scandal]] at [[FIFA]], the real-life world governing body of soccer, the episode received attention over social media, a phenomenon reported on by media such as the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa elections: Blatter wins as dark days light up social media|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32932074|accessdate=2015-05-29|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
