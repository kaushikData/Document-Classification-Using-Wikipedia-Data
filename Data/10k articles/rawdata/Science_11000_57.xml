[[File:HipparchusConstruction.svg|thumb|400px|Geometric construction used by Hipparchus in his determination of the distances to the sun and moon]]
The '''''Almagest''''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|√¶|l|m|…ô|Àå|d í|…õ|s|t}}) is a 2nd-century [[Koine Greek|Greek]]-language [[Greek mathematics|mathematical]] and [[Greek astronomy|astronomical]] treatise on the apparent motions of the [[star]]s and [[planet]]ary paths, written by [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|{{circa}} AD 100 ‚Äì}} {{circa|lk=no|170}}). One of the most influential scientific texts of all time, its [[geocentric model]] was accepted for more than 1200 years from its origin in Hellenistic [[Roman-era Alexandria|Alexandria]], in the medieval [[Byzantine]] and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] worlds, and in Western Europe through the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]] until [[Copernicus]].

The ''Almagest'' is the critical source of information on ancient [[Greek astronomy]]. It has also been valuable to students of mathematics because it documents the ancient Greek mathematician [[Hipparchus]]'s work, which has been lost. Hipparchus wrote about [[trigonometry]], but because his works appear to have been lost, mathematicians use Ptolemy's book as their source for Hipparchus's work and ancient Greek trigonometry in general.{{dubious|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Claudius Ptolemaeus, Almagestum, 1515.djvu|page=309|thumb|An edition in Latin of the ''Almagestum'' in 1515]]
Ptolemy set up a public inscription at [[Canopus, Egypt]], in 147 or 148. N. T. Hamilton found that the version of Ptolemy's models set out in the ''Canopic Inscription'' was earlier than the version in the ''Almagest''. Hence it cannot have been completed before about 150, a quarter-century after Ptolemy began observing.&lt;ref&gt;NT Hamilton, N. M. Swerdlow, [[G. J. Toomer]]. "The Canobic Inscription: Ptolemy's Earliest Work". In Berggren and Goldstein, eds., ''From Ancient Omens to Statistical Mechanics''. Copenhagen: University Library, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
The work was originally titled "{{lang|grc|ŒúŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫·Ω¥ Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ}}" (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Mathƒìmatikƒì Syntaxis}}'') in [[Ancient Greek]], and also called ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' or ''Almagestum'' in [[Latin]]. The treatise was later titled ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Hƒì Megalƒì Syntaxis}}'' ({{lang|grc|·º© ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ}}, "The Great Treatise"; {{lang-la|Magna Syntaxis}}), and the superlative form of this ({{lang-grc|ŒºŒµŒ≥ŒØœÉœÑŒ∑}}, ''megiste'', "greatest") lies behind the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''{{transl|ar|al-majis·π≠ƒ´}}'' ({{lang|ar|ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ÿ≥ÿ∑Ÿä}}), from which the English name ''Almagest'' derives. The Arabic name is important due to the popularity of a Latin re-translation made in the 12th century from an Arabic translation, which would endure until original Greek copies resurfaced in the 15th century.

The Arabic form came from Middle Persian ''Magestƒ´g'' ({{Lang-pal|ê≠¨ê≠¢ê≠Æê≠≤ê≠©ê≠™|lit=magestƒ´g}}).{{fact|date=August 2018}} The [[Middle Persian|Persian]] name still remains as [[Letters of Manucher|NƒÅmagƒ´hƒÅ Man≈çƒçihr]] (Letters of Manucher).

== Contents ==

=== Books ===
The ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' consists of thirteen sections, called books. As with many medieval manuscripts that were handcopied or, particularly, printed in the early years of printing, there were considerable differences between various editions of the same text, as the process of transcription was highly personal. An example illustrating how the ''Syntaxis'' was organized is given below. It is a Latin edition printed in 1515 at Venice by Petrus Lichtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Almagestum (1515) |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/hwastro/rare/1515_ptolemae.htm |publisher=Universit√§t Wien |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Book I contains an outline of [[Aristotle]]'s cosmology: on the spherical form of the heavens, with the spherical Earth lying motionless as the center, with the [[fixed stars]] and the various [[planets]] revolving around the Earth. Then follows an explanation of [[chord (geometry)|chords]] with [[Ptolemy's table of chords|table of chords]]; observations of the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]] (the apparent path of the Sun through the stars); and an introduction to [[spherical trigonometry]].
* Book II covers problems associated with the daily motion attributed to the heavens, namely risings and settings of celestial objects, the length of daylight, the determination of [[latitude]], the points at which the [[Sun]] is vertical, the shadows of the [[gnomon]] at the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s, and other observations that change with the spectator's position. There is also a study of the angles made by the ecliptic with the vertical, with tables.
* Book III covers the length of the year, and the motion of the [[Sun]]. Ptolemy explains Hipparchus' discovery of the [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the equinoxes and begins explaining the theory of [[epicycles]].
* Books IV and V cover the motion of the [[Moon]], lunar [[parallax]], the motion of the lunar [[apogee]], and the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon relative to the Earth.
* Book VI covers solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s.
* Books VII and VIII cover the motions of the fixed stars, including precession of the equinoxes. They also contain a [[star catalogue]] of 1022 stars, described by their positions in the [[constellation]]s, together with [[ecliptic coordinates|ecliptic longitude and latitude]]. Ptolemy states that the longitudes (which increase due to [[precession]]) are for the beginning of the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138 AD), whereas the latitudes do not change with time. (But see below, under [[Almagest#The star catalog|The star catalog]].) The constellations north of the [[zodiac]] and the northern zodiac constellations (Aries through Virgo) are in the table at the end of Book VII, while the rest are in the table at the beginning of Book VIII. The brightest stars were marked first [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] (''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), while the faintest visible to the naked eye were sixth magnitude (''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6). Each numerical magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following one, which is a [[logarithmic scale]]. (The ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed.) This system is believed to have originated with Hipparchus. The stellar positions too are of Hipparchan origin, despite Ptolemy's claim to the contrary.
: Ptolemy identified 48 constellations: The 12 of the [[zodiac]], 21 to the north of the zodiac, and 15 to the south.&lt;ref name="ley196312"&gt;{{Cite magazine

* Book IX addresses general issues associated with creating models for the five [[naked eye planet]]s, and the motion of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].
* Book X covers the motions of [[Venus]] and [[Mars]].
* Book XI covers the motions of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].
* Book XII covers stations and [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]], which occurs when planets appear to pause, then briefly reverse their motion against the background of the zodiac. Ptolemy understood these terms to apply to Mercury and Venus as well as the outer planets.
* Book XIII covers motion in latitude, that is, the deviation of planets from the ecliptic.

=== Ptolemy's cosmos ===

The cosmology of the ''Syntaxis'' includes five main points, each of which is the subject of a chapter in Book I. What follows is a close paraphrase of Ptolemy's own words from Toomer's translation.&lt;ref name=toomer /&gt;

* The celestial realm is spherical, and moves as a sphere.
* The Earth is a sphere.
* The Earth is at the center of the cosmos.
* The Earth, in relation to the distance of the fixed stars, has no appreciable size and must be treated as a mathematical point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ptolemy |title = Almagest}}, Book I, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Earth does not move.

===The star catalog===
As mentioned, Ptolemy includes a star catalog containing 1022 stars. He says that he "observed as many stars as it was possible to perceive, even to the sixth magnitude", and that the [[ecliptic longitude]]s are for the beginning of the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138 AD). But calculations show that his ecliptic longitudes correspond more closely to around 58 AD. He states that he found that the longitudes had increased by 2¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ since the time of [[Hipparchos]]. This is the amount of [[axial precession]] that occurred between the time of Hipparchos and 58 AD. It appears therefore that Ptolemy took a star catalog of Hipparchos and simply added 2¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ to the longitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Christian Peters]] and [[Edward Knobel]]|title=Ptolemy's Catalogue of the Stars ‚Äì A Revision of the Almagest|date=1915|page=15|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924012300491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the longitudes and latitudes have been corrupted in the various manuscripts. Most of these errors can be explained by similarities in the symbols used for different numbers. For example, the Greek letters Œë and Œî were used to mean 1 and 4 respectively, but because these look similar copyists sometimes wrote the wrong one. In Arabic manuscripts, there was confusion between for example 3 and 8 (ÿ¨ and ÿ≠). (At least one translator also introduced errors. [[Gerard of Cremona]], who translated an Arabic manuscript into Latin around 1175, put 300¬∞ for the latitude of several stars. He had apparently learned from [[Moors]], who used the letter "sin" for 300, but the manuscript he was translating came from the East, where "sin" was used for 60.)&lt;ref&gt;Peters and Knobel, pp. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even without the errors introduced by copyists, and even accounting for the fact that the longitudes are more appropriate for 58 AD than for 137 AD, the latitudes and longitudes are not very accurate, with errors of large fractions of a degree. Some errors may be due to [[atmospheric refraction]] causing stars that are low in the sky to appear higher than where they really are.&lt;ref&gt;Peters and Knobel, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of stars in [[Centaurus]] are off by a couple degrees, including the star we call [[Alpha Centauri]]. These were probably measured by a different person or persons from the others, and in an inaccurate way.&lt;ref&gt;Peters and Knobel, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ptolemy's planetary model ===
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|16th-century representation of Ptolemy's [[geocentric model]] in Peter Apian's ''Cosmographia'', 1524]]

Ptolemy assigned the following order to the [[planetary spheres]], beginning with the innermost:
{{Colbegin|colwidth=30em}}
# Moon
# Mercury
# Venus
# Sun
# Mars
# Jupiter
# Saturn
# Sphere of fixed stars
{{colend}}
Other classical writers suggested different sequences. [[Plato]] (c. 427 ‚Äì c. 347 BC) placed the Sun second in order after the Moon. [[Martianus Capella]] (5th century AD) put Mercury and Venus in motion around the Sun. Ptolemy's authority was preferred by most [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic]] and late medieval European astronomers.

Ptolemy inherited from his Greek predecessors a geometrical toolbox and a partial set of models for predicting where the planets would appear in the sky. [[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 ‚Äì c. 190 BC) had introduced the [[deferent and epicycle]] and the eccentric deferent to astronomy. Hipparchus (2nd century BC) had crafted mathematical models of the motion of the Sun and Moon. Hipparchus had some knowledge of [[History of Astronomy#Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian astronomy]], and he felt that Greek models should match those of the Babylonians in accuracy. He was unable to create accurate models for the remaining five planets.

The ''Syntaxis'' adopted Hipparchus' solar model, which consisted of a simple eccentric deferent. For the Moon, Ptolemy began with Hipparchus' epicycle-on-deferent, then added a device that historians of astronomy refer to as a "crank mechanism":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Hoskin |title = The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy}} Chapter 2, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded in creating models for the other planets, where Hipparchus had failed, by introducing a third device called the [[equant]].

Ptolemy wrote the ''Syntaxis'' as a textbook of mathematical astronomy. It explained geometrical models of the planets based on combinations of circles, which could be used to predict the motions of celestial objects. In a later book, the ''Planetary Hypotheses'', Ptolemy explained how to transform his geometrical models into [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional spheres]] or partial spheres. In contrast to the mathematical ''Syntaxis'', the ''Planetary Hypotheses'' is sometimes described as a book of [[cosmology]].

== Impact ==

Ptolemy's comprehensive treatise of mathematical astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy. Some were more specialized and thus of less interest; others simply became outdated by the newer models. As a result, the older texts ceased to be copied and were gradually lost. Much of what we know about the work of astronomers like Hipparchus comes from references in the ''Syntaxis''.

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' became an authoritative work for many centuries.]]
The first translations into Arabic were made in the 9th century, with two separate efforts, one sponsored by the [[caliph]] [[Al-Ma'mun]].  [[Sahl ibn Bishr]] is thought to be the first Arabic translator.  By this time, the ''Syntaxis'' was lost in Western Europe, or only dimly remembered. [[Henry Aristippus]] made the first Latin translation directly from a Greek copy, but it was not as influential as a later translation into Latin made by [[Gerard of Cremona]] from the Arabic (finished in 1175).&lt;ref&gt;See p. 3 of Introduction of the Toomis translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard translated the Arabic text while working at the [[Toledo School of Translators]], although he was unable to translate many technical terms such as the Arabic ''Abrachir'' for Hipparchus. In the 12th century a Spanish version was produced, which was later translated under the patronage of [[Alfonso X]].

[[File:Almagest 1.jpeg|thumb|200px|Picture of [[George of Trebizond]]'s Latin translation of the ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' or ''Almagest'']]
In the 15th century, a Greek version appeared in Western Europe. The German astronomer Johannes M√ºller (known, from his birthplace of [[K√∂nigsberg]], as [[Regiomontanus]]) made an abridged Latin version at the instigation of the Greek churchman [[Johannes Bessarion|Johannes, Cardinal Bessarion]]. Around the same time, [[George of Trebizond]] made a full translation accompanied by a commentary that was as long as the original text. George's translation, done under the patronage of [[Pope Nicholas V]], was intended to supplant the old translation. The new translation was a great improvement; the new commentary was not, and aroused criticism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The Pope declined the dedication of George's work,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and Regiomontanus's translation had the upper hand for over 100 years.

During the 16th century, [[Guillaume Postel]], who had been on an embassy to the [[Ottoman Empire]], brought back Arabic disputations of the ''Almagest'', such as the works of [[al-Kharaqƒ´]], ''MuntahƒÅ al-idrƒÅk fƒ´ taqƒÅsƒ´m al-aflƒÅk'' ("The Ultimate Grasp of the Divisions of Spheres", 1138/9).&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic science and the making of European Renaissance'', by George Saliba, p. 218 {{ISBN|978-0-262-19557-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentaries on the ''Syntaxis'' were written by [[Theon of Alexandria]] (extant), [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (only fragments survive), and [[Ammonius Hermiae]] (lost).

== Modern editions ==
The ''Almagest'' was edited by [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|J. L. Heiberg]] in ''Claudii Ptolemaei opera quae exstant omnia'', vols. 1.1 and 1.2 (1898, 1903).

Three translations of the ''Almagest'' into English have been published. The first, by [[R. Catesby Taliaferro]] of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], was included in volume 16 of the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' in 1952. The second, by [[G. J. Toomer]], ''Ptolemy's Almagest'' in 1984, with a second edition in 1998.&lt;ref name=toomer&gt;
{{Citation|title=Ptolemy's Almagest|last1=Toomer|url=https://isidore.co/calibre/get/pdf/Ptolemy%26%2339%3Bs%20Almagest%20-%20Ptolemy%2C%20Claudius%20%26amp%3B%20Toomer%2C%20G.%20J__5114.pdf|first1=G. J.|authorlink=G. J. Toomer|publisher=Princeton University Press|date= 1998|ISBN =0-691-00260-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was a partial translation by Bruce M.

A direct French translation from the Greek text was published in two volumes in 1813 and 1816 by [[Nicholas Halma]], including detailed historical comments in a 69-page preface. The scanned books are available in full at the ''[[Gallica]]'' French national library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halma|first=Nicolas|title=Composition math√©matique de Claude Ptol√©m√©e, traduite pour la premi√®re fois du grec en fran√ßais, sur les manuscrits originaux de la biblioth√®que imp√©riale de Paris, tome 1|date=1813|publisher=J.

'''Apolista''' is a native [[South America]]n nation of western [[Bolivia]]. Sedentary farmers, hunters, gatherers and fishers, they spoke an [[Arawakan languages]] now [[List of endangered languages in South America|gravely endangered]], if not extinct. From 1713, they were gathered at a variety of missions with other nations, and rapidly lost their traditional culture to the point that a realistic census count is no longer possible.

The '''Australian Grains Genebank''' (AGG) is a national center for storing genetic material for [[plant breeding]] and research. The Genebank is in a collaboration with the Australian Seed Bank Partnership on an Australian Crop Wild Relatives project. It is located at Grains Innovation Park, in [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]], Victoria, Australia.

==Objectives and challenges==
The Australian Grains Genebank ('''AGG''') aims to collect and conserve the seeds of Australian crop wild species, that are not yet adequately represented in existing collections. 40 key species of [[crop]] wild, 32 of which are [[endemic]] to Australia, have been identified as being crucial to increasing Australia's stock of grain crops. Seeds of [[crop wild relatives]] (CWR) will be available to plant breeders and researchers in order to develop the plant varieties of the future. The seeds will be stored not only in the Australian Grains Genebank but also in the Australian Seed Bank Partnership member seed banks.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Seedpartnership|url=http://www.seedpartnership.org.au/associates/agg|publisher=Council of Heads of Australian Botanic Gardens Inc.|accessdate=17 November 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This project will enable research into new plant varieties, that are vital to Australia's agricultural future. Progress can be made in understanding the [[genetic material]] contained in the crops.

One of the main objectives of the Australian Grains Genebank is helping the research; for this reason, this institution distributes about 25,000 packets of seeds to scientists in Australia and overseas. Therefore, they can evaluate this material for characteristics that could be used to breed more productive grain crops. These characteristics include the resistance to heat, [[frost]], [[drought]], pests and diseases.

Another fact about Australian Grains Genebank is that it uses a DNA-based [[soil]] testing service, to assist grain growers in predicting the losses from various diseases before a crop is planted. Growers have the option of changing [[cultivars]] or modifying cropping programs, in situations where the risk of crop loss is high. The service was launched in 1997 and the initial focus was on grain and [[barley]], but [[pathogens]] of rotation crops are now included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|last1=Dr Gio Braidotti|title=Australian Grains Genebank helping research and development|url=https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/groundcover/ground-cover-issue-124-septemberoctober-2016/national-genebank-a-regional-rd-powerhouse|publisher=Grains Research and Development Corporation|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
In 2009 the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] provided $3 millions to [[Sally Norton]], leader of the Australian Grains Genebank to make the bank, also promising $600,000 per year for the next five years toward operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|last1=Field|first1=Emma|title=$6 million Australian Grains Genebank opened in Horsham last week|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/agribusiness/cropping/million-australian-grains-genebank-opened-in-horsham-last-week/news-story/975ac7909b495b480fe9337994f2441e|accessdate=21 November 2017|publisher=the weekly times|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank was officially opened in March, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McFadden|first1=Erin|title=Horsham opens Australian Grains Genebank|url=http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/2181959/horsham-opens-australian-grains-genebank/|accessdate=5 October 2017|agency=The Wimmera Mail-Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;The budget is provided by the Government of Victoria and the [[Grains Research and Development Corporation]], a corporation that is supported by the [[Government of Australia]].

The AGG is a national seed store bank completed by H2o architects, on the [[Wimmera]] flatland at the edge of Horsham, Victoria, for the Victorian [[Department of Environment and Primary Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Australian Grains Genebank Facility|url=http://www.h2oarchitects.com.au/project/australian-grains-genebank/|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=H2o architects}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility has more than 2.7 kilometres of space to give a secure store for [[seed]] specimens. The building is also used for seed development, seed requests and contains a [[packaging]] and receiving area, administration areas, drying facilities, [[freezers]] working at -20 degrees [[Celsius]] and a multipurpose national reception area, or [[lobby (room)|lobby]], to accommodate visiting groups.

A double skin freezer design has an inner [[esky]] box of isolated panels, used for storing seeds and contained within an outer wood clad weather protecting [[lid|cover]]. This design makes certain that the freezers work with less charge, reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of the facility. Efficiency is reached with a robust and environmentally responsible [[mechanical system]].

The building has a strong presence and provides innovation in design, technology and materials. The exterior layer is very similar to a [[pergola]], with thousands of timber slats, each one 120 centimetres long, creating the top layer.

==Storage conditions and regeneration==
[[File: Wheat Ear milk full.jpg|thumb|Wheat Ear milk full]]
The Horsham bank is the biggest of its kind and is designed for long-term [[Warehouse|storage]]. The material they conserve includes released crop varieties, breeding materials, and crop wild relatives. It serves not only producers but also processors, marketers, breeders and regional farming communities. [[Peter Walsh (Victorian politician)|Peter Walsh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|last2=Peter|title=Australian Grains Genebank|url=https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/groundcover/gc110/australian-genebank|publisher= Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC)|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Victorian Minister of [[Agriculture]], explained that the bank could contain about 300 million seeds from all around the globe. The bank has the capacity to hold 200,000 packets of seeds and more than 200 different crop species. In 2017 the collection held about 138,016 different seeds (or assessions), and it is growing about 3000 seeds each year.

The most representative crop names stored are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|date=26 October 2016|title=The Most Representative Crop Names| url=https://www.genesys-pgr.org/content/news/55/australian-grains-genebank|publisher=Genesys|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Wheat]]''' with 42,624 different species coming from different areas of the world, mainly from [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[Africa]].

*'''[[Barley]]''' with 19,062 different types, mainly from Europe and [[Central Asia]].

*'''[[Chickpea]]''' with 9,771 different breeds, coming from Australia, Africa, Europe and Asia Minor.

*'''[[Pea]]''' with about 7,558 different categories, principally coming from Europe, [[United State of America]], [[South America]] and Australia.

*'''[[Lentil]]''' with 5,061 different species, coming from [[Asia Minor]], Central Asia, Europe and Africa.

The seed [[drying]] room operates at 15 degrees Celsius and 15% of humidity. Seeds remain in this room form four to six weeks to dry down to around 6% seed [[moisture]] before being sealed into foil packets and placed under long-term storage at -20 degrees Celsius.

AGG routinely conduct seed viability monitoring tests because seeds lose their ability to [[germinate]], even under long-term conditions. Once seed germination drops below 85%, and the seed quantity they have in the store is below 500 seeds, the genebank regenerates the seed. They regenerate around 4000 different samples per year under field and greenhouse environments. When they regenerate seeds, they consider the biology of the plants to ensure the right soil mix, temperatures, control pollination for outcrossing species.

==Longevity==
In order to keep the seeds safe, they are stored in 2.7 kilometres of shelf space at -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]) with very low [[moisture]]. The seeds can remain viable for 50 or 100 years (depending on the kind of seed), preserving, in this way, the genetic materials.
[[File:Genebank4 (4331057760).jpg|thumb|Genebank|left]]

The primary reason for the bank to be created was the extreme temperatures in the area, up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summertime. Because of that, they had to ensure the protection of the grains all year around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crafti|first1=Stephen|title=Australian Grains Genebank Built For Extreme Temperatures|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/australian-grains-genebank-built-for-extreme-temperatures-20150625-ghxtp7.html|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=The Sydney Morning Harold|date=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longevity of seeds differs; some keep well for decades, crops are grown out regularly and new grains assembled to increase the collection. A [[database]] carries the information about the origin and characteristics of each seed line (none genetically modified) and features of seed viability and the quantity held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|last1=Rance|first1=Carolyn|title=Securing the Future of Crops|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/securing-the-future-of-crops-20160515-govpb0.html|date=21 May 2016|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeds are placed in controlled maturing environments with high temperatures and a certain [[humidity]] (RH; 45¬∞C and 60 % RH). The [[Lithium chloride]] (LiCl) helps to obtain the right RH environment.

The seed survival curve, that can be acquired from the [[germination]] test, is compared with the longevity of ‚Äòmarker‚Äô species aged under the same conditions. From here, longevity categories can be distinguished: this is most important for [[alpine plant|alpine]] seeds, as recent proofs show that grains from cooler and wetter habitats are shorter lived than seeds from warmer ones.
Longevity checks can also indicate how seeds should be conserved.

== Australian Seed Bank Partnership==
The main goal of the  Australian Seed Bank Partnership is to save about 1700 native species of plant and [[ecological]] communities facing [[extinction]] due to [[habitat]] loss, and the [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] of [[invasive species]]. To accomplish this objective, the partnership maintains a safe and [[sustainable]] [[Natural environment|environment]], and collects and stores seeds to help research on the subject.

[[File:Genebank6 (4330334301).jpg|thumb|Genebank's seeds]]

The '''Australian Grains Genebank''' is one of the most important members of the Australian Seed Bank [[Partnership]], which is an alliance between 12 organizations that are trying to deal with the multitude of threats facing Australian [[biodiversity]] by working together. The partnership consists of nine seeds banks, that are storing and conserving seeds, and three flora-focused organizations, that have the mission not only to fulfill the gap between policymakers, researcher, and seed collectors, but also to manage the on-ground conservation and restoration activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Information About Australian Seed Bank Partnership|url=http://www.seedpartnership.org.au/about/aboutus|publisher=Australian Seed Bank Partnership|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The activities related to the Australian Seed Bank Partnership consist of four simple concepts: [[collecting]], [[research]], supporting [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] and [[sharing knowledge]].

* '''Collecting''': the process of collection and conservation of the native seeds is carried out by organizations, [[non-profit]] institutions and [[community groups]], that are working together to provide a future-proof [[insurance policy]] for Australian's unique seed flora, which is particularly important in time of [[environmental stress]]. One of the main activities, in the field of collecting and storing seeds, involves the coordination of [[seasonal]] seeds collecting fields trips. Some [[experts]], in fact, follow a rigid [[protocol (science)|protocol]] to recognize, collect, clean and store seeds. The experts have also the important task of recording the information (such as the time of the year the seed has been collected, the associated [[vegetation]] and the soil type in the seed-collecting region) and the principal characteristics of the seed. Those information are considered fundamental to the seed banks' future rule in conservation.
* '''Research''': to keep the collected seeds available for a long time and under controlled conditions, the research process is a central concept. To store a seed properly the researcher must establish what is required by each category or type of seed (for example if they require a specific temperature or if it needs light and moisture cues to germinate).
* '''Supporting Restoration''': one of the most important activities in which the Australian Seed Bank Partnership is involved, is the [[row (database)|recording]] of all the data about Australian native crops. This process is considered that important because it informs the restoration of plant communities and landscapes. In order to achieve this objective, the Australian Seed Bank Partnership applies the [[scientific]] knowledge to the field and shares it with the restoration community. This institution, thanks to this process, has already saved a lot of [[Australian native plants]], discovered new species and rediscovered species that they thought to be extinct in the wild.
* '''Sharing knowledge''': The Australian Seed Bank Partnership shares his knowledge among all the existing Australian conservation seed banks, restoration practitioners, and community groups. By sharing this knowledge, they hope to build a greater understanding of seed science in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Australian Seed Bank Partnership Activity|url=http://www.seedpartnership.org.au/about/whatwedo#restoration|publisher=Council of Heads of Australian Botanic Gardens Inc.|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Grains Genebank is related to the Australian Seed Bank Partnership. They are actually [[collaborating]] on an Australian Crop Wild Relatives project. Through this project, these two institutions are trying to store all the Australian crop wild relatives, that are not yet represented in the ex-suit collection. The 32 wild crop species will be stored and [[conservation (ethic)|preserved]] on the facilities of the Australian Grains Genebank. This project is considered really important, because saving and storing the wild crops will enable researchers into new plant [[variety (botany)|varieties]], that will be important for the future and the development of the Australian agriculture.

'''Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ''' (English: ''White Elephant''; Ukrainian: –ë—ñ–ª–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–Ω, Bily slon) is a Polish name for an abandoned campus of the former [[Poland|Polish]] Astronomical and Meteorological Observatory of [[Warsaw University]], located at remote area on the peak of [[Pip Ivan (Chornohora)|Pip Ivan]] in the [[Chornohora]] range of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], [[Ukraine]]. Currently the structure is used as a [[mountain shelter]] with a small search and rescue team with some rooms adopted for lodging and recovery. 

Along with that Bialy Slon is recognized as a historical landmark and there are restoration activities on the way since 2012 to restore its original conditions in cooperation with the [[Vasyl Stefanyk Subcarpathian National University|Ciscarpathian National University]] and the [[Warsaw University]] and scheduled to be finished in 2018.&lt;ref name=renovation/&gt; It is considered to be the highest built residential structure in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=renovation&gt;[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2015/10/7/148602/ Renovation of the abandoned observatory at the Carpatian peak continues]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 7 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest settlement today is a village of Zelena in [[Verkhovyna Raion]] ([[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]) and territorially belongs to the Zelena rural council. Currently the observatory is classified under the registration number three as a monument of cultural heritage that is not considered for privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?page=1&amp;nreg=574-17 Law of Ukraine: About the list of monuments of cultural heritage that are not considered for privatization (#574-17, September 23, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is located with the [[Carpathian National Nature Park]].

The region was part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] when the observatory was established during the interbellum period. Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ, started in 1937 and completed in the summer of 1938, was the highest-elevated, permanently inhabited, building in Poland.&lt;ref name="IWAN"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://rzecz-pospolita.com/pop-iwan0.php3]&lt;/ref&gt; It was located on the international border between the [[Second Polish Republic]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] that stretched across mountain peaks of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].

==Polish observatory==
===Preparation and construction===
[[File:Plan obserwatorium 1935.jpg|thumb|1935 draft plan (side view)]]
[[File:Plan tender observatorium2.jpg|thumb|1935 draft plan (top view)]]
According to Wladyslaw Midowicz, the first and only director of the observatory, the construction of "Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ" was suggested by a group of influential Warsaw astronomers who managed to convince General [[Leon Berbecki]], director of the influential [[Airborne and Antigas Defence League]], to support it. General [[Tadeusz Kasprzycki]], minister of military affairs, also backed the construction of the observatory.&lt;ref name="MIDO"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://karpaccy.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=31]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building design was approved sometime in 1935.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2012/07/9/89646/ The abandoned observatory in Carpathians will be rescued. (–ó–∞–∫–∏–Ω—É—Ç—É –æ–±—Å–µ—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—é –≤ –ö–∞—Ä–ø–∞—Ç–∞—Ö –±—É–¥—É—Ç—å —Ä—è—Ç—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏. –§–û–¢–û)]. Istorychna Pravda ([[Ukrayinska Pravda]]). 9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of this impressive building began in the summer of 1936&lt;ref name=history/&gt; with an official ceremony for the placing of the cornerstone. Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ was a very expensive structure with total costs exceeding one million Polish [[z≈Çoty]], a huge burden for the state budget of the time. The design was based on the [[Przemy≈õl Castle]] and shaped like a letter "L" with a tower.

The whole complex consists of three major features that could be considered as separate structure connected together, a tower, a main building, and smaller service attachment. Due to relief, "Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ" had five stories facing the Czechoslovakian side (today [[Zakarpattia Oblast]]) and two stories facing the Polish (today [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The whole complex was built mostly from local [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Due to lack of roads, the construction materials were brought by horses or either by hand or back of local [[Hutsuls]] and soldiers of the [[49th Hutsul Rifle Regiment]] from the [[Vorokhta train station]] located some {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIDO" /&gt; The walls of a lower attachment and the [[semi-basement]] floor have thickness of {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while upper floors - {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The roof of a building was covered with copper sheets.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; At the southern side was located a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] on which was located a telescope.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The copper dome of the telescope opened automatically.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; 

The "Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ" had 43 rooms including a conference hall, living quarters, offices, a cafeteria, a battery station, and a boiler room in the basement (the lower structure).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The upper floors were occupied by astronomers and meteorologists, most of whom worked for the State Meteorological Institute and Astronomical Observatory of the [[Warsaw University]]. Their work was to carry out meteorological observations for the Polish Air Force. In the lower levels, there were lodgings of soldiers of the "Karpaty" Regiment of the [[Border Defence Corps]], with headquarters in [[Stryi|Stryj]].&lt;ref name="IWAN" /&gt; Altogether, the number of inhabitants never exceeded 20. Among those who worked there were professor [[Wlodzimierz Zonn]], doctor [[Jan Gadomski]], and professor [[Eugeniusz Rybka]].

===Opening and operations===
The opening ceremony of the building took place on July 29, 1938.&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.atomnet.pl/~geodeta/1997/24text.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Its official name was the "Observatory of the State Meteorological Institute", but soon it took on the nickname "Bia≈Çy S≈Ço≈Ñ", due to the color of its walls. The observatory was lavishly equipped, with a custom-made [[astrograph]] and [[refracting telescope]] made by the renowned British company [[Grubb Parsons]] of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. It had its own power plant with two Diesel [[motor-generator]]s and central heating fueled by oil, which was transported in iron barrels from the "Polmin" company in Borys≈Çaw (today [[Boryslav]]). The military authorities also installed their own equipment, including two [[radiotelephone]] prototypes constructed to withstand high altitude.

The observatory was located in a remote, deserted area, with the nearest store and mail office {{convert|12|mi|km}} away (at ≈ªabie, today [[Verkhovyna]]), the nearest doctor {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, and a rail station in [[Kolomyia]] as far as {{convert|80|mi|km}} away. The directory of the observatory a local of Mykulychyn W≈Çadys≈Çaw Midowicz wrote that the staff's main problem, however, was water, as no waterworks had been constructed and it had to be carried from a stream {{convert|4|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name="MIDO" /&gt;

For fourteen months (July 1938-September 1939) the Observatory was the highest-elevated, permanently inhabited, building of interbellum Poland. As entry was permitted only with a special military pass, local Hutsuls made up several legends about the building and its inhabitants. Wladyslaw Midowicz wrote that the Hutsuls thought that the Observatory was in fact a mighty cannon, capable of attacking neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="MIDO" /&gt;

On September 18, 1939, following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet aggression]] on eastern part of Poland (see: [[Kresy]]), the personnel of the Observatory packed the most important equipment (including the [[Refracting telescope|refractor]]{{cn|date=December 2017}}) and left toward the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border.&lt;ref name="GEO" /&gt; At first it was taken to the Budapest [[Konkoly Observatory]], and by the end of war to the [[Vienna Observatory]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Within the first years after the war, the equipment returned to Poland.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The three-lens [[Objective (optics)|objective]] today is located in the [[Silesian Planetarium]] ([[Katowice]]).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

At the end of the month, the [[Red Army]] captured the building. After the region was united with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (NASU) sent an expedition.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; On 31 December 1939 the first academician-astronomer of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR Oleksandr Orlov ascended to the observatory.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; He established that the most valuable equipment has been taken out of the building, including five lenses of big diameter, two lenses of smaller diameter, two [[micrometer]]s, and two chronometers.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Based on the Orlov's report, the NASU Presidium declared that the Carpathian Astronomical Observatory (the newly acquired name) is transferred to the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, based on the resolution of the government of the Ukrainian SSR of 2 January 1940.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The director of the Carpathian Observatory was appointed academician Oleksandr Orlov.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Until June 1941 it was used as a meteorological station.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In the summer of 1941 (see: [[Operation Barbarossa]]), the Observatory was seized by the [[Wehrmacht]], which in turn was passed to the Hungarian troops,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; who were stationed there until winter 1941. After that, the deserted building became a ruin, even though it had not been damaged during the war, the locals reused all remaining material.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Even the [[cast iron]] batteries were taken away.&lt;ref name=mukachevo/&gt;

It was reported that Germans have taken out metal parts of [[astrograph]] to Lviv.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Now they are kept indoors of the [[Lviv University]] Faculty of Physics.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Revival==
Recovery of the building started only after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], but very slow. In mid-1990s scientists of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], led by professor Anatoliy Dultsev, together with their colleagues from [[Warsaw Polytechnic]], brought forward the idea of rebuilding of the Observatory. In October 1996 a special conference took place in [[Lviv]] and [[Yaremche]], but according to ''atomnet.pl'' from May 1997 no works have been started.&lt;ref name="GEO" /&gt; 

On January 24, 2002 another Scientific council took place in [[Yaremche]] to renew the rebuilding project of the observatory. In the beginning of October 2002 the head of the [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]] administration Mykhailo Vyshyvaniuk sent an official letter to the [[President of Ukraine]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] about the project. By the end of November of the same year Vyshyvaniuk received an answer from the First Deputy of the President administration [[Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy]] stating that the proposition was reviewed and recognized as one for the international discussion for the restoration. In that regard the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was given the required orders. Between 1998 and 2010 there took place some a dozen of summer expeditions which contributed to the historical reconstruction of the building's construction.

In 2012 the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture of Poland]] has directed some $70,000 as a grant program which is in partnership with the Ciscarpathian University.&lt;ref name=lightning/&gt; Along with Warsaw and Ciscarpathian university, total amount of money allocated for preparation works accounted to $100,000.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Since July 2012&lt;ref name=history/&gt; there started some preparation work and continued in fall of 2012,  having all window openings be sealed with bricks and roof covered.&lt;ref name=reporter&gt;{{uk icon}} http://www.report.if.ua/portal/novyny/na-gori-pip-ivan-pochaly-zamurovuvaty-observatoriyu-foto On the Pip Ivan mountain started to wall up the observatory (–ù–∞ –≥–æ—Ä—ñ –ü—ñ–ø –Ü–≤–∞–Ω –ø–æ—á–∞–ª–∏ –∑–∞–º—É—Ä–æ–≤—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –æ–±—Å–µ—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—é (–§–û–¢–û))].

Since 2015 within the building is located a [[mountain rescue]] post of the Ivano-Frankivsk branch of the [[State Emergency Service of Ukraine]]. The post is unique as it is the most high-altitude government institution in Ukraine. The post is insulated and electrified. There is a [[wifi]] and separate space for visitors.

The tourist traffic over [[Chornohora]] Ridge is constant and especially in summer exceeds 6,000 people per month according to statistics of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in 2017. Between summer of 2016 and summer of 2017, the mountain was visited by 4,000 groups with total population exceeding 22,000 people with 9,000 of which were foreigners. Some 420 groups (about 1,500 people) managed to find shelter at the top. The rescue post conducted seven search and rescue missions saving eight people and providing various type of help to 89 others.

In 2017 there was initiated a creation of a joint Polish-Ukrainian mountain rescue service and a school of mountain rescue.&lt;ref name=lightning/&gt; During the actively ongoing restoration activities in 2017, main rooms of [[mountain shelter]] are not available, but some provisionally space was created without heating capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171229020157/https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-tourism/2334130-bilij-slon-dopomoze-turistam-z-ukrittam.html White Elephant will help tourists with shelter (–ë—ñ–ª–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–Ω –¥–æ–ø–æ–º–æ–∂–µ —Ç—É—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞–º –∑ —É–∫—Ä–∏—Ç—Ç—è–º)].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''calcaneal fracture''' is a [[fracture (bone)|break]] of the [[calcaneus]] (heel bone).&lt;ref name=AO2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcaneus (Heel Bone) Fractures-OrthoInfo - AAOS|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00524|website=orthoinfo.aaos.org|accessdate=12 October 2017|date=January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618014208/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00524|archivedate=18 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms may include pain, bruising, trouble walking, and deformity of the [[heel]].&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt; It may be associated with breaks of the [[hip fracture|hip]] or [[spinal fracture|back]].&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
It usually occurs when a person lands on their feet following a fall from a height or during a [[motor vehicle collision]].&lt;ref name=Pal2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt; Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by [[radiography|X-rays]] or [[CT scan]]ing.&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
If the bones remain normally aligned treatment may be by [[orthopedic cast|casting]] without weight bearing for around eights weeks.&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt; If the bones are not properly aligned surgery is generally required.&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt; Returning the bones to their normal position results in better outcomes.&lt;ref name=Pal2012/&gt; Surgery may be delayed a few days as long as the skin remained intact.&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
About 2% of all fractures are calcaneal fractures, however, they make up 60% of fractures of the [[tarsal bone|mid foot bones]].&lt;ref name=Pal2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmersheim|first1=K|last2=Hines|first2=B|last3=Olsen|first3=BL|title=Calcaneal fractures: update on current treatments.|journal=Clinics in podiatric medicine and surgery|date=April 2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=205‚Äì20, vii|doi=10.1016/j.cpm.2012.01.007|pmid=22424485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undisplaced fractures may heal in around three months while more significant fractures can take two years.&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt; Difficulties such as [[arthritis]] and decreased range of motion of the foot may remain.&lt;ref name=AO2016/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptom is pain over the heel area, especially when the heel is palpated or squeezed. Patients usually have a history of recent trauma to the area or fall from a height. Other symptoms include: inability to bear weight over the involved foot, limited mobility of the foot, and limping. Upon inspection, the examiner may notice swelling, redness, and hematomas. A hematoma extending to the sole of the foot is called "Mondor Sign", and is pathognomonic for calcaneal fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1232246|Calcaneus Fractures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richman |first1=JD |last2=Barre |first2=PS |title=The plantar ecchymosis sign in fractures of the calcaneus |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research |issue=207 |pages=122‚Äì5 |year=1986 |pmid=3720074 |doi=10.1097/00003086-198606000-00022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heel may also become widened with associated edema due to displacement of lateral calcaneal border. Involvement of soft tissue (tendons, skin, etc.,) should be evaluated because soft tissue injury has been associated to serious complications (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=G.

==Cause==
Calcaneal fractures are often attributed to shearing stress adjoined with compressive forces combined with a rotary direction (Soeur, 1975&lt;ref name="Soeur-1975"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert |last1=Soeur |first2=Robert |last2=Remy |title=Fractures of the calcaneus with displacement of the thalamic portion |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. British Volume |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=413‚Äì21 |year=1975 |pmid=1194308 |url=http://bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1194308}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These forces are typically linked to injuries in which an individual falls from a height, involvement in an automobile accident, or muscular stress where the resulting forces can lead to the trauma of fracture. Overlooked aspects of what can lead to a calcaneal fracture are the roles of [[osteoporosis]] and [[diabetes]].

Unfortunately, the prevention of falls and automobile accidents is limited and applies to unique circumstances that should be avoided. The risk of muscular [[stress fractures]] can be reduced through [[stretching]] and weight-bearing exercise, such as [[strength training]]. In addition, footwear can influence forces that may cause a calcaneal fracture and can prevent them as well. A 2012 study conducted by Salzler&lt;ref name="Salzler-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salzler |first1=Matthew J. |last2=Bluman |first2=Eric M. |last3=Noonan |first3=Samantha |last4=Chiodo |first4=Christopher P. |last5=de Asla |first5=Richard J. |title=Injuries Observed in Minimalist Runners |journal=Foot &amp; Ankle International |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=262‚Äì6 |year=2012 |pmid=22735197 |doi=10.3113/FAI.2012.0262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the increasing trend toward minimalist footwear or running barefoot can lead to a variety of stress fractures including that of the calcaneus.

===Osteoporosis===
Bone mineral density decreases with increasing age. [[osteoporosis|Osteoporotic]] bone loss can be prevented through an adequate intake of [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin D]], coupled with exercise and by being a non-smoker. A study by Cheng et al. in 1997,&lt;ref name="Cheng-1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cheng |first1=Sulin |last2=Suominen |first2=Harri |last3=Sakari-Rantala |first3=Ritva |last4=Laukkanen |first4=Pia |last5=Avikainen |first5=Veikko |last6=Heikkinen |first6=Eino |title=Calcaneal Bone Mineral Density Predicts Fracture Occurrence: A Five-Year Follow-up Study in Elderly People |journal=Journal of Bone and Mineral Research |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1075‚Äì82 |year=1997 |pmid=9200007 |doi=10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.7.1075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that greater bone density indicated less risk for fractures in the calcaneus.

===Diabetes===
In 1991, Kathol&lt;ref name="Kathol-1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kathol |first1=M H |last2=el-Khoury |first2=G Y |last3=Moore |first3=T E |last4=Marsh |first4=J L |title=Calcaneal insufficiency avulsion fractures in patients with diabetes mellitus |journal=Radiology |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=725‚Äì9 |year=1991 |pmid=1871285 |doi=10.1148/radiology.180.3.1871285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study which showed a correlation between calcaneal insufficiency avulsion fractures (a fracture in which the [[Achilles tendon]] removes a portion of the bone as it rescinds) and diabetes mellitus. The diabetic population is more susceptible to the risks of fracture and potential healing complications and infection that may lead to [[limb amputation]]. Diabetes can be regulated and prevented through diet and exercise.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:CalcanealfractCT.png|thumb|right|A fractured calcaneus as seen on CT]]
Conventional radiography is usually the initial assessment tool when a calcaneal fracture is suspected. Recommended x-ray views are (a) axial, (b) anteroposterior, (c) oblique and (d) views with dorsiflexion and internal rotation of the foot. However, conventional radiography is limited for visualization of calcaneal anatomy, especially at the subtalar joint. A [[CT scan]] is currently the imaging study of choice for evaluating calcaneal injury and has substituted conventional radiography in the classification of calcaneal fractures.&lt;ref name=pmid21257934/&gt; Axial and coronal views are obtained for proper visualization of the calcaneus, subtalar, calcaneocuboid and talonavicular joints.

[[File:Gissane.jpg|thumb|Gissane's angle]]
The calcaneus, also known as the heel bone, is the largest of the tarsal bones and articulates with the cuboid bone anteriorly and the talus bone superiorly. It is responsible for transmitting the majority of the body's weight from the talus bone to the ground.

Calcaneal fractures are categorized as intra-articular or extra-articular on the basis of subtalar joint involvement. Intra-articular fractures are more common and involve the posterior talar articular facet of the calcaneus. The [[Sanders classification]] groups these fractures into four types based on the location of the fracture at the posterior articular surface. Extra-articular fractures are less common and may be located anywhere outside the subtalar joint.&lt;ref name=pmid21257934&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badillo |first1=Kenneth |last2=Pacheco |first2=Jose A. |last3=Padua |first3=Samuel O. |last4=Gomez |first4=Angel A. |last5=Colon |first5=Edgar |last6=Vidal |first6=Jorge A. |title=Multidetector CT Evaluation of Calcaneal Fractures |journal=RadioGraphics |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=81‚Äì92 |year=2011 |pmid=21257934 |doi=10.1148/rg.311105036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extra-articular fractures are categorized depending on whether the involvement of the calcaneus is anterior (Type A), middle (Type B) or posterior (Type C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/calcaneal-fracture |title=Calcaneal fracture |last=Radswiki |display-authors=etal |website=Radiopaedia |access-date=July 20, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014034119/https://radiopaedia.org/articles/calcaneal-fracture |archivedate=October 14, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angle of Gissane, or "Critical Angle", is the angle formed by the downward and upward slopes of the calcaneal superior surface. On a lateral radiograph, an angle of Gissane &gt; 130¬∞ suggests fracture of the posterior subtalar joint surface. Bohler's angle, or the "Tuber Angle", is another normal anatomic landmark seen in lateral radiographs. It is formed by the intersection of 1) a line from the highest point of the posterior articular facet to the highest point of the posterior tuberosity, and 2) a line from the former to the highest point on the anterior articular facet. Bohler's angle is normally 25¬∞ to 40¬∞.&lt;ref name=Miller2015/&gt; A decreased angle is indicative of a calcaneal fracture.

The [[Sanders classification]] system is the most commonly used system for categorizing intra-articular fractures. There are 4 types:
# Type I fractures are non-displaced fractures (displacement &lt; 2&amp;nbsp;mm).
# Type II fractures consist of a single intra-articular fracture that divides the calcaneus into 2 pieces.
#* Type IIA: fracture occurs on lateral aspect of calcaneus.
#* Type IIB: fracture occurs on central aspect of calcaneus.
#* Type IIC: fracture occurs on medial aspect of calcaneus.
# Type III fractures consist of two intra-articular fractures that divide the calcaneus into 3 articular pieces.
#* Type IIIAB: two fracture lines are present, one lateral and one central.
#* Type IIIAC: two fracture lines are present, one lateral and one medial.
#* Type IIIBC: two fracture lines are present, one central and one medial.
# Type IV fractures consist of fractures with more than three intra-articular fractures.

Extra-articular fractures include all fractures that do not involve the posterior facet of the subtalar joint.

* Type A involve the anterior calcaneus
* Type B involve the middle calcaneus. This includes the sustentaculum tali, trochlear process and lateral process.
* Type C involve the posterior calcaneus, the posterior tuberosity and medial tubercle included.

==Treatment==
Non-surgical treatment is for extra-articular fractures and Sanders Type I intra-articular fractures, provided that the calcaneal weight-bearing surface and foot function are not compromised. Physicians may choose to perform closed reduction with or without fixation (casting), or fixation alone (without reduction), depending on the individual case. Recommendations include no weight-bearing for a few weeks followed by range-of-motion exercises and progressive weight bearing for a period of 2‚Äì3 months.

Displaced intra-articular fractures require surgical intervention within 3 weeks of fracture, before bone consolidation has occurred. Conservative surgery consists of closed reduction with percutaneous fixation. This technique is associated with less wound complications, better soft tissue healing (because of less soft tissue manipulati) and decreased intraoperative time. However, this procedure has increased risk of inadequate calcaneal bone fixation, compared to open procedures.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1232246treatment&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1232246|Calcaneus Fractures|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) is usually the preferred surgical approach when dealing with displaced intra-articular fractures. Newer, more innovative surgical techniques and equipment have decreased the incidence of intra- and post-operative complications.

===Rehabilitation===
[[File:Calcaneal fracture neutral lposition.jpg|thumb|Calcaneal fracture neutral lposition]] [[File:Leg Stand.jpg|thumb|Leg Stand]]

Rehabilitation for a calcaneal fractures is dependent on whether surgery was required or not.  Both types of rehabilitation require three phases in which only the first phase is different.

Exercises that can be used for the range of motion phase can include eversion and inversion of the ankle,  [[flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the ankle, and a combination of the two motions to create a circular foot motion. Exercises that allow slight to full body weight to be used in the final phases include stepping forward then back, side-stepping, and leg stand.

===Phases===
The first phase of the rehabilitation after surgery includes keeping the foot elevated and iced for the first 2 days after the operation. After those 2 days, using crutches or a wheelchair in which there is no weight applied to the affected foot is recommended to getting around.  If no operation was performed, the foot should be submitted to frequent range of motion exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Godges |first1=Joe |first2=Robert |last2=Klingman |title=Calcaneal Fracture and Rehabilitation |publisher=Kaiser Permanente |url=http://xnet.kp.org/socal_rehabspecialists/ptr_library/09FootRegion/31Foot-CalcanealFracture.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306020443/https://xnet.kp.org/socal_rehabspecialists/ptr_library/09FootRegion/31Foot-CalcanealFracture.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second phase occurs 6 weeks after and consists of keeping the foot elevated and iced while resting and performing exercises in which only slight weight is applied to the affected area for the next two weeks, others recommend six weeks of this phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hatzokos |first1=I |last2=Karataglis |first2=D |last3=Papadopoulos |first3=P |last4=Dimitriou |first4=C |last5=Christodoulou |first5=A |last6=Pournaras |first6=J |title=Treatment of intra-articular comminuted os calcis fractures |journal=Orthopedics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=25‚Äì9 |year=2006 |pmid=16429931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this phase, range of motion exercises should be implemented if surgery was needed for the fracture. The third and final phase of rehabilitation of calcaneal fractures is to allow the full body weight to be used and use crutches or a cane if needed, between 13 weeks to a year the patient is allowed to resume normal activities.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1232246treatment/&gt;

==Complications==
Evaluating soft-tissue involvement is the most important aspect of the clinical examination because of its association with patient outcome.&lt;ref name=pmid14668494/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soeur-1975"/&gt; Skin blisters may become infected if medical attention is delayed, which can lead to necrotizing fasciitis or osteomyelitis, causing permanent damage to muscle or bone. Ligament and tendon involvement should also be explored. Achilles tendon injury can be seen with posterior (Type C) fractures. Since calcaneal fractures are related to falls from height, other concomitant injuries should be evaluated. Vertebral compression fractures occur in approximately 10% of these patients.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stoller |first1=D. W. |first2=P. F. J. |last2=Tirman |first3=M. |last3=Bredella |chapter=Ankle and foot, osseous fractures, calcaneal fractures |title=Diagnostic imaging: orthopaedics |publisher=Amirsys |location=Salt Lake City |year=2004 |pages=70‚Äì4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trauma-focused clinical approach should be implemented; tibial, knee, femur, hip, and head injuries should be ruled out by means of history and physical exam.

==Society and culture==
The name ''lover's fracture'' is derived from the fact that a lover may jump from great heights while trying to escape from the lover's spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Patrick |last2=Hunter |first2=Tim B. |last3=Taljanovic |first3=Mihra |title=Musculoskeletal Colloquialisms: How Did We Come Up with These Names? |journal=Radiographics |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=1009‚Äì27 |year=2004 |pmid=15256625 |doi=10.1148/rg.244045015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Security Studies''' ('''CSS''') is a  center at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]], which focuses on Swiss and international security.&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center.html |title=About Us |website= css.ethz.ch| publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCENetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osce-network.net/members/institutions/center-for-security-studies-css-eth-zuerich/ |title=OSCE Network |website=osce-network.net| publisher= OSCE Network, OSCE Network of Think Tanks and Academic Institutions |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The center was founded by Prof. Dr. Kurt Spillmann in 1986 and has been led by Prof. Dr. Andreas Wenger since 2002. It also constitutes as part of the [[Center for Comparative and International Studies]] (CIS) along with the political science professorships at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref name=AboutUs /&gt;

The mission of the CSS is to examine the challenges surrounding security policy development and how to deal with them. It does this by performing research on security-related issues and by training researchers and practitioners. The center also includes an independent think tank, which focuses on Swiss and international security policy as well as furthering peace. Another key aim of the CSS is to serve as a link between academia, practitioners and the public on security matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center/mission-statement.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |website= css.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Projects which have been supported by the CSS include the [[Parallel History Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/about/imprint/index.html |title=Imprint ‚àí Parallel History Project |website= ethz.ch |date= | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)| accessdate= 2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online project which collected together and analyzed declassified and other government documents relating to the [[Cold War]], as well as the [[International Relations and Security Network]], an online information service that provided a range of open access products and resources on [[international relations]]. While the International Relations and Security Network was closed in 2016, its extensive [[digital library]] as well as other products have been integrated into the CSS and transformed into a new project, CSS Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services.html |title=Resources | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)|website= css.ethz.ch |date= 2016-10-10 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crespi effect''' is a [[Behavioral contrast|behavioural contrast]] phenomenon first observed in rats by US [[psychologist]] [[Leo P. Crespi]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Leo P.|date=1942|title=Quantitative Variation of Incentive and Performance in the White Rat|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1417120|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=55|issue=4|pages=467‚Äì517|doi=10.2307/1417120}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that in a repeatedly carried out task such as finding food in a maze, the running speed of the rat is proportional to the size of the reward it obtained on the previous trial. The more food reward that was given to it last time upon completion of the task, the faster it will run when attempting to complete the same task. The effect also works in reverse: when rats were shifted from a larger to a smaller reward, they ran more slowly than the control rats that had always received the small reward.

It is important to note that the size of the reward has little or no influence on the speed of [[learning]], but that it does have an influence on the performance of tasks already learned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">In [[physics]] and in [[electronic engineering]], '''dark current''' is the relatively small [[electric current]] that flows through [[photodetector|photosensitive devices]] such as a [[photomultiplier tube]], [[photodiode]], or [[charge-coupled device]] even when no [[photon]]s are entering the device; it consists of the charges generated in the detector when no outside radiation is entering the detector.&lt;ref name=PIT&gt;''Dark Current and Influence of Target Emissivity'', Photonics &amp; Imaging Technology, September 2016, pp. 11-14 [http://www.techbriefsmediagroup.com/magazines/photonics-imaging-technology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as [[reverse bias]] [[leakage current]] in non-optical devices and is present in all [[diode]]s. Physically, dark current is due to the random generation of [[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] within the [[depletion region]] of the device.

The charge generation rate is related to specific [[crystallographic defect]]s within the depletion region. Dark-current [[spectroscopy]] can be used to determine the defects present by monitoring the peaks in the dark current histogram's evolution with temperature.

Dark current is one of the main sources for noise in [[image sensor]]s such as charge-coupled devices. The pattern of different dark currents can result in a [[fixed-pattern noise]]; [[dark frame subtraction]] can remove an estimate of the mean fixed pattern, but there still remains a temporal noise, because the dark current itself has a [[shot noise]].

'''Drive.ai''' is an American technology company headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]] that uses [[artificial intelligence]] to make self-driving systems for cars.&lt;ref name=micdotcom/&gt; It is the second company to remove the safety driver from its autonomous vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365188/drive-ai-driverless-self-driving-car-texas| title=Fully driverless cars are on public roads in Texas| author=Andrew J. Hawkins| date=May 17, 2018| publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the company has raised approximately $77 million in funding. Drive.ai's technology can be modified to turn a vehicle autonomous.&lt;ref name=fund&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/09/28/robocar-startup-drive-ai-gets-backing-from-uber-rival-grab-plans-singapore-move/#77ee1957494b| title=Robocar Startup Drive.ai Gets Backing From Uber Rival Grab, Plans Singapore Move| author=Alan Ohnsman| date=September 28, 2017| publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Drive.ai announced a pilot program in [[Frisco, Texas]] to test the company's vehicles in its first application of a passenger carrying service available to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-driveai-self-driving-20180507-story.html| title=Drive.at to offer Uber-like service with self-driving vans starting in July| date=May 7, 2018| publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Drive.ai was established in 2015 through [[Stanford University]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab by a group of graduate and PhD students.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/drive-ai-uses-deep-learning-to-teach-self-driving-cars-and-to-give-them-a-voice/| title=Drive.ai uses deep learning to teach self-driving cars ‚Äì and to give them a voice| author=Darrell Etherington| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group initially worked to develop a retrofit kit to add their autonomous driving system to existing cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-bolt-on-retrofit-kit-turns-certain-cars-into-self-driving-vehicles/| title=This bolt-on retrofit kit turns certain cars into self-driving vehicles| author=Greg Nichols| date=July 5, 2017| publisher=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the company emerged from stealth mode with $12 million in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/30/12700290/drive-ai-autonomous-car-human-robot-interface| title=Drive.ai wants to help autonomous cars talk with the people around them| author=Jordan Golson| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/08/30/garage-startup-uses-deep-learning-teach-cars-drive/89424514/| title=Garage startup uses deep learning to teach cars to drive| author=Marco della Cava| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.recode.net/2016/9/6/12772862/self-driving-car-robot-communication| title=This self-driving startup wants to change the way robot cars make decisions and communicate| author=Johana Bhuiyan|publisher=Recode}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's early funding included investments by Northern Light Venture Capital, Oriza Ventures and InnoSpring Seed Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.businessinsider.com/driveai-using-deep-learning-for-its-autonomous-cars-2016-8| title=A start-up born out of Stanford just entered the driverless car race with a radical approach| author=Danielle Muoio| date=August 30, 2016| publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/02/14/drive-ai-mountain-view-self-driving-cars-video.html| title=Look, Mountain View, no hands!

In June 2017, Drive.ai raised a $50 million Series B funding round led by [[New Enterprise Associates]] with participation from [[GGV Capital]], Northern Light Venture Capital and other previous investors.&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/07/lyft-partners-drive-ai-provide-self-driving-rides/639426001/| title=Lyft partners with Drive.ai to provide self-driving rides| author=Marco della Cava| date=September 7, 2017| publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/drive-ai-raises-50m-for-retrofit-kits-to-bring-self-driving-to-existing-fleets/| title=Drive.ai raises $50M for retrofit kits to bring self-driving to existing fleets| author=Darrell Etherington| date=June 27, 2017| publisher=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-driveai-autonomous/drive-ai-raises-50-million-in-funding-andrew-ng-joins-board-idUSKBN19I2ZD| title=Drive.ai raises $50 million in funding; Andrew Ng joins board| date=June 27, 2017| publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the funding announcement, the company also announced that scientist [[Andrew Ng]] had joined its board of directors.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/27/technology/startups/driveai-andrew-ng/index.html| title=The hottest self-driving car startup you've never heard of| author=Matt McFarland| date=June 27, 2017| publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/06/27/robot-car-tech-startup-drive-ai-raises-50-million-adds-stanfords-ng-to-board/#2d0dc1be20dd| title=Robot Car Tech Startup Drive.ai Raises $50 Million, Adds Stanford's NG To Board| author=Alan Ohnsman| date=June 27, 2017| publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, [[Lyft]] announced a partnership with Drive.ai to run a pilot program in San Francisco operating Drive.ai's test fleet through Lyft's platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/lyft-and-drive-ai-partner-on-bay-area-self-driving-ride-hailing-pilot/| title=Lyft and Drive.ai partner on Bay Area self-driving ride-hailing pilot| author=Darrell Etherington| date=September 7, 2017| publisher=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://mashable.com/2017/09/28/driveai-lyft-deal/#2MKEUNuSQmq6| title= Drive.ai is the hot new company on the self-driving car scene| author=Jason Abbruzzese| date=September 28, 2017| publisher=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive.ai raised an additional $15 million in September 2017 including participation from [[Grab (company)|Grab]], a ride-hailing technology company in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/self-griving-startup-drive-ai-to-open-singapore-office-with-new-grab-funding/| title=Self-driving startup Drive.ai to open Singapore office with new Grab funding| author=Darrell Etherington| date=September 28, 2017| publisher=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced that Drive.ai was working with the Frisco Transportation Management Association and would be releasing an on-demand self-driving passenger carrying car service in [[Frisco, Texas]] during the course of an initial 6-month pilot program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/16/watch-drive-ai-demo-its-self-driving-car-service/| title=Watch Drive.ai demo its self-driving car service| author=Kyle Wiggers| date=May 16, 2018| publisher=Venture Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first public deployment of self-driving cars in Texas.&lt;ref name=micdotcom&gt;{{cite web| url=https://mic.com/articles/189425/driveai-offers-a-simple-answer-to-safer-driverless-cars#.PTN7dCcLE| title=Mic| author=Xavier Harding| date=May 17, 2018| publisher=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot program will initially use safety drivers to monitor the car's operation, but will eventually move to driverless operation with remote monitoring.

== Technology ==
The company has a fleet of [[Lincoln MKZ]]s, an [[Audi A4]] and [[Nissan NV200]]s for its testing in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://qz.com/1271375/driverless-car-startup-drive-ai-is-launching-a-ride-hailing-service-in-dallas-texas/| title=Driverless car startup Drive.ai is launching a ride-hailing service in Texas| author=Alison Griswold| date=May 7, 2018| publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Drive.ai released the first video footage of its technology, featuring one of its self-driving Lincoln MKZ cars navigating the streets of Mountain View, CA in the rain after dark. This marked an early recording of a self-driving vehicle operating on a fully autonomous ride at night, or in inclement weather.

In May 2018, Drive.ai released a video featuring an orange Nissan NV200 driverless vehicle navigating Frisco streets. The video featured private streets as well as busy intersections and a traffic circle. It also featured a display showing the car's sensors and cameras dealing with objects on the road and highlighted operation through low-angle sunlight that would obscure typical sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/self-driving-taxi-demonstration-before-texas-launch/| title=See what it's like to take a ride in Drive.ai's self-driving taxi| author=Trevor Mogg| date=May 16, 2018| publisher=Digital Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car's object recognition systems identify and route around other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2018/may/17/driveai-demonstrates-self-driving-cars/| title=Drive.ai demonstrates its self-driving cars| author=Ryan Daws| date=May 17, 2018| publisher=IoT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drive.ai's cars include screens on the outside of the car, one on the hood, one on the back, and one on each side, to communicate with pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://techxplore.com/news/2018-05-self-driving-vehicle-frisco-texas-july.html| title=Self-driving vehicle service in Frisco, Texas, to start in July| author=Nancy Owano| date=May 19, 2018| publisher=TechXplore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screens feature prompts such as "Passengers Entering/Exiting' or "Waiting for You to Cross."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/drive-ai-will-offer-uber-like-service-with-autonomous-vans-this-summer| title=Drive.ai Will Offer Uber-Like Service With Autonomous Vans This Summer| author=Ellen Huet| date=May 7, 2018| publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globular clusters==
ESO 444-46 has an estimated population of about 27,000 [[globular clusters]] which may be one of the largest populations ever studied. However, this large number may be due to the addition of [[Intracluster globular clusters]] since the galaxy lies about 1 arcmin of the center of Abell 3558.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.libraries.wsu.edu:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/3008/BarberDeGraaff_wsu_0251E_10242.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=A Study of Globular Cluster Systems in the Shapley Supercluster Region with the Hubble Space Telescope|last=Barber DeGraaff|first=Regina Grace|date=August 2011|website=Washington State University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>ECN noise source needs defining scientifically as the present edited explanation makes "no sense" without an explanation of its evolution.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Electrochemical noise''' ('''ECN''') is the generic term given to fluctuations of [[Electric current|current]] and [[potential difference|potential]].  When associated with [[corrosion]], it is the result of stochastic pulses of current generated by sudden film rupture, crack propagation, discrete events involving metal dissolution and hydrogen discharge with gas bubble formation and detachment.  The technique of measuring electrochemical noise uses no applied external signal for the collection of experimental data.

The ECN technique measures the signal perturbations which are low level fluctuations of the corrosion potential between two nominally identical electrodes which can be used in the mechanistic determination of corrosion type and speed. The fluctuations are usually of low amplitude, less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[millivolt|mV]] and of low frequency bandpass filtered [[Root mean square|RMS]] value ([[Direct current|DC]] and high frequency [[Alternating current|AC]] components removed).  The noise corresponds with the low level frequency noise (differential of the ZRA) signal but has a much lower amplitude when general corrosion is involved.  The major source of noise can be ascribed to macroscopic random-stochastic phenomena.  They include partial faradaic currents adsorption / desorption, surface coverage, corrosion cracking and mechanical erosion processes.   A common feature of this 1/f  Poisson spectra is that it differs from the "white" Guassian noise in which accuracy increases as the square root of the measurement time. 

The technique considers the reactions occurring at the metal‚Äìsolution interface  and suggests two currents flowing on each electrode as a result of the anodic and cathodic reactions.  Once regarded as a source of bias and error that compromised electrochemical measurements it is now regarded as a rich source of information. The technique is widely used within the [[Corrosion engineering]] world as a useful [[Corrosion Monitoring]] technique.  

The ECN phenomenon belongs to the general category of random low frequency stochastic processes described by either probability density function equations or in statistical terms. These random processes are either stationary or non-stationary.  The first moments of a stationary process are invariate with time.

'''Fran√ßois Robert''', born in [[Paris]], [[France]] the 26th of January,  1951, is a French researcher specializing in [[isotope geochemistry]] and [[cosmochemistry]]. His work on the isotopes of hydrogen has enhanced the understanding of the origin of water and of organic matter in the solar system. He is famous for his work on [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]], light elements formed by the irradiation of interstellar matter. He received a [[Leonard Medal]] from the Meteoritical Society in 2011 for his work on the isotopic composition of stable nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01228.x | volume=46 | title=2011 Leonard Medal for Fran√ßois Robert | journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science | pages=923‚Äì925 | last1 = Thiemens | first1 = Mark H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

He began his thesis in 1975 in the CEA Saclay under the direction of Marc Javoy and Liliane Merlivat and edited by Samuel Epstein at Caltech, Pasadena, California. He joined the CNRS in 1980 at the Laboratory of stable isotope geochemistry at the University of Jussieu, where he defended his thesis on the isotopic compositions (H, C, N) of carbonaceous meteorites in 1982. Between 1983 and 1990, he worked successively with Liliane Merlivat in Saclay, Samuel Epstein at the California Institute of Technology and Marc Javoy at Jussieu.

In 1990 he became a Directeur de Recherche in the CNRS.

In 1992 he worked for a few months in Thiruvananthapuram, India, where he created a laboratory for isotopic analysis.

He was assigned in 1993 to the Laboratory of Mineralogy of the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) led by Professor Jacques Fabri√®s. Between 1993 and 2004, he collaborated with the Research Center for Petrology and Geochemistry in Nancy (CNRS / INPL). Under the leadership of Professor Stephen Roth he participated in the establishment of the French Society for Stable Isotopes of which he became the Senior Vice President in 1999.

In 1999, he undertook the determination of the molecular structure of the insoluble organic matter of meteorites in collaboration with the Laboratory of Organic and Inorganic Geochemistry of the Environment at the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris.

In 2006, he became responsible for a consortium of French laboratories set up by CNES, which set itself the goal of analysis of samples from the halo of Comet Wild 2 captured by the U.S. Stardust space mission (NASA).

Between 2003 and 2011, he was successively elected member of the Board of Directors and the Scientific Council of the MNHN and Chairman of the National Program of Planetology (PNP / CNRS-INSU). Since 2004 he has been Director of the Laboratory of Mineralogy and Cosmochemistry of the Museum, in which there is a NanoSims (Cameca) ion probe accessible to national and international researchers as part of the National Analysis Service of the INSU-CNRS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43755">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy sets''' (aka '''uncertain sets''') are somewhat like [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Zadeh (1965) [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/papers/Fuzzy%20Sets-Information%20and%20Control-1965.pdf "Fuzzy sets"]. ''Information and Control'' 8 (3) 338‚Äì353.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dieter Klaua&lt;ref&gt;Klaua, D. (1965) √úber einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre. Monatsb. Deutsch. Akad. Wiss. Berlin 7, 859‚Äì876. A recent in-depth analysis of this paper has been provided by {{Cite journal | last1 = Gottwald | first1 = S. | title = An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory | doi = 10.1016/j.fss.2009.12.005 | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 161 | issue = 18 | pages = 2369‚Äì2379 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.
At the same time, {{harvtxt|Salii|1965}} defined a more general kind of structure called an [[L-relation]], which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are used now in different areas, such as [[linguistics]] {{harv|De Cock|Bodenhofer|Kerre|2000}}, [[Decision making|decision-making]] {{harv|Kuzmin|1982}}, and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] {{harv|Bezdek|1978}}, are special cases of ''L''-relations when ''L'' is the [[unit interval]] [0, 1].

In classical [[set theory]], the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent condition]] &amp;mdash; an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]] valued in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the [[indicator function]]s (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Dubois and H. Prade (1988) Fuzzy Sets and Systems. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called [[Crisp set|''crisp'' sets]]. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lily R. Liang, Shiyong Lu, Xuena Wang, Yi Lu, Vinay Mandal, Dorrelyn Patacsil, and Deepak Kumar, "FM-test: A Fuzzy-Set-Theory-Based Approach to Differential Gene Expression Data Analysis", BMC Bioinformatics, 7 (Suppl 4): S7. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A fuzzy set is a pair &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;m\colon U \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; a membership function. 
The reference set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is called '''universe of discourse''', and for each &lt;math&gt;x\in U,&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''grade''' of membership of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The function &lt;math&gt;m = \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''membership function''' of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U, m)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite set &lt;math&gt;U=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\},&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{m(x_1)/x_1,\dots,m(x_n)/x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;x \in U.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called 
* '''not included''' in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt; if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}} (no member), 
* '''fully included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;}} (full member), 
* '''partially included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (fuzzy member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic AAAI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805071058/http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The (crisp) set of all fuzzy sets on a universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with &lt;math&gt;SF(U)&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes just &lt;math&gt;F(U)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===Crisp sets related to a fuzzy set===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; the following crisp sets are defined:
* &lt;math&gt;A^{\ge\alpha} = A_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)\ge\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''Œ±-cut''' (aka '''Œ±-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;A^{&gt;\alpha} = A'_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''strong Œ±-cut''' (aka '''strong Œ±-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;S(A) = Supp(A) = A^{&gt;0} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''support''' 
* &lt;math&gt;C(A) = Core(A) = A^{=1} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''core''' (or sometimes '''kernel''' &lt;math&gt;Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Note that some authors understand 'kernel' in a different way, see below.

===Other definitions===
* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; is '''empty''' (&lt;math&gt;A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;) [[iff]] (if and only if)
::[[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt; x \in U: \mu_A(x) = m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are '''equal''' (&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''included''' in a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, having
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; 
:is called a '''crossover point'''.

* For a given fuzzy set A any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;A^{=\alpha} = \{x \in U | \mu_A(x) = \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, is called a '''level''' of A. 
The '''level set''' of A is the set of all levels Œ±‚àà[0,1] representing distinct-cuts. It is the target set (aka codomain) of &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_A = \{\alpha \in [0,1] \mid A^{=\alpha} \ne \varnothing\} = \{\alpha \in [0, 1] \mid\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Existential quantification|&lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = \alpha\} = \mu_A(U)&lt;/math&gt;

* For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''height''' is given by
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = sup \{\mu_A(x) \mid x\in{U}\}  = sup(\mu_A(U))&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;sup&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], which does exist because 1 is an upper bound. If U is finite, we can simply replace the supremum by the maximum.

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''normalized''' iff
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:In the finite case, where the supremum is a maximum, this means that at least one element of the fuzzy set has full membership. A non-empty fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be normalized with result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the membership function of the fuzzy set by its height:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\tilde{A}}(x) = \mu_A(x)/Hgt(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:Besides similarities this differs from the usual [[normalizing constant|normalization]] in that the normalizing constant is not a sum.

* For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ‚äÜ ‚Ñù) having a core with [[Infimum and supremum|an upper and a lower bound]] the '''width''' is defined as
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = sup(Supp(A)) - inf(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:This does always exist for bounded a reference set U, especially if U is finite.
:In case that &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[closed set]], the width is just
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = max(Supp(A)) - min(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:In the n-dimensional case (U ‚äÜ ‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) the above can be replaced by the n-dimensional volume of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In general there must exist some [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] for instance by integration (e. g. [[Lebesgue integration]]) of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

* A real fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (U ‚äÜ ‚Ñù) is said to be '''convex''' (in fuzzy sense, not to be confused with a crisp [[convex set]]), iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in{U}, \forall\lambda\in[0,1]: \mu_A(\lambda{x} + (1-\lambda)y) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;,
:or (if we assume x‚â§y, which is no restriction), equivalent, iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in [x,y]: \mu_A(z) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;.
:In general, we may have to choose subsets Z of U and compare like follows:  
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in Z: \mu_A(z) \ge inf(\mu_A(\partial{Z}))&lt;/math&gt;,
:where &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Z and &lt;math&gt;f(X) = \{f(x)|x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Function (mathematics)#Image and preimage|image]] of a set ''X'' (here &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) under a function ''f'' (here &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;).

===Fuzzy set operations===
{{main|Fuzzy set operations}}
In contrast to the complement of a fuzzy set, for which there is a very common definition, union and intersection do have some ambiguity.
* For a given fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''complement''' &lt;math&gt;\neg{A}&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; or '''‚àÅ'''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by the following membership function:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Let t be a [[t-norm]], and s the corresponding s-norm (aka t-conorm). For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; their '''intersection''' &lt;math&gt;A\cap{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cap{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;,
:and their '''union''' &lt;math&gt;A\cup{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cup{B}}(x) = s(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the definitions of t-norms, fuzzy sets inherit laws as [[Commutativity]], [[Monotonicity]], [[Associativity]] and for null and identity element (‚àÖ and U, respectively). However, the union of a fuzzy set and its complement may not result in the full universe U, and the intersection of them may not give the empty set ‚àÖ. Intersection and union of a finite [[Indexed family|family]] of fuzzy sets can be defined by recursion, keeping associativity law in mind.

* If the standard negator &lt;math&gt;n(\alpha) = 1 - \alpha, \alpha \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by another [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]], the fuzzy set difference may be generalized by
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = n(\mu_A(x))&lt;/math&gt;. 
:The tripel of fuzzy intersection, union and complement build up a '''De Morgan Triplet''. Examples for fuzzy intersection/union pairs with standard negator can be derived from samples provided in the article about [[t-norm]]s.

:The fuzzy intersection is not idempotent in general, because the standard t-norm min is the only one which has this property. Using arithmetic multiplication a t-norm instead, this defines a specific fuzzy intersection operation not being idempotent. By this, iterating multiplication of a fuzzy set with itself is not trivial. It defines the '''m-th power''' of a fuzzy set which can be canonically generalized for non-integer exponents in the following way:

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in \R^+&lt;/math&gt; the ŒΩ-th power of A is defined by its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A^{\nu}}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
:Special case: Exponent is 2 (quadrature): For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''concentration''' &lt;math&gt;CON(A) = A^2&lt;/math&gt; is defined via its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{CON(A)}(x) = \mu_{A^2}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:With &lt;math&gt;0^0 := 1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A^0 = U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^1 = A&lt;/math&gt;.

* For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set '''Difference''' &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted just &lt;math&gt; A - B&lt;/math&gt;) maybe defined straightforward via membership functions:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),n(\mu_B(x)))&lt;/math&gt;,
:which means &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap \neg{B}&lt;/math&gt;, e. g.:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = min(\mu_A(x),1 - \mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mamoni Dhar: [http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJEIC/vol4_Is1/2.pdf Cardinality of Fuzzy Sets: An Overview], International Journal of Energy, Information and Communications Vol. 4, Issue 1, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014"&gt;N.R. Vemuri, A.S. Hareesh, M.S. Srinath: [http://www.math.sk/fsta2014/presentations/VemuriHareeshSrinath.pdf Set Difference and Symmetric Difference of Fuzzy Sets], in: Fuzzy Sets Theory and Applications 2014, Liptovsk√Ω J√°n, Slovak Republic&lt;/ref&gt;

:Another proposal for a set difference could be: 
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A-{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) - t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* Proposals for symmetric fuzzy set differences have been done by Dubois and Prade (1980), either using the absulute:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = |\mu_A(x) - \mu_B(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
:or, using a combination of just max, min, and standard negation:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = max(min(\mu_A(x), 1 - \mu_B(x)), \,min(\mu_B(x), 1 - \mu_A(x)))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

:Axioms for definition of generalized symmetric differences analog to those for t-norms, t-conorms, and negators have been proposed by Vemur et al. (2014) with predecessors by Alsina et. al. (2005) and Bedregal et. al. (2009).&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* In contrast to crisp sets averaging operations can also be defined for fuzzy sets.

===Disjoint fuzzy sets===
In contrast to the general ambiguity of intersection and union operations, there is clearness for disjoint fuzzy sets:
Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are '''disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = 0 \lor \mu_B(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to
:[[Existential quantification#Negation|&lt;math&gt;\nexists&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) &gt; 0 \land \mu_B(x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and also equivalent to 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: min(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
We keep in mind that min/max is a t/s-norm pair, and any other will do the job here as well.

Fuzzy sets are disjoint, iff their supports are disjoint according to the standard definition for crisp sets.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; any intersection will give ‚àÖ, and any union will give the same result, which is denoted as
:&lt;math&gt;A \dot{\cup} B = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\dot{\cup}{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) + \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that only one of both summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(A \dot{\cup} B) = Supp(A) \,\dot{\cup}\, Supp(B)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to finite families of fuzzy sets as follows:
Given a family &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; of fuzzy sets with Index set I (e.g. I = {1,2,3,...n}). This family is '''(pairwise) disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}\,\exists i\in{I}: \mu_{A_i}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A family of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint, iff the family of underlying supports &lt;math&gt;Supp \circ A = (Supp(A_i))_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint in the standard sense for families of crisp sets.

Independend of the t/s-norm pair, intersection of a disjoint family of fuzzy sets will give ‚àÖ again, while the union has no ambiguity:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i = \bigcup_{i\in{I}} A_i&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i}(x) = \sum_{i\in{I}} \mu_{A_i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Again only one of the summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint families of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i) = \dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} Supp(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar Cardinality===
For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with finite &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; (i. e. a 'finite fuzzy set'), its '''cardinality''' (aka '''scalar cardinality''' or '''sigma-count''') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Card(A) = sc(A) = |A| = \sum_{x\in{U}} \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In case that U itself is a finite set, the '''relative cardinality''' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A) = ||A|| = sc(A)/|U| = |A|/|U|&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be generalized for the divisor to be an non-empty fuzzy set: For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A,G&lt;/math&gt; with G ‚â† ‚àÖ, we can define the '''relative cardinality''' by:
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A,G) = sc(A|G) = sc(A\cap{G})/sc(G)&lt;/math&gt;,
which looks very similar to the expression for [[conditional probability]]&lt;!--and because of that, sc(A|G) is used instead of sc(A/G)- this in't **set** division, isn't it? --&gt;.
Note:
* &lt;math&gt;sc(G) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; here.
* The result may depend on the specific intersection (t-norm) chosen. 
* For &lt;math&gt;G = U&lt;/math&gt; the result is unambiguous and resembles the prior definition.

===Distance and Similarity===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_A: U \to U&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a family &lt;math&gt;\mu_A = (\mu_A(x))_{x\in{U}} \in [0,1]^U&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is a [[metric space]] with several metrics &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; known. A metric can be derived from a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (vector norm) &lt;math&gt;\|\,\|&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) = \| \alpha - \beta \,\|&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is finite, i. e. &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, such a metric may be defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) := max \{ |\alpha(x_i) - \beta(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are sequences of real numbes between 0 and 1. 
For infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum can be replaced by a supremum. 
Because fuzzy sets are unambiguously defined by their membership function, this metric can be used to measure distances between fuzzy sets on the same universe:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) := d(\mu_A,\mu_B)&lt;/math&gt;,
which becomes in the above sample:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) = max \{ |\mu_A(x_i) - \mu_B(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt;
Again for infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the maximum must be replaced by a supremum. Other distances (like the canonical 2-norm) may diverge, if infinite fuzzy sets are too different, e .g &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarity measures (here denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) may then be derived from the distance, e. g. after a proposal by Koczy:
:&lt;math&gt;S = 1 / (1 + d(A,B))&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else, 
or after Williams an Steele:
:&lt;math&gt;S = exp(-\alpha{d(A,B)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a steepness parameter and &lt;math&gt;exp(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Beg20019"&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition for interval valued (rather 'fuzzy') similarity measures &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is provided by Beg and Ashraf as well.&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===L-fuzzy sets===
Sometimes, more general variants of the notion of fuzzy set are used, with membership functions taking values in a (fixed or variable) [[algebraic structure|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a given kind; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. These are usually called '''''L''-fuzzy sets''', to distinguish them from those valued over the unit interval. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions. These kinds of generalizations were first considered in 1967 by [[Joseph Goguen]], who was a student of Zadeh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Goguen|Goguen, Joseph A.]], 196, "''L''-fuzzy sets". ''Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications'' '''18''': 145‚Äì174&lt;/ref&gt; A classical corollary may be indicating truth and membership values by {f,t} instead of {0,1}.

An extension of fuzzy sets has been provided by Atanassov and Baruah. An '''intuitionistic fuzzy set''' (IFS) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by two functions:
:1. &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of membership of x
:2. &lt;math&gt;\nu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of non-membership of x
with functions &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \nu_A: U \mapsto [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

This resembles a situation like some person denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; voting 
* for a proposal A (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=1, \nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;), 
* against it (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=0, \nu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;), 
* or abstain from voting (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=\nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;).
After all, we have a percentage of approvals, a percentage of denials, and a percentage of abstentions.

For this situation, special 'intuitive fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms can be provided. 
With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta) \in [0, 1]^2 \mid \alpha + \beta = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and by combining both functions to &lt;math&gt;(\mu_A,\nu_A): U \to D^*&lt;/math&gt; this situation resembles a special kind of L-fuzzy sets.

Once more, this has been expanded by defining '''picture fuzzy sets''' (PFS) as follows: A PFS A is characterized by three functions mapping U to [0, 1]: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \eta_A, \nu_A&lt;/math&gt;, 'degree of positive membership', 'degree of neutral membership', and 'degree of negative membership' respectively and additional condition &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \eta_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
This expands the voting sample above by an additional possibility 'refusal of voting'.

With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \in [0, 1]^3 \mid \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and special 'picture fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms this resembles just another type of L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Bui Cong Cuong, Vladik Kreinovich, Roan Thi Ngan: [http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2050&amp;context=cs_techrep A classification of representable t-norm operators for picture fuzzy sets], in: Departmental Technical Reports (CS).

== Fuzzy logic ==
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}

As an extension of the case of [[multi-valued logic]], valuations (&lt;math&gt;\mu : \mathit{V}_o \to \mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) of [[propositional variable]]s (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{V}_o&lt;/math&gt;) into a set of membership degrees (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) can be thought of as [[membership function (mathematics)|membership functions]] mapping [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] into fuzzy sets (or more formally, into an ordered set of fuzzy pairs, called a fuzzy relation).  With these valuations, many-valued logic can be extended to allow for fuzzy [[premise]]s from which graded conclusions may be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Gottwald]], 2001. ''A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics''. Baldock, Hertfordshire, England: Research Studies Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-86380-262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension is sometimes called "fuzzy logic in the narrow sense" as opposed to "fuzzy logic in the wider sense," which originated in the [[engineering]] fields of [[automation|automated]] control and [[knowledge engineering]], and which encompasses many topics involving fuzzy sets and "approximated reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;"The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning," ''Information Sciences'' '''8''': 199‚Äì249, 301‚Äì357; '''9''': 43‚Äì80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial applications of fuzzy sets in the context of "fuzzy logic in the wider sense" can be found at [[fuzzy logic]].

== Fuzzy number and interval ==
{{main|Fuzzy number}}
A '''fuzzy number''' is a convex, normalized fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ‚äÜ ‚Ñù) whose membership function is at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]]{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} and has the functional value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; at at least one element.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the assumed convexity the maximum (of 1) is 
* either an interval: '''fuzzy interval''', its core is a crisp interval (mean interval) with lower bound

::&lt;math&gt;\min \,C(A) = \min(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt; 
:and upper bound 
::&lt;math&gt;\max \,C(A) = \max(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt;.
* or unique: '''fuzzy number''', its core is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]; the location of the maximum is 
::‚Ñ© C(A) = ‚Ñ©&lt;math&gt;x \in \R : \mu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; (where ‚Ñ© reads as '[[Definite description#Mathematical logic|this]]');
:which will assign a 'sharp' number to the fuzzy number, in addition to fuzzyness parameters like &lt;math&gt;Width(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Fuzzy numbers can be likened to the [[funfair]] game "guess your weight," where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, and where the guesser "wins" if he or she guesses near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being completely correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function).

A '''fuzzy interval''' is a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with a core interval, i. e. a mean interval whose elements possess the membership function value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
The latter means that fuzzy intervals are normalized fuzzy sets. As in fuzzy numbers, the membership function must be convex, normalized, at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fuzzy sets as a basis for a theory of possibility," ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''1''': 3&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; Like crisp intervals, fuzzy intervals may reach infinity. The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(A) = Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a fuzzy interval &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the 'inner' part, without the 'outbound' parts where the membership value is constant ad infinitum. In other words, the smallest subset of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is constant outside of it, is defined as the kernel.

However, there are other concepts of fuzzy numbers and intervals as some authors do not insist on convexity.

==Fuzzy categories==
The use of [[Set theory|set membership]] as a key components of [[category theory]] can be generalized to fuzzy sets. This approach which initiated in 1968 shortly after the introduction of fuzzy set theory&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Goguen "Categories of fuzzy sets : applications of non-Cantorian set theory" PhD Thesis University of California, Berkeley, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of "Goguen categories" in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winter "Goguen Categories:A Categorical Approach to L-fuzzy Relations"  2007 [[Springer Verlag|Springer]] {{ISBN|9781402061639}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=goguencateg&gt;Michael Winter "Representation theory of Goguen categories" [[Fuzzy Sets and Systems]] Volume 138, Issue 1, 16 August 2003, Pages 85‚Äì126&lt;/ref&gt; In these categories, rather than using two valued set membership, more general intervals are used, and may be lattices as in  L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref name=goguencateg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goguen, J.A., "L-fuzzy sets". Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 18(1):145‚Äì174, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy relation equation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The [[fuzzy relation equation]] is an equation of the form {{nowrap|1=''A'' ¬∑ ''R'' = ''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are fuzzy sets, ''R'' is a fuzzy relation, and {{nowrap|''A'' ¬∑ ''R''}} stands for the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''A'' with&amp;nbsp;''R'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

==Entropy==
A measure d of fuzzyness for fuzzy sets of universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; should fulfill the following conditions for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a crisp set: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \in \{0,\,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; has a unique maximum iff &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) \ge d(B)&lt;/math&gt; iff 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \le 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \ge \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \ge 0.5&lt;/math&gt;, 
::which means that B is 'crisper' than A.
#&lt;math&gt;d(\neg{A}) = d(A)&lt;/math&gt;   
In this case &lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of the fuzzy set A.

For '''finite''' &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; the entropy of a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = H(A) + H(\neg{A})&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_A(x_i) \ln \mu_A(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;
or just
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n S(\mu_A(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(x) = H_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Binary entropy function|Shannon's function]] (natural entropy function)
:&lt;math&gt;S(\alpha) = -\alpha \ln \alpha - (1-\alpha) \ln (1-\alpha), \alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the measure unit and the logarithm base ([[e (mathematical constant)|here: e]]) used.
Physical interpretation of k is the [[Boltzmann constant]] k&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a fuzzy set with a '''continuous''' membership function (fuzzy variable). Then 
:&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \ln \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and its entropy is 
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty S(\operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace )\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==
There are many mathematical constructions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965, a lot of new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inexactness, ambiguity, and uncertainty have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others try to mathematically model imprecision and uncertainty in a different way ({{harvnb|Burgin|Chunihin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Kerre|2001}}; Deschrijver and Kerre, 2003).

The diversity of such constructions and corresponding theories includes:
{{div col|colwidth=35em}}
* interval sets (Moore, 1966),
* ''L''-fuzzy sets (Goguen, 1967),
* flou sets  (Gentilhomme, 1968),

'''''Gravitation''''' is a physics book on [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity|theory of gravity]], written by [[Charles W. Misner]], [[Kip Thorne|Kip S. Thorne]], and [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and originally published by [[W. H. Freeman and Company]] in 1973. It is frequently abbreviated '''''MTW''''' after its authors' initials. The cover illustration, drawn by [[Kenneth Gwin]], is a [[line art|line drawing]] of an apple with cuts in the skin to show [[geodesics]]. It contains 10 parts and 44 chapters, each beginning with a quotation.  The bibliography has a long list of original sources and other notable books in the field. The level of the book is advanced, with the intended audience at the [[graduate-level]] and above.

==Content==

===Subject matter===

After a brief review of [[special relativity]] and [[flat spacetime]], physics in curved spacetime is introduced and many aspects of general relativity are covered; particularly about the [[Einstein field equations]] and their implications, experimental confirmations, and [[alternatives to general relativity]]. Segments of history are included to summarize the ideas leading up to Einstein's theory. The book concludes by questioning the nature of spacetime and suggesting possible frontiers of research. Although the exposition on [[linearized gravity]] is detailed, one topic which is not covered is [[gravitoelectromagnetism]]. Some [[quantum mechanics]] is mentioned, but [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]] and [[quantum gravity]] are not included.

The topics covered are broadly divided into two "tracks", the first contains the core topics while the second has more advanced content. The first track can be read independently of the second track. The main text is supplemented by boxes containing extra information, which can be omitted without loss of continuity. Margin notes are also inserted to annotate the main text.

The mathematics, primarily [[tensor calculus]] and [[differential forms]] in [[curved spacetime]], is developed as required. An introductory chapter on [[spinor]]s near the end is also given. There are numerous illustrations of advanced mathematical ideas such as [[Exterior algebra#Alternating multilinear forms|alternating multilinear forms]], [[parallel transport]], and the orientation of the [[hypercube]] in spacetime. Mathematical exercises and physical problems are included for the reader to practice.

The prose in the book is conversational; the authors use plain language and analogies to everyday objects. For example, [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz transformed]] coordinates are described as a "squashed egg-crate" with an illustration. Tensors are described as "machines with slots" to insert vectors or one-forms, and containing "gears and wheels that guarantee the output" of other tensors.

===Sign and unit conventions===

''MTW'' uses the [[Sign convention|‚àí+++ metric convention]], and dissuades the use of the ++++ metric and [[complex number|imaginary]] time coordinate ''ict''. In the front endpapers, the [[Einstein field equations#Sign convention|sign conventions for the Einstein field equations]] are established and the conventions used by many other authors are listed.

The book also uses [[geometrized units]], the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and [[speed of light]] in vacuum ''c'' each set to 1. The back endpapers contain a table of unit conversions.

==Editions and translations==

The book has been reprinted in English 24 times. Hardback and softcover editions have been published. The original citation is

==Reviews==

The book is still considered influential in the physics community, with generally positive reviews, but with some criticism of the book's length and presentation style. To quote Ed Ehrlich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Ed |title=Gravitation - Book Review |website=sky-watch.com |url=http://www.sky-watch.com/books/misner1.html |accessdate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202083527/http://www.sky-watch.com/books/misner1.html |archivedate=2 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTW is a rich resource and is certainly worth consulting for a whole string of topics. However, its style is not perhaps for everyone (I find it somewhat verbose in places and would not recommend it for a first course in general relativity). MTW has a very extensive bibliography.‚Äù''

The '''Iberian lynx''' (''Lynx pardinus'') is a wild [[felidae|cat]] species native to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in southwestern Europe that is listed as [[endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;

By the turn of the 21st century, the Iberian lynx was on the verge of extinction, as only about 100 individuals survived in two isolated subpopulations in [[Andalusia]]. Conservation measures implemented since 2002 included improving habitat, restocking of rabbits, [[Translocation (wildlife conservation)|translocating]] and [[Species reintroduction|re-introducing]] Iberian lynxes, so that by 2012 the population had increased to 326 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez|first1=G.|last2=Lopez|first2=M.|last3=Fernandez|first3=L.|last4=Ruiz|first4=G.|last5=Arenas|first5=R.|last6=Del Rey|first6=T.|last7=Gil|first7=J.M.|last8=Garrote|first8=G.|last9=Garcia|first9=M.|last10=Simon|first10=M.|year=2012 |title=Population development of the Iberian lynx since 2002 |journal=Cat News |volume=57 |pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an attempt to save this species from extinction, projects under the EU [[The LIFE Programme|LIFE Programme]] have undertaken habitat preservation, lynx population monitoring, and rabbit population management.&lt;ref name=pone2012&gt;{{cite journal |journal= PLoS ONE |title= Gene sets for utilization of Primary and Secondary Nutrition supplies in the Distal gut of Endangered Iberian Lynx |last1= Alcaide |first1=M. |last2=Messina |first2=E. |last3=Richter |first3=M. |last4=Bargiela |first4=R. |last5=Peplies|first5=J.|last6=Huws|first6=S.A.|last7=Newbold|first7= C.J. |last8=Golyshin|first8=P.N. |last9=Sim√≥n|first9=M.A. |last10=L√≥pez|first10=G.|last11=Yakimov|first11=M.M. |year= 2012 |volume= 7 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051521 |pmid= 23251564 |pmc= 3520844 |issue= 12 |pages=e51521|bibcode=2012PLoSO...751521A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly considered a subspecies of the [[Eurasian lynx]] (''Lynx lynx''), the Iberian lynx is now classified as a separate species.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Linces1.jpg|left|thumb|Closeup of the Iberian lynx]]

The Iberian lynx has a bright yellowish to tawny colored spotted and short fur, a short body, long legs, a short tail, a small head with tufted ears and facial whiskers, called a ruff. Head and body length of males is {{convert|74.7|to|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|12.5|to|16|cm|in|abbr=on}} long tail and a weight of {{convert|7|to|15.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Males are larger than females who have a head-to-body-length of approximately {{convert|68.2|to|77.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and can weigh {{convert|9.2|to|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=WCoW&gt;{{cite book |first= M. |last= Sunquist |first2= F. |last2= Sunquist |year=2002 |title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |pages= 177‚Äì184 |isbn= 0-226-77999-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot pattern of the fur varies from uniformly and densely distributed small spots to more elongate spots arranged in lines that decrease in size from the back towards the sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beltr√°n|first1=J.F.|last2=Delibes|first2=M. |year=1993 |title=Physical characteristics of Iberian lynxes (''Lynx pardinus'') from Do√±ana, southwestern Spain |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=74 | issue = 4  |pages=852‚Äì862 |doi=10.2307/1382423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Iberian lynx was once present throughout the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. In the 1950s, the northern population extended from the [[Mediterranean]] to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and parts of northern Portugal, and the southern population from central to southern Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clavero|first1=M.|last2=Delibes|first2=M. |year=2013 |title=Using historical accounts to set conservation baselines: the case of Lynx species in Spain |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=22 | issue = 8  |pages=1691‚Äì1702 |doi=10.1007/s10531-013-0506-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Populations declined from 15 subpopulations in the 1940s to only two subpopulations in the early 1990s, most noticeably in [[Montes de Toledo]] and [[Sierra Morena]]. Before 1973, it was present in [[Sierra de Gata]], Montes de Toledo, eastern Sierra Morena, Sierra de Relumbrar and [[Do√±ana National Park|Do√±ana coastal plains]]. Between the early 1960s and 2000, it has lost about 80% of its former range.&lt;ref name=AC2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alda |first1=F. |last2=Inog√©s |first2=J. |last3=Alcaraz |first3=L. |last4=Oria |first4=J. |last5=Aranda |first5=A. |last6=Doadrio |first6=I. |year=2008 |title=Looking for the Iberian lynx in central Spain: a needle in a hay stack? |journal=Animal Conservation |issn=1367-9430 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=297‚Äì305 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JM2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gil-Sanchez |first1=J.M. |last2=McCain |first2=E.B. |year=2011 |title=Former range and decline of the Iberian lynx (''Lynx pardinus'') reconstructed using verified records |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=1081‚Äì1090 |doi=10.1644/10-MAMM-A-381.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now restricted to very limited areas in southern Spain, with breeding only confirmed in Sierra Morena and Do√±ana coastal plains.&lt;ref name=Sim√≥n2012/&gt;

A study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] from fossil remains, published in March 2015, suggests the Iberian lynx had a wider range during the [[Late Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]], including northern Italy and southern France.{{r|QSR150315}}

The Iberian lynx prefers [[heterogeneous]] environments of open grassland mixed with dense shrubs such as [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]], [[Pistacia lentiscus|mastic]], and [[juniper]], and trees such as [[holm oak]] and [[cork oak]]. It is now largely restricted to mountainous areas.

The Iberian lynx preys foremost on the [[European rabbit]] (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'') for the bulk of its diet, supplemented by [[red-legged partridge]], [[rodent]]s and to a smaller degree also on wild [[ungulate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palomares|first1=F.|last2=Delibes|first2=M.|last3=Revilla|first3=E.|last4=Calzada|first4=J.|last5=Frediani|first5=J.M. |year=2001 |title=Spatial ecology of Iberian lynx and abundance of European rabbits in south-western Spain |journal=Wildlife Monographs |volume=148 |pages=1‚Äì36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gil-S√°nchez|first1=J.M.|last2=Ballesteros-Duper√≥n|first2=E.|last3=Bueno-Segura|first3=J.F.|year=2006 |title=Feeding ecology of the Iberian lynx ''Lynx pardinus'' in eastern Sierra Morena (Southern Spain) |journal=Acta Theriologica |volume= 51 |pages= 85‚Äì90 |doi=10.1007/bf03192659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LopezBao2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1= L√≥pez‚ÄêBao|first1=J.V.|last2=Palomares|first2=F.|last3=Rodr√≠guez|first3=A.|last4=Ferreras|first4=P.|title= Intraspecific interference influences the use of prey hotspots |journal= OIKOS |volume= 120 |issue= 10 |year= 2011 |pages= 1489‚Äì1496 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19194.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes preys on young [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], [[mouflon]], and ducks.{{r|DelibesRod2000}} A male requires one rabbit per day while a female raising kittens will eat three per day.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite book |url=http://wardenvironment.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ward_REP_The_Iberian_lynx_emergency.pdf |first=D. |last=Ward |title=The Iberian Lynx Emergency |year=2004 |publisher=EU commissioned report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iberian species has low adaptability‚Äîit continued to rely heavily on rabbits (75% of its food intake) despite the latter's repeated population crashes due to two diseases: [[myxomatosis]], which spread to Iberia after a physician intentionally introduced it in France in 1952, and [[rabbit haemorrhagic disease]] beginning in 1988.&lt;ref name=Fordham2013/&gt; There were two major outbreaks of the latter in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name=efe130917 /&gt; Recovery has occurred in some areas‚Äîin 2013, rabbit overpopulation was reported south of [[C√≥rdoba, Andalusia|C√≥rdoba]], causing damage to transport infrastructure and farms.&lt;ref name=abc130805 /&gt; In December 2013, however, it was reported that wildlife officials were concerned about the spread of a new strain of the hemorraghic disease, affecting mainly young rabbits.&lt;ref name=elpais131215 /&gt;{{r|Phys150211}} Sierra Morena's rabbit population was worst affected, falling from an average of three per hectare to less than one‚Äîbelow the minimum required level of 1.5 to two per hectare.&lt;ref name=ideal140514 /&gt; Forced to travel greater distances for food, the lynx became more susceptible to death in road accidents, particularly on [[Autov√≠a A-4]].&lt;ref name=ideal140514 /&gt;

It competes for prey with the [[red fox]], the [[Egyptian mongoose]] (''Herpestes ichneumon'') and the [[wildcat]]. Also, it often kills other smaller carnivores such as the [[red fox]], the [[Egyptian mongoose]], and the [[Common genet]] (''Genetta genetta'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fedriani | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Palomares | first2 = F. | last3 = Delibes | first3 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Niche relations among three sympatric Mediterranean carnivores | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 121 | issue = | pages = 138‚Äì148 | doi=10.1007/s004420050915| bibcode = 1999Oecol.121..138F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is solitary and hunts alone; it will stalk its prey or lie in wait for hours behind a bush or rock until the prey is sufficiently close to pounce in a few strides.

The Iberian lynx is smaller than its northern relatives, and typically hunts smaller animals, usually no larger than [[hare]]s. It also differs in habitat choice, with Iberian lynx inhabiting open [[scrubland]] and Eurasian lynx inhabiting forests.&lt;ref name=iucncsg /&gt;

A lynx, especially with younger animals, will roam widely, with ranges reaching more than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Its territory (‚âà{{convert|10|to|20|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}) is also dependent on how much food is available.&lt;ref name=ward /&gt; Adult Iberian lynx tend to require a minimum amount of space of {{convert|5| to |20|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and a population of 50 breeding females requires about {{convert|500|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of habitat area.&lt;ref name=LopezBao2011 /&gt; Nonetheless, once established, ranges tend to be stable in size over many years, the boundaries often being along man-made roads and trails. The Iberian lynx [[Spraying (animal behavior)|marks its territory with its urine]], droppings left in existing tracks through the vegetation, and scratch marks on the barks of trees.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Lince Ib√©rico Do√±ana.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Specimen in the [[Do√±ana National Park]]]]
During the mating season the female leaves her territory in search of a male. The typical [[gestation]] period is about two months; the kittens are born between March and September, with a peak of births in March and April. A litter consists of two or three (rarely one, four or five) kittens weighing between {{convert|200|and|250|g|oz}}.

The kittens become independent at 7 to 10 months old, but remain with the mother until around 20 months old. Survival of the young depends heavily on the availability of prey species. In the wild, both males and females reach sexual maturity at the age of one year, though in practice they rarely breed until a territory becomes vacant; one female was known not to breed until five years old when its mother died. The maximum longevity in the wild is 13 years.&lt;ref name=iucncsg /&gt;&lt;ref name=adw /&gt;

Siblings become violent towards one another between 30 and 60 days, peaking at 45 days. A kitten will frequently kill its littermate in a brutal fight. It is unknown why these episodes of aggression occur, though many scientists believe it is related to a change in hormones when a kitten switches from its mother's milk to meat. Others believe it is related to hierarchy, and "[[survival of the fittest]]".

Difficulty in finding mates has led to more inbreeding, which results in fewer kittens and a greater rate of non-traumatic death.{{r|EJWR2012}} Inbreeding leads to lower semen quality and greater rates of infertility in males, hindering efforts to increase the species' fitness.{{r|CB2013}}

== Conservation ==
The Iberian lynx has been downlisted from [[critically endangered species]] to [[endangered species]] thanks to reintroduction and other conservation actions.  Its small population makes the cat especially vulnerable to extinction from sudden random events such as a natural disaster or disease.{{r|Vargas2008}} Conservation measures include restoring its native habitat, maintaining the wild rabbit population, reducing unnatural causes of death, and captive breeding for release.&lt;ref name=Vargas2008 /&gt; The Spanish National Commission for the Protection of Nature endorsed the Iberian Lynx Ex Situ Conservation Breeding Program to serve as a "safety net" by managing the captive population and also to "help establish new Iberian lynx free-ranging populations through reintroduction programmes."&lt;ref name=Vargas2008 /&gt; Before release of captive-bred cats, their natural habit may be simulated to prepare them for life in the wild.&lt;ref name=Vargas2008 /&gt; A 2006 study used a non-intrusive monitoring system involving cameras to monitor the demographics of both lynxes and rabbits residing in Sierra Morena.{{r|GilSanchez2010}} Supplemental food sources could be provided if wild rabbits suffered a decline.&lt;ref name=GilSanchez2010 /&gt;

The Iberian lynx and its habitat are fully protected, and they are no longer legally hunted. Threats include habitat loss, vehicle strikes, poisoning, feral dogs, illegal poaching, and occasional outbreaks of [[feline leukemia]].&lt;ref name=efe091003 /&gt; Chronic renal illness affects some captive animals.&lt;ref name=rtve100326 /&gt; Habitat loss is due mainly to infrastructure improvement, urban and resort development and tree monocultivation, which fragments the lynx's distribution. In the 20th century, rabbit diseases such as [[myxomatosis]] and [[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease|hemorrhagic disease]] resulted in a dramatic decline of its main prey;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/12/14-0517_article|title=Ecosystem Effects of Variant Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus, Iberian Peninsula|first1=Miguel|last1=Delibes-Mateos|first2=Catarina|last2=Ferreira|first3=Francisco|last3=Carro|first4=Marco A.|last4=Escudero|first5=Christian|last5=Gort√°zar|publisher=|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=20|issue=12|pages=2166‚Äì2168|doi=10.3201/eid2012.140517|pmid=25417710|pmc=4257825}}&lt;/ref&gt; outbreaks have been reported into the 2010s.&lt;ref name=efe130917 /&gt; Accidental vehicle strikes are the leading cause of unnatural death;&lt;ref name=materia131205 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ep130911 /&gt; The death toll on Spanish roads was 14 in 2013,&lt;ref name=EFE140101 /&gt; and 21 in 2014.{{r|Pais150219}} Illegal traps set for rabbits and foxes are other leading causes for lynx fatality.{{r|BC1992}}

In 2013, it was reported that the Iberian lynx possesses antibiotic resistant bacteria within its digestive tract, which may lead to more dangerous and difficult-to-treat infections and decrease the cat's fitness.{{r|TE2013}} A 2013 study suggests climate change may threaten the Iberian lynx species due to their inability to adapt well to new climates or it may lead them to relocate to areas that have a more suitable climate but fewer rabbits, increasing mortality.{{r|NCC2013}}

=== Wild population and re-introductions ===
[[File:Poblaci√≥n lince.jpg|thumb|left|Graph showing Iberian lynx population in Spain, 1960‚Äì2007]]

The Iberian lynx species has declined by about 80% in the last 20 years. The cat was estimated to number 3,000 in 1960,&lt;ref name=SOSlynx /&gt; about 400 in 2000, less than 200 in 2002, and possibly as few as 100 in March 2005.&lt;ref name=bbc050310 /&gt; [[Do√±ana National Park]] and the Sierra de [[And√∫jar]], [[Ja√©n (Spanish province)|Ja√©n]] had the only known breeding populations until the 2007 discovery of a previously unknown population of around 15 individuals in [[Castile-La Mancha]] (central [[Spain]]).&lt;ref name=sd0710 /&gt;&lt;ref name=deshok /&gt; In 2008, the Do√±ana population was assessed at 24 to 33, while the [[Sierra Morena]] group was believed to number 67 to 190 adults. The total population was estimated to be 99 to 158 adults, including the La Mancha population. The Iberian lynx was thus listed as Critically Endangered under C2a(i) on the IUCN Redlist.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;

Beginning in 2009, the Iberian lynx was reintroduced into [[Embalse de Guadalmellato|Guadalmellato]], resulting in a population of 23 in 2013.&lt;ref name=eleco130408 /&gt; Since 2010, the species has also been released in Guarrizas.&lt;ref name=NL130621 /&gt;&lt;ref name=decpaper /&gt; Discussions were held with the Ministry of Environment on plans for releases in the Campanarios de Azaba area near [[Salamanca]].&lt;ref name=rewild /&gt; In April 2013, it was reported that Andalusia's total wild population‚Äîonly 94 in 2002‚Äîhad tripled to 309 individuals.&lt;ref name=elmundo130409 /&gt;&lt;ref name=eleco130408 /&gt; In July 2013, environmental groups confirmed the presence of a wild-born litter in the [[Province of C√°ceres]] ([[Extremadura]]).&lt;ref name=efe130706 /&gt; A study published in July 2013 in ''Nature Climate Change'' advised that reintroduction programs take place in northern Iberia, suggesting that climate change would threaten rabbits in the south.&lt;ref name=UA130722 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LS130721 /&gt;

On 26 November 2014, 8 Iberian lynxes were released into [[Toledo, Spain]]; one of them traveled near [[Madrid]], the first time in 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/03/09/inenglish/1425900807_150674.html|title= Iberian Lynx returns to Madrid region after 40 years|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 10 March 2015|website= |publisher= El Pais}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Iberian lynxes in Portugal, particularly in the south, has been verified.&lt;ref name=pu130601 /&gt; In 2014, the [[Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests]] signed contracts securing 2,000 hectares of land for Portugal's reintroduction project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynx pardinas (2000)|url=http://www.icnf.pt/portal/naturaclas/rn2000/resource/docs/rn-plan-set/mamif/lynx-pardinus/|website=ICNF Portal|publisher=ICN:B|accessdate=27 June 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icnf.pt/portal/naturaclas/rn2000/resource/docs/rn-plan-set/mamif/lynx-pardinus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PN141113 /&gt; On 16 December 2014, a pair of Iberian lynx was released into [[Guadiana Valley Natural Park]] near [[M√©rtola]], Portugal.{{r|PN141218}} On 7 February 2015, another pair was released into the park, but the female was later found dead on 12 March 2015 after being poisoned in M√©rtola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/iberian-lynx-female-released-last-month-found-dead/34313|title= Iberian Lynx female released last month found dead|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 19 March 2015|website= |publisher= The Portugal News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last pair of captive-bred Iberian lynxes were released into Guadiana Valley Nature Reserve on 12 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/final-two-iberian-lynx-released-into-the-wild/34765|title= Final two Iberian Lynx released into the wild|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 14 May 2015|website= theportugalnews.com|publisher= The Portugal News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2015 there were 400 lynx on the Iberian peninsula, the vast majority in Andalusia, in southern Spain, but with smaller new populations in the hills near Toledo, in Extremadura (south-western Spain) and in southern Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35890789|title=The return of the lynx|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 March 2016|website=bbc.com|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reintroduction of Iberian lynx in Portugal has been a success; from 17 animals that were reintroduced, 12 have already established territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilder.pt/historias/comecou-hoje-a-epoca-de-2017-de-libertacoes-de-linces-em-portugal/|title=Come√ßou a √©poca de 2017 de liberta√ß√µes de linces em Portugal|date=17 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a 2007 outbreak of [[feline leukemia virus]] (FeLV), wild lynxes are tested periodically for possible disease. September‚ÄìDecember 2013 samples were negative for FeLV but one male became the first of his species to test positive for [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV) and was placed into quarantine.&lt;ref name=EP131230 /&gt;

=== Captive breeding ===
[[File:Iberian Lynx CNRLI reproduction centre 10 May 2015 (15).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Iberian Lynx CNRLI reproduction centre near the village of Vale Fuzeiros near the town of [[Silves, Portugal]]]]
In 2002, the Jerez Zoo confirmed it had three females and was developing a plan for a captive breeding program.&lt;ref name=guard0204 /&gt; One of those females was [[Saliega]], captured as a kitten in April 2002.&lt;ref name=guard0204 /&gt; She became the first Iberian lynx to breed in captivity, giving birth to three healthy kittens on 29 March 2005 at the El Acebuche Breeding Center, in the Do√±ana Nature Park in [[Huelva]], Spain.&lt;ref name=bbc050330 /&gt; Over the following years, the number of births grew and additional breeding centers were opened. In March 2009, it was reported that 27 kittens had been born since the beginning of the program.&lt;ref name=ap090320 /&gt; In 2009, the Spanish government planned to build a ‚Ç¨5.5 million breeding center in [[Zarza de Granadilla]].&lt;ref name=ap090320 /&gt; In Portugal the Centro Nacional de Reprodu√ß√£o do Lince-Ib√©rico (CNRLI) established a breeding center in [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]].&lt;ref name=TPN130627 /&gt;&lt;ref name=expr130402 /&gt;

There were 14 surviving kittens in 2008 and 15 in 2009.&lt;ref name=rtve100818 /&gt; In 2010, intense rain and health issues resulted in lower reproductive success‚Äî14 born, 8 surviving&lt;ref name=rtve100818 /&gt;‚Äîbut the next year, breeding centers recorded 45 births with 26 surviving kittens.&lt;ref name=ep120617 /&gt; In 2012, breeding centers in Portugal and Spain reported a total of 44 survivors from 59 births,&lt;ref name=ep120617 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tpn120331 /&gt; while 2013 saw a total of 44 survivors out of 53 born.&lt;ref name=efe130909 /&gt; In 2017, the total population of Iberian lynx reached 475 specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El lince ib√©rico ampl√≠a sus dominios y alcanza los 475 ejemplares, pese a la falta de conejos y los atropellos|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/natural/20170202/413902666216/lince.html|publisher=La Vanguardia|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, it was reported that Iberian lynx embryos and oocytes had been collected and preserved for the first time.&lt;ref name=fvb130323 /&gt; They were collected from Saliega and another female‚Äîboth sterilized and retired from the breeding program‚Äîby Berlin's Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research and stored in liquid nitrogen at the [[Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales]] in Madrid for possible future breeding.&lt;ref name=fvb130323 /&gt; In July 2014, the MNCN-CSIC announced they had produced sperm cells from the testicular tissue of sexually immature lynx.&lt;ref name=mundo140722 /&gt;

Iberian lynx can be observed in captivity only at the Jerez Zoo,&lt;ref name=zoobotanico2014 /&gt; since December 2014 at the [[Lisbon Zoo]],&lt;ref name=observador211214 /&gt; and since July 2016 at the [[Madrid Zoo]].&lt;ref name=zoomadrid200716 /&gt; The [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]] animals integrate the breeding program, the two Lisbon lynxes were formerly in the Portuguese breeding center but are no longer suited for the program (the female had multiple failed pregnancies and the male has a form of epilepsy),&lt;ref name=ultimoreduto17032015 /&gt; and the two Madrid lynxes were equally retired from the breeding program for not being suited for reproduction.

== Genetic studies ==
In August 2012, researchers announced that the genome of the Iberian lynx had been sequenced.&lt;ref name=mat120808 /&gt; They also plan genetic testing of the remains of long-deceased lynx to quantify loss of genetic diversity and improve conservation programs.&lt;ref name=mat121231 /&gt; In December 2012, it was reported that researchers had located remains of 466 Iberian lynx in private and museum collections.&lt;ref name=mat121231 /&gt; However, it is estimated that 40% of specimens were lost over the preceding 20 years.&lt;ref name=mat121231 /&gt;

Genetic diversity in the Iberian lynx is lower than in any other felids known to be genetically impoverished, including the [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), Ngorongoro crater lions, and Scandinavia's Eurasian lynx. Researchers believe this may be a consequence of decreasing population sizes and isolation.{{r|Casas2013}} A study published in 2013 indicated strong genetic differentiation between the Do√±ana and Andujar populations, due to both allelic frequencies and allelic composition. Do√±ana lynxes have differentiated more from the ancestral population as a result of their longer isolation and lower population size. The researchers suggested bringing the two groups together in order to lessen the degree of inbreeding.&lt;ref name=Casas2013&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Molecular Ecology]] |title= Genetics at the verge of extinction: insights from the Iberian lynx |author= Casas-Marce, M. |author2= Soriano, L. |author3= L√≥pez-Bao, J.

'''''Infinite Worlds: An Illustrated Voyage to Planets Beyond Our Sun''''' is a nonfiction book by Ray Villard and Lynette Cook about [[extrasolar planets]], featuring Lynette Cook's artwork. The book covers topics from the Big Bang, to extrasolar planets (the main focus of the book), and the [[ultimate fate of the universe]].

From the book's description on the back cover:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The newly discovered planets are boggling astronomers' minds with their bizarre characteristics, including an unimagined diversity of sizes and orbits. In Lynette Cook's illustrations - many newly created for this book - we glimpse the landscapes and atmospheres that might adorn these planets. Ray Villard's text describes the state of astronomy today, imagines where it will take us in the coming years, ponders the chances of success for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and explores the survivability of life in the context of an evolving and accelerating universe. Infinite Worlds is a cosmic adventure that brings the drama of creation and the beauty of the universe to anyone who has wondered at the night sky
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Fulton''' (1803&amp;ndash;1853), was originally a cobbler or [[Shoemaking|shoemaker]] by trade.&lt;ref name=fw&gt;[http://thefenwickweavers.coop/fenwick-in-history/john-fulton/ Fenwick Weavers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915031438/http://thefenwickweavers.coop/fenwick-in-history/john-fulton/# |date=2013-09-15 }} Retrieved : 2012-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; He built three [[orrery]]s in a workshop attached to at his home, now demolished, in the [[Kirton Brae]] area of [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]]&lt;ref&gt;Love, Page 102&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually appointed [[Musical instrument|instrument]] maker to King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], moving to London, but retiring to [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]]. He is buried in the Fenwick Kirk graveyard.&lt;ref name=fw/&gt;

==Life==
It is recorded that John's father, also a cobbler, was a subscribing member to the library set up in the village by the Fenwick Weavers. With access to this library, John pursued his interest in astronomy, mathematics, physics, and other disciplines that led to his career as an instrument maker of outstanding ability and achievement.&lt;ref name=fw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Page 120&lt;/ref&gt; Largely self-taught, he studied botany, learned several foreign languages, constructed a ‚Äòvelocipede‚Äô or early bicycle, and experimented with the production of coal gas. He had left school at the age of only thirteen.

===Orrerys===
[[File:Fenwick Parish Church - east side.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Fenwick Kirk, burial place of John Fulton.]]
[[Astronomy]] held a particular fascination for him, so much so that he was prompted to construct, in his spare time in the years between 1823 and 1833, three working models of the solar system, known as orrerys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futuremuseum.co.uk/Collection.aspx/john_fulton/Description Future Museum]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved : 2012-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; The third of these is now on display in Glasgow's [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]]: it was the most intricate and took him four years to finish. It measured 1000mm x 3000mm x 3000mm. Entirely his own work, it has 175 wheels and more than 200 moving parts and is acknowledged to be one of the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.glasgowmuseums.com/starobject.html?oid=386785 Glasgow Museums] Retrieved : 2012-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Arts, who awarded him a silver medal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121211060400/http://hausman27.wordpress.com/2011/12/04/intellectual-icon-john-fultons-orrery/ Intellectual Icons] Retrieved : 2012-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; calculated that his third orrery was the most perfect built up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulton took the orrery on a tour of the United Kingdom. Such was the public interest that in 1869 a group of Glasgow businessmen led by William Walker bought the orrery for the city. It was brought up from London and then toured around Glasgow schools and museums until the 1930s when it found a more permanent home in the Old Glasgow Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE00101&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=search.php%3Fstart%3D0%26end%3D20%26what%3D%26where%3D|yorkhill%26who%3D%26period%3D0%26collection%3D0%26search%3D99 The Glasgow Story] Retrieved : 2012-07-24&lt;/ref&gt;

A local story relates that Fulton 'borrowed' his grandmother‚Äôs candlesticks and melted them down to provide the brass for his first orrery model.&lt;ref name=fw/&gt;

==John Fulton Memorial Hall==
This is the public meeting hall for Fenwick, maintained by [[East Ayrshire Council]]. It was previously the Guthrie Memorial Free Church of 1844,&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Page 107&lt;/ref&gt; and following a worldwide fund raising campaign sufficient funds had been raised by 1919 and the hall was opened in 1920.&lt;ref name=fw/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1723">In artificial intelligence, knowledge-based agents draw on a pool of logical sentences to infer conclusions about the [[world]].  At the '''knowledge level''', we only need to specify what the agent knows and what its goals are; a logical abstraction separate from details of implementation.

This notion of knowledge level was first introduced by [[Allen Newell]] in the 1980s, to have a way to rationalize an agent's behavior.  The agent takes actions based on knowledge it possesses, in an attempt to reach specific goals.  It chooses actions according to the [[principle of rationality]].

Beneath the knowledge level resides the [[symbol level]].  Whereas the knowledge level is ''world'' oriented, namely that it concerns the environment in which the agent operates, the symbol level is ''system'' oriented, in that it includes the mechanisms the agent has available to operate.  The knowledge level ''rationalizes'' the agent's behavior, while the symbol level ''mechanizes'' the agent's behavior.

For example, in a computer program, the knowledge level consists of the information contained in its data structures that it uses to perform certain actions.  The symbol level consists of the program's algorithms, the data structures themselves, and so on.

'''''Kuhn vs. Popper: The Struggle for the Soul of Science''''' is a 2003 book by sociologist [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], in which the author discusses and criticizes the philosophers of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper]]. The book, published by [[Columbia University Press]], received several negative reviews, but was also made Book of the Month by ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine.

==Summary==
Fuller uses the 1965 meeting between [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper]], in which they discussed the [[philosophy of science]], as a point of departure to discuss how their respective philosophies have been received by the media, the public, and scholars.

==Reception==
Academic [[Rupert Read]] called the book worthless, and wrote that it presented an over-simplified and distorted view of both Popper and Kuhn.&lt;ref name="2005Read"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pos.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/35/3/369| title=Book Review: How and How Not to Write on a "Legendary" Philosopher  |journal=[[Philosophy of the Social Sciences (journal)|Philosophy of the Social Sciences]] |date=September 2005|volume=35|issue=3|pages=369‚Äì387 | first=Rupert | last= Read   | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that the book was not thorough enough to be convincing.&lt;ref name="2003Economist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1973924 | title=Book Review: Kuhn vs. Popper  | publisher=The Economist |date=Aug 7, 2003  | first= | last=   | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass circulation US magazine ''Popular Science'' made the book Book of the Month in February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle |publisher=Popsci.com |date=2005-02-01 |author= Gregory Mone|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK-based website, also called 'Popular Science' but bearing no relation to the magazine, wrote that "Fuller rightly points out some of the flaws in both Popper and Kuhn's approach", but added that he wasted an opportunity to explain the philosophy of science in a way that ordinary readers would find useful.&lt;ref name="2005Science"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev174.htm | title=Book Review: Kuhn vs. Popper  | publisher=[[Popular Science]] |date=February 1, 2005|volume=266|issue=2|page=89  | first= | last=   | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewis and Clark Landing''' is a public park located at 515 North Riverfront Drive in [[Downtown Omaha, Nebraska]] .  This {{convert|23|acre|ha|adj=on}} park is situated along the eight-foot-tall (2.4 m) river walk of the [[Missouri River]] just north of [[Interstate 480 (Iowa-Nebraska)|U.S. Interstate 480]].

== History ==
Lewis and Clark Landing is the original landing site of the 1804 [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].  The Lewis and Clark Expedition took place from 1804 to 1806.  The purpose of the expedition was to explore the land which the [[United States]] had purchased from [[France]] through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.  Lewis and Clark Landing now sits on property formerly owned by [[ASARCO]], which maintained a lead refinery there that closed in 1997. [[HDR Inc.]] won an award from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] for their work on remediation of the Lewis and Clark Landing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdrinc.com/about-hdr/news-and-events/news-releases/2009-11-18-hdr-designed-asarco-remediation-project-wins-phoe "HDR-designed ASARCO remediation project wins Phoenix award," HDR website.

== Features ==

The park has a number of distinct features including as a walking trail which follows the riverfront and a bike trail which takes riders west to [[River City Star|Miller's Landing]] and another trail which leads to the [[Heartland of America Park]]. The [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Pedestrian Bridge, with interpretive exhibits, connects to [[CenturyLink Center Omaha]]. The park also includes the Omaha Firefighter's Memorial Monument and the second largest labor monument in the United States. The park contains a walking trail which follows the riverfront and sections of a bike trail that connect to Omaha's bike trail system.  The walking trail also connects to the [[Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge]] that spans the river and joins Omaha with [[Council Bluffs]], [[Iowa]]. There is expansive area for festivals and events and there are a number of tables with umbrellas and chairs that offer a chance to relax and take in the riverfront experience.  Additional attractions include a "Monument to Labor" sculpture, Lewis and Clark interpretive exhibits, jumping fountains where children can play, and a historical marker on site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitomaha.com/listings/index.cfm?action=displayListing&amp;listingID=57383 "Lewis &amp; Clark Landing"], Omaha Convention and Visitor's Bureau.

The park is immediately down the trail from Omaha's new National Park Service Regional Headquarters. The office houses the superintendent of the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;Gale, K.

Crystal structures of protein and nucleic acid molecules and their complexes are central to the practice of most parts of [[biophysics]], and have shaped much of what we understand scientifically at the atomic-detail level of biology.  Their importance is underlined by the United Nations declaring 2014 as the [[International Year of Crystallography]], as the 100th anniversary of [[Max von Laue]]'s 1914 [[Nobel prize]] for discovering the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals.  This chronological list of biophysically notable protein and nucleic acid structures is loosely based on a review in the [[Biophysical Journal]].&lt;ref name=BJ&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson JS, Richardson DC |title=Biophysical highlights from 54 years of macromolecular crystallography |journal=Biophysical Journal |year=2014 |volume=106 |pages=510‚Äì525 |doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2014.01.001 |pmid=24507592 |pmc=3945011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The list includes all the first dozen distinct structures, those that broke new ground in subject or method, and those that became model systems for work in future biophysical areas of research.

The myoglobin 3-dimensional structure is made up of 8 [[alpha helix|alpha-helices]], and the crystal structure showed that their conformation was right-handed and very closely matched the geometry proposed by [[Linus Pauling]], with 3.6 residues per turn and backbone hydrogen bonds from the peptide NH of one residue to the peptide CO of residue i+4.

1960 - The '''[[Hemoglobin]]''' crystal structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perutz MF, Rossmann MG, Cullis AF, Muirhead H, North AC |title=Structure of haemoglobin: A three-dimensional Fourier synthesis at 5.5-√Ö resolution, obtained by X-ray analysis |year=1960 |journal=Nature |volume=185 |pages=416‚Äì422 |doi=10.1038/185416a0 |pmid=18990801 |issue=4711}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed a tetramer of two related chain types and was solved at much lower resolution than the monomeric myoglobin, but it clearly had the same basic 8-helix architecture (now called the "globin fold"). Further hemoglobin crystal structures at higher resolution [PDB 1MHB, 1DHB)  soon showed the coupled change of both local and [[Quaternary structure|quaternary conformation]] between the oxy and deoxy states of hemoglobin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perutz MF |title=Stereochemistry of Cooperative Effects in Haemoglobin: Haem‚ÄìHaem Interaction and the Problem of Allostery |year=1970 |journal=Nature |volume=228 |pages=726‚Äì734 |doi=10.1038/228726a0 |issue=5273}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explains the cooperativity of oxygen binding in the blood and the [[allostery|allosteric]] effect of factors such as [[pH]] and [[2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate|DPG]]. For decades hemoglobin was the primary teaching example for the concept of allostery, as well as being an intensive focus of research and discussion on allostery.  In 1909, hemoglobin crystals from &gt;100 species were used to relate taxonomy to molecular properties.&lt;ref name=Reichert&gt;{{cite book |author1=Edward Tyson Reichert  |author2=Amos Peaslee Brown  |lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Differentiation and Specificity of Corresponding Proteins and other Vital Substances in Relation to Biological Classification and Organic Evolution: The Crystallography of Hemoglobins |year=1909 |publisher=Carnegie Institution |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; That book was cited by [[Max Perutz|Perutz]] in the 1938 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernal JD, Fankuchen I, Perutz M |title=X-ray syudy of chymotrypsin and hemoglobin |year=1938 |journal=Nature |volume=141 |pages=523‚Äì524|doi=10.1038/141523a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of horse hemoglobin crystals that began his long saga to solve the crystal structure. Hemoglobin crystals are [[pleochroism|pleochroic]] - dark red in two directions and pale red in the third&lt;ref name=Reichert/&gt; - because of the orientation of the hemes, and the bright [[Soret peak|Soret band]] of the heme [[porphyrin]] groups is used in spectroscopic analysis of hemoglobin ligand binding.

==Hen-egg-white lysozyme==
1965 - '''Hen-egg-white [[lysozyme]]''' (PDB file 1lyz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blake CC, Koenig DF, Mair GA, North AC, Phillips DC, Sarma VR |title=Structure of hen egg-white lysozyme: A three-dimensional Fourier synthesis at 2√Ö resolution |year=1965 |journal=Nature |volume=206 |pages=757‚Äì761 |doi=10.1038/206757a0 |pmid=5891407 |issue=4986}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first crystal structure of an enzyme (it cleaves small [[carbohydrates]] into simple sugars), used for early studies of enzyme mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warshel A, Levitt M |title=Theoretical studies of enzymic reactions: Dielectric, electrostatic, and steric stabilization of the carbonium ion in the reaction of lysozyme |year=1976 |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=103 |pages=227‚Äì49|pmid=985660 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(76)90311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contained [[beta sheet]] (antiparallel) as well as helices, and was also the first macromolecular structure to have its atomic coordinates refined (in real space).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond R |title=Real-space refinement of the structure of hen egg-white lysozyme |year=1974 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume= 82 |pages=371‚Äì374 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(74)90598-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The starting material for preparation can be bought at the grocery store, and hen-egg lysozyme crystallizes very readily in many different [[space groups]]; it is the favorite test case for new crystallographic experiments and instruments.  Recent examples are nanocrystals of lysozyme for free-electron laser data collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Boutet S, Lomb L, Williams GJ, etal |title=High-resolution protein structure determination by serial femtosecond crystallography |year=2012 |journal=Science |volume=337 |pages=362‚Äì364|doi=10.1126/science.1217737 |url=http://bib-pubdb1.desy.de/record/140575/files/lysozyme-all.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and microcrystals for micro electron diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shi D, Nannenga BL, Iadenza MG, Gonen T |title=Three-dimensional electron crystallography of protein microcrystals |year=2013 |journal=eLife |volume=2 |pages=e01345-e01345 |doi=10.7554/elife.01345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RibonucleaseA SS paleRib.png|thumb|right|180px| Ribonuclease A ribbon drawing]]

==Ribonuclease==
1967 - '''[[Ribonuclease A]]''' (PDB file 2RSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kartha G, Bello J, Harker D |title=Tertiary structure of ribonuclease |year=1967 |journal=Nature |volume=213 |pages=862‚Äì865 |doi=10.1038/213862a0 |pmid=6043657 |issue=5079}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an RNA-cleaving enzyme stabilized by 4 disulfide bonds.  It was used in [[Christian B. Anfinsen|Anfinsen]]'s seminal research on protein folding which led to the concept that a protein's 3-dimensional structure was determined by its [[amino-acid]] sequence. [[Ribonuclease S]], the cleaved, two-component form studied by [[Frederic M. Richards|Fred Richards]], was also enzymatically active, had a nearly identical crystal structure (PDB file 1RNS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wyckoff HW, Hardman KD, Allewell NM, Inagami T, Johnson LN, Richards FM |title=The structure of ribonuclease-S at 3.5 √Ö resolution |year=1967 |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=242 |pages=3984‚Äì3988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was shown to be catalytically active even in the crystal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doscher MS, Richards FM | year=1963| title=The activity of an enzyme in the crystalline state: Ribonuclease-S| journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume=238| pages=2399‚Äì2406}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping dispel doubts about the relevance of protein crystal structures to biological function.

==Serine proteases==
1967 - The [[serine proteases]] are a historically very important group of enzyme structures, because collectively they illuminated catalytic mechanism (in their case, by the Ser-His-Asp "catalytic triad"), the basis of differing substrate specificities, and the activation mechanism by which a controlled enzymatic cleavage buries the new chain end to properly rearrange the active site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Dickerson RE, Geis I |title=Structure and Action of Proteins |year=1969 |publisher= Harper |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early crystal structures included '''[[chymotrypsin]] '''(PDB file 2CHA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matthews BW, Sigler PB, Henderson R, Blow DM |title=Three-dimensional structure of tosyl-Œ±-chymotrypsin |year=1967 |journal=Nature |volume=214 |pages=652‚Äì656 |doi=10.1038/214652a0 |issue=5089}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[chymotrypsinogen]]''' (PDB file 1CHG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freer ST, Kraut J, Robertus JD, Tonle H, Wright HT |title=Chymotrypsinogen: 2.5-√Ö crystal structure, comparison with Œ±-chymotrypsin, and implications for zymogen activation |year=1970 |journal= Biochemistry |volume=9 |pages=1997‚Äì2009 |doi=10.1021/bi00811a022 |pmid=5442169 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[trypsin]]''' (PDB file 1PTN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fehlhammer H, Bode W |title=The refined crystal structure of bovine beta-trypsin at 1.8√Ö resolution, II.

One reason for their wide use as textbook and classroom examples was the insertion-code numbering system (hated by all computer programmers), which made Ser195 and His57 consistent and memorable despite the protein-specific sequence differences.

[[File:Potato CPA inhibitor ribbon.jpg|thumb|right|120px| CPA inhibitor]]

==Carboxypeptidase==
1969 - '''[[Carboxypeptidase A]]'''  is a zinc [[metalloprotease]].  Its crystal structure (PDB file 1CPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lipscomb WN |author2=Hartsuck JA |author3=Reeke GN |author4=Quiocho FA |author5=Bethge PH |author6=Ludwif=g ML |author7=Steitz TA |author8=Muirhead H |author9=Coppola JC |title= The structure of carboxypeptidase A, VII. The 2.0-√Ö resolution studies of the enzyme and of its complex with glycyltyrosine, and mechanistic deductions |year=1969 |journal=Brookhaven Symposia in Biology |volume= 21 |pages=24‚Äì90}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed the first parallel beta structure: a large, twisted, central sheet of 8 strands with the active-site Zn located at the C-terminal end of the middle strands and the sheet flanked on both sides with alpha helices. It is an [[exopeptidase]] that cleaves peptides or proteins from the carboxy-terminal end rather than internal to the sequence.  Later a small protein inhibitor of carboxypeptidase was solved (PDB file 4CPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rees DC, Lipscomb WN |title=Refined crystal structure of the potato inhibitor complex of carboxypeptidase A at 2.5 A resolution |year=1982 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=160 |pages=475‚Äì498 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(82)90309-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that mechanically stops the catalysis by presenting its C-terminal end just sticking out from between a ring of disulfide bonds with tight structure behind it, preventing the enzyme from sucking in the chain past the first residue.

==Insulin==
1971 - '''[[Insulin]]''' (PDB file 1INS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blundell TL, Cutfield JF, Cutfield SM, Dodson EJ, Dodson GG, Hodgkin DC, Mercola DA, Vijayan M |title=Atomic positions in rhombohedral 2-zinc insulin crystals |year=1971 |journal=Nature |volume=231 |pages=506‚Äì511 |doi=10.1038/231506a0 |pmid=4932997 |issue=5304}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[hormone]] central to the [[metabolism]] of sugar and fat storage, and important in human diseases such as [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]].  It is biophysically notable for its Zn binding, its equilibrium between monomer, dimer, and hexamer states, its ability to form crystals in vivo, and its synthesis as a longer "pro" form which is then cleaved to fold up as the active 2-chain, SS-linked monomer.  Insulin was a success of [[NASA]]'s crystal-growth program on the [[space shuttle]], producing bulk preparations of very uniform tiny crystals for controlled dosage.

==Vault particle==
2009 The '''[[Vault (organelle)|Vault particle]]''' is an intriguing new discovery of a large hollow particle common in cells, with several different suggestions for its possible biological function.  The crystal structures (PDB files 2zuo, 2zv4, 2zv5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanaka H, Kato K, Yamashita E, Sumizawa T, Zhou Y, Yau M, Iwasaki K, Yoshimura M, Tsukihara T |title=The Structure of Rat Liver Vault at 3.5 Angstrom Resolution |year=2009 |journal=Science |volume=323 |pages=384‚Äì388 |doi=10.1126/science.1164975 |pmid=19150846 |issue=5912}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4hl8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casanas A, Querol-Audi J, Guerra P, Pous J, Tanaka H, Tsukihara T, Verdaguer N, Fita I |title=New features of vault architecture and dynamics revealed by novel refinement using the deformable elastic network approach |year=2013 |journal=Acta Crystallographica |volume=D69 |pages=1054‚Äì1061 |pmid=23695250 |doi=10.1107/S0907444913004472 |issue=Pt 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show that each half of the vault is made up of 39 copies of a long 12-domain protein that swirl together to form the enclosure.

A '''mathematician''' is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of [[mathematics]] in his or her work, typically to solve [[mathematical problem]]s.

Mathematics is concerned with [[number]]s, [[data]], [[quantity]], [[mathematical structure|structure]], [[space]], [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[mathematics#Change|change]].

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is on the history of mathematicians. For a history of mathematics in general, see [[History of mathematics]]}}

One of the earliest known mathematicians was [[Thales of Miletus]] (c. 624‚Äìc.546 BC); he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Boyer|year=1991|title=A History of Mathematics|page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]].

The number of known mathematicians grew when [[Pythagoras of Samos]] (c. 582‚Äìc. 507 BC) established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins.

The first woman mathematician recorded by history was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/hypatia.html Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Science and mathematics in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs,&lt;ref&gt;Abattouy, M., Renn, J. &amp; Weinig, P., 2001. Transmission as Transformation: The Translation Movements in the Medieval East and West in a Comparative Perspective. Science in Context, 14(1-2), 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was [[al-Khawarizmi]]. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on [[optics]], [[Mathematics|maths]] and [[astronomy]] of [[Ibn al-Haytham]].

The [[Renaissance]] brought an increased emphasis on mathematics and science to Europe. During this period of transition from a mainly feudal and ecclesiastical culture to a predominantly secular one, many notable mathematicians had other occupations: [[Luca Pacioli]] (founder of [[accounting]]); [[Niccol√≤ Fontana Tartaglia]] (notable engineer and bookkeeper); [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (earliest founder of probability and binomial expansion); [[Robert Recorde]] (physician) and [[Fran√ßois Vi√®te]] (lawyer).

As time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities. An emphasis on free thinking and experimentation had begun in Britain's oldest universities beginning in the seventeenth century at Oxford with the scientists [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]], and at Cambridge where [[Isaac Newton]] was [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Professor of Mathematics &amp; Physics]]. Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the ‚Äúregurgitation of knowledge‚Äù to ‚Äúencourag[ing] productive thinking.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;R√∂hrs, "The Classical Idea of the University," ''Tradition and Reform of the University under an International Perspective'' p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Humboldt convinced the King of Prussia to build a university in Berlin based on [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]‚Äôs liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge and to teach students to ‚Äútake account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking.‚Äù Thus, seminars and laboratories started to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;R√ºegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

British universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the Italian and German universities, but as they already enjoyed substantial freedoms and [[autonomy]] the changes there had begun with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the same influences that inspired Humboldt. The Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] emphasized the importance of [[research]], arguably more authentically implementing Humboldt‚Äôs idea of a university than even German universities, which were subject to state authority.&lt;ref&gt;R√ºegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, science (including mathematics) became the focus of universities in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students could conduct research in [[seminars]] or [[laboratories]] and began to produce doctoral theses with more scientific content.&lt;ref&gt;R√ºegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; According to Humboldt, the mission of the [[University of Berlin]] was to pursue scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;R√ºegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The German university system fostered professional, bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed in well-equipped laboratories, instead of the kind of research done by private and individual scholars in Great Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;R√ºegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, R√ºegg asserts that the German system is responsible for the development of the modern research university because it focused on the idea of ‚Äúfreedom of scientific research, teaching and study.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;R√ºegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Required education==
Mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[graduate-level|graduate level]]. In some universities, a [[qualifying exam]] serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students, who pass, are permitted to work on a [[doctoral dissertation]].

==Activities==
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|[[Emmy Noether]], mathematical theorist and teacher.]]

===Applied mathematics===
{{main|Applied mathematics}}
Mathematicians involved with solving problems with applications in real life are called [[applied mathematician]]s. Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and [[professional]] methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of [[mathematical models]]. Mathematicians and applied mathematicians are considered to be two of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The discipline of [[applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract. As professionals focused on problem solving, ''applied mathematicians'' look into the ''formulation, study, and use of mathematical models'' in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and other areas of mathematical practice.

===Abstract mathematics===
{{main|Pure mathematics}}
[[Pure mathematics]] is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s. From the eighteenth century onwards, this was a recognized category of mathematical activity, sometimes characterized as ''speculative mathematics'',&lt;ref&gt;See for example titles of works by [[Thomas Simpson]] from the mid-18th century: ''Essays on Several Curious and Useful Subjects in Speculative and Mixed Mathematicks'', ''Miscellaneous Tracts on Some Curious and Very Interesting Subjects in Mechanics, Physical Astronomy and Speculative Mathematics''.{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Simpson, Thomas |volume=25 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and other applications.

Another insightful view put forth is that ''pure mathematics is not necessarily [[applied mathematics]]'': it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature, and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;Andy Magid, Letter from the Editor, in ''Notices of the AMS'', November 2005, American Mathematical Society, p.1173. [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

===Mathematics teaching===
Many professional mathematicians also engage in the teaching of mathematics. Duties may include:
* teaching university mathematics courses;
* supervising undergraduate and graduate research; and
* serving on academic committees.

===Consulting===
Many careers in mathematics outside of universities involve consulting. For instance, actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.

As another example, mathematical finance will derive and extend the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain [[share price]], a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use [[stochastic calculus]] to obtain the corresponding value of [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s of the [[stock]] (''see: [[Valuation of options]]; [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|Financial modeling]]'').

== Occupations ==

== Quotations about mathematicians ==
The following are quotations about mathematicians, or by mathematicians.

: ''A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.''
::‚ÄîAttributed to both [[Alfr√©d R√©nyi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html |title=Biography of Alfr√©d R√©nyi |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Erd≈ës]]

: ''Die Mathematiker sind eine Art Franzosen; redet man mit ihnen, so √ºbersetzen sie es in ihre Sprache, und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes.'' (Mathematicians are [like] a sort of Frenchmen; if you talk to them, they translate it into their own language, and then it is immediately something quite different.)
::‚Äî[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]&lt;ref&gt;''Maximen und Reflexionen, Sechste Abtheilung'' cited in {{citation|first=Robert Edouard|last=Moritz|title=On Mathematics / A Collection of Witty, Profound, Amusing Passages about Mathematics and Mathematicians|year=1958|origyear=1914|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-20489-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Each generation has its few great mathematicians...and [the others'] research harms no one.''
::‚Äî[[Alfred W. Adler]] (1930- ), "Mathematics and Creativity"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Adler, "Mathematics and Creativity," ''The New Yorker'', 1972, reprinted in Timothy Ferris, ed., ''The World Treasury of Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics'', Back Bay Books, reprint, June 30, 1993, p, 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.''
::‚Äî[[Edgar Allan Poe]], ''The purloined letter''

: ''A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.''
::‚Äî[[G. H. Hardy]], ''A Mathematician's Apology''

: ''Some of you may have met mathematicians and wondered how they got that way.''
::‚Äî[[Tom Lehrer]]

: ''It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul.''
::‚Äî[[Sofia Kovalevskaya]]

: ''There are two ways to do great mathematics. The first is to be smarter than everybody else. The second way is to be stupider than everybody else‚Äîbut persistent.''
::‚Äî[[Raoul Bott]]
: ''Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and arithmetic the queen of mathematics.''
::‚Äî[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sartorius von Waltershausen: Gauss zum Gedachtniss. (Leipzig, 1856), p. 79'' cited in {{citation|first=Robert Edouard|last=Moritz|title=On Mathematics / A Collection of Witty, Profound, Amusing Passages about Mathematics and Mathematicians|year=1958|origyear=1914|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-20489-8|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prizes in mathematics ==
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, though sometimes mathematicians have won the Nobel Prize in a different field, such as economics. Prominent prizes in mathematics include the [[Abel Prize]], the [[Chern Medal]], the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Gauss Prize]], the [[Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize|Nemmers Prize]], the [[Balzan Prize]], the [[Crafoord Prize]], the [[Shaw Prize]], the [[Steele Prize]], the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[Schock Prize]], and the [[Nevanlinna Prize]].

The [[American Mathematical Society]], [[Association for Women in Mathematics]], and other mathematical societies offer several prizes aimed at increasing the representation of women and minorities in the future of mathematics.

==Mathematical autobiographies==
Several well known mathematicians have written autobiographies in part to explain to a general audience what it is about mathematics that has made them want to devote their lives to its study. These provide some of the best glimpses into what it means to be a mathematician. The following list contains some works that are not autobiographies, but rather essays on mathematics and mathematicians with strong autobiographical elements.

It is currently owned by the [[Swatch Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/90f7457e-8dde-11dc-8591-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=24d8b986-8c3a-11dc-b887-0000779fd2ac.html Financial Times Article]&lt;/ref&gt; Nivarox is also the trade name of the metallic alloy from which its products are fabricated.  Its notable property is that its coefficient of elasticity is remarkably constant with temperature.  Nivarox is most famous for producing hairsprings which are attached to the [[balance wheel]] inside a mechanical watch movement, as well as mainsprings which provide the motive power for the watch.

The Nivarox story began in 1933 when Dr. Straumann perfected the process of hairspring manufacturing in his Waldenbourg laboratory. FAR was the corporate name chosen in 1932 for the entity comprising several companies and subsidiaries located in [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, manufacturing various watch components.

==Nivarox alloy==

As a trade name, Nivarox is a German [[acronym]] for "Nicht variabel oxydfest" (G.) or "Non-Variable Non-Oxidizing" (E.). The Nivarox alloy is a [[nickel]] [[iron]] [[alloy]] used mainly in the watch industry for hairsprings for balance wheels, but also in other micro-machine industries and in certain medical equipment and surgical instruments, in the same category as [[Elinvar]], [[Ni-Span]], [[Vibralloy]], and other similar alloys.  The "non-variable" refers to the alloy's most notable property: that it has a low temperature coefficient of elasticity; its [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] does not change much with temperature,   There are several versions of the Nivarox alloy depending upon the intended application: Nivarox-CT, but also with suffixes CTC, M, W. Chemical compositions vary in wt% as follows for all Nivarox alloys : Iron as balance, a wide variation in nickel between 30-40%, beryllium 0.7-1%, some versions have molybdenum at 6-9% while others have instead chromium 8%, titanium is present in some compositions at 1%, manganese at 0.7-0.8%, silicon 0.1-0.2% and carbon in traces up to 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;page 1 (in text p.216-217) of Subvolume I1 ‚ÄòMagnetic Alloys for Technical Applications. Soft Magnetic Alloys, Invar and Elinvar Alloys‚Äô of Volume 19 ‚ÄòMagnetic Properties of Metals‚Äô of Landolt-B√∂rnstein - Group III Condensed Matter , Springer Verlag, 1994  https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F10065028_63.pdf#page-1&lt;/ref&gt; A typical composition would be for the early version Nivarox-CT (by wt %) : Fe 54%, Ni 38%, Cr 8%, Ti 1%, Si 0.2%, Mn 0.8%, Be 0.9%, C &lt; 0.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Woldman's engineering alloys, page805, ASM International, 2000.  https://books.google.com/books?id=RzMOiOEQ-oMC&amp;pg=PA805&lt;/ref&gt;  

When used for critical watch components, the alloy reduces errors due to temperature variation.  [[Hairspring]]s made of this alloy have a [[spring constant]] which does not vary with temperature, allowing the watch's [[balance wheel]], its timekeeping element, to keep better time.   Along with the earlier alloy [[Elinvar]], this alloy made obsolete the expensive [[balance wheel|compensation balance]] used in precision timepieces in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hiro.alliancehorlogere.com/en/Under_the_Loupe/The_Hairspring.html Under the Loupe: The Hairspring]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nivarox springs are now used by most [[watchmakers]] worldwide, with a global market share of 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Hermann |authorlink=Hermann Simon |date=2009 |title=Hidden Champions of the Twenty-First Century: The Success Strategies of Unknown World Market Leaders |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-0-387-98147-5 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alloys also see limited use for specific components of sensitive scientific instruments.

'''''Magicicada''''' is the genus of the 13-year and 17-year '''periodical cicadas''' of eastern [[North America]]. Although they are sometimes called "[[locust]]s", this is a misnomer, as [[cicada]]s belong to the taxonomic order [[Hemiptera]] (true bugs), suborder [[Auchenorrhyncha]], while locusts are grasshoppers belonging to the order [[Orthoptera]].&lt;ref name=umich&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.magicicada.org |title = Periodical Cicada |work = magicicada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magicicada'' belongs to the tribe Lamotialnini, a group of cicada genera with representatives in Australia, Africa, and Asia, as well as the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=DC |last2=Moulds |first2=M |last3=Hill |first3=KBR |last4=Price |first4=BW |last5=Wade |first5=EJ |last6=Owen |first6=CO |last7=Goemans |first7=G |last8=Marathe |first8=K |last9=Sarkar |first9=V |last10=Cooley |first10=JR |last11=Sanborn |first11=AF |last12=Kunte |first12=K |last13=Villet |first13=MH |last14=Simon |first14=C |year=2018 |title=A molecular phylogeny of the cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) with a review of tribe and subfamily classification |journal=Zootaxa |volume=4424 |issue=1 |pages=1‚Äì64 |url=http://www.mapress.com/j/zt/article/view/zootaxa.4424.1.1 |doi=10.11646/zootaxa.4424.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Magicicada'' species spend most of their 13- and 17-year lives underground feeding on [[xylem]] fluids from the roots of [[deciduous]] forest trees in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lloyd, M. |author2=H.S.

Within two months of the original emergence, the lifecycle is complete, the eggs have been laid, and the adult cicadas are gone for another 13 or 17 years.

==Description==
The familiar winged [[imago]] (adult) periodical cicada has red eyes and a black dorsal thorax. The wings are translucent and have orange veins. The underside of the abdomen may be black, orange, or striped with orange and black, depending on the species.&lt;ref name=species&gt;{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Richard D. |title=The Evolutionary Relationships of 17-Year and 13-Year Cicadas, and Three New Species (Homoptera, Cicadidae, ''Magicicada'') |author2=Moore, Thomas E. |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/buzz/c700lam62.pdf |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |year = 1962 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults are typically {{convert|2.4|to|3.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, depending on species, slightly smaller than most of the annual cicada species found in the same regions of the United States. Mature females are slightly larger than males.&lt;ref name=encycent&gt;{{cite book |last=Capinera |first=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4020-6242-7 |pages=2785‚Äì2794 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Magicicada'' males typically form large aggregations that sing in chorus to attract receptive females. Different species have different characteristic calling songs. The call of [[decim periodical cicadas]] is said to resemble someone calling "weeeee-whoa" or "Pharaoh".&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite web |last=Stranahan |first=Nancy |title=Nature Notes from the Eastern Forest |url=http://www.highlandssanctuary.org/nature.notes.1.cicada/nature.notes.htm |publisher=[[Arc of Appalachia]] |accessdate=10 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005233752/http://www.highlandssanctuary.org/nature.notes.1.cicada/nature.notes.htm |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cassini periodical cicadas|cassini]] and decula periodic cicadas (including ''M. tredecula'') have songs that intersperse buzzing and ticking sounds.&lt;ref name=encycent/&gt;

Cicadas do not sting and do not normally bite. Like other [[Auchenorrhyncha]] bugs, they have mouthparts used in piercing plants and sucking their sap. A cicada's proboscis can pierce human skin when it is handled, which is painful, but in no other way harmful. These cicadas are not venomous, and no evidence shows they transmit diseases. They pose little threat to mature vegetation, although planting new trees or shrubs is best postponed until after an expected emergence of the periodical cicadas. Mature plants rarely suffer lasting damage, although twig die-off or flagging can result from egg-laying.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=William M. |author2=Robert D.

==Lifecycle==
[[File:Snodgrass periodical cicada transformation.png|upright|thumb|left|Transformation of the periodical cicada from the mature [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] to the adult]]

Nearly all cicadas spend years underground as juveniles, before emerging above ground for a short adult stage of several weeks to a few months.  The seven periodical cicada species are so named because, in any one location, all of the members of the population are developmentally synchronized‚Äîthey emerge as adults all at once in the same year. This periodicity is especially remarkable because their lifecycles are so long‚Äî13 or 17 years. Cicadas of all other species (perhaps 3000 worldwide) are not synchronized, so some adults mature each summer and emerge while the rest of the population continues to develop underground. Many people refer to these nonperiodical species as [[annual cicada]]s since some are seen every summer. The few known lifecycles of annual species range from two to 10 years, although some could be longer.

The nymphs of the periodical cicadas live underground, usually within {{convert|2|ft|cm|0|abbr=on}} of the surface, feeding on the juices of plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marlatt|first=C. L.|author-link=Charles Lester Marlatt|title=The Periodical Cicada (Bulletin No. 71 - U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Entomology)|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|year=1907|pages=123‚Äì125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CloDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nymphs of the periodical cicada undergo five [[instar]] stages in their development underground. It has been suggested that the difference in the 13- and 17-year lifecycle is the time it takes for the second instar to mature. While underground, the nymphs move deeper below ground, feeding on larger roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = J | last2 = Lloyd | first2 = M. | year = 1979 | title = Seventeen year cicadas emerging after eighteen years-a new brood? | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1193‚Äì1199 | doi=10.2307/2407477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MoltingMagicicadaCrop.jpg|thumb|''Magicicada'' molting]]

The nymphs emerge on a spring evening when the soil temperature at about {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} depth is above {{convert|17.9|¬∞C|¬∞F|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. In most years in the United States, this works out to late April or early May in the far south, and late May to early June in the far north. Emerging nymphs climb to a suitable place on the nearby vegetation to complete their transformation into adults. They [[ecdysis|molt]] one last time and then spend about six days in the trees waiting for their [[exoskeleton]]s to harden completely. Just after this final molt, the teneral adults are white, but darken within an hour.

[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|''Magicicada'' in final molting stage prior to hardening of exoskeleton]]

Adult periodical cicadas live only for a few weeks; by mid-July, all have disappeared. Their short adult lives have one purpose: reproduction. The males "sing" a species-specific mating song; like other cicadas, they produce loud sounds using their tymbals. Singing males of a single ''Magicicada'' species form aggregations (choruses) that are sexually attractive to females. Males in these choruses alternate bouts of singing with short flights from tree to tree in search of receptive females.&lt;ref name=magiiii&gt;{{cite web|title=Magicicada Broods III and XXII will emerge in 2014 |url=http://www.magicicada.org|publisher=www.magicicada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most matings occur in "chorus" trees.&lt;ref name=species/&gt;

Receptive females respond to the calls of conspecific males with timed wing-flicks, which attract the males for mating.&lt;ref name=wingflick&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Signals in Periodical Cicadas |url=http://www.magicicada.org/cooley/reprints/Cooley_Marshall_2001.pdf|publisher=Behaviour}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sounds of a "chorus"‚Äîa group of males‚Äîcan be deafening and reach 100&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]]. In addition to their "calling" or "congregating" song, males produce a distinctive courtship song when approaching an individual female.&lt;ref name=species /&gt;

[[File:cicada egg slits 20040606 200213 1.jpg|thumb|''Magicicada'' egg slits (circled in red)]]

Both males and females can mate multiple times, although most females seem to mate just once.  After mating, the female cuts V-shaped slits in the bark of young twigs and lays about 20 eggs in each, for a total of 600 or more eggs. After about six to 10 weeks, the eggs hatch and the newborn nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow and begin another 13- or 17-year cycle.

==Predator satiation survival strategy==
{{further|Antipredator adaptation}}

[[File:Magicicada emergence holes.jpg|thumb|left|Emergence holes]]

The nymphs emerge in large numbers about the same time, sometimes more than 1.5 million individuals per [[acre]] (&gt;370/m¬≤).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dybas |first=H. S. |last2=Davis |first2=D.

The emergence period of large [[prime numbers]] (13 and 17 years) was hypothesized to be a predator avoidance strategy adopted to eliminate the possibility of potential predators receiving periodic population boosts by synchronizing their own generations to [[divisor]]s of the cicada emergence period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Goles |first=E. |last2=Schulz |first2=O. |last3=Markus |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=Prime number selection of cycles in a predator-prey model |journal=Complexity |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=33‚Äì38 |url= |doi=10.1002/cplx.1040|bibcode=2001Cmplx...6d..33G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another viewpoint holds that the prime-numbered developmental times represent an adaptation to prevent hybridization between broods with different cycles during a period of heavy selection pressure brought on by isolated and lowered populations during [[Interglacial#Interglacials during the Pleistocene|Pleistocene glacial stadia]], and that predator satiation is a short-term maintenance strategy.&lt;ref name="Cox, R.

===Impact on other populations===
Cycles in cicada populations are significant enough to affect other animal and plant populations. For example, tree growth has been observed to decline the year before the emergence of a brood, because of the increased feeding on roots by nymphs.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt; [[Mole (animal)|Moles]], which feed on nymphs, have been observed to do well during the year before an emergence, but suffer population declines the following year, because of the reduced food source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070530-cicadas-food.html National Geographic: Cicada Outbreaks Linked to Other Animals' Booms, Busts.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wild turkey]] populations respond favorably to increased nutrition in their food supply from gorging on cicada adults on the ground at the end of their lifecycles. Uneaten carcasses of periodic cicadas decompose on the ground, providing a resource pulse of nutrients to the forest community.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yang |first=Louie H. |year=2004 |title=Periodical cicadas as resource pulses in North American forests |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=306 |issue=5701 |pages=1565‚Äì1567 |url= |doi=10.1126/science.1103114 |pmid=15567865|bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1565Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicada broods may also have a negative impact. [[Eastern gray squirrel]] populations have been negatively affected, because the egg-laying activity of female cicadas damaged upcoming [[mast (botany)|mast]] crops.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Periodical cicadas are grouped into [[wikt:brood|broods]] based on the calendar year when they emerge (see chart below and maps on [http://www.magicicada.org www.magicicada.org]). For example, in 2014, the 13-year brood XXII emerged in Louisiana and the 17-year brood III emerged in western Illinois and eastern Iowa.

In 1898, [[entomologist]] [[Charles Lester Marlatt|C. L. Marlatt]] assigned Roman numerals to 30 different broods of periodical cicadas: 17 distinct broods with a 17-year lifecycle, to which he assigned brood numbers I through XVII (with emerging years 1893 through 1909); plus 13 broods with a 13-year cycle, to which he assigned brood numbers XVIII through XXX (1893 through 1905).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marlatt |first=C. L.|title=The Periodical Cicada (Bulletin No. 71 - U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Entomology)|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|year=1907|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CloDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these hypothetical 30 broods, however, have not been observed. Furthermore, two of the brood numbers assigned by Marlatt (broods XI and XXI) existed at one time, but have become extinct. The Marlatt numbering scheme has been retained for convenience (and because it clearly separates 13- and 17-year lifecycles), although today only 15 broods are known to survive.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web |last=Post |first=Susan L. |title=A Trill of a Lifetime |url=http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/highlights/periodicalCicada.html |year=2004 |publisher=The Illinois Steward |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510060933/http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/highlights/periodicalCicada.html |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Seven recognized species are placed within ''Magicicada''. Three of them follow a 17-year cycle:

* ''[[Magicicada septendecim|M. septendecim]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758)&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Magicicada cassini|M. cassinii]]'' &lt;small&gt;(Fisher, 1852)&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Magicicada septendecula|M. septendecula]]'' &lt;small&gt;&lt;!-- do not add parentheses --&gt;Alexander &amp; Moore, 1962&lt;/small&gt;

Four more species follow a 13-year cycle:

* ''[[Magicicada neotredecim|M. neotredecim]]'' &lt;small&gt;&lt;!-- do not add parentheses --&gt;Marshall &amp; Cooley, 2000&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Magicicada tredecim|M. tredecim]]'' &lt;small&gt;(Walsh &amp; Riley, 1868)&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Magicicada tredecassini|M. tredecassini]]'' &lt;small&gt;Alexander &amp; Moore, 1962&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Magicicada tredecula|M. tredecula]]'' &lt;small&gt;Alexander &amp; Moore, 1962&lt;/small&gt;

These seven species are also sometimes grouped differently into three subgroups, the so-called Decim species group, Cassini species group, and Decula species group, reflecting strong similarities of each 17-year species with one or more species with a 13-year cycle.&lt;ref name=ngspecies&gt;{{cite web|title=''Magicicada'' species|url=http://www.magicicada.org/about/species_pages/species.php|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/26301507 Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 5: 272-275].&lt;/ref&gt; with two 'i's, a large majority of publications have spelled the name ''cassini'' since the mid-1960s.

==Distribution==
The 17-year periodical cicadas are distributed across the eastern, upper midwestern, and Great Plains states within the U.S., while the 13-year cicadas occur in the southern and Mississippi Valley states, but some may overlap slightly. For example, Broods IV (17-year cycle) and XIX (13-year cycle) overlap in western Missouri and eastern Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.magicicada.org/about/brood_pages/broodIV.php brood IV distribution] with [http://www.magicicada.org/about/brood_pages/broodXIX.php brood XIX distribution]. From http://www.magicicada.org http://www.magicicada.org/about/brood_pages/broods.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon2009"&gt;See figure 1, p. 107, Cooley ''et al.'' [http://www.magicicada.org/cooley/reprints/Cooley_ea_2009.pdf The distribution of periodical cicadas.] American Entomologist, 55:2, 106-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Their emergences should again coincide in 2219, 2440, 2661, etc., as they did in 1998&lt;ref&gt;[http://advance.uconn.edu/2004/040426/04042611.htm Lifecycles Of Cicada Species Are Focus Of Biologist's Research], The UConn Advance, 4/26/2004, Elizabeth Omara-Otunnu&lt;/ref&gt; (although distributions change slightly from generation to generation and older distribution maps can be unreliable.&lt;ref name="Simon2009"/&gt;). An effort is currently underway to generate new distribution maps of all periodical cicada broods.  This effort makes use of crowdsourced records and records collected by entomologists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magicicada.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Not only are the periodical cicada lifecycles curious for their prime numbers 13 or 17, but also their evolution is intricately tied to one- and four-year changes in their lifecycles.&lt;ref name="Cox, R. T., and C. E. Carlton 1988 183‚Äì193"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox, R. T., and C. E. Carlton 1991 63‚Äì74"/&gt;  One-year changes are less common than four-year changes and are probably tied to variation in local climatic conditions.  Four-year early and late emergences are common and involve a much larger proportion of the population than one-year changes.

Recent research suggests, in extant periodical cicadas, the 13- and 17-year lifecycles evolved at least eight different times in the last 4 million years and that different species with identical lifecycles developed their overlapping geographic distribution by synchronization of lifecycle to existing dominant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Teiji Sota |author2=Satoshi Yamamoto |author3=John R. Cooley |author4=Kathy B. R. Hill |author5=Chris Simon |author6=Jin Yoshimura |year=2013 |title=Independent divergence of 13- and 17-y life cycles among three periodical cicada lineages |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=110 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1220060110  |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/15/1220060110 |accessdate=22 March 2013 |issue=2|bibcode = 2013PNAS..110.6919S |pages=6919‚Äì6924 |pmid=23509294 |pmc=3637745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study estimates that the Decim species group split from the common ancestor of the Decula plus Cassini species groups around 4 million years ago (Mya).  At around 2.5 Mya, the Cassini and Decula groups split from each other.

The Sota ''et al.'' (2013) paper also calculates that the first separation of extant 13-year cicadas from 17-year cicadas took place in the Decim group about 530,000 years ago when the southern ''M. tredecim'' split from the northern ''M. septendecim''. The second noteworthy event took place about 320,000 years ago with the split of the western Cassini group from its conspecifics to the east.  The Decim and the Decula clades experienced similar western splits, but these are estimated to have taken place 270,000 and 230,000 years ago, respectively. The 13- and 17-year splits in Cassini and Decula took place after these events.

The 17-year cicadas largely occupy formerly glaciated territory, and as a result their phylogeographic relationships, reflect the effects of repeated contraction into glacial refugia (small islands of suitable habitat) and subsequent re-expansion during multiple interglacial periods. In each species group, Decim, Cassini, and Decula, the signature of the glacial periods is manifested today in three phylogeographic genetic subdivisions: one subgroup east of the Appalachians, one midwestern, and one on the far western edge of their range.

The Sota ''et al.'' data suggest that the founders of the southern 13-year cicada populations seen today originated from the Decim group.  These were later joined by Cassini originating from the western Cassini clade and Decula originating from eastern, middle, and western Decula clades. As Cassini and Decula invaded the south, they became synchronized with the resident ''M. tredecim''.  Today, these Cassini and Decula are known as ''M. tredecassini'' and ''M. tredecula''. More data is needed to lend support to this hypothesis and others hypotheses related to more recent 13- and 17-year splits involving ''M. neotredecim'' and ''M. tredecim''.

{{quote|The general opinion is that these insects appear in these fantastic numbers in every seventeenth year. Meanwhile, except for an occasional one which may appear in the summer, they remain underground.

There is considerable evidence that these insects appear every seventeenth year in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;}}

Kalm then described documents (including one from [[Benjamin Franklin]]) that had recorded the emergence from the ground of large numbers of cicadas in Pennsylvania in May 1715 and May 1732. He noted that the people who had prepared these documents had made no such reports in other years.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; Kalm further noted that others had seen cicadas only occasionally before the large swarms of 1749.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; He stated that he had not heard any cicadas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1750 in the same months and areas in which he had heard many in 1749.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

Kalm summarized his findings in a paper translated into English in 1771,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalm |first=Peter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qG0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Travels into North America: Translated into English, By John Reinhold Foster |year=1771 |volume=2 |pages=212‚Äì213 |location=London |publisher=T.

Based on Kalm's account and a specimen that Kalm had provided, in 1758 [[Carl Linnaeus]] named the insect ''Cicada [[wiktionary:septendecim|septendecim]]'' in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition of his ''Systema Naturae'']].&lt;ref name=species/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Linnaei |first=Caroli |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/458/mode/1up |work=Systema Naturae Per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, Cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis |title=Insecta.

In 1766, Moses Bartram described in his ''Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years'' the next appearance of the brood that Kalm had observed in 1749. Bartram noted that upon hatching from eggs deposited in the twigs of trees, the young insects ran down to the earth and "entered the first opening that they could find". He reported that he had been able to discover them {{convert |10 |ft |m |0}} below the surface, but that others had reportedly found them {{convert |30 |ft |m |0}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartram |first=Moses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5lGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA103&amp;lpg=RA2-PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years.

In 1775, [[Thomas Jefferson]] recorded in his "Garden Book" the insect's 17-year periodicity, writing that an acquaintance remembered "great locust years" in 1724 and 1741, that he and others recalled another such year in 1754 and that the insects had again emerged from the ground at [[Monticello]] in 1775. He noted that the females lay their eggs in the small twigs of trees while above ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jefferson |first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Jefferson |title=Thomas Jefferson's garden book, 1766-1824, with relevant extracts from his other writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yngcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=great+locust+years|editor=Betts, Edward Morris|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] (1944)|journal=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society|volume=22|year=1775|oclc=602659598|lccn=45001776|page=68 |accessdate=2017-05-20|via=[[Google Books]]|quote=Dr. Walker sais he remembers that the years 1724 and 1741 were great locust years.Wee all remember that 1758 was and now they are come again this year of 1775.

In April 1800, [[Benjamin Banneker]], who lived near [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott's Mills]], Maryland, wrote in his record book that he recalled a "great locust year" in 1749, a second in 1766 during which the insects appeared to be "full as numerous as the first", and a third in 1783. He predicted that the insects "may be expected again in the year 1800, which is seventeen years since their third appearance to me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Latrobe |first=John H.

==Use as human food==
''Magicicada'' species are edible when cooked. They have historically been eaten by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who roasted them in hot ovens, stirring them until they were well browned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marlatt |first=C.

Charles Lester Marlatt wrote in 1907:

{{quote|The use of the newly emerged and succulent cicadas as an article of  human diet has merely a theoretical interest, because, if for no other  reason, they occur too rarely to have any real value. There is also the much stronger objection in the instinctive repugnance which all insects seem to inspire as an article of food to most civilized nations. Theoretically, the Cicada, collected at the proper time and suitably dressed and served, should be a rather attractive food. The larvae  have lived solely on vegetable matter of the cleanest and most whole-some sort, and supposedly, therefore, would be much more palatable and suitable for food than the oyster, with its scavenger habit of living in the muddy ooze of river bottoms, or many other animals which are highly prized and which have not half so clean a record as the periodical Cicada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marlatt |first=C.

'''Project Mercury''' was the first [[human spaceflight]] program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963.  An early highlight of the [[Space Race]], its goal was to put a man into Earth [[orbital spaceflight|orbit]] and return him safely, ideally before the [[Soviet Union]].  Taken over from the [[US Air Force]] by the newly created civilian space agency [[NASA]], it conducted twenty unmanned developmental flights (some using animals), and six successful flights by [[astronauts]]. The program, which took its name from [[Mercury (mythology)|Roman mythology]], cost ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1600000000|2018|r=2}}}} adjusted for [[inflation]].&lt;ref name="lafleur20100308"/&gt;{{refn|The project was delayed by 22 months, counting from the beginning until the first orbital mission.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=508}} It had a dozen prime contractors, 75 major subcontractors, and about 7200 third-tier subcontractors.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=508}} The cost estimate made by NASA in 1969 was $392.6 million, broken down as follows: Spacecraft: $135.3 million, launch vehicles: $82.9 million, operations: $49.3 million, tracking operations and equipment: $71.9 million and facilities: $53.2 million.{{sfn|Wilford|1969|p=67}}{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=643}}|group=n}} The astronauts were collectively known as the "[[Mercury Seven]]", and each spacecraft was given a name ending with a "7" by its pilot.

The Space Race began with the 1957 launch of the Soviet [[satellite]] [[Sputnik 1]].  This came as a shock to the American public, and led to the creation of NASA to expedite existing US space exploration efforts, and place most of them under civilian control. After the successful launch of the [[Explorer 1]] satellite in 1958, manned spaceflight became the next goal. The Soviet Union put the first human, [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]], into a single orbit aboard [[Vostok 1]] on April 12, 1961. Shortly after this,  on May 5, the US launched its first astronaut, [[Alan Shepard]], on a [[suborbital]] flight. Soviet [[Gherman Titov]] followed with a day-long orbital flight in August 1961.  The US reached its orbital goal on February 20, 1962, when [[John Glenn]] made three orbits around the Earth. When Mercury ended in May 1963, both nations had sent six people into space, but the Soviets led the US in total time spent in space.

The Mercury [[space capsule]] was produced by [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and carried supplies of water, food and oxygen for about one day in a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized cabin]]. Mercury flights were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida, on [[launch vehicle]]s modified from the [[Redstone MRLV|Redstone]] and [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas D]] missiles.  The capsule was fitted with a [[launch escape system|launch escape rocket]] to carry it safely away from the launch vehicle in case of a failure. The flight was designed to be controlled from the ground via the [[Manned Space Flight Network]], a system of tracking and communications stations; back-up controls were outfitted on board.  Small [[retrorocket]]s were used to bring the spacecraft out of its orbit, after which an [[ablative heat shield]] protected it from the heat of  [[atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]]. Finally, a [[parachute]] slowed the craft for a [[Splashdown|water landing]]. Both astronaut and capsule were recovered by helicopters deployed from a US Navy ship.

The Mercury project gained popularity, and its missions were followed by millions on radio and TV around the world.  Its success laid the groundwork for [[Project Gemini]], which carried two astronauts in each capsule and perfected space docking maneuvers essential for manned [[Moon landing|lunar landings]] in the subsequent [[Apollo program]] announced a few weeks after the first manned Mercury flight.

==Creation==
Project Mercury was officially approved on October 7, 1958 and publicly announced on December 17.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|p=12}}{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=132}} Originally called Project Astronaut, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] felt that gave too much attention to the pilot.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=92}} Instead, the name ''[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'' was chosen from [[classical mythology]], which had already lent names to rockets like the Greek ''[[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]'' and Roman ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'' for the [[SM-65 Atlas|SM-65]] and  [[PGM-19 Jupiter|PGM-19]] [[missiles]].{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=132}} It absorbed military projects with the same aim, such as the Air Force [[Man In Space Soonest]].{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=102}}{{refn|Man in Space Soonest was the first part of a four-phase Moon landing program estimated to finish in 1965, cost a total of $1.5 billion (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1500000000|1959|r=1}}}} adjusted for inflation), and be launched by a "Super Titan" rocket.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=91}}|group=n}}

=== Background ===
Following the end of [[World War II]], a [[nuclear arms race]] evolved between the US and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR). Since the USSR did not have bases in the western hemisphere from which to deploy  [[bomber|bomber planes]], [[Joseph Stalin]] decided to develop [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, which drove a missile race.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=12-14}} The rocket technology in turn enabled both sides to develop Earth-orbiting satellites for communications, and gathering weather data and [[geospatial intelligence|intelligence]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=81}} Americans were shocked when the Soviet Union placed the first satellite into orbit in October 1957, leading to a growing fear that the US was falling into a "[[missile gap]]".{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=28, 52}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=81}}  A month later, the Soviets launched [[Sputnik 2]], carrying a dog into orbit. Though the animal was not recovered alive, it was obvious their goal was manned spaceflight.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=55}} Unable to disclose details of military space projects, President Eisenhower ordered the creation of a civilian space agency in charge of civilian and scientific space exploration. Based on the  federal research agency [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), it was named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=113}} It achieved its first goal, an American satellite in space, in 1958. The next goal was to put a man there.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=57, 82}}

The limit of space was defined at the time as a minimum altitude of {{convert|62|mi|abbr=on}}, and the only way to reach it was by using rocket-powered boosters.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=70}}{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=13}} This created risks for the pilot, including explosion, high [[g-force]]s and vibrations during lift off through a dense atmosphere,{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=44}} and temperatures of more than {{convert|10,000|¬∞F|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from air compression during reentry.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=59}}

In space, pilots would require  pressurized chambers or [[space suits]] to supply fresh air.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=466}}  While there, they would experience [[weightlessness]], which could potentially cause disorientation.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=357}} Further potential risks included [[space radiation|radiation]] and [[micrometeoroid]] strikes, both of which would normally be absorbed in the atmosphere.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=35, 39‚Äì40}}  All seemed possible to overcome: experience from satellites suggested micrometeoroid risk was negligible,{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=49}} and experiments in the early 1950s with simulated weightlessness, high g-forces on humans, and sending animals to the limit of space, all suggested potential problems could be overcome by known technologies.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=37-38}} Finally, reentry was studied using the nuclear warheads of ballistic missiles,{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=61}} which demonstrated a blunt, forward-facing heat shield could solve the problem of heating.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=61}}

===Organization===
[[T. Keith Glennan]] had been appointed the first Administrator of NASA, with [[Hugh L. Dryden]] (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at the creation of the agency on October 1, 1958.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=98‚Äì99}} Glennan would report to the president through the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics and Space Council]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=82}} The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA's [[Space Task Group]], and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=xiii, 134}} Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=134}} Spacecraft requirements included: a [[launch escape system]] to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the [[launch vehicle]] in case of impending failure; [[attitude control]] for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a [[retrorocket]] system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking [[Blunt Body theory|blunt body]] for [[atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]]; and landing on water.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=134}} To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=143}} In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the US space program an overly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the [[Defense Production Act]]), which meant that Mercury had to wait in line behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, a little more than a year and a half after Sputnik was launched.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=157}}

===Contractors and facilities===

Twelve companies bid to build the Mercury spacecraft on a $20 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|20000000|1959|r=-2}}}} adjusted for inflation) contract.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=121, 191}} In January 1959, [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Corporation]] was chosen to be prime contractor for the spacecraft.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=137}} Two weeks earlier, [[North American Aviation]], based in Los Angeles, was awarded a contract for [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]], a small rocket to be used for development of the launch escape system.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=124}}{{refn|group=n|The name ''Little Joe'' was adopted by its designers from the throw of a double deuce in a [[craps]] game since this resembled the four-rocket arrangement in the blueprints for the vehicle.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=124}}}} The World Wide Tracking Network for communication between the ground and spacecraft during a flight was awarded to the Western Electric Company.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=216}} Redstone rockets for suborbital launches were manufactured in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], Alabama by the [[Chrysler Corporation]]{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=21}} and Atlas rockets by [[Convair]] in San Diego, California.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=158}} For manned launches, the [[Atlantic Missile Range]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida was made available by the USAF.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=89‚Äì90}} This was also the site of the Mercury Control Center while the computing center of the communication network was in [[Goddard Space Center]], Maryland.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=86}} Little Joe rockets were launched from [[Wallops Island]], Virginia.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=141}} Astronaut training took place at [[Langley Research Center]] in Virginia, [[Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] in Cleveland, Ohio, and [[Naval Air Development Center|Naval Air Development Center Johnsville]] in Warminster, PA.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=103-110}} Langley wind tunnels{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=88}} together with a rocket sled track at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] at Alamogordo, New Mexico were used for aerodynamic studies.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=248}} Both Navy and Air Force aircraft were made available for the development of the spacecraft's landing system,{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=172-173}} and Navy ships and Navy and Marine Corps helicopters were made available for recovery.{{refn|NASA's planning for recovery operations in the summer of 1960 was, according to the Navy, asking for the deployment of the whole Atlantic Fleet and might have cost more than the entire Mercury program.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=265}}|group=n}} South of Cape Canaveral the town of [[Cocoa Beach]] boomed.&lt;ref name="CocoaBeach" /&gt; From here, 75,000 people watched the first American orbital flight being launched in 1962.&lt;ref name="CocoaBeach" /&gt;

== Spacecraft ==
The Mercury spacecraft's principal designer was [[Maxime Faget]], who started research for manned spaceflight during the time of the NACA.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=150}} It was {{convert|10.8|ft}} long and {{convert|6.0|ft}} wide; with the launch escape system added, the overall length was {{convert|25.9|ft}}.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=131}} With {{convert|100|ft3|m3}} of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for a single crew member.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=47}} Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and 35 mechanical levers.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=245}} The heaviest spacecraft, Mercury-Atlas 9, weighed {{convert|3000|lb}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=490}} Its outer skin was made of [[Ren√© 41]], a nickel alloy able to withstand high temperatures.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=136}}

The spacecraft was cone shaped, with a neck at the narrow end.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=131}} It had a convex base, which carried a heat shield (Item '''2''' in the diagram below){{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=134‚Äì136}} consisting of an aluminum [[honeycomb structure|honeycomb]] covered with multiple layers of [[fiberglass]].{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=140, 143}} Strapped to it was a retropack ('''1'''){{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=132‚Äì134}} consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=132}} Between these were three minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=188}} The straps that held the package could be severed when it was no longer needed.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=134}} Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment ('''3''').{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=136‚Äì144}} Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments in front of him and with his back to the heat shield.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=136-137}} Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat,{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=138}} scrubbing the air of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=139}}{{refn|group=n|On the first suborbital flight there was no urine collection whereas on the other, the astronaut had a reservoir added to the space suit{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=368}}}} The recovery compartment ('''4'''){{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=144‚Äì145}} at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: a drogue to stabilize free fall and two main chutes, a primary and reserve.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=144}} Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=135}} On top of the recovery compartment was the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] section ('''5'''){{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=145‚Äì148}} containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=147}} Attached was a flap used to ensure  the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=199}} A launch escape system ('''6''') was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=179‚Äì181}} containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule's parachute for a landing nearby at sea.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=179}} (See also [[#Mission profile|Mission profile]] for details.)

The Mercury spacecraft did not have an on-board computer, instead relying on all computation for reentry to be calculated by computers on the ground, with their results (retrofire times and firing attitude) then transmitted to the spacecraft by radio while in flight.&lt;ref name="NASAComp1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DanCompSpace" /&gt; All computer systems used in the Mercury space program were housed in [[NASA]] facilities on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NASAComp1" /&gt; The computer systems were [[IBM 701]] computers.&lt;ref name="IBMArchSpace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM701" /&gt; (See also [[#Ground control|Ground control]] for details.)

===Pilot accommodations===
[[File:GPN-2000-001027.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Glenn]] wearing his Mercury space suit]]

The astronaut lay in a sitting position with his back to the heat shield, which was found to be the position that best enabled a human to withstand the high [[g-force]]s of launch and reentry. A fiberglass seat was custom-molded from each astronaut's space-suited body for maximum support. Near his left hand was a manual abort handle to activate the launch escape system if necessary  prior to or during liftoff, in case the automatic trigger failed.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=142}}

To supplement the onboard environmental control system, he wore a [[pressure suit]] with its own [[oxygen]] supply, which would also cool him.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=191}} A cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at a low pressure of 5.5 psi (equivalent to an altitude of {{convert|24800|ft}}) was chosen, rather than one with the same composition as air ([[nitrogen]]/oxygen) at sea level.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=264}} This was easier to control,{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=410}} avoided the risk of [[decompression sickness]] ("the bends"),{{sfn|Giblin|1998|p=}}{{refn|group=n|The decision to eliminate the use of any gas but oxygen was crystalized when a serious accident occurred on April 21, 1960, in which McDonnell Aircraft test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin/spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber. The problem was found to be nitrogen-rich (oxygen-poor) air leaking from the cabin into his spacesuit feed.{{sfn|Giblin|1998|p=}}}} and also saved on spacecraft weight. Fires (which never occurred) would have to be extinguished by emptying the cabin of oxygen.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=139}} In such case, or failure of the cabin pressure for any reason, the astronaut could make an emergency return to Earth, relying on his suit for survival.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=48‚Äì49}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=139}} The astronauts normally flew with their [[visor]] up, which meant that the suit was not inflated.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=139}} With the visor down and the suit inflated, the astronaut could only reach the side and bottom panels, where vital buttons and handles were placed.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=246}}

The astronaut also wore [[electrodes]] on his chest to record his [[heart rhythm]], a cuff that could take his blood pressure, and a [[Medical thermometer|rectal thermometer]] to record his temperature (this was replaced by an oral thermometer on the last flight).{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=191, 194}} Data from these was sent to the ground during the flight.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=191}} The astronaut normally drank water and ate food pellets.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=343-344}}{{refn|group=n|Moisture and urine was reclycled into drinking water.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=47}}}}

Once in orbit, the spacecraft could be rotated in three directions: along its longitudinal axis (roll), left to right from the astronaut's point of view (yaw), and up or down (pitch).{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=142‚Äì143}} Movement was created by [[Rocket engine|rocket-propelled]] thrusters which used [[hydrogen peroxide]] as a fuel.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=499}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=143}} For orientation, the pilot could look through the window in front of him or he could look at a screen connected to a [[periscope]] with a camera which could be turned 360¬∞.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=141}}

The Mercury astronauts had taken part in the development of their spacecraft, and insisted that manual control, and a window, be elements of its design.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=98‚Äì99}} As a result, spacecraft movement and other functions could be controlled three ways: remotely from the ground when passing over a ground station, automatically guided by onboard instruments, or manually by the astronaut, who could replace or override the two other methods. Experience validated the astronauts' insistence on manual controls.  Without them, Gordon Cooper's manual reentry during the last flight would not have been possible.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=501}}

===Development and production===
[[File:Technicians working in the McDonnell White Room on the Mercury-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Spacecraft production in clean room at [[McDonnell Aircraft]], St. Louis, 1960]]
The Mercury spacecraft design was modified three times by NASA between 1958 and 1959.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=152}} After bidding by potential contractors had been completed, NASA selected the design submitted as "C" in November 1958.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=153}} After it failed a test flight in July 1959, a final configuration, "D", emerged.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=159}} The heat shield shape had been developed earlier in the 1950s through experiments with ballistic missiles, which had shown a blunt profile would create a shock wave that would lead most of the heat around the spacecraft.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=149}} To further protect against heat, either a [[heat sink]], or an ablative material, could be added to the shield.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=63}} The heat sink would remove heat by the flow of the air inside the shock wave, whereas the ablative heat shield would remove heat by a controlled evaporation of the ablative material.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=64}} After unmanned tests, the latter was chosen for manned flights.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=206}} Apart from the capsule design, a [[rocket plane]] similar to the existing [[X-15]] was considered.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=78-80}} This approach was still too far from being able to make a spaceflight, and was consequently dropped.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=72}}{{refn|group=n|The rocket plane approach to manned space flight was pursued by the Air Force with their [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|Dyna-Soar]] project, which was canceled in 1963{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=425, 428}} Toward the end of the 1960s, NASA began the development of a reusable space plane, which was ultimately developed into the [[Space Shuttle]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to future launch vehicle plans [1963-2001]. 3.The Space Shuttle (1968-72)|url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld001.htm|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rocket plane to enter space was an X-15 in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Steve|title=X - 15 Hypersonic Research  at the Edge of Space|url=https://history.nasa.gov/x15/cover.html|website=NASA History Homepage|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The heat shield and the stability of the spacecraft were tested in [[supersonic wind tunnel|wind tunnels]],{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=88}} and later in flight.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=229}} The launch escape system was developed through unmanned flights.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=196}} During a period of problems with development of the landing parachutes, alternative landing systems such as the [[Rogallo wing|Rogallo glider wing]] were considered, but ultimately scrapped.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=198}}

The spacecraft were produced at [[McDonnell Aircraft]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri in clean rooms and tested in vacuum chambers at the McDonnell plant.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=132, 159}} The spacecraft had close to 600 subcontractors, such as [[Garrett AiResearch]] which built the spacecraft's environmental control system.{{sfn| Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=137}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=138}} Final quality control and preparations of the spacecraft were made at Hangar S at Cape Canaveral.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=184-188}}{{refn|Test and rework of Mercury-Redstone 2 at the Hangar required 110 days.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=310}} Hangar S was also the place where the chimpanzees were trained.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=312}}|group=n}} NASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=137}} Five of the 20, Nos. 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|pp=235‚Äì238}} Spacecraft No. 3 and No. 4 were destroyed during unmanned test flights.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|pp=235‚Äì238}} Spacecraft No. 11 sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|pp=235‚Äì238}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=402‚Äì405}} Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.).{{refn|They received a letter designation after their number, examples 2B, 15B.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|pp=216-218}} Some were modified twice; for example, spacecraft 15 became 15A and then 15B.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|p=149}}|group=n}} A number of Mercury [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate spacecraft]] (made from non-flight materials or lacking production spacecraft systems) were also made by NASA and McDonnell.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=126 &amp; 138}} They were designed and used to test spacecraft recovery systems and the escape tower.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=96, 105}} McDonnell also built the spacecraft simulators used by the astronauts during training.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=107}}

==Launch vehicles==
[[File:Mercury-launch-vehicles.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Launch vehicles: 1. Mercury-Atlas (orbital flights). 2. Mercury-Redstone (suborbital flights). 3. Little Joe (unmanned tests)]]

===Launch escape system testing===
A small launch vehicle ({{convert|55|ft}} long) called [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]] was used for unmanned tests of the launch escape system, using a Mercury capsule with an escape tower mounted on it.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=638}} Its main purpose was to test the system at a point called max-q, at which air pressure against the spacecraft peaked, making separation of the launch vehicle and spacecraft most difficult.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=223}} It was also the point at which the astronaut was subjected to the heaviest vibrations.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=284}} The Little Joe rocket used [[solid-fuel rocket|solid-fuel]] propellant and was originally designed in 1958 by the NACA for suborbital manned flights, but was redesigned for Project Mercury to simulate an Atlas-D launch.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=196}} It was produced by [[North American Aviation]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=197}} It was not able to change direction; instead its flight depended on the angle from which it was launched.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=198}} Its maximum altitude was {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=125}} A [[Mercury-Scout 1|Scout launch vehicle]] was used for a single flight intended to evaluate the tracking network; however, it failed and was destroyed from the ground shortly after launch.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=392‚Äì397}}

===Suborbital flight===
The [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]], an {{convert|83|ft|adj=on}} tall (with capsule and escape system) single-stage launch vehicle used for suborbital ([[ballistic missile|ballistic]]) flights.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=206}} It had a liquid-fueled engine that burned alcohol and liquid oxygen producing about 75,000 pounds of thrust, which was not enough for orbital missions.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=206}} It was a descendant of the German [[V-2 (rocket)|V-2]],{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=21}} and developed for the [[U.S. Army]] during the early 1950s. It was modified for Project Mercury by removing the warhead and adding a collar for supporting the spacecraft together with material for damping vibrations during launch.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=207}} Its rocket motor was produced by [[North American Aviation]] and its direction could be altered during flight by its fins. They worked in two ways: by directing the air around them, or by directing the thrust by their inner parts (or both at the same time).{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=21}} Both the Atlas-D and Redstone launch vehicles contained an automatic abort sensing system which allowed them to abort a launch by firing the launch escape system if something went wrong.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=209, 214}} The [[Mercury-Jupiter|Jupiter]] rocket, also developed by Von Braun's team at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, was considered as well for intermediate Mercury suborbital flights at a higher speed and altitude than Redstone, but this plan was dropped when it turned out that man-rating Jupiter for the Mercury program would actually cost more than flying an Atlas due to economics of scale.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=151}}{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|p=69}} Jupiter's only use other than as a missile system was for the short-lived [[Juno II]] launch vehicle and keeping a full staff of technical personnel around solely to fly a few Mercury capsules would result in excessively high costs.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Orbital flight===
Orbital missions required use of the [[Atlas LV-3B]], a man-rated version of the [[SM-65D Atlas|Atlas D]] which was originally developed as the [[United States]]' first operational [[intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)]]{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=211}} by [[Convair]] for the Air Force during the mid-1950s.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=22}} The Atlas was a "one-and-one-half-stage" rocket fueled by [[kerosene]] and liquid [[oxygen]] (LOX).{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=211}} The rocket by itself stood {{convert|67|ft}} high; total height of the Atlas-Mercury space vehicle at launch was {{convert|95|ft}}.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=212}}

The Atlas first stage was a booster skirt with two engines burning liquid fuel.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=225, 250}}{{refn|group=n|At the time word booster was sometimes used for the first stage of the launch stack. Later the word booster came to refer to additional single-stage rockets attached to the sides of the main launch vehicle, as in Space Shuttle boosters.}} This together with the larger sustainer second stage gave it sufficient power to launch a Mercury spacecraft into orbit.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=211}} Both stages fired from lift-off with the thrust from the second stage sustainer engine passing through an opening in the first stage. After separation from the first stage, the sustainer stage continued alone. The sustainer also steered the rocket by thrusters guided by gyroscopes.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=458-459}} Smaller vernier rockets were added on its sides for precise control of maneuvers.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=211}}

Shepard became the first American in space by making a suborbital flight in May 1961.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=341}} He went on to fly in the Apollo program and became the [[Apollo 14|only Mercury astronaut to walk on the Moon]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=445}} Gus Grissom, who became the second American in space, also participated in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a pre-launch test for [[Apollo 1]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=442}} Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, then quit NASA and went into politics, serving as a US Senator from 1974 to 1999, and returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard [[STS-95]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=440,441}} Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962, but remained with NASA and was appointed Chief Astronaut at the beginning of [[Project Gemini]]. He remained in the position of senior astronaut, in charge of space crew flight assignments among many other responsibilities, until towards the end of [[Project Apollo]], when he resigned and began training to fly on the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975, which he successfully did.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=446-447}} Gordon Cooper became the last to fly in Mercury and made its longest flight, and also flew a Gemini mission.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=640‚Äì641}} Carpenter's Mercury flight was his only trip into space. Schirra flew the third orbital Mercury mission, and then flew a Gemini mission. Three years later, he commanded the first manned Apollo mission, becoming the only person to fly in all three of those programs.

One of the astronauts' tasks was publicity; they gave interviews to the press and visited project manufacturing facilities to speak with those who worked on Project Mercury.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=99}} To make their travels easier, they requested and got jet fighters for personal use.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=104}} The press was especially fond of John Glenn, who was considered the best speaker of the seven.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=96}} They sold their personal stories to [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine which portrayed them as patriotic, God-fearing family men.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=100}} ''Life'' was also allowed to be at home with the families while the astronauts were in space.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=100}} During the project, Grissom, Carpenter, Cooper, Schirra and Slayton stayed with their families at or near Langley Air Force Base; Glenn lived at the base and visited his family in Washington DC on weekends. Shepard lived with his family at [[Naval Air Station Oceana]] in Virginia.

Other than Grissom, who was killed in the 1967 [[Apollo 1]] fire, the other six survived past retirement{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=97}} and died between 1993 and 2016.

===Selection and training===
Prior to Project Mercury, there was no protocol for selecting astronauts so NASA would set a far reaching precedent with both their selection process and initial choices for astronaut. At the end of 1958, various ideas for the selection pool were discussed privately within the national government and the civilian space program, and also among the public at large. Initially, there was the idea to issue a widespread public call to volunteers. Thrill seekers such as rock climbers and acrobats would have been allowed to apply but this idea was quickly shot down by NASA officials who understood that an undertaking such as space flight required individuals with professional training and education in flight engineering. By late 1958, NASA officials decided to move forward with test pilots being the heart of their selection pool. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunbar|first1=Brian|title=Project Mercury Overview -- Astronaut Selection|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mercury/missions/summary.html|website=nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On President Eisenhower's insistence, the group was further narrowed down to active duty military [[test pilot]]s, which set the number of candidates at 508 men.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=160‚Äì161}} who were either [[USN]] or [[USMC]] [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviation pilots]] (NAPs), or [[USAF]] [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating#USAF rating requirements|pilots of Senior or Command rating]]. These men had long military records which would give NASA officials more background information to base their decisions on. Furthermore, these men were adept at flying the most advanced aircraft to date, giving them the best qualifications for the new position of astronaut. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunbar|first1=Brian|title=Project Mercury Overview -- Astronaut Selection|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mercury/missions/summary.html|website=nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this selection excluded women since there were no female military test pilots at the time.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=92}} It also excluded civilian NASA [[X-15]] pilot [[Neil Armstrong]], though he had been selected by the US Air Force in 1958 for its [[Man In Space Soonest]] program, which was replaced by Mercury.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=173}} Although Armstrong had been a combat-experienced NAP during the Korean War, he left active duty in 1952.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=92}}{{refn|group=n|Armstrong left the Navy as a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant, Junior Grade]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|US Naval Reserve]], until resigning his commission 1960.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=118}}}} Armstrong became NASA's first civilian astronaut in 1962 when he was selected for NASA's second group,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=201‚Äì202}} and [[Apollo 11|became the first man on the Moon]] in 1969.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=17}}

It was further stipulated that candidates should be between 25 and 40 years old, no taller than {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, and hold a college degree in a [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subject.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=92}} The college degree requirement excluded the USAF's [[Bell X-1|X-1]] pilot, then-Lt Col (later Brig Gen) [[Chuck Yeager]], the first person to exceed the [[speed of sound]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=92‚Äì93}} He later became a critic of the project, ridiculing the civilian space program, labeling astronauts as "spam in a can." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cloer|first1=Dan|title=Alan B. Shepard, Jr.: Spam in a Can?|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography/alan-b-shepard/17449.aspx|website=vision.org|publisher=Vision|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Glenn did not have a college degree either, but used influential friends to make the selection committee accept him.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=440}} USAF Capt (later Col) [[Joseph Kittinger]], a USAF fighter pilot and stratosphere balloonist, met all the requirements but preferred to stay in his contemporary project.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=92‚Äì93}} Other potential candidates declined because they did not believe that manned spaceflight had a future beyond Project Mercury.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=92‚Äì93}}{{refn|At the beginning of the project both President Eisenhower and NASA's first administrator T.

Work Physiology. Archives of Environmental Health. 8(3): 427-436.&lt;/ref&gt; In a special chamber, they were tested to see if they could perform their tasks under confusing conditions.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=98}} The candidates had to answer more than 500 questions about themselves and describe what they saw in different images.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=98}} Navy Lt (later Capt) [[Jim Lovell]], who was later an astronaut in the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program]]s, did not pass the physical tests.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=92‚Äì93}} After these tests it was intended to narrow the group down to six astronauts, but in the end it was decided to keep seven.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=94}}

The astronauts went through a training program covering some of the same exercises that were used in their selection.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=103-110}} They simulated the g-force profiles of launch and reentry in a centrifuge at the Naval Air Development Center, and were taught special breathing techniques necessary when subjected to more than 6 g.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=104}} Weightlessness training took place in aircraft, first on the rear seat of a two-seater fighter and later inside converted and padded [[cargo aircraft]].{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=105}} They practiced gaining control of a spinning spacecraft in a machine at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory called the Multi-Axis Spin-Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF), by using an [[attitude control]]ler handle simulating the one in the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Gimbal Rig Mercury Astronaut Trainer | publisher =NASA| date =9 June 2008| url =http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/mastif.html#.VIy1TnvAuJw|accessdate = 13 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube| M3m5npzgVLY | "Gimbal Rig" }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further measure for finding the right attitude in orbit was star and Earth recognition training in planetaria and simulators.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=105, 109}} Communication and flight procedures were practiced in flight simulators, first together with a single person assisting them and later with the Mission Control Center.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=111}} Recovery was practiced in pools at Langley, and later at sea with frogmen and helicopter crews.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=346}}

[[File:Launch-complex-14.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Launch Complex 14 just before launch (service tower rolled aside). Preparations for launch were made in the blockhouse.]]

Preparations for a mission started a month in advance with the selection of the primary and back-up astronaut; they would practice together for the mission.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=110}} For three days prior to launch, the astronaut went through a special diet to minimize his need for [[defecation|defecating]] during the flight.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=278}} On the morning of the trip he typically ate a steak breakfast.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=278}} After having sensors applied to his body and being dressed in the pressure suit, he started breathing pure oxygen to prepare him for the atmosphere of the spacecraft.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=280}} He arrived at the launch pad, took the elevator up the launch tower and entered the spacecraft two hours before launch.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=188}}{{refn|group=n|Inside the spacecraft the other astronauts had usually prepared a practical joke, such as a sign saying "No handball playing".{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=281}}}} Once the astronaut was secured inside, the hatch was bolted, the launch area evacuated and the mobile tower rolled back.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=281}} After this, the launch vehicle was filled with liquid oxygen.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=281}} The entire procedure of preparing for launch and launching the spacecraft followed a time table called the countdown. It started a day in advance with a pre-count, in which all systems of the launch vehicle and spacecraft were checked. After that followed a 15-hour hold, during which pyrotechnics were installed. Then came the main countdown which for orbital flights started 6¬Ω hours before launch (T ‚Äì 390 min), counted backwards to launch (T = 0) and then forward until orbital insertion (T + 5 min).{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=188}}{{refn|group=n|Countdown was controlled from the blockhouse at the Launch Complex until 2 min. before launch then it was transferred to Mission Control Center.

On an orbital mission, the Atlas' rocket engines were ignited four seconds before lift-off. The launch vehicle was held to the ground by clamps and then released when sufficient thrust was built up at lift-off ('''A''').{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=188, 242}} After 30 seconds of flight, the point of maximum [[dynamic pressure]] against the vehicle was reached, at which the astronaut felt heavy vibrations.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=340}} After 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the two outboard booster engines shut down and were released with the aft skirt, leaving the center sustainer engine running ('''B''').{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=188}} At this point, the launch escape system was no longer needed, and was separated from the spacecraft by its jettison rocket ('''C''').{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=132}}{{refn|In the event of a launch abort before this point, the launch escape system would fire its main rocket for one second, pulling the spacecraft and astronaut away from the launch vehicle and a possible explosion.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=179}} At this point, the spacecraft could be separated from the launch vehicle and land using its parachute.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=180}}|group=n}} The space vehicle moved gradually to a horizontal attitude until, at an altitude of {{convert|87|nmi|km|sp=us}}, the sustainer engine shut down and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit ('''D''').{{sfn|Unknown|1962|p=46}} This happened after 5 minutes and 10 seconds in a direction pointing east, whereby the spacecraft would gain speed from the rotation of the Earth.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=188, 460}}{{refn|group=n|The direction of insertion was east and slightly to the north, this meant that on at three orbit flight the tracking network was used best possible and a landing could take place in the North Atlantic Ocean.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=215}}}} Here the spacecraft fired the three posigrade rockets for a second to separate it from the launch vehicle.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=133}}{{refn|The sustainer would disintegrate and fall down; after the launch of ''Friendship 7'' a part of the sustainer was found in South Africa.{{sfn|Grimwood|1963|p=164}}|group=n}} Just before orbital insertion and sustainer engine cutoff, g-loads peaked at 8 g (6 g for a suborbital flight).{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=340}}{{sfn|Unknown|1961|p=10}} In orbit, the spacecraft automatically turned 180¬∞, pointed the retropackage forward and its nose 14.5¬∞ downward and kept this attitude for the rest of the orbital phase of the mission, as it was necessary for communication with the ground.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=333}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=120}}{{refn|group=n|The capsule's tendency to drift was countered automatically by the attitude control system (ASCS) which used small hydrogen peroxide thrusters.

Once in orbit, it was not possible for the spacecraft to change its [[trajectory]] except by initiating reentry.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=462}} Each orbit would typically take 88 minutes to complete.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=324}} The lowest point of the orbit, called [[perigee]], was at about {{convert|87|nmi|km|sp=us}} altitude, and the highest point, called [[apogee]], was about {{convert|150|nmi|km|sp=us}} altitude.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=475}} When leaving orbit ('''E'''), the angle of retrofire was 34¬∞ downward from the flight path angle.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=333}} Retrorockets fired for 10 seconds each ('''F''') in a sequence where one started 5 seconds after the other.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=133}}{{sfn|Unknown|1961|p=9}} During reentry ('''G'''), the astronaut would experience about 8 g (11‚Äì12 g on a suborbital mission).{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=574}} The temperature around the heat shield rose to {{convert|3,000|¬∞F|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and at the same time, there was a two-minute radio blackout due to [[ionization]] of the air around the spacecraft.{{sfn|Unknown|1962|p=9}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=134}}

After reentry, a small, drogue parachute ('''H''') was deployed at {{convert|21,000|ft|abbr=on}} for stabilizing the spacecraft's descent.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=147}} The main parachute ('''I''') was deployed at {{convert|10,000|ft|abbr=on}} starting with a narrow opening that opened fully in a few seconds to lessen the strain on the lines.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=356}} Just before hitting the water, the landing bag inflated from behind the heat shield to reduce the force of impact ('''J''').{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=356}} Upon landing the parachutes were released.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=144}} An antenna ('''K''') was raised and sent out signals that could be traced by ships and [[helicopter]]s.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=144}} Further, a green marker dye was spread around the spacecraft to make its location more visible from the air.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=144}}{{refn|group=n|[[Radar chaff]] and a [[SOFAR bomb]] which could be detected by the recovery ship's [[hydrophone]] were eliminated as unnecessary measures after the first orbital flight.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=445}}}} [[Frogmen]] brought in by helicopters inflated a collar around the craft to keep it upright in the water.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=166}}{{refn|group=n|The collar was not ready for suborbital missions.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=166}}}} The recovery helicopter hooked onto the spacecraft and the astronaut blew the escape hatch to exit the capsule.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|pp=144‚Äì145}} He was then hoisted aboard the helicopter that finally brought both him and the spacecraft to the ship.{{refn|It was also possible to exit the capsule through the nose cylinder; only Carpenter did this.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=143}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=147}} | group=n}}

All of the six manned Mercury flights were successful, though some planned flights were canceled during the project (see below).{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=640-641}} The main medical problems encountered were simple personal [[hygiene]], and post-flight [[orthostatic hypotension|symptoms of low blood pressure]].{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=508}} The launch vehicles had been tested through unmanned flights, therefore the numbering of manned missions did not start with 1.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=638-641}} Also, there were two separately numbered series: MR for "Mercury-Redstone" (suborbital flights), and MA for "Mercury-Atlas" (orbital flights). These names were not popularly used, since the astronauts followed a pilot tradition, each giving their spacecraft a name. They selected names ending with a "7" to commemorate the seven astronauts.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=132}}{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=640}} Times given are [[UTC|Universal Coordinated Time]], local time + 5 hours.

===Unmanned===
The 20 unmanned flights used Little Joe, Redstone, and Atlas launch vehicles.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=640}} They were used to develop the launch vehicles, launch escape system, spacecraft and tracking network.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|pp=638-641}} One flight of a [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout rocket]] attempted to launch an unmanned satellite for testing the ground tracking network, but failed to reach orbit.  The Little Joe program used seven airframes for eight flights, of which three were successful. The second Little Joe flight was named Little Joe 6, because it was inserted into the program after the first 5 airframes had been allocated.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=231}}{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=278}}

Today the Mercury program is commemorated as the first manned American space program.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=cover}} It did not win the race against the Soviet Union, but gave back national prestige and was scientifically a successful precursor of later programs such as Gemini, Apollo and Skylab.{{sfn|Catchpole|2001|p=417}}{{refn|International rules required that a pilot must land safely with the spacecraft; in reality, Gagarin landed separately by parachute; however, the Soviet Union did not admit this until 1971 when their claim was no longer in danger of being challenged.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2000|p=283}}|group=n}}

During the 1950s, some experts doubted that manned spaceflight was possible.{{refn|In May 1957, five months before Sputnik I, the president of McDonnell, the later prime contractor, predicted that manned spaceflight would not take place before 1990.{{sfn|Alexander &amp; al.|1966|p=119}}|group=n}} Still when [[John F.

'''Q.E.D.''' (also written QED and in italics: ''QED'') is an [[initialism]] of the [[List of Latin phrases (full)|Latin phrase]] {{lang|la|'''"quod erat demonstrandum"'''}} meaning "what was to be demonstrated" or "what was to be shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quod%20erat%20demonstrandum|title=Definition of QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some may also use a less direct translation instead: "thus it has been demonstrated." Traditionally, the phrase is placed in its abbreviated form at the end of a [[mathematical proof]] or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Logical argument|argument]] when the original proposition has been restated exactly, as the conclusion of the demonstration or completion of the proof.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Euclid's Elements translated from Greek by Thomas L. Heath. 2003 Green Lion Press pg. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and early use ==
The phrase, ''quod erat demonstrandum'', is a translation into [[List of Latin phrases|Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|·ΩÖœÄŒµœÅ ·ºîŒ¥ŒµŒπ Œ¥Œµ·øñŒæŒ±Œπ}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|hoper edei deixai}}; abbreviated as ''ŒüŒïŒî''). Translating from the Latin into English yields, "what was to be demonstrated", however, translating the Greek phrase {{lang|grc|·ΩÖœÄŒµœÅ ·ºîŒ¥ŒµŒπ Œ¥Œµ·øñŒæŒ±Œπ}} produces a slightly different meaning. Since the verb {{lang|grc|"Œ¥ŒµŒØŒ∫ŒΩœÖŒºŒπ"}} also means ''to show'' or ''to prove'',&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddei%2Fknumi Œ¥ŒµŒØŒ∫ŒΩœÖŒºŒπ] at [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt; a better translation from the Greek would read, "The very thing it was required to have shown."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The Greek phrase was used by many early Greek mathematicians, including [[Euclid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Euc.+2&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0085 Elements 2.5] by Euclid (ed. J. L. Heiberg), retrieved 16 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Archimedes]].

During the European [[Renaissance]], scholars often wrote in Latin, and phrases such as ''Q.E.D.'' were often used to conclude proofs.

[[File:Spinoza Ethica Pars1 Prop1.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s original text of ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part 1,  ''Q.E.D.'' is used at the end of ''Demonstratio'' of ''Propositio III'' on the right hand page]]
Perhaps the most famous use of ''Q.E.D.'' in a philosophical argument is found in the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in 1677. Written in Latin, it is considered by many to be Spinoza's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. The style and system of the book are, as Spinoza says, "demonstrated in [[Geometry|geometrical]] order", with [[axiom]]s and definitions followed by [[proposition (mathematics)|propositions]]. For Spinoza, this is a considerable improvement over [[Ren√© Descartes]]'s writing style in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]'', which follows the form of a [[diary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Chief Works of Benedict De Spinoza'', translated by R. H. M. Elwes, 1951. {{isbn|0-486-20250-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference from Q.E.F. ==
There is another Latin phrase with a slightly different meaning, usually shortened similarly, but being less common in use. {{lang|la|Quod erat faciendum}}, originating from the Greek geometers' closing {{lang|grc|·ΩÖœÄŒµœÅ ·ºîŒ¥ŒµŒπ œÄŒøŒπ·øÜœÉŒ±Œπ}} ({{transl|grc|hoper edei poiƒìsai}}), meaning "which had to be done". Because of the difference in meaning, the two phrases should not be confused.

[[Euclid]] used the phrase, Quod Erat Faciendum (Q.E.F.), to close propositions that were not proofs of theorems, but constructions. For example, Euclid's first proposition showing how to construct an [[equilateral triangle]], given one side, is concluded this way.

There is no common formal English equivalent, although the end of a proof may be announced with a simple statement such as "this completes the proof", "as required", "hence proved", "ergo", or by using a similar locution. WWWWW or W&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Äì an abbreviation of "Which Was What Was Wanted" ‚Äì has been used similarly. Often this is considered to be more tongue-in-cheek than the usual Halmos symbol ''(see below)'' or ''Q.E.D.''

== Typographical forms used symbolically ==
{{Main|Tombstone (typography)}}
Due to the paramount importance of [[Mathematical proof|proofs in mathematics]], mathematicians since the time of [[Euclid]] have developed conventions to demarcate the beginning and end of proofs. In printed English language texts, the formal statements of [[theorem]]s, [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]], and propositions are set in italics by tradition. The beginning of a proof usually follows immediately thereafter, and is indicated by the word "proof" in boldface or italics. On the other hand, several symbolic conventions exist to indicate the end of a proof.

While some authors still use the classical abbreviation, Q.E.D., this practice is increasingly viewed as archaic or even pretentious.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Paul Halmos]] pioneered the use of a solid black square at the end of a proof as a Q.E.D symbol, a practice which has become standard, although not universal. Halmos adopted this use of a symbol from magazine typography customs in which simple geometric shapes had been used to indicate the end of an article. This symbol was later called the ''[[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]]'' or ''Halmos symbol'' or even a ''halmos'' by mathematicians. Often the Halmos symbol is drawn on chalkboard to signal the end of a proof during a lecture, although this practice is not so common as its use in printed text.

The tombstone symbol appears in [[TeX]] as the character &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; (filled square, \blacksquare) and sometimes, as a &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (hollow square, \square). In the AMS Theorem Environment for LaTeX, the hollow square is the default end-of-proof symbol. [[Unicode]] explicitly provides the "End of proof" character, U+220E (‚àé). Some authors use other Unicode symbols to note the end of a proof, including, ‚ñÆ (U+25AE, a black vertical rectangle), and ‚Ä£ (U+2023, a triangular bullet). Other authors have adopted two forward slashes (//) or four forward slashes (////).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real and Complex Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1987|isbn=0-07-100276-6|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, authors have elected to segregate proofs typographically by displaying them as indented blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern humorous use ==
In [[Joseph Heller]]'s book ''[[Catch-22]]'', [[Chaplain Tappman|the Chaplain]], having been told to examine a forged letter allegedly signed by him (which he knew he didn't sign), verified that his ''name'' was in fact there. His investigator replied, "Then you wrote it. Q.E.D." The chaplain said he didn't write it and that it wasn't his handwriting, to which the investigator replied, "Then you signed your name in somebody else's handwriting again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6k30_63q08C&amp;pg=PA84|title=Catch-22|work=|last=Heller|first=Joseph|date=|accessdate=15 July 2011|isbn=978-0-573-60685-4|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1978 science-fiction radio comedy, and later in the television and novel adaptations of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', "Q.E.D." is referred to in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|the Guide's]] entry for the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|babel fish]], when it is claimed that the babel fish ‚Äì which serves the "mind-bogglingly" useful purpose of being able to translate any spoken language when inserted into a person's ear ‚Äì is used as evidence for existence and non-existence of God. The exchange from the novel is as follows: "'I refuse to prove I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.' 'But,' says Man, 'The babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Adams|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]|publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]]|series=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]|edition=Film tie-in|date=2005|location=Basingstoke and Oxford|pages=62‚Äì64|isbn=0-330-43798-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'', Q.E.D. is used as a punchline to several humorous anecdotes in which characters go to great lengths to prove something non-mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Neal|title=Cryptonomicon|date=1999|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-051280-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter [[Thomas Dolby]]'s 1988 song "Airhead" includes the lyric, "Quod erat demonstrandum, baby," referring to the self-evident vacuousness of the eponymous subject; and in response, a female voice squeals, delightedly, "Oooh... you speak French!" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/music/preview/Titfyr7lz4lzc67o5yrek7drnaq|title=Airhead ‚Äì Thomas Dolby|website=play.google.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quadrans Vetus''' is a [[medieval]] astronomical instrument.

Known as the ''quadrans vetus'' ["old quadrant"], the three surviving [[medieval]] examples are in the [[Museo Galileo]] in [[Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quadrans vetus|url=http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/object/QuadransVetus.html|publisher=[[Museo Galileo]]|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of the History of Science]] in Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quadrans Vetus|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/about/sphaera/sphaera-issue-no-1/the-quadrans-vetus/|publisher=Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|accessdate=29 October 2016|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Museum]] in London.

There are two sights on one of the straight sides. The front carries the shadow square, the hour lines, and a mobile zodiacal cursor in its guide, to be positioned for the desired latitude. The back is inscribed with the zodiacal calendar. The instrument displays Gothic characters. Designed to measure heights, distances, and depths, the instrument could also be used as a universal dial. A similar quadrant is documented in a drawing by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] (c. 1520?) at the Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe (Department of Drawings and Prints) of the [[Uffizi]].

{{evolutionary biology}}
The '''theory of recapitulation''', also called the '''biogenetic law''' or '''embryological parallelism'''‚Äîoften expressed using [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s phrase  "'''ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny'''"‚Äîis a historical hypothesis that the [[embryogenesis|development]] of the [[embryo]] of an animal, from [[fertilization]] to gestation or hatching ([[ontogeny]]), goes through stages resembling or representing successive stages in the evolution of the animal's remote ancestors ([[phylogeny]]). It was formulated in the 1820s by  [[√âtienne Serres]]  based on the work of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]], after whom it is also known as '''Meckel‚ÄìSerres law'''.

Since [[evolutionary developmental biology|embryos also evolve in different ways]], the shortcomings of the theory had been recognized by the early 20th century, and it had been relegated to "biological mythology"&lt;ref name="Ehrlich1963"&gt;[[Paul R. Ehrlich|Ehrlich, Paul]]; Richard Holm; Dennis Parnell (1963) ''The Process of Evolution''. New York: McGraw‚ÄìHill, pg. 66: "Its shortcomings have been almost universally pointed out by modern authors, but the idea still has a prominent place in biological mythology.  The resemblance of early vertebrate embryos is readily explained without resort to mysterious forces compelling each individual to reclimb its phylogenetic tree."&lt;/ref&gt; by the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="Blechschmidt77"&gt;Blechschmidt, Erich (1977) ''The Beginnings of Human Life''. Springer-Verlag, p. 32: "The so-called basic law of biogenetics is wrong. No buts or ifs can mitigate this fact. It is not even a tiny bit correct or correct in a different form, making it valid in a certain percentage. It is totally wrong."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2006"/&gt;

Analogies to recapitulation theory have been formulated in other fields, including [[cognitive development]]&lt;ref name="Foster1994p387"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G. Payne, Michael J. Wenger (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpgQAQAAIAAJ ''Cognitive Psychology''] p.352 quotation: {{quotation|Faulty logic and problematic proposals relating the development of an individual to the development of the species turn up even today. The hypothesis that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been applied and extended in a number of areas, including cognition and mental activities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and art criticism.&lt;ref name="Medicus92p2"&gt;Medicus (1992) p.2 quotation: {{quotation|...many biologists accept the rule with respect to behavioral ontogeny in animal species.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryology==

===Meckel, Serres, Geoffroy===

The idea of recapitulation was first formulated in [[biology]] from the 1790s onwards by the German [[natural philosopher]]s [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]], [[√âtienne Serres]], and [[Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer]],&lt;ref name="Mayr94"&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which, [[Marcel Danesi]] states, it soon gained the status of a supposed [[biogenetic]] law.&lt;ref name="Danesi93p65"&gt;{{Harv|Danesi|1993|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embryological theory was formalised by Serres in 1824‚Äì26, based on Meckel's work, in what became known as the "Meckel-Serres Law". This attempted to link [[comparative embryology]] with a "pattern of unification" in the organic world. It was supported by [[√âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], and became a prominent part of his ideas. It suggested that past transformations of life could have been through environmental causes working on the embryo, rather than on the adult as in [[Lamarckism]]. These [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] ideas led to disagreements with [[Georges Cuvier]]. The theory was widely supported in the Edinburgh and London schools of higher anatomy around 1830, notably by [[Robert Edmond Grant]], but was opposed by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s [[von Baer's laws (embryology)|ideas of divergence]], and attacked by [[Richard Owen]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=52‚Äì53, 86‚Äì88, 337‚Äì340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|350px|[[George Romanes]]'s 1892 copy of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s controversial [[embryo drawing]]s{{efn|George Romanes's 1892 version of the figure is often attributed incorrectly to Haeckel.}}&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck (2002) "Haeckel‚Äôs ABC of evolution and development," p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Haeckel===
{{see|Embryo drawing}}

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834‚Äì1919) attempted to synthesize the ideas of [[Lamarckism]] and [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' with [[Charles Darwin]]'s concepts.  While often seen as rejecting Darwin's theory of branching evolution for a more linear Lamarckian view of progressive evolution, this is not accurate: Haeckel used the Lamarckian picture to describe the ontogenetic and phylogenetic history of individual species, but agreed with Darwin about the branching of all species from one, or a few, original ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Robert J. 2008.

Pp.&amp;nbsp;136‚Äì142&lt;/ref&gt; Since early in the twentieth century, Haeckel's "biogenetic law" has been refuted on many fronts.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://11e.devbio.com/ |title=Ernst Haeckel and the Biogenetic Law |accessdate=2008-05-03 |author=Scott F Gilbert |year=2006 |work=Developmental Biology, 8th edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates |quote=Eventually, the Biogenetic Law had become scientifically untenable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeckel formulated his theory as "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny". The notion later became simply known as the recapitulation theory. [[Ontogeny]] is the growth (size change) and development (structure change) of an individual organism; [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] is the [[evolution]]ary history of a species. Haeckel claimed that the development of advanced species passes through stages represented by adult organisms of more primitive species.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2006" /&gt; Otherwise put, each successive stage in the development of an individual represents one of the adult forms that appeared in its evolutionary history.

For example, Haeckel proposed that the pharyngeal grooves between the [[pharyngeal arch]]es in the neck of the human embryo not only roughly resembled gill slits of fish, but directly represented an adult "fishlike" developmental stage, signifying a fishlike ancestor. Embryonic pharyngeal slits, which form in many animals when the thin branchial plates separating pharyngeal pouches and pharyngeal grooves perforate, open the [[pharynx]] to the outside. Pharyngeal arches appear in all [[tetrapod]] embryos: in [[mammal]]s, the first pharyngeal arch develops into the lower [[jaw]] ([[Meckel's cartilage]]), the [[malleus]] and the [[stapes]]. But these embryonic pharyngeal arches, grooves, pouches, and slits in human embryos can not at any stage carry out the same function as the [[gill]]s of an adult fish.

Haeckel produced several [[embryo drawing]]s that often overemphasized similarities between embryos of related species. The misinformation was propagated through many biology textbooks, and popular knowledge, even today. Modern biology rejects the literal and universal form of Haeckel's theory, such as its possible application to behavioural ontogeny, i.e. the psychomotor development of young animals and human children.&lt;ref name="Medicus1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerhard Medicus |year=1992 |title=The Inapplicability of the Biogenetic Rule to Behavioral Development |journal=Human Development |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=1‚Äì8 |issn=0018-716X |url=https://www.uibk.ac.at/psychologie/humanethologie/einfuehrung-in-die-humanethologie/dateien/humandevelopment.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-04-30 |quote=The present interdisciplinary article offers cogent reasons why the biogenetic rule has no relevance for behavioral ontogeny. ...

These facts lead to the conclusion that attempts to establish a psychological theory on the basis of the biogenetic rule will not be fruitful. |doi=10.1159/000277108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary criticism ===

Haeckel's drawings were such a misrepresentation of observed human embryonic development that he attracted the opposition of several members of the scientific community, including the anatomist [[Wilhelm His Sr.|Wilhelm His]], who had developed a rival "causal-mechanical theory" of human embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Making visible embryos: Forgery charges | url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s4_2.html | publisher=University of Cambridge | accessdate=27 October 2016| quote=R√ºtimeyer‚Äôs ex-colleague, Wilhelm His, who had developed a rival, physiological embryology, which looked, not to the evolutionary past, but to bending and folding forces in the present. He now repeated and amplified the charges, and lay enemies used them to discredit the most prominent Darwinist. But Haeckel argued that his figures were schematics, not intended to be exact. They stayed in his books and were widely copied, but still attract controversy today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Wilhelm His, Sr | publisher=Embryo Project Encyclopedia | year=2007 | accessdate=27 October 2016 | url=http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/wilhelm-his-sr-1831-1904 | quote=In 1874 His published his ''√úber die Bildung des Lachsembryos'', an interpretation of vertebrate embryonic development.

These differences were, in turn, caused by "heredity". &lt;!--Wilhelm --&gt;His&lt;!-- anatomist--&gt; compared the shapes of embryonic structures to those of rubber tubes that could be slit and bent, illustrating these comparisons with accurate drawings. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s attack on Haeckel's recapitulation theory was far more fundamental than that of any empirical critic, as it effectively stated that Haeckel's "biogenetic law" was irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Gould1977"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gould | first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould | title=Ontogeny and phylogeny | publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | year=1977 | isbn=0-674-63941-3 | pages=189‚Äì193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ray RS, Dymecki SM |title=Rautenlippe Redux -- toward a unified view of the precerebellar rhombic lip |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=741‚Äì7 |date=December 2009  |pmid=19883998 |pmc=3729404 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Embryology theories of [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] compared]]

Darwin's view was that embryos resembled each other, since they shared a common ancestor, which presumably had a similar embryo, but that development did not necessarily recapitulate phylogeny: in his view, there was no reason to suppose that an embryo at any stage resembled an adult of any ancestor. Darwin supposed further that embryos were subject to less intense selection pressure than adults, and had therefore changed less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=M. Elizabeth |title=The Origin of Species: "Chapter Thirteen: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary Organs" (1859), by Charles R.

=== Modern status ===

Modern [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo) follows von Baer, rather than Darwin, in pointing to active evolution of embryonic development as a significant means of changing the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of adult bodies. Two of the key principles of evo-devo, namely that changes in the timing ([[heterochrony]]) and positioning within the body ([[heterotopy]]) of aspects of embryonic development would change the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's, were however first formulated by Haeckel in the 1870s. These elements of his thinking about development have thus survived, whereas his theory of recapitulation has not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B. K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7‚Äì8 |pages=491‚Äì495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haeckelian form of recapitulation theory is considered defunct.&lt;ref name=Lovtrup&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lovtrup | first1=S | year=1978 | title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation | url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/3/348.full.pdf | journal=Systematic Zoology | volume=27 | issue=3| pages=348‚Äì352 | doi=10.2307/2412887| jstor=2412887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, embryos do undergo a period where their morphology is strongly shaped by their phylogenetic position, rather than selective pressures.&lt;ref name="Kalinka2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Kalinka | first1=A. T. | last2=Tomancak | first2=P. | title=The evolution of early animal embryos: Conservation or divergence? | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.007 | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | year=2012 | volume=27 | issue=7 | pages=385‚Äì393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern view is summarised by the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]]:

{{quote|Embryos do reflect the course of evolution, but that course is far more intricate and quirky than Haeckel claimed. Different parts of the same embryo can even evolve in different directions. As a result, the Biogenetic Law was abandoned, and its fall freed scientists to appreciate the full range of embryonic changes that evolution can produce‚Äîan appreciation that has yielded spectacular results in recent years as scientists have discovered some of the [[Evo-devo gene toolkit|specific genes that control development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Early Evolution and Development: Ernst Haeckel | series=Evolution 101 | publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/early_evodevo.shtml | accessdate=2013-02-20 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222105021/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/early_evodevo.shtml | archivedate=2012-12-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Applications to other areas==
The idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been applied to some other areas.

===Cognitive development===
Research in the late 20th century confirmed that "both biological evolution and the stages in the child's cognitive development follow much the same progression of evolutionary stages as that suggested in the archaeological record".&lt;ref name="Foster1994p387"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Symbolism: the foundation of culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Foster, Mary LeCron | editor=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1994 | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6Y2hNf35J4C&amp;pg=PA387 p.387]}} quotation: {{quotation|While ontogeny does not generally recapitulate phylogeny in any direct sense (Gould 1977), both biological evolution and the stages in the child's cognitive development follow much the same progression of evolutionary stages as that suggested in the archaeological record (Borchert and Zihlman 1990, Bates 1979, Wynn 1979) ... Thus, one child, having been shown the moon, applied the word 'moon' to a variety of objects with similar shapes as well as to the moon itself (Bowerman 1980). This spatial globality of reference is consistent with the archaeological appearance of graphic abstraction before graphic realism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] was one of the most energetic promoters of evolutionary ideas to explain many phenomena. He compactly expressed the basis for a cultural recapitulation theory of [[education]] in the following claim, published in 1861, five years before Haeckel first published on the subject:&lt;ref name="EganEducatedMind"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Kieran Egan (educationist) |author=Egan, Kieran |title=The Educated Mind: How Cognitive Tools Shape Our Understanding |titlelink=The Educated Mind |page=27 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1997 |isbn=0-226-19036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{quotation|If there be an order in which the human race has mastered its various kinds of knowledge, there will arise in every child an aptitude to acquire these kinds of knowledge in the same order. ... Education is a repetition of civilization in little.&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book | author=Herbert Spencer |authorlink=Herbert Spencer | year=1861 | title=Education | pages = 5 | url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98953755}}&lt;/ref&gt; | Herbert Spencer}}

[[G. Stanley Hall]] used Haeckel's theories as the basis for his theories of child development. His most influential work, "Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education" in 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=G. Stanley |title=Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education |date=1904 |publisher=D. Appleton and Company |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/adolescenceitsps01hall/page/n5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that each individual's life course recapitulated humanity's evolution from "savagery" to "civilization". Though he has influenced later childhood development theories, Hall's conception is now generally considered racist.&lt;ref name="Lesko 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lesko | first=Nancy | title=Past, Present, and Future Conceptions of Adolescence | journal=Educational Theory | volume=46 | issue=4 | year=1996 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.1996.00453.x | pages=453‚Äì472}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Developmental psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] favored a weaker version of the formula, according to which ontogeny ''parallels'' phylogeny because the two are subject to similar external constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1977|pp=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Austrian pioneer in psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], also favored Haeckel's doctrine. He was trained as a biologist under the influence of recapitulation theory at the time of its domination, and retained a [[Lamarckian]] outlook with justification from the recapitulation theory.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1977|pp=156‚Äì158}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also distinguished between physical and mental recapitulation, in which the differences would become an essential argument for his [[Defence mechanisms#Level 1: "Psychotic"|theory of neuroses]].&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt;

===Art criticism===

The musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] in 2005 applied the term "ontogeny becomes phylogeny" to the process of creating and recasting art history, often to assert a perspective or argument. For example, the peculiar development of the works by modernist composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (here an "ontogeny") is generalized in many histories into a "phylogeny" ‚Äì a historical development ("evolution") of Western music toward atonal styles of which Schoenberg is a representative. Such historiographies of the "collapse of traditional tonality" are faulted by art historians as asserting a rhetorical rather than historical point about tonality's "collapse".&lt;ref name=Taruskin&gt;{{cite book | last=Taruskin | first=Richard | title=The Oxford History of Western Music | volume=4 | year=2005 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-195-38630-1  | pages=358‚Äì361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taruskin also developed a variation of the motto into the pun "ontogeny recapitulates ontology" to refute the concept of "absolute music" advancing the socio-artistic theories of the musicologist [[Carl Dahlhaus]]. [[Ontology]] is the investigation of what exactly something is, and Taruskin asserts that an art object becomes that which society and succeeding generations made of it. For example, composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''St. John Passion'', composed in the 1720s, was appropriated by the [[Nazi]] regime in the 1930s for propaganda. Taruskin claims the historical development of the ''Passion'' (its ontogeny) as a work with an anti-Semitic message does, in fact, inform the work's identity (its ontology), even though that was an unlikely concern of the composer. Music or even an abstract visual artwork can not be truly autonomous ("absolute") because it is defined by its historical and social reception.&lt;ref name=Taruskin/&gt;

The '''reward theory of attraction''' states that people like those whose [[behavior]] is [[reward (psychology)|reward]]ing to them or whom they associate with rewarding events.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;Myers, D. G. (2010). Relationship Rewards. In Social Psychology (10th ed., pp. 418-420). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  More clearly stated this means people are attracted to those who in some way make them feel good, or are attracted to those who remind them of people that they enjoy being around.

==Effects on attraction==

We are attracted to those that we find it satisfying and gratifying to be with.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;  If a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] gives us more reward and pleasure than cost and pain, we will like that relationship and wish it to continue.  Thus, even after a relationship ends, we may find ourselves drawn to people that remind us of the former person.

This can help explain why no [[love]] can feel quite the same as that "first".  These "firsts" can generate sensations so new and unfamiliar that the experience feels almost unreal.&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, J. (2010, January 1). Heartbreak and Home Runs: The Power of First Experiences. Psychology Today. Retrieved from http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200912/ heartbreak-and-home-runs-the-power-first-experiences&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}  Besides emotional engagement, these experiences also have a heavy dose of [[novelty]]. Novelty simply driving up [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] (brain systems associated with focus and paying attention and rewards).  A first [[romantic relationship]] is the only time in which an individual is in "love" without ever having been hurt from such a relationship. If a person meets someone who reminds them of an ex, whether physically or a similarity in attitudes, gestures, voice, or interests, it may engage the representation in their memory.  And since their first love, by result of its novelty and emotional significance, is potentially the most prominent, it may be the representation that is summoned when they meet a potential someone new, which effects the way they see that new relationship.  Their old feelings, [[motivation]]s, and expectations are all transferred into their memory, which can cause them to (if their new found partner reminds them of an ex) begin to repeat behaviors that they engaged in with that ex.

The fact that people are attracted to those who make them feel good can also explain why people are attracted to those they cannot have.  Forbidden love is the most intense. Again, dopamine plays a major role. Beyond pleasure, dopamine is also associated with focus, motivation, and [[goal-oriented]] behavior. When a person cannot get somebody, the dopamine system keeps on spitting out [[hormone]]s, providing the [[adrenaline]], focus and motivation necessary to keep trying.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, S. (2009, July 20). Bloodlust: What Women Want. Psychology Today. Retrieved from http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200908/bloodlust-what-women-want&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

===Other influences explained===
The reward theory also helps explain why people are more attracted to people of close proximity, of more [[attractiveness]], more similar, and people who have feelings of mutuality.  Proximity is rewarding.  It cost less effort to receive [[friendship]]'s benefits with someone who lives or works closer.  People like attractive people because they perceive that attractive people offer other desirable traits, and they benefit from associating with them.  If others have similar opinions as ourselves we feel rewarded because we presume that they like us in return.  People also like to be liked and love to be loved.  Therefore, [[Reciprocal liking|liking]] is usually mutual because we like those who like us in return.

==Original research==

===Pawel Lewicki (1985)===
[[Classical conditioning|Conditioning]] creates positive feelings towards things and people linked with rewarding events.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt; [[Pawel Lewicki]] in 1985 tested this liking-by-association principle by conducting an experiment on students at the [[University of Warsaw]].  In the experiment students were given the option of choosing which of two pictured women (woman A or woman B) looked friendlier.  Students were 50-50 in choosing which was friendlier.  Other students, however, before viewing the pictures interacted with a warm and friendly experimenter who resembled woman A, chose woman A at a margin of 6 to 1.  In a follow up study, the experimenter acted unfriendly toward half of the participants.  When these participants later had to turn in their data to one of the two women, they almost always avoided the one who looked like the "unfriendly" experimenter.

===Griffit (1970)===
In Griffit's study college students that evaluated strangers in a pleasant room liked them better than students who evaluated strangers in an uncomfortably hot room.

==Recent research==

===Helen Fisher (Yale University)===
[[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]] and colleagues conducted a [[neuroimaging]] study on men and women that had just "fallen madly in love".  Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), they collected data on 10 women and 7 men that reported being in love an average of 7.4 months.  Each participant was shown a picture of their loved one as well as a photograph of an emotionally neutral person, each viewing was then followed by a [[distraction]] task to cleanse the mind of strong [[emotion]]s.  [[Brain activity|Brain activation]] with the picture of the loved one was high in the region of the brain that produces and distributes dopamine and also brains "reward system", or the [[neural network]] associated with pleasure, arousal, focus, and motivation.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;Fisher, H. (n.d.). The Drive to Love: The Neural Mechanism for Mate Selection. In R. J. Sternberg &amp; K. Weis (Eds.), The New Psychology of Love (pp. 87-110). Retrieved from http://www.helenfisher.com/downloads/articles/15npolve.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gingrich, Liu, Cascio, Wang, and Insel (2000)===
In 2000 animal studies were conducted that supported that [[Attractiveness|attraction]] is associated with elevated activity in central dopamine.  In the experiment a female lab-raised [[Prairie Vole|prairie vole]] was mated with a male, and formed a distinct preference for him associated with a 50% increase of dopamine.  When a [[dopamine antagonist]] was injected into the reward region of the brain, she no longer had the preference for the male.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt;

===Helen Fisher (2005)===
In 2005 Fisher and colleagues conducted a second [[fMRI]] study in which participants were still in love with a past partner.  The study included 10 women and 5 men.  The rejected participants viewed pictures of their ex and of a similar, emotionally neutral individual.  Within the participants dopamine was again increased with viewing of the photographs.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt;

SWAP can detect the sparse solar wind concentration at 32 AU, which is about three orders of magnitude less than near Earth (1 AU).&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0709/0709.4505.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; However, at that distance the flow of the Solar Wind is still [[supersonic]], and thus liable to create a bow shock around an obstacle.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0709/0709.4505.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; One of the areas of investigation is the relationship between high altitude atmospheric loss and the solar wind.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0709/0709.4505.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; After the July 2015 flyby of Pluto by ''New Horizons'', data from SWAP was used to study the nature of Pluto's interaction with the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McComas|first=D.

Earlier in the mission SWAP was intended to observe the Solar Wind around Jupiter.&lt;reF&gt;[http://www.boulder.swri.edu/pkb/ssr/ssr-swap.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; SWAP was also designed to be used in conjunction with  PEPPSI and REX, to study how the solar wind changes with greater distance from the Sun.&lt;reF&gt;[http://www.boulder.swri.edu/pkb/ssr/ssr-swap.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; 

By the 2010s, only three other spacecraft besides ''New Horizons'' have collected extensive data about the solar wind beyond 10 AU, ''[[Voyager 2]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', and ''[[Pioneer 11]]''.&lt;ReF&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0067-0049/223/2/19]&lt;/reF&gt; SWAP took only limited observations before 2012, but after that took a greater amount of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2577">'''Salomon Coster''' (c. 1620&amp;ndash;1659) was a Dutch clockmaker of [[the Hague]], who in 1657 was the first to make a [[pendulum clock]], which had been invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629-1695). Coster's earliest pendulum clocks were signed "Samuel Coster Haghe met privilege", indicating that he had been authorized by the inventor to make such clocks.&lt;ref&gt;Hans van den Ende, et al.: "Huygens's Legacy, The Golden Age of the Pendulum Clock", Fromanteel Ltd., 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; John Fromanteel, the son of a London clockmaker, [[Ahasuerus]], went to work for Coster. He was one of many foreign clockmakers to soon make pendulum clocks following the prototype by Huygens and Coster. A contract was signed on 3 September 1657 between Salomon Coster and John Fromanteel which allowed Fromanteel to continue making the clocks. This clock design was heralded as a new beginning in the clockmaking industry, due to its level of timekeeping accuracy which was previously unheard of.

The oldest extant pendulum clock is signed by Salomon Coster and dated 1657. It is on display at the [[Boerhaave Museum]] in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans van den Ende, "Huygens's Legacy, The Golden Age of the Pendulum Clock", Fromanteel Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Coster died a sudden death in 1659.

The '''Shiva laser''' was a powerful 20-beam [[infrared]] [[neodymium]] [[glass]] (silica glass) [[laser]] built at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in 1977 for the study of [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) and long-scale-length laser-plasma interactions. Presumably, the device was named after the multi-armed form of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], due to the laser's multi-beamed structure. Shiva was instrumental in demonstrating a particular problem in compressing targets with lasers, leading to a major new device being constructed to address these problems, the [[Nova laser]].

==Background==
{{Main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
The basic idea of any ICF device is to rapidly heat the outer layers of a "target", normally a small plastic sphere containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. The heat burns the plastic into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. Due to [[Newton's Third Law]], the remaining portion of the target is driven inwards, eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel. When it meets itself in the center of the fuel, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot is raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, which collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel &amp;ndash; high enough density and temperature &amp;ndash; this heating process can result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as "ignition", which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the targets. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles, as well as creating a suitable shock wave. The laser beams must also be focussed evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other "drivers" have been suggested, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.

==Description==
Shiva incorporated many of the advancements achieved on the earlier [[Cyclops laser|Cyclops]] and [[Argus laser]]s, notably the use of amplifiers made of Nd:glass slabs set at the [[Brewster's angle]] and the use of long vacuum [[spatial filter]]s to "clean" the resulting laser beams. These features have remained a part of every ICF laser since, which leads to long "beamlines". In the case of Shiva, the beamlines were about 30 m long.

Prior to "firing", the laser glass of the Shiva was [[laser pumping|"pumped"]] with light from a series of [[Xenon flash lamp]]s fed power from a large [[capacitor]] bank. Some of this light is absorbed by the neodymium atoms in the glass, raising them to an [[excited state]] and leading to a [[population inversion]] which readies the lasing medium for amplification of a laser beam. A small amount of laser light, generated externally, was then fed into the beamlines, passing through the glass and becoming amplified through the process of [[stimulated emission]]. This is not a particularly efficient process; in total, around ~1% of the electricity used to feed the lamps ends up amplifying the beam on most Nd:glass lasers.

After each amplifier module there was a [[spatial filter]], which was used to smooth the beam by removing any nonuniformity or power anisotropy which had accumulated due to nonlinear focussing effects of intense light passage through air and glass. The spatial filter is held under vacuum in order to eliminate the creation of plasma at the focus (pinhole).&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978STIN...7913361G&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=44fac4eeaa02324 Shiva: A 30 terawatt glass laser for fusion research]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the light had passed through the final amplifier and spatial filter it was then used for experiments in the '''target chamber''', lying at one end of the apparatus. Shiva's 20 beamlines each delivered about 500&amp;nbsp;[[Joules]] of energy, which together delivered a ~.5 to 1 nanosecond pulse of 10.2&amp;nbsp;kJ of infrared light at 1062&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength, or smaller peak powers over longer times (3&amp;nbsp;kJ for 3&amp;nbsp;ns).

By today's standards, Shiva was fairly inexpensive. The entire device, including test equipment and buildings, cost about $25 million when it was completed in 1977 (${{inflation|US|25|1977}} million today).

==Shiva and ICF==
Shiva was never expected to reach ignition conditions, and was primarily intended as a proof-of-concept system for a larger device that would. Even before Shiva was completed, the design of this successor, then known as Shiva/Nova, was well advanced. Shiva/Nova would emerge as Nova in 1984. Shiva was heavily instrumented, and its target chamber utilized high-resolution, high-speed optical and X-ray instruments for the characterization of the plasmas created during implosion.

When experiments with targets started in Shiva in 1978, compression was ramped upward to about 50 to 100 times the original density of the liquid hydrogen, or about 3.5 to 7&amp;nbsp;g/mL. For comparison, lead has a density of about 11&amp;nbsp;g/mL. While impressive, this level of compression is far too low to be useful in an attempt to reach ignition, and far lower than simulations had estimated for the system

Studies of the causes of the lower than expected compression led to the realization that the laser was coupling strongly with the hot [[electron]]s (~50&amp;nbsp;keV) in the plasma which formed when the outer layers of the target were heated, via [[raman scattering#stimulated raman scattering|stimulated raman scattering]]. John Holzrichter, director of the ICF program at the time, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The laser beam generates a dense plasma where it impinges on the target material. The laser light gives up its energy to the electrons in the plasma, which absorb the light. The rate at which that happens depends on the wavelength and the intensity. On Shiva, we were heating up electrons to incredible energies, but the targets were not performing well. We tried a lot of stuff to coax the electrons to transfer more of their energy to the target, with no success.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was earlier realized that laser energy absorption on a surface scaled favorably with reduced wavelength, but it was believed at that time that the IR generated in the Shiva Nd:glass laser would be sufficient for adequately performing target implosions. Shiva proved this assumption wrong, showing that irradiating capsules with infrared light would likely never achieve ignition or gain. Thus Shiva's greatest advance was in its failure, a not entirely obvious example of the [[null result]].

ICF research turned to using an "[[optical frequency multiplier]]" to convert the incoming IR light into the [[ultraviolet]] at about 351&amp;nbsp;nm, a technique that was well known at the time but was not efficient enough to be worthwhile. Research on the GDL laser at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] in 1980 first achieved efficient frequency tripling techniques which were then used next (for the first time at LLNL) on Shiva's successor, the [[Novette laser]]. Every laser-driven ICF system after Shiva has used this technique.

On January 24 1980, a 5.8 {{M|w}} earthquake (the [[List of earthquakes in California|first in a doublet]]) shook Livermore and the facility enough to shear fist-sized bolts off Shiva; repairs were made and the laser was subsequently put back online a month later. Many experiments including testing the "''indirect mode''" of compression using [[hohlraums]] continued at Shiva until its dismantling in 1981. Shiva's target chamber would be reused on the [[Novette laser]]. Maximum fusion yield on Shiva was around 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; [[neutron]]s per shot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18228">'''Social geography''' is the branch of [[human geography]] that is most closely related to [[social theory]] in general and [[sociology]] in particular, dealing with the relation of [[social phenomenon|social phenomena]] and its spatial components. Though the term itself has a tradition of more than 100 years,&lt;ref name="term"&gt;Dunbar, Gary S. (1977): Some Early Occurrences of the Term "Social Geography". ''Scottish Geographical Journal'' 93 (1): 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no consensus on its explicit content.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan J. Smith|Smith, Susan J.]] et al. (2010): Introduction: Situating Social Geographies. In: Smith, Susan J. et al. (eds.): The Sage Handbook of Social Geographies. London (Sage): 1-39 [5-7].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, noted that "[w]ith some notable exceptions, (...) social geography can be considered a field created and cultivated by a number of individual scholars rather than an academic tradition built up within particular schools".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Buttimer|Buttimer, Anne]] (1968): Social geography. In: Sills, David (ed.): International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. New York (MacMillan): 134-145 [134].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, despite some calls&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Jackson (geographer)|Peter Jackson]] (1983): Social geography: Convergence and Compromise. ''Progress in Human Geography'' 7 (1): 116-121.&lt;/ref&gt; for convergence centred on the [[structure and agency]] debate,&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek Gregory|Gregory, Derek]] (1981): Human Agency and Human Geography. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' 6 (1): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; its methodological, theoretical and topical diversity has spread even more, leading to numerours definitions of social geography&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Eyles|Eyles, John]] (1986): Introduction: Diffusion and Convergence? In: Eyles, John (ed.): Social Geography in International perspective. Barnes &amp; Noble: 1-12 [4-5].&lt;/ref&gt; and, therefore, contemporary scholars of the discipline identifying a great variety of different ''social geographies''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Susan J. et al. (2010): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[Benno Werlen]] remarked,&lt;ref&gt;[[Benno Werlen|Werlen, Benno]] (2008): Sozialgeographie: Eine Einf√ºhrung (3. ed.). Bern et al. (Haupt). [11] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; these different perceptions are nothing else than different answers to the same two (sets of) questions, which refer to the spatial constitution of society on the one hand, and to the spatial expression of social processes on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter (1987): The Idea of 'Race' and the Geography of Racism. In: Jackson, Peter (ed.): Race and Racism: Essays in Social geography. London (Allen &amp; Unwin): 3-18 [14].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The outline of these questions is basically of dialectical purpose, and, in its original context, wasn't used as a subject's definition. (Cf. Jackson, Peter (2003): Introduction: The Social in Question. In: Anderson, Kay et al. (eds.) (2003): Handbook of Cultural Geography. London et al. (Sage): 37-42.) Also note that Werlen's original two questions that social geography has to answer slightly differ from these two, and that Buttimer (1968: 135) provides another two of such questions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The different conceptions of social geography have also been overlapping with other sub-fields of geography and, to a lesser extent, sociology. When the term emerged within the Anglo-American tradition during the 1960s, it was basically applied as a synonym for the search for patterns in the distribution of [[social group]]s, thus being closely connected to [[urban geography]] and [[urban sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron J. Johnston|Johnston, Ron]] (1987): Theory and Methodology in Social Geography. In: Pacione, Michael (ed.): Social Geography: Progress and Prospect. London (Croom Helm): 1-30 [3-4].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the focus of debate within American human geography lay on [[Political economy|political economic]] processes (though there also was a considerable number of accounts&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ley|Ley, David]] (1977): Social Geography and the Taken-for-granted-World. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' 2 (4): 498-512.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] perspective on social geography),&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter (1981): Phenomenology and Social Geography. ''Area'' 13 (4): 299-305.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 1990s, geographical thought was heavily influenced by the "[[cultural turn]]". Both times, as [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] noted, these approaches "claimed authority over the 'social'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Smith (geographer)|Smith, Neil]] (2000): Socializing Culture, Radicalizing the Social. ''Social &amp; Cultural Geography'' 1 (1): 25-28 [25].&lt;/ref&gt; In the American tradition, the concept of [[cultural geography]] has a much more distinguished history than social geography, and encompasses research areas that would be conceptualized as "social" elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Del Casino Jr., Vincent J. and [[Sallie A. Marston]] (2006): Social Geography in the United States: Everywhere and Nowhere. ''Social &amp; Cultural Geography'' 7 (6): 995-1006 [995-996].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, within some continental European traditions, social geography was and still is considered an approach to human geography rather than a sub-discipline,&lt;ref&gt;for the German-language geography, see [[Dietrich Bartels|Bartels, Dietrich]] and Thomas K.

== History ==

=== Before the Second World War ===
The term "social geography" (or rather "g√©ographie sociale") originates from France, where it was used both by geographer [[√âlis√©e Reclus]] and by sociologists of the [[Pierre Guillaume Fr√©d√©ric le Play|Le Play]] School, perhaps independently from each other. In fact, the first proven occurrence of the term derives from a review of Reclus' ''Nouvelle g√©ographie universelle'' from 1884, written by [[Paul de Rousiers]], a member of the Le Play School. Reclus himself used the expression in several letters, the first one dating from 1895, and in his last work ''L'Homme et la terre'' from 1905. The first person to employ the term as part of a publication's title was [[Edmond Demolins]], another member of the Le Play School, whose article ''G√©ographie sociale de la France'' was published in 1896 and 1897. After the death of Reclus as well as the main proponents of Le Play's ideas, and with [[√âmile Durkheim]] turning away from his early concept of [[social morphology]],&lt;ref name="term" /&gt; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]], who noted that geography "is a science of places and not a science of men",&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Vidal de la Blache|Vidal de la Blache, Paul]] (1913): Des caract√®res distinctifs de la g√©ographie. ''[[Annales de G√©ographie]]'' 22: 289-299 [297]. {{fr icon}} Cited by: [[Paul Claval|Claval, Paul]] (1986): Social Geography in France. In: Eyles, John (ed.): Social Geography in International perspective. Totowa (Barnes &amp; Noble): 13-29 [13-14].&lt;/ref&gt; remained the most influential figure of French geography. One of his students, [[Camille Vallaux]], wrote the two-volume book ''G√©ographie sociale'', published in 1908 and 1911.&lt;ref name="term" /&gt; [[Jean Brunhes]], one of Vidal's most influential disciples, included a level of (spatial) interactions among groups into his fourfold structure of human geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Brunhes|Brunhes, Jean]] (1924): Human Geography. London (G.G. Harrap &amp; Co.). [36-46] (Originally published in French in 1910) Cited by: Buttimer, Anne (1968): 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Second World War, no more theoretical framework for social geography was developed, though, leading to a concentration on rather descriptive rural and [[regional geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer, Anne (1968): 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H√©rin, Robert (1984): Social Geography in France - Heritages and Perspectives. ''GeoJournal'' 9 (3): 231-240 [231].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As Paul Claval (1986) puts it: "At mid-century, French geography was more open to social problems than other schools, but there is nothing like a recognised social geographical field." (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vidal's works were influential for the historical [[Annales School]],&lt;ref&gt;Werlen, Benno (2008): 57.&lt;/ref&gt; who also shared the rural bias with the contemporary geographers,&lt;ref&gt;Claval, Paul (1986): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and Durkheim's concept of social morphology was later developed and set in connection with social geography by sociologists [[Marcel Mauss]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]] (1927): Divisions et proportions des divisions de la sociologie. ''L'Ann√©e Sociologique'', Nouvelle S√©rie 2: 98-173 [112]. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Halbwachs]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomale, Eckhard (1972): 136-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person in the Anglo-American tradition to use the term "social geography" was George Wilson Hoke, whose paper ''The Study of Social Geography''&lt;ref&gt;Hoke, G. W. (1907): The Study of Social Geography. ''The Geographical Journal'' 29 (1): 64-67.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1907, yet there is no indication it had any academic impact. Le Play's work, however, was taken up in Britain by [[Patrick Geddes]] and [[Andrew John Herbertson]].&lt;ref name="term" /&gt; Percy M. Roxby, a former student of Herbertson, in 1930 identified social geography as one of human geography's four main branches.&lt;ref&gt;Roxby, P. M. (1930): The Scope and Aims of Human Geography. ''Scottish Geographical Journal'' 46 (5): 276-290 [283].&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the American academic geography of that time was dominated by the Berkeley School of Cultural Geography led by [[Carl O. Sauer]], while the spatial distribution of social groups was already studied by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Casino Jr., Vincent J. and Sallie A. Marston (2006): 997, 999-1000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harlan H. Barrows]], a geographer at the University of Chicago, nevertheless regarded social geography as one of the three major divisions of geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harlan H. Barrows|Barrows, H. H.]] (1923): Geography as Human Ecology. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 13 (1): 1-14 [7].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pre-war concept that combined elements of sociology and geography was the one established by Dutch sociologist [[Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz]] and his Amsterdam School of [[Sociography]]. However, it lacked a definitive subject, being a combination of geography and [[ethnography]] created as the more concrete counterpart to the rather theoretical sociology. In contrast, the Utrecht School of Social geography, which emerged in the early 1930s, sought to study the relationship between social groups and their [[living space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomale, Eckhard (1972): 108-110, 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernste, Huib and Lothar Smith (2009): Dutch Human Geography. In: Kitchin, Rob and Nigel Thrift (eds.): [[International Encyclopedia of Human Geography]]. Oxford (Elsevier): 255-265 [256].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-War Period ===

==== Continental Europe ====
In the German-language geography, this focus on the connection between social groups and the [[landscape]] was further developed by [[Hans Bobek]] and [[Wolfgang Hartke]] after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, Joseph J. (1968): Toward a Definition of Post-War German Social Geography. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 58 (2): 397-410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though the term "Sozialgeographie" had been used before, the first call for a systematic consideration of social groups within German-language geography came from Richard Busch-Zantner (1937): Zur Ordnung der anthropogenen Faktoren. ''Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen'' 83: 138-141 [139]. {{de icon}} (Cited by: Werlen, Benno (2008): 75-76.). However, he died in the Second World War.&lt;/ref&gt; For Bobek, groups of ''Lebensformen'' (patterns of life)‚Äîinfluenced by social factors‚Äîthat formed the landscape, were at the center of his social geographical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bobek, Hans (1948): Stellung und Bedeutung der Sozialgeographie. ''[[Erdkunde]]'' 2: 118-125 [122]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar approach, Hartke considered the landscape a source for indices or traces of certain social groups' behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Hartke|Hartke, Wolfgang]] (1959): Gedanken √ºber die Bestimmung von R√§umen gleichen sozialgeographischen Verhaltens. ''Erdkunde'' 13 (4): 426-436 [427]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known example of this perspective was the concept of ''Sozialbrache'' (social-fallow),&lt;ref&gt;Hartke, Wolfgang (1956): Die Sozialbrache als Ph√§nomen der geographischen Differenzierung der Landschaft. ''Erdkunde'' 10 (4): 257-269. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the abandoning of tillage as an indicator for occupational shifts away from agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomale, Eckhard (1984): Social Geographical Research in Germany - a Balance Sheet for the Years 1950-1980. ''GeoJournal'' 9 (3): 223-230 [228].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the French ''G√©ographie Sociale'' had been a great influence especially on Hartke's ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu (1968): 400&lt;/ref&gt; no such distinct school of thought formed within the French human geography.&lt;ref&gt;H√©rin (1984): 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claval (1986): 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Albert Demangeon]] paved the way for a number of more systematic conceptualizations of the field with his (posthumously published) notion&lt;ref&gt;Demangeon, A. (1942): Probl√®mes de g√©ographie humaine. Paris (Armand Colin). [28]&lt;/ref&gt; that social groups ought to be within the center of human geographical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Werlen (2008): 60.&lt;/ref&gt; That task was carried out by [[Pierre George]] and [[Maximilien Sorre]], among others. Then a Marxist,&lt;ref&gt;H√©rin (1984): 232.&lt;/ref&gt; George's stance was dominated by a socio-economic rationale,&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer (1968): 137.&lt;/ref&gt; but without the [[Structural marxism|structuralist interpretations]] found in the works of some the French sociologists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Claval (1986): 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was another French Marxist, the sociologist [[Henri Lefebvre]], who introduced the concept of the (social) production of space.&lt;ref&gt;Claval, Paul (1984): The Concept of Social Space and the Nature of Social Geography. ''New Zealand Geographer'' 40 (2): 105-109 [105-106].&lt;/ref&gt; He had written on that and related topics since the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Peet|Peet, Richard]] (1998): Modern Geographical Thought. Oxford, Malden (Blackwell). [100-102]&lt;/ref&gt; but fully expounded it in ''La Production de L'Espace''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Lefebvre|Lefebvre, Henri]] (1974): La Production de L'Espace. Paris (Anthropos).&lt;/ref&gt; as late as 1974. Sorre developed a schema of society related to the ecological idea of [[habitat]], which was applied to an urban context by the sociologist [[Paul-Henry Chombart de Lauwe]].&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer, Anne (1969): Social Space in Interdisciplinary Perspective. ''Geographical Review'' 59 (3): 417-426.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Dutch geographer [[Christiaan van Paassen]], the world consisted of socio-spatial entities of different scales formed by what he referred to as a "syn-ecological complex",&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiaan van Paassen|van Passen, Christiaan]] (1965): Preliminary to social-geographical theory. Utrecht. [3-5]&lt;/ref&gt; an idea influenced by [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoekveld, Gerard (2003): Christiaan van Paassen (1917-1996). In: Armstrong, Patrick H. and Geoffrey J. Martin (eds.): Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies (22). New York: 157-168 [158].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more analytical ecological approach on human geography was the one developed by [[Edgar Kant]] in his native Estonia in the 1930s and later at [[Lund University]], which he called "anthropo-ecology". His awareness of the temporal dimension of social life would lead to the formation of [[time geography]] through the works of [[Torsten H√§gerstrand]] and [[Sven Godlund]].&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer, Anne (2005): Edgar Kant (1902‚Äì1978): A Baltic Pioneer. ''Geografiska Annaler, Series B: Human Geography'' 87 (3): 175-192 [179-180].&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have used the phrase to refer to the integration of the [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[social]] properties of [[system]]s, [[wikt:process|process]]es, [[function (engineering)|function]]s, [[Model (abstract)|models]], as well as can indicate the branch of [[science]], [[engineering]] or [[technology]], such as ''socio-cognitive research'', ''socio-cognitive interactions''.

December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
This term is especially used when [[complexity|complex]] cognitive and social properties are reciprocally connected and essential for a given problem. 

'''Socio-cognitive research''' is [[human factor]] and socio-organizational factor based, and assumes an integrated [[knowledge engineering]], environment and [[business]]  [[modeling perspectives|modeling perspective]], therefore it is not ''[[social cognition]]'' which rather is a branch of [[psychology]] focused on ''how people process social information''.

'''Socio-cognitive engineering''' ('''SCE''') includes a set of theoretical interdisciplinary frameworks, methodologies, methods and software tools for the design of [[Human-centered computing (discipline)|human centred]] technologies,&lt;ref&gt;M. Sharples at al.(2002), [http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/sharplem/Papers/mediate%20ejor.pdf Socio-cognitive engineering:  a methodology for the design of humancentred technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923190713/http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/sharplem/Papers/mediate%20ejor.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }}, European Journal of Operational Research&lt;/ref&gt; as well as, for the improvement of large complex human-technology systems.

'''''StarDate''''' is a science [[radio program]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] [[McDonald Observatory]], broadcast on over 360 radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stardate.org/radio "StarDate Radio"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a daily guide to the night sky and breaking astronomical news. Typically heard without formal introduction, ''StarDate'' is a self-contained science news feature interwoven with routine radio programming. It is the longest-running science outreach program on U.S. radio. Created by KNOW Radio (Austin) News Director Grady Blount in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;Grady Price Blount, [http://sese.asu.edu/people/grady-price-blount "SESE People"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610021008/http://sese.asu.edu/people/grady-price-blount |date=2010-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the short synoptic format of ''StarDate'' was borrowed from a daily radio news feature called ''90 Seconds'', and was intended to invoke the immediate sense of the term "[[stardate]]" used in the opening monologue of the 1960s television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.

Original scripts were written by science journalist [[Deborah Byrd]] of the McDonald Observatory. These evolved from a 1976 astronomy telephone message service and a 30-minute-long Sunday morning public service radio program on astronomy taped at the former KNOW studios on North Lamar Street at Martin Luther King Boulevard. Another Austin radio station, [[KLBJ-FM]], aired a broadcast version of similar Byrd-inspired scripts as ''Have You Seen the Stars Tonight?'' With the creation of the ''StarDate'' concept, Byrd secured funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] to begin national distribution under the new moniker and brief, immediate format. The niche broadcasting position of ''StarDate'' has always been its quick but relaxed, diary-like delivery which allows it to be interspersed with regular programming. 

Byrd produced the show and Joel Block hosted it, until 1991, when a change in management at McDonald and effective demotions led both to depart and start another syndicated radio series, ''[[Earth &amp; Sky]]'', which aired from 1991 to 2013 and was heard on about 1,000 radio stations.

Since 1991, ''StarDate'' has been produced by Damond Benningfield, and hosted by Sandy Wood, a [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] radio personality who was one of the first female [[disc jockey]]s in the southwestern United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Smith, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/us/sandy-wood-the-voice-of-stardate-for-20-years.html "Day After Day, Her Voice Takes Listeners to the Stars"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stations that broadcast ''StarDate'' include affiliates and owned stations of [[CBS Radio]] and [[National Public Radio]], approximately 300 stations. The program is also available as a downloadable podcast.&lt;ref&gt;StarDate Podcasts, [http://stardate.org/radio/listen "Listen to StarDate"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Universo''''', the [[Spanish language]] version of ''StarDate'', first aired on April 1, 1995.

''StarDate Magazine'' was first known as ''McDonald Observatory News'' in 1972.  It became a bimonthly magazine in 1988.

'''Takwin''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ™ŸÉŸàŸäŸÜ}}) was a goal of certain [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Muslim alchemists]], notably [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]]. In the alchemical context, takwin refers to the creation of [[synthetic life]] in the laboratory, up to and including [[human]] life. Whether Jabir meant this goal to be interpreted literally is unknown.

Jabir states in his ''Book of Stones'' (4:12) that "The purpose is to baffle and lead into error everyone except those whom God loves and provides for!" The ''Book of Stones'' was deliberately written in a highly esoteric code, so that only those who had been initiated into his alchemical school could understand them. It is therefore difficult at best for the modern reader to discern which aspects of Jabir's work are to be read as symbols (and what those symbols mean), and what is to be taken literally.

Kathleen Malone O'Connor writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the [[emic]] perspective of the alchemist, the act of takwin was an emulation of the divine creative and life-giving powers of Genesis and Resurrection and tapped the physical and spiritual forces in nature. At the same time it was an act through which the alchemist was inwardly transformed and purified, a spiritual regeneration. Such an act highlights the creative and often uneasy interrelationship of Islamic [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and science with Islamic revelation and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Connor, Kathleen Malone |title=The alchemical creation of life (takwin) and other concepts of Genesis in medieval Islam |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |year=1994 |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9503804 |accessdate=2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">'''Wilhelm Heinrich Prestele''' (or '''William Henry Prestele''') (13 October 1838 ‚Äì 16 August 1895) was a botanical artist known for his lithographs and watercolor work commissioned by the [[US Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt;

== Biography ==
[[Image:prestele raspberry.jpg|right|thumb|Lithograph created by Prestele of ''[[Rubus crataegifolius]]'' (Korean Raspberry) and ''[[Rubus ursinus]]'' (California Blackberry).]]

Prestele was born on October 13, 1838, in [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Germany]], to Franz Joseph Martin Prestele and Karoline Russ. The family emigrated to America in 1843, settling first in New York and later in the [[Amana Colonies]] in [[Iowa]].&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt; His father, known in America as Joseph Prestele, was also a painter and lithographer of flowers and fruits and prior to emigrating had been head gardener for King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] as well as a staff artist for a time at the Royal Botanical Garden in Munich.&lt;ref name=djk/&gt;&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; From his father he learned the arts of watercolor and lithography.&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt;

In the late 1850s, Prestele moved to New York, and in 1861 he joined the Union Army as a private in a regiment of New York volunteers. He was wounded at the battle of [[Antietam]] in 1862 and spent the remainder of his service period recovering in hospital.&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt; Sometime around 1863, he married an Irish woman named Anne, and with her he had three children‚ÄîMargaret (1864), Frances (ca. 1869), and Emma (1870)‚Äîbefore Anne died in 1871 or 1872.&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt;

In 1867, at the age of 29, William was hired to make a series of nurserymen‚Äôs [[lithography|plates]] by Illinois nursery owner Franklin Kelsey Phoenix. He moved his family from New York to Bloomington, Illinois, for this project. No plates from this project are known to have survived, but a write-up in the August 1869 edition of ''Gardener's Monthly and Horticultural Advertiser'' praised them in robust terms: "We have now before us a fruit piece... prepared by W. H. Prestele. We are in the habit of admiring European art in this line, and have often wished Americans could successfully compete with it. We now have it here. We never saw anything of the kind better executed from any part of the world".&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt;

When this relationship ended in 1871, William briefly went into business with L. B. Littlefield, publishing fruit and flower plates. In 1875, he moved his family to Iowa, not far from the Amana community where he was raised, and married his second wife, Susanna Gefaller.&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt; With Susanna, who died in 1882, he had a daughter, Lillian.&lt;ref name=dfn/&gt; He set up as a lithographer in [[Iowa City]] and practiced this trade for a decade or so.

[[File:Pomological Watercolor POM00004651.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of wild cherry (''Prunus avium'') by William Henry Prestele, 1892.]]

On August 1, 1887, he was appointed as the first artist on the staff of the recently formed Pomological Division of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. He was assigned to make life-size watercolors of native grapes intended as illustrations for a monograph by [[Thomas Volney Munson]] of Denison, Texas, a leading authority on native grapes.&lt;ref name=djk/&gt;&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt;&lt;ref name=issue/&gt; He worked from live and dried specimens sent to him by Munson, making color sketches of details that Munson would then review; Prestele would then use these detail drawings would to create a life-size painting of the species.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt; The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture eventually decided the cost of printing the monograph with the illustrations would be prohibitive, so it was never published in its intended form, though Munson went on to use the text he wrote as the foundation for his highly regarded book ''Foundations of American Grape Culture''.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt; Munson's book was illustrated with photographs instead of with Prestele's watercolors, which remained in the collection of the USDA.

Prestele's paintings are noted for their naturalness and attention to botanical accuracy.&lt;ref name=djk/&gt; Over a hundred of his watercolors of grapes and other fruit are held in the National Agricultural Library's [[United States National Agricultural Library#Pomological Watercolor Collection|Pomological Watercolor Collection]].

He died in Arlington, Virginia on August 16, 1895, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. A collection of his papers spanning the years 1887-1891 is held by the USDA National Agricultural Library Special Collections and comprises original watercolors and drawings, plant specimens, and other materials, including work related to the planned Munson monograph.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;
