Based in [[Las Vegas]], he has released three mixtapes since 2011 and several singles, and has performed at festivals such as [[Electric Zoo]] in New York and EDC Vegas.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2014 he released the track "Vikings" with Botnek on [[Dim Mak Records]].&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

==Early life==
Justin David Blau was born in [[Syosset]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States on {{birth date and age|1991|01|09}}.&lt;ref name="ablau"/&gt; Blau grew up around an artistic family, and was soon playing piano, playing guitar and singing. At thirteen, he moved with his family to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he spent the rest of his youth.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; He attended [[The Meadows School]] for high school and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] for college.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt;

== Background ==
Much of 3LAU's music incorporates [[electro house]], [[dubstep]], [[deep house]], and [[progressive house]].&lt;ref name="dblau" /&gt; He is known for his melodic take on dance music and live sets that incorporate [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. He is also known for using [[Ableton]].

==Music career==

===2011–12: First releases===
In 2011, at the age of 20, he vacationed in Sweden, where he discovered electronic dance music. After returning to college he started producing mashups, "mainly because [he] didn't think anyone was doing a good job."&lt;ref name="cblau"/&gt; He soon began mixing under the professional name 3LAU, and by June of that year was uploading mashups to YouTube.&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

3LAU gained recognition in the [[electronic music]] world in 2011 with his two bootlegs, "Girls Who Save the World" and "All Night Long". He also won a remix competition for his remix of [[Tiesto]]'s "Work Hard, Play Hard".

Before 2012, 3LAU spent his days studying at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and DJing at night. He has had remixes charts in the top 10 on both [[Beatport]] and [[Hype Machine]].&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt;

===2012–15: Singles, touring===
In 2012, he focused on DJing and launched his 3LAU Your Mind tour. That same year, he released his second bootleg album, ''Dance Floor Filth''.&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt; In 2012, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' described him as "one of America's fastest-rising DJ-producers."&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2012 he released ''Dance Floor Filth 2'', an album featuring his production.&lt;ref name="iblau"/&gt;

In late 2013, he went on a short tour with Carnage called the Night Riot tour.&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hblau"/&gt; Wrote Jonah Ollman of ''Sound of Boston'' about 3LAU's live performances in late 2013, "A nice balance of mashups, electro-house, poppy vocal samples, and a 90’s throwback here and there keep the young 20-something crowd going and constantly entertained."&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;

In the summer of 2015, 3LAU did his first European tour visiting Barcelona, Germany and Ibiza. Later that fall, he went on his first Asian tour which included Bangkok, Jakarta, Tokyo and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tour|url = http://www.3lau.com/tour|website = Tour|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117071736/http://www.3lau.com/tour|archive-date = 2016-01-17|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[knot theory]], the '''6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot''' is one of three [[prime knot]]s with [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] six, the others being the [[Stevedore knot (mathematics)|stevedore knot]] and the [[6₃ knot|6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot]].  This knot is sometimes referred to as the '''Miller Institute knot''',&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Miller Institute Knot|urlname=MillerInstituteKnot}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it appears in the logo&lt;ref&gt;[http://millerinstitute.berkeley.edu Miller Institute - Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Miller Institute]] for Basic Research in Science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

The 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot is [[invertible knot|invertible]] but not [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]]. Its [[Alexander polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = -t^2 + 3t -3 + 3t^{-1} - t^{-2}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

its [[Alexander polynomial#Alexander.E2.80.93Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = -z^4 - z^2 + 1, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and its [[Jones polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = q - 1 + 2q^{-1} - 2q^{-2} + 2q^{-3} - 2q^{-4} + q^{-5}. \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Knot Atlas|6_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot is a [[hyperbolic knot]], with its [[knot complement|complement]] having a [[Hyperbolic volume (knot)|volume]] of approximately 4.40083.

'''Abas I of Armenia''' ({{Lang-hy|Աբաս Ա.}}) was king of [[Armenia]] from 928 to 953.  Abas was of the royal [[Bagratuni Dynasty]]. He was the son of [[Smbat I]] and the brother of [[Ashot II|Ashot "Yerkat" II]]. In contrast to the way his predecessors' ruled, Abas' reign was marked by years of peace, stability, and prosperity that Armenia had not enjoyed for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Life==
His capital was based at the fortress-city of [[Kars]] and Abas achieved numerous successes on both the foreign and domestic fronts. In the same year that he became king, Abas traveled to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], where he was able to convince the Arab governor there to release several Armenian hostages and turn over control of the pontifical palace back to Armenia. Conflict between the Arabs were minimal too, with the exception of a military defeat Abas suffered near the holy city of [[Vagharshapat]]. He was far less conciliatory towards the Byzantines, who had repeatedly demonstrated their unreliability as allies by attacking and annexing Armenian territories. However, the Byzantine emperor [[Romanus I Lecapenus]] was more focused on fighting the Arab [[Hamdanids]], leaving Abas virtually free to conduct his policies without foreign hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, Steven. Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his reign; a study of tenth-century Byzantium,  1929, pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Abas confronted an invasion by king Ber of [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]] in 943: a new church had been completed in Kars under Abas' orders and prior to its consecration, Ber had appeared with an army along the river of the [[Araxes]], demanding that the new church be consecrated under [[Chalcedonian]] rite.&lt;ref&gt;Chamchyants. ''History of Armenia'', pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Abas refused to make any concessions and ambushed Ber's forces in a dawn assault. Several more [[skirmish]]es took place, wherein Ber was finally captured by Abas' men. Abas took the king to his new church and told him that he would never see it again, [[blindness|blinding]] him and sending him back to Abkhazia. Abas died in 953, leaving his kingdom to his two sons, [[Ashot III]] and [[Mushegh]].

In [[molecular biology]], an '''amplicon''' is a piece of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that is the source and/or product of [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] or [[DNA replication|replication]] events. It can be formed artificially, using various methods including [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR) or [[ligase chain reaction]]s (LCR), or naturally through [[gene duplication]]. In this context, ''amplification'' refers to the production of one or more copies of a genetic fragment or target sequence, specifically the amplicon. As it refers to the product of an amplification reaction, ''amplicon'' is used interchangeably with common laboratory terms, such as "PCR product."

Artificial amplification is used in [[research]],&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Meyers |editor1-first=Robert A. |title=Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: A Comprehensive Desk Reference |year=1995 |publisher=VCH Publishers |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-56081-925-1 |pages=53, 585}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic science|forensics]],&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1867860 |year=1991 |last1=Walsh |first1=PS |last2=Metzger |first2=DA |last3=Higuchi |first3=R |title=Chelex 100 as a medium for simple extraction of DNA for PCR-based typing from forensic material |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=506–13 |journal=BioTechniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[medicine]]&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; for purposes that include detection and quantification of [[Infectious disease|infectious agents]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Consumer Affairs Branch |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/PremarketApprovalsPMAs/ucm091626.htm |title=Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test |publisher=FDA |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; identification of human remains,&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng0294-130 |title=Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis |year=1994 |last1=Gill |first1=Peter |last2=Ivanov |first2=Pavel L. |last3=Kimpton |first3=Colin |last4=Piercy |first4=Romelle |last5=Benson |first5=Nicola |last6=Tully |first6=Gillian |last7=Evett |first7=Ian |last8=Hagelberg |first8=Erika |last9=Sullivan |first9=Kevin |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=130–5 |pmid=8162066}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extracting [[genotypes]] from human hair.&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt;

Amplification of the genes encoded by these amplicons generally increases [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of those genes and ultimately the volume of associated [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Bignell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/gr.6522707 |title=Architectures of somatic genomic rearrangement in human cancer amplicons at sequence-level resolution |year=2007 |last1=Bignell |first1=G.

==Structure==
Amplicons in general are [[direct repeat]] (head-to-tail) or [[inverted repeat]] (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or circular in structure.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohn|editor1-first=Waldo E. |editor2-last=Moldave |editor2-first=Kivie |title=Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-540054-1 |pages=280–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Annealing|annealed]] into a circle&lt;ref name=Grondin&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |last1=Grodin |first1=K |last2=Roy |first2=G |last3=Ouellette |first3=M |title= Formation of extrachromosomal circular amplicons with direct or inverted duplications in drug-resistant Leishmania tarentolae. |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=3587–3595 |journal=Mol.

During artificial amplification, amplicon length is dictated by the experimental goals.&lt;ref&gt;PCR Primer Design Guidelines. Premier Biosoft: Accelerating Research in Life Sciences. Retrieved from: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Analysis of amplicons has been made possible by the development of amplification methods such as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], and increasingly by cheaper and more [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput]] technologies for [[DNA sequencing]] or [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]], such as [[ion semiconductor sequencing]], popularly referred to as the brand of the developer, Ion Torrent.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iontorrent.com/ |title=Ion Torrent Official Webpage |access-date=2018-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192756/http://www.iontorrent.com/ |archive-date=2012-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study amplicons in [[Genome Biology|genome biology]] and [[genetics]], including [[Genetics of cancer|cancer genetics]] research,&lt;ref name="International Cancer Genome Consortium"&gt;[http://icgc.org International Cancer Genome Consortium Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] research, and [[human genetics]].&lt;ref name="National Human Genome Research Institute Official Website"&gt;[http://www.genome.gov National Human Genome Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using the [[16S rRNA]] gene, which is part of every bacterial and archaeal genome and is highly conserved, bacteria can be taxonomically classified by comparison of the amplicon sequence to known sequences. This works similarly in the fungal domain with the [[18S rRNA]] gene.

Irrespective of the approach used to amplify the amplicons, some technique must be used to quantitate the amplified product.&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;Stanley, J. (2002). Essentials of Immunology &amp; Serology by Jacqueline Stanley. Albany, NY: Delmar.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these techniques incorporate a capture step and a detection step, although how these steps are incorporated depends on the individual [[assay]].

Examples include the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Assay ([[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]), which has the capacity to recognize [[HIV]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]]; the HIV-1 QT ([[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]]), which is used to measure plasma [[viral load]] by amplifying a segment of the HIV RNA; and Transcription Mediated Amplification, which employs a hybridization protection assay to distinguish ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' infections.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt; Various detection and capture steps are involved in each approach to assess the amplification product, or amplicon. With amplicon sequencing the high number of different amplicons resulting from amplification of a usual sample are concatenated and sequenced. After quality control classification is done by different methods, the counts of identical taxa representing their relative abundance in the sample.

==Applications==

PCR can be used to determine sex from a human DNA sample.&lt;ref name=Mannucci&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01371335 |title=Forensic application of a rapid and quantitative DNA sex test by amplification of the X-Y homologous gene amelogenin |year=1994 |last1=Mannucci |first1=Armando |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin M. |last3=Ivanov |first3=Pavel L. |last4=Gill |first4=Peter |journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=190–3 |pmid=8038111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of [[Alu element]] insertion is selected, amplified and evaluated in terms of size of the fragment. The sex assay utilizes AluSTXa for the [[X chromosome]], AluSTYa for the [[Y chromosome]], or both AluSTXa and AluSTYa, to reduce the possibility of error to a negligible quantity. The inserted chromosome yields a large fragment when the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous region]] is amplified. The males are distinguished as having two DNA amplicons present, while females have only a single amplicon. The kit adapted for carrying out the method includes a pair of primers to amplify the locus and optionally polymerase chain reaction reagents.&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00430-X |title=Mobile element-based assay for human gender determination |year=2003 |last1=Hedges |first1=Dale J |last2=Walker |first2=Jerilyn A |last3=Callinan |first3=Pauline A |last4=Shewale |first4=Jaiprakash G |last5=Sinha |first5=Sudhir K |last6=Batzer |first6=Mark A |journal=Analytical Biochemistry |volume=312 |pages=77–9 |pmid=12479838 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCR can be used to diagnose [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=T M|title=The ligase chain reaction as a primary screening tool for the detection of culture positive tuberculosis|journal=Thorax|date=1 November 2000|volume=55|issue=11|pages=955–957|doi=10.1136/thorax.55.11.955|pmid=11050266|pmc=1745641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence containing protein [[antigen]] B is targeted by four [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]]—two for the [[sense strand]], and two for the [[Sense (molecular biology)#Antisense DNA|antisense strand]]. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future rounds of replication. In this instance, the product can be detected via the [[Enzyme immunoassay|microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA)]].

[[File:Book of the Dead Fragment, ROM, 3.jpg|thumb|Fragment from Egyptian Book of the Dead]]

The [[ancient Egypt]]ians believed that a [[soul]] ([[wikt:kꜣ|kꜣ]]/[[wikt:bꜣ|bꜣ]]; [[Egyptian language#Egyptological pronunciation|Egypt. pron.]] ka/ba) was made up of many parts. In addition to these components of the soul, there was the human body (called the ''ḥꜥ'', occasionally a plural ''[[wikt:ḥꜥw|ḥꜥw]]'', meaning approximately "sum of bodily parts"). 

According to [[ancient Egyptian creation myths]], the god [[Atum]] created the world out of chaos, utilizing his own magic ([[heka (god)|ḥkꜣ]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt|last=Pinch|first=Geraldine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the earth was created with magic, Egyptians believed that the world was imbued with magic and so was every living thing upon it. When humans were created, that magic took the form of the soul, an eternal force which resided in and with every human being. The concept of the soul and the parts which encompass it has varied from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] to the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], at times changing from one dynasty to another, from five parts to more. Most [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts]] reference numerous parts of the soul: the ''[[wikt:ẖt|ẖt]]'' (physical body), the ''[[wikt:sꜥḥ|sꜥḥ]]'' (spiritual body), the ''[[wikt:rn|rn]]'' (/ɾin/, Coptic [[wikt:ⲣⲁⲛ|ⲣⲁⲛ]] or [[wikt:ⲗⲉⲛ|ⲗⲉⲛ]]) "name, identity", the ''[[wikt:bꜣ|bꜣ]]'' "personality", the ''[[wikt:kꜣ|kꜣ]]'' (/kuʀ/) "double", the ''[[wikt:jb|jb]]'' (/jib/, Coptic [[wikt:ⲉⲡ|ⲉⲡ]]) "heart", the ''[[wikt:šwt|šwt]]'' "shadow", the ''[[wikt:sḫm|sḫm]]'' "power, form", and the ''[[wikt:ꜣḫ|ꜣḫ]]'' (the combined spirits of a dead person that has successfully completed its transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE BOOK OF THE DEAD The Papyrus of Ani IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.

{{quote|The Egyptians believed that the human personality had many facets - a concept that was probably developed early in the Old Kingdom. In life, the person was a complete entity, but if he had led a virtuous life, he could also have access to a multiplicity of forms that could be used in the next world. In some instances, these forms could be employed to help those whom the deceased wished to support or, alternately, to take revenge on his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and Magic in Ancient Egypt|last=David|first=Rosalie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[wikt:ẖt|ẖt]]'', or physical form, had to exist for the soul (kꜣ/bꜣ) to have intelligence or the chance to be judged by the guardians of the underworld. Therefore, it was necessary for the body to be preserved as efficiently and completely as possible and for the burial chamber to be as personalized as it could be, with paintings and statuary showing scenes and triumphs from the deceased's life. In the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh was granted mummification and, thus, a chance at an eternal and fulfilling afterlife. However, by the Middle Kingdom, all dead were afforded the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death and Burial in Ancient Egypt|last=Ikram|first=Salima|publisher=Longman|year=2003|isbn=978-0582772168|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]], an ancient Greek scholar, observed that grieving families were given a choice as to the type and or quality of the [[mummification]] they preferred: "The best and most expensive kind is said to represent [Osiris], the next best is somewhat inferior and cheaper, while the third is cheapest of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Cultural History - Living in Ancient Egypt|last=Nardo|first=Don|publisher=Thomson/Gale|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the state of the body was tied so closely with the quality of the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]], by the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], not only were the burial chambers painted with depictions of favourite pastimes and great accomplishments of the dead, but there were also small figurines (''[[ushabti]]''s) of servants, slaves, and guards (and, in some cases beloved pets) included in the tombs, to serve the deceased in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miniaci|first=Gianluca|date=2014|title=THE CASE OF THE THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD 'SHABTI-MAKER (?)

Before a person could be judged by the gods, they had to be "awakened" through a series of [[ancient Egyptian funerary practices|funerary rites]] designed to reanimate their mummified remains in the afterlife. The main ceremony, the [[opening of the mouth ceremony]], is best depicted within Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sety]] I's tomb. All along the walls and statuary inside the tomb are reliefs and paintings of priests performing the sacred rituals and, below the painted images, the text of the liturgy for opening of the mouth can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mojsov|first=Bojana|date=Winter 2002|title=The Ancient Egyptian Underworld in the Tomb of Sety I: Sacred Books of Eternal Life|jstor=25091798|journal=The Massachusetts Review|volume=42|issue=4|pages=489–506}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual which, presumably, would have been performed during internment, was meant to reanimate each section of the body: brain, head, limbs, etc. so that the spiritual body would be able to move in the afterlife.

==sꜥḥ (spiritual body)==
[[File:Ostrakon Ghost story Turin.JPG|right|thumb|197.997x197.997px|[[Ostrakon]] with the beginning of the ''Ghost story''. Terracotta from [[Deir el-Medina]], 19th–20th Dynasties, [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Found by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]] in 1905. [[Museo Egizio]], S.6619.]]
If all the rites, ceremonies, and preservation rituals for the ''ẖt'' were observed correctly, and the deceased was found worthy (by Osiris and the gods of the underworld) of passing through into the afterlife, the ''[[wikt:sꜥḥ|sꜥḥ]]'' (or spiritual representation of the physical body) forms. This spiritual body was then able to interact with the many entities extant in the afterlife. As a part of the larger construct, the ꜣḫ, the ''sꜥḥ'' was sometimes seen as an avenging spirit which would return from the underworld to seek revenge on those who had wronged the spirit in life. A well-known example was found in a tomb from the Middle Kingdom in which a man leaves a letter to his late wife who, it can be supposed, is haunting him:
{{quote|What wicked thing have I done to thee that I should have come to this evil pass? What have I done to thee? But what thou hast done to me is to have laid hands on me although I had nothing wicked to thee. From the time I lived with thee as thy husband down to today, what have I done to thee that I need hide? When thou didst sicken of the illness which thou hadst, I caused a master-physician to be fetched…I spent eight months without eating and drinking like a man. I wept exceedingly together with my household in front of my street-quarter. I gave linen clothes to wrap thee and left no benefit undone that had to be performed for thee. And now, behold, I have spent three years alone without entering into a house, though it is not right that one like me should have to do it. This have I done for thy sake. But, behold, thou dost not know good from bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living in Ancient Egypt|last=Nardo|first=Don|publisher=Thomson/Gale|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==jb (heart)==
{{Hiero|''jb'' (F34) "heart"|&lt;hiero&gt;F34&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
[[File:Hatnofer's heart scarab.jpg|left|thumb|This exquisite gold and green stone heart scarab belonged to Hatnofer, the mother of the prominent 18th dynasty state official Senenmut, who served under the female king and pharaoh Hatshepsut. The tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer was found intact by archaeologists at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, in Thebes. The scarab is today on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
An important part of the Egyptian soul was thought to be the ''[[wikt:jb|jb]]'', or [[heart (symbolism)|heart]]. The heart&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280503/ib|title=Ib {{!}} ancient Egyptian religion|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was believed to be formed from one drop of blood from the heart of the child's mother, taken at conception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://enc.slider.com/Enc/Ab_(Egyptian_heart-soul_concept) ''Slider'', ''Ab, Egyptian heart and soul conception'']&lt;/ref&gt; To ancient Egyptians, the heart was the seat of emotion, thought, will and intention, evidenced by the many expressions in the [[Egyptian language]] which incorporate the word ''jb''. Unlike in English, when ancient Egyptians referenced the ''jb'' they generally meant the physical heart as opposed to a metaphorical heart. However, ancient Egyptians usually made no distinction between the mind and the heart with regard to emotion or thought. The two were synonymous. 

In the Egyptian religion, the heart was the key to the afterlife. It was essential to surviving death in the nether world, where it gave evidence for, or against, its possessor. Like the physical body (''ẖt''), the heart was a necessary part of judgement in the afterlife and it was to be carefully preserved and stored within the mummified body with a heart scarab carefully secured to the body above it to prevent it from telling tales. According to the ''Text of the Book of Breathings'',{{quote|[They drag Osiris in]to the Pool of Khonsu, ... and likewise [the Osirism Hor, justified] born of Taikhebyt, justified ... after he has grasped his heart. They bury ... the Book of Breathings which [Isis] made, which ... is written on both its inside and outside, (wrapped) in royal linen, and it is placed [under] the ... left arm near his heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Translation of the Book of Breathings|last=Rhodes|first=Michael|publisher=Brigham young University|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}It was thought that the heart was examined by [[Anubis]] and the deities during the [[Weighing of the Heart]] ceremony. If the heart weighed more than the feather of [[Maat]], it was immediately consumed by the monster [[Ammit]], and the soul became eternally restless.

==kꜣ "double"== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pyramid of Unas]] --&gt;
{{Hiero|kꜣ (D28)|&lt;hiero&gt;D28&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
The ''kꜣ'' was the Egyptian concept of vital essence, which distinguishes the difference between a living and a dead person, with death occurring when the kꜣ left the body. The Egyptians believed that [[Khnum]] created the bodies of children on a [[potter's wheel]] and inserted them into their mothers' bodies. Depending on the region, Egyptians believed that [[Heqet]] or [[Meskhenet]] was the creator of each person's kꜣ, breathing it into them at the instant of their [[birth]] as the part of their soul that made them be ''alive''. This resembles the concept of [[spirit]] in other religions.

The Egyptians also believed that the kꜣ was sustained through food and drink. For this reason food and drink offerings were presented to the dead, although it was the kꜣw within the offerings that was consumed, not the physical aspect. In the Middle kingdom a form of offering tray known as a [[Soul house]] was developed to facilitate this.&lt;ref name=BMspout&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=111623&amp;partId=1&amp;object=230535&amp;page=1 |title=soul house |website=British Museum Collection online |publisher= British Museum |access-date=30 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/burialcustoms/soulhouse.html |title=Soul-houses  |date=2002 |website=Digital Egypt for Universities |publisher=University College London. |access-date= 21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kꜣ was often represented in Egyptian iconography as a second image of the king, leading earlier works to attempt to translate kꜣ as ''double''.

==bꜣ (personality)== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pyramid of Unas]] --&gt;
[[File:Ba bird.svg|thumb|left|upright|Bꜣ takes the form of a bird with a human head.]]
[[File:Egyptian - Ba Bird - Walters 571472.jpg|thumb|right|This golden bꜣ amulet from the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] would have been worn as an [[apotropaic]] device. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

{{Hiero|bꜣ (G29)|&lt;hiero&gt;G29&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
{{Hiero|bꜣ (G53)|&lt;hiero&gt;G53&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}

The '''bꜣ''' ([[Egyptian language#Egyptological pronunciation|Egyptological pronunciation]]: ''ba'') was everything that makes an individual unique, similar to the notion of 'personality'. In this sense, inanimate objects could also have a bꜣ, a unique character, and indeed [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] often were called the bꜣ of their owner. The bꜣ is an aspect of a person that the Egyptians believed would live after the body died, and it is sometimes depicted as a human-headed bird flying out of the tomb to join with the kꜣ in the afterlife&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

In the ''[[Coffin Texts]],'' one form of the bꜣ that comes into existence after death is corporeal—eating, drinking and copulating. Egyptologist [[Louis Vico Žabkar]] argues that the bꜣ is not merely a part of the person ''but is the person himself'', unlike the soul in Greek, or late Judaic, Christian or Muslim thought. The idea of a purely immaterial existence was so foreign to Egyptian thought that when Christianity spread in Egypt, they borrowed the Greek word {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} ''psychē'' to describe the concept of soul instead of the term bꜣ. Žabkar concludes that so particular was the concept of the bꜣ to ancient Egyptian thought that it ought not to be translated but instead the concept be footnoted or parenthetically explained as one of the modes of existence for a person.&lt;ref&gt;"''A Study of the Ba Concept In Ancient Egyptian Texts.''", p. 162–163, Louis V. Žabkar, University of Chicago Press, 1968. [https://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc34.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another mode of existence the bꜣ of the deceased is depicted in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' returning to the mummy and participating in life outside the tomb in non-corporeal form, echoing the solar theology of [[Ra]] uniting with [[Osiris]] each night.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Guide: The Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology'', [[James P. Allen]], p. 28, Berkley, 2003, {{ISBN|0-425-19096-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bꜣw'' (''baw''), plural of the word bꜣ, meant something similar to "impressiveness", "power", and "reputation", particularly of a deity. When a deity intervened in human affairs, it was said that the bꜣw of the deity were at work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borghouts|first=Joris Frans|date=1982|title="Divine Intervention in Ancient Egypt and Its Manifestation (bꜣw)" In Gleanings from Deir el-Medîna, edited by Robert Johannes Demarée and Jacobus Johannes Janssen|url=|journal=Egyptologische Uitgaven, Leiden: Nederlands Instituut Voor Het Nabije Oosten|volume=|pages=1–70|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==šwt (shadow)==
A person's [[shadow]] or silhouette, šwt, is always present. Because of this, Egyptians surmised that a shadow contains something of the person it represents. Through this association, statues of people and deities were sometimes referred to as shadows.

The shadow was also representative to Egyptians of a figure of death, or servant of [[Anubis]], and was depicted graphically as a small human figure painted completely black. Sometimes people (usually pharaohs) had a shadow box in which part of their šwt was stored.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==sḫm (form)==
Little is known about the Egyptian interpretation of this portion of the soul. Many scholars define sḫm as the living force or life-force of the soul which exists in the afterlife after all judgement has been passed. However, sḫm is also defined in a ''Book of the Dead'' as the "power" and as a place within which Horus and Osiris dwell in the underworld.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==rn (name)==
As a part of the soul, a person's rn (''[[mouth (hieroglyph)|r]][[water ripple (hieroglyph)|n]]'' 'name') was given to them at birth and the Egyptians believed that it would live for as long as that name was spoken, which explains why efforts were made to protect it and the practice of placing it in numerous writings. It is a person's identity, their experiences, and their entire life's worth of memories. For example, part of the ''[[Books of Breathing|Book of Breathings]]'', a derivative of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', was a means to ensure the survival of the name. A [[cartouche]] (magical rope) often was used to surround the name and protect it. Conversely, the names of deceased enemies of the state, such as [[Akhenaten]], were hacked out of monuments in a form of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. Sometimes, however, they were removed in order to make room for the economical insertion of the name of a successor, without having to build another monument. The greater the number of places a name was used, the greater the possibility it would survive to be read and spoken.

==ꜣḫ== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pyramid of Unas]] --&gt;
{{redirect|Akh|the French hip-hop artist|Akhenaton (rapper)|the airport with the code "AKH"|Gastonia Municipal Airport}}
[[File:Akh glyph.svg|thumb|ꜣḫ glyph]]

The [[wikt:ꜣḫ|ꜣḫ]] "(magically) effective one"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Allen, James W. |title=Middle Egyptian : An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year= 2000|pages= |isbn=978-0-521-77483-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a concept of the dead that varied over the long history of ancient Egyptian belief.

It was associated with thought, but not as an action of the mind; rather, it was intellect as a living entity. The ꜣḫ also played a role in the afterlife. Following the death of the ẖt (physical body), the bꜣ and kꜣ were reunited to reanimate the ꜣḫ.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptology online, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The reanimation of the ꜣḫ was only possible if the proper funeral rites were executed and followed by constant offerings. The ritual was termed s-ꜣḫ "make (a dead person) into an (living) ꜣḫ". In this sense, it even developed into a sort of [[ghost]] or roaming dead being (when the tomb was not in order any more) during the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]. An ꜣḫ could do either harm or good to persons still living, depending on the circumstances, causing e.g., nightmares, feelings of guilt, sickness, etc. It could be invoked by prayers or written letters left in the tomb's offering chapel also in order to help living family members, e.g., by intervening in disputes, by making an appeal to other dead persons or deities with any authority to influence things on earth for the better, but also to inflict punishments.

The separation of ꜣḫ and the unification of kꜣ and bꜣ were brought about after death by having the proper offerings made and knowing the proper, efficacious spell, but there was an attendant risk of dying again. Egyptian funerary literature (such as the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' and the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'') were intended to aid the deceased in "not dying a second time" and to aid in becoming an ꜣḫ.

==Relationships==
Ancient Egyptians believed that [[death]] occurs when a person's kꜣ leaves the body. Ceremonies conducted by priests after death, including the "[[Opening of the mouth ceremony|opening of the mouth (''wp r'')]]", aimed not only to restore a person's physical abilities in death, but also to release a ''Ba''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s attachment to the body. This allowed the bꜣ to be united with the kꜣ in the afterlife, creating an entity known as an ꜣḫ.

Egyptians conceived of an afterlife as quite similar to normal physical existence – but with a difference. The model for this new existence was the journey of the Sun. At night the Sun descended into the [[Duat]] or "underworld". Eventually the Sun meets the body of the mummified [[Osiris]]. Osiris and the Sun, re-energized by each other, rise to new life for another day. For the deceased, their body and their tomb were their personal Osiris and a personal Duat. For this reason they are often addressed as "Osiris". For this process to work, some sort of bodily preservation was required, to allow the bꜣ to return during the night, and to rise to new life in the morning. However, the complete ''ꜣḫ''s were also thought to appear as stars.&lt;ref name="Frankfort2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frankfort|first=Henri|authorlink=Henri Frankfort|title=Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYhfazYeAnUC&amp;pg=PA100|year=2011|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-41138-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], non-royal Egyptians did not expect to unite with the Sun deity, it being reserved for the royals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wagenburg.at/staticE/page161.html 26th Dynasty stela description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929025515/https://www.wagenburg.at/staticE/page161.html |date=2007-09-29 }} from Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', the collection of spells which aided a person in the afterlife, had the Egyptian name of the ''Book of going forth by day''. They helped people avoid the perils of the afterlife and also aided their existence, containing spells to ensure "not dying a second time in the underworld", and to "grant memory always" to a person. In the Egyptian religion it was possible to die in the afterlife and this death was permanent.

The tomb of Paheri, an Eighteenth dynasty [[nomarch]] of [[Nekhen]], has an eloquent description of this existence, and is translated by [[James Peter Allen]] as:
{{quote|Your life happening again, without your ''ba'' being kept away from your divine corpse, with your ''ba'' being together with the ''akh'' ... You shall emerge each day and return each evening. A lamp will be lit for you in the night until the sunlight shines forth on your breast. You shall be told: "Welcome, welcome, into this your house of the living!"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

[[Ancient astronauts]] have been addressed frequently in [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction]]. Occurrences in the genres include:

== Novels and comics ==
* [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]]'s ''[[Les Xipehuz]] [The Shapes]'' from 1887 features geometric aliens encountered by primitive humans living a thousand years before [[Babylon]]ian times.
* [[Garrett P. Serviss]]' ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'', published in 1898, is perhaps the first story to feature ancient astronauts who have a major influence on early human civilizations, predating Fort's book by over 20 years. In it, the narrator learns that the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]] from ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' visited Earth around 7500 BC, enslaving the inhabitants of the [[Fertile Crescent]] and bringing them to [[Egypt]] to make monuments of their conquest, including the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] (which is actually the face of the leader of the Martian expedition). Afterwards, a plague caused them to leave, with the Martians taking a number of their human slaves to [[Mars]] to serve them there, until an expedition led by [[Thomas Edison]] freed their descendants in the early 20th century.
* [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]'' (1926) and ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' (1931) are some of the many works of the cosmic horror author that deal with ancient aliens.
* [[Wilson Tucker]]'s ''The Time Masters'' (1953) has a private detective who turns out to be Gilgamesh, who was a survivor of a starship crash thousands of years ago.
* [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' (1959) depicts the whole of human development and civilization to be a medium used by aliens for relaying messages to an alien space-explorer stranded on one of [[Saturn]]'s moons.
* The March 1961 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact]]'' contains a piece by Arthur W. Orton entitled ''The Four-Faced Visitors of Ezekiel''. Although described in the magazine's Table of Contents as a [[short story]], it actually takes the form of a pseudo-factual essay presenting a verse-by-verse analysis of Ezekiel's vision and interpreting this in terms of an encounter with ancient astronauts. In this respect the essay mirrors J. F. Blumrich's book ''[[The Spaceships of Ezekiel]]'' (1974), despite predating it by more than a decade.
* In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Known Space]]'' (1964–present), humanity is descended from aliens called the [[Pak Protector|Pak]].
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]] has written several stories utilizing the theme, most famously in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). In his novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', a religion called the "Fifth Church of Christ, Cosmonaut" is mentioned, whose central tenet is that [[Jesus]] was an alien visitor.
* ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic  ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]'' by [[Hergé]] (1968) features a temple built to honor ancient astronauts and a scientist who acts as Earth's ambassador to them.
* [[Philip K. Dick]] explores this theory in his ''[[VALIS trilogy]]'', wherein race of ancient astronauts is thought to have placed an information-streaming satellite in orbit around Earth.
* [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] wrote of an alien race which inhabited a destroyed fifth planet between Mars and Jupiter and are discovered in the hulk of an abandoned spacecraft on Ganymede in his five-volume [[Giants series]]. (1977-2005.)
* [[Douglas Adams]] used a satirical version of the theory in his ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series (1979–1992).
* [[Buzz Aldrin]]'s and [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]' novel, ''[[Encounter With Tiber]]'' (1996), deals with the discovery of ancient alien encounters on Earth and Mars, with humanity utilizing recovered alien technology to advance the space program.
* In [[David Brin]]'s ''[[Uplift Universe]]'' series, all known species were brought to sapience through the direct intervention of a known galactic "patron", except for the fabled first sentient species, the Progenitors, and humanity. While most humans take pride at achieving space travel without a patron, some humans (called Danikenites, after Erich von Däniken) and most [[List of Uplift Universe species|Galactics]] believe otherwise.
* [[S. M. Stirling]]'s novels ''[[The Sky People]]'' and ''[[In the Courts of the Crimson Kings]]'' state that an ancient race of aliens populated Earth, Mars, and Venus with human and animal life. Additionally, the ancient astronaut theme is played in reverse, with the technologically advanced humans from Earth being seen as advanced gods by the [[bronze age]]-level alien natives of Venus and Mars.
* In [[William H. Keith, Jr.]]'s "Heritage Trilogy," a war between the United States and a United Europe (and later between the United States and China) has its roots in the discovery that ancient astronaunts visited Earth on several occasions.  Ancient technology found on [[Mars]], the [[Moon]], and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] change the balance of power on Earth.
* In [[Walter Ernsting]]'s ''The Day the Gods Died'', an extraterrestrial civilization is said to have built the ruins of ancient [[Peru]].

* The [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic series ''[[The Eternals]]'' deals with advanced aliens (the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]) who had experimented on early hominids, creating two sister races, the Eternals and the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], who resembled "gods" and "demons" respectively. It is also noted that their advanced test eventually lead to the X-gene in mutants.
* [[Yoshiki Takaya]]'s manga series ''[[Bio Booster Armor Guyver]]'', later adapted several times into animated form and twice into a pair of americanized films, featured the idea that all life on earth was created by an organization of various alien beings as biological weapons intended for use in interstellar war, which were later abandoned for reasons unknown, and thus were never taken into space. According to the series, human beings are actually a 'first stage' organism that can be further mutated into monstrous creatures called ''Zoanoids'', which supposedly account for many modern-day [[myth]]s of [[vampire]]s and werewolves. The comic features an alien armor supposedly used by the aliens themselves which remains on Earth and is possessed by a high-school student. One of the principal characters, the most highly advanced living weapon, fears the aliens' return and plans to take mankind into space to find a means to confront the aliens on their own terms.
* In [[Jon Stewart]]'s ''[[Naked Pictures of Famous People]]'' the section "The Recipe" claims to be a translation of an ancient [[Aztec]] text from 2000 BC depicting a celebrity awards ceremony. In the context of the book, Erich Von Daniken brought it to the world's attention in his book ''Weird, Huh?'' wondering if ancient alien visitors had brought knowledge of celebrity awards shows to the Aztecs.
* [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series describes the Earth from the view of two alien civilisations, responsible for bringing life to the planet.

* A series of short novels known as the ''Outernet'' series has, as one of its premises, the idea that Stonehenge was originally built as a means of communication with extraterrestrials.
* An obscure novel by [[André Norton]] called ''Merlin's Mirror'' portrays the wizard [[Merlin]] as a servant of benevolent "Sky People" who seek to elevate humanity and thwart the "Dark Ones" who wish to keep humanity ignorant. [[Nimue]] is described as a servant of the Dark Ones, sent to prevent Merlin from giving humanity a leader (Arthur) who would bring it to the heights of knowledge. The Sky People are once implied to have assumed the guises of already-worshipped gods, such as [[Cernunnos]], in order to communicate with humans, and sometimes are identified as divine by the human characters. Stonehenge is said to be their creation, and Merlin's reconstruction of it a means of establishing a "beacon" whereby the Sky People would find their way to Earth, avoiding their own extinction and humanity's limitation.
* The [[Thorgal]] series by [[Grzegosz Rosinski]] and [[Van Hamme]] (29 albums) where the main protagonist Thorgal Aegirsson is in fact the son of ancient astronauts.

== Movies and television series ==
*The Japanese anime television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982) featured an ancient, long extinct and very advanced humanoid alien civilization called [[Protoculture (Macross)|The Protoculture]], who dominated the Milky Way Galaxy by founding a Stellar Republic and who also created the human race on Earth.
*The film ''[[Outlander (film)|Outlander]]'' (2008) is based on an advanced man from space crashing on Earth during the Viking era and remaining with the Vikings as their king.
*The documentary film ''[[The Outer Space Connection]]'' (1975) narrated by [[Rod Serling]].
*The film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) is themed around a group of scientists who set out to discover the origins of human life, which was seeded on Earth and influenced by an ancient race of aliens.
* The basis for [[Prometheus and Bob]] is an alien 900,000 years ago attempting to educate a caveman called "Bob", and creating video tapes of his failed attempts.
* The American independent film ''A Genesis Found'' (2009) features characters who use the theory to explain an anomalous skeleton discovered at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in central [[Alabama]].
* ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008) links (albeit by coincidence) the existence of [[crystal skull]]s to beings that were perceived as gods by the [[Maya civilization]], though these visitors were from another dimension rather than outer space.
* [[Nigel Kneale]]'s miniseries ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958–1959) and the [[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|1967 film adaptation]] used a version of the idea.
* The [[BBC]], [[Doctor Who]] serial ''[[Pyramids of Mars]]'' (1975) featured a conflict on Earth between aliens of a race named the Osirans forming the basis of Egyptian mythology, and a number of other ''Doctor Who'' serials have used similar ideas.
* In ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), an alien ship crashes in Antarctica in 100,000 B.C.E. A character later mentions ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' and the belief that the [[Incan]] civilization was developed by aliens.
* The original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2003 remake]] depicts humans as having originated on the planet Kobol and later settled thirteen colony planets, [[Earth]] being the last and most distant. The plots of both concern a group of humans attempting to find Earth. The original 1978 series is more closely linked to the ancient astronaut theory, using modernized versions of ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Ages costumes, as well as mixing ancient myths and religious materials into the storylines. In contrast, SyFy's 2003 remake deals little with ancient myths and legends and depicts an American-like culture, and in a twist, it is revealed that the "human" and Cylon protagonists are in fact the ancient astronauts themselves.
* The French animated series ''Il était une fois... l'Espace'' (1982) (English: ''[[Once Upon a Time... Space]]'') featured far-future humans taking on the role of superior aliens to an inca-like culture. The spaceships of the human civilization also used decorative iconography derived from the [[Nazca lines]] as a wink to the theory – the ship of the main characters using a hummingbird design.
* The television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' (1993–2002) has borrowed the theory.
* The movie ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994) featured Ra, a member of the alien species [[Goa'uld]] that came to Earth around 8000 B.C., who enslaved the ancient Egyptians, creating their culture and religion, before eventually transporting thousands of them through the Stargate to offworld mining colonies.

Also featured the sinister [[Goa'uld]], who posed as gods to enslave the humans; and the benevolent Asgard, who posed as gods to protect the humans.
** The ''Stargate: Ultimate Edition: Director's Cut'' DVD includes a featurette interview with [[Erich von Däniken]] entitled ''"Is there a Stargate?"''.
* A 1996 episode of the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' involves an ancient alien living in a hidden spaceship under [[Easter Island]]. In the episode it is concluded that this alien came to Earth long ago and inspired [[Moai]] statues which Easter Island is famous for.
* The ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise has dozens of examples of extraterrestrials visiting Earth in past centuries, many having an influence on pre-modern humans. These are just a few prime examples:
**The 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[Who Mourns for Adonais?]]" uses the idea that the [[Greek gods]] were extraterrestrials, although the Sun god [[Apollo]] is the only mythological character to actually appear.
**The 1993 ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]" reveals that the predominance of humanoid species in known space of modern times is the result of a progenitor humanoid species "seeding" various planets with their DNA in order to influence the development of sentient life into forms similar to themselves.
** In the 1995 ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Tattoo (Star Trek: Voyager)|Tattoo]]", it is revealed that the human character [[Chakotay]] is descended from the Rubber Tree People, a group of Native Americans who were visited by the Sky Spirits 45,000 years ago. The Sky Spirits, who are actually advanced, space-faring aliens, granted these primitive humans a genetic alteration which influenced their development.
** By contrast, in several other Trek projects, for example the Next Gen's "[[Who Watches the Watchers]]," humans come to be regarded as gods by lesser advanced aliens. The [[United Federation of Planets]] and [[Starfleet]] have a [[Prime Directive]] of non interference to discourage this, but it happens often due to carelessness or malicious disobedience.
* Lilith and Adam in the manga/anime series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' were two extraterrestrial beings that landed on Earth and gave birth to humanity.
* While not specifically using [[Earth]] as an example, the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe has many references to aliens giving primitive races technology, or humans de-advancing into a more primitive society as time passes.
* The film ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002) briefly shows an alien spacecraft trapped in ice during the [[ice age]].
** In ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016), the fifth film of the series, Scrat accidentally activates a spacecraft similar to the one from the first film and Buck discovers a building built by an advanced civilization that observed Sid in ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' and know [[astrophysics]].
* One of the ''[[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]]'' chapters depicts [[Tezcatlipoca]] as an ancient astronaut during a mission in Mexico.

When Dilbert asks what happened to the aliens after the pyramids were constructed, they move to the next exhibit, which depicts the Egyptians feasting on the aliens.
* The ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[A Pharaoh to Remember]]" features an alien culture that claims to have been taught space travel, [[mummy|mummification]] (for the purpose of [[Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy|scaring Abbott and Costello]]), and pyramid building ''by'' the ancient Egyptians (instead of this happening the other way around).
* In the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' episode "[[Waiting for God (Red Dwarf)|Waiting for God]]", [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]] states his belief in aliens having visited Earth in ancient times, asking [[Dave Lister|Lister]] how else the pyramids could have been built. Lister replies, "They had massive whips, Rimmer. Massive, massive whips."

* The animated series ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' depicts the Autobots and Decepticons as ancient astronauts crash-landing on Earth four million years ago.
** The Maximals and Predacons from ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers|Beast Wars]]'' take this theme one step further by time traveling to prehistoric Earth from the future (their present). They discover that another alien species called the Vok had already visited Earth, using it as an experiment which the Beast Wars had contaminated.
** The film ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' (2007), [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers|Megatron]] chases after a powerful piece of technology from Cybertron and ends up on prehistoric Earth. Over several decades, a secret U.S. government group reverse-engineered many modern human technologies from Megatron's dormant body.

* In an episode of ''Martin Mystery'', Martin, his stepsister, and his father are all captured by a Synth, a creature synthesized with human and alien genes (which was giving birth at the time). After looking at the cave paintings in the Synth's cave which seem to depict a UFO dropping off a strange creature on earth, Martin states it was abandoned by its "creators" some thousand years ago. It lived in secrecy until loggers got to its forest.
** In another episode of ''Martin Mystery'', Martin, Java, and Diana are sent to investigate paranormal activity at a summer camp.

*[[CJON-DT|NTV]], a television station in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], regularly shows programming centering around Captain Atlantis, an ancient astronaut espousing [[New Age]] philosophy, and his protégé, the human [[Captain Canada (comics)|Captain Canada]]. Captain Atlantis is said to be part of a godlike race of ancient aliens from the far edges of the universe who settled in the city of [[Atlantis]] (which in the context of the story was located on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]]); the rest of his race deliberately hid themselves and Atlantis from mankind to prevent humanity from using it for evil. By adopting New Age philosophies, Captain Atlantis claims humans can gain supernatural powers and eventually use them to achieve world peace.

== Music ==
* [[Chris de Burgh|Chris de Burgh's]] ''[[A Spaceman Came Travelling]]'' deals with the concept of an ancient astronaut, in this case pertaining to the Christ story.
* [[Frank Zappa]]'s "[[Inca Roads]]" (from the album ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]'') deals with Ancient Astronaut Theory. The primary lyric is "Did a vehicle come from somewhere out there just to land in the [[Andes]]? Was it round, and did it have a motor, or was it something different? Did a vehicle fly along the mountain and find a place to park itself, or did someone build a place to leave a space for such a thing to land?"

==Video games==
* The game ''Spore'' has many elements of ancient astronauts, even giving you the ability to manipulate other less developed species as a space travelling species.
* ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' features an ancient astronaut, [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Jenova|Jenova]], as the main antagonist who gives rise to [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] and SOLDIER.
* The American computer game ''SPY Fox: Some Assembly Required" playfully showed a [[flying saucer]] buried beneath the [[World's Fair]].
* In the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halopedia.org/Prehistoric_human_civilization|title=Ancient humanity - Halopedia, the Halo encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ancient humanity was a spacefaring society technologically superior to modern humanity, with many worlds colonized and contact established with several alien species. After losing a large-scale war with slightly more technologically advanced, but more wide spread species, the Forerunners, humanity was stripped of their technologies and quarantined to Earth, their home planet. For millennia, the Forerunners exercised influence over humanity's behavior, evolution, and even memories. When an invasive parasitic species threatened all sentient life, the Forerunners eventually decided that their only option was to sterilize the galaxy. Though they established automated preservation and "reseeding" technologies in order to reestablish humans and many other species across the galaxy after the sterilization, the Forerunners sacrificed themselves in order to see the plan through. Later, some of the alien species discovered remnants of Forerunner technology. While they derived many technological innovations from the artifacts, they also misinterpreted much of what they found and worshipped the extinct Forerunners as gods. Eventually regaining spacefaring technology, humans studied the Forerunner artifacts with a more scientific approach. Both the alien species and humanity were surprised to discover that the Forerunners granted humanity alone stewardship over the technology they had been left behind. The reasons for this were only made clear in the most recent novels and [[Halo 4]]. The Forerunners themselves were created by aliens far more ancient, of which the Forerunners had only a mythological understanding of.
*''[[Dark Void]]'' features a race of humanoid shape-shifters called Watchers, who ruled over ancient humans as gods, bringing technology and civilization to Earth. Their human subjects rebelled, and exiled them to the titular Dark Void, an alternate dimension that exists between Earth and the original Watcher homeworld.
* In the game ''[[Mass Effect]]'' humanity discovers a cache of alien technology buried on [[Mars]], built by an alien species known as the Protheans. The Protheans had apparently maintained a vast interstellar empire encompassing the entirety of the [[Milky Way]]; the empire collapsed suddenly and mysteriously 50,000 years ago, leaving almost no traces of its existence. It is revealed later in the game that the Protheans, along with numerous interstellar civilizations before them, had been systematically exterminated by a race of artificially intelligent machines called Reapers.
* The arcade shoot-em-up ''Xevious'' (from [[Namco]] 1983, designed by [[Masanobu Endō]]) were also deeply inspired on ancient astronaut theories.
* In ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and it's succsessors, it is gradually revealed that [[human]]ity was originally created as a slave race by the then-ruling people tentatively known as the "First Civilization" [[Aeon|eons]] prior to the game's setting. Humanity eventually revolted against their "gods" and full-scale war erupted. This race, as well as humans, were nearly wiped out by a solar flare, forcing the two to compromise a truce to ensure the survival of both. SThe First Civilization have since, as a distinct species, become extinct, though hybrid bloodlines of the two species still exist; their presence in history has been erased, leaving only remnants of their technology behind which became powerful religious artifacts (the reason behind the [[Knights Templar|Templars]]' and the [[Hashshashin|Assassins]]' ongoing war). However, the "First Civilization" did not originate from outer space, having resided on the Earth and evolved over time.
* The Cuotl in ''[[Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends]]'' is a nation of Mesoamerica-inspired tribes subjugated by four extraterrestrial beings who install themselves as deities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">'''Ashide'''  - one of the dominant general and empress clan of [[Turkic Khaganate]].

==The origin==
Ashide led his descent from some ancient [[khagan]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank E.A Sogdian Colony in Inner Mongolia. — ТР. Vol. 41, 1952, Р.332.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The representatives of clan Ashide==
The baga-tarkhan (military leader) of four [[Göktürk]] [[khagan]]s - [[Tonyukuk]] was Ashide clan origin.
And from Ashide was mother of Chinese warlord - [[An Lushan]].

==[[Tamga]] Ashide==
[[File:AshideUsunA-shi-de.gif]]

==Ashide and Ashina==
Historian [[S.G.Kjyashtorny]] said that originally [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] and Ashide together were dual system, so well known among the Turkic and [[Mongolian peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Абрамзон С.М. Формы родоплеменной организации у кочевников Средней Азии. — ТИЭ. Н. сер. Т. 14. М., 1951. ↑ Жданко Т.А. Очерки исторической этнографии каракалпаков. М.-Л., 1950 (ТИЭ, н. сер., т. 9).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Жданко Т.А. Очерки исторической этнографии каракалпаков. М.-Л., 1950 (ТИЭ, н. сер., т. 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiefs Ashide bore the title Irkin (Erkin) common to tribal leaders in the Turkic Khaganate. However, their particular position is determined by kinship with the dynasty; no coincidence that one of Irkin Ashide tegin held the title - 'the prince of the royal family, prince'. Ashide clan was not is one root, so in the ''[[Book of Tang|Tang Shu]]''{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2016}} mentioned Da Ashide and Bayan Ashide; their tamgas differ from  tamgas of Ashide.&lt;ref&gt;Liu Mau-tsai. Die chinesischen Nachrichten zur Geschichte der Ost-Türken. 1-2. Weisbaden, 1958. (101/102)&lt;/ref&gt;

To the end of the 7th-8th centuries, probably be more correct to speak about Ashide as one of the tribes of the khaganate, which together with Ashina was the main military and political support of Turkic dynasty. Ashide leaders initiated the liberation revolt of the Turkuts (679-682) against [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Кляшторный.Г. Древнетюркская надпись на каменном изваянии из Чойрэна//СНВ. Вып. XXII. М.: 1980. С. 90-102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics (Data of Y-DNA) ==
In 2015-2016 yy. in Fudan University (Shanghai), headed by ethnogenomist Shao-Qing Wen (文少卿) in China were tested to determine the Y-DNA haplogroup the representatives from aristocratic Turkic clan Ashide.

==[[Ethnonym]]==

In ancient Chinese texts "Ashide" is shaped 阿史德, for example: 阿史德 等 (translation: "They [clan of] Ashide"). Availability Form "Ashina" indicates the semantic aspect of the data forms. Character 阿 has semantics "prefix names, clan of"; Character semantics 史 has "historical, ancient '; Character semantics 德 has "a blessing and happiness." Therefore, the shape 阿史德 can translate as "the dear old [race] happiness." As can be seen, the name or semantics of Göktürks (referred hieroglyph 德 ["happiness"]). On Proto-Altaic language semantics "respected" - * p "ĕro; on the Proto-Turkic language - * er. On Proto-Altaic language semantics" ancient "- * bằǯá; on the Proto-Turkic language - * baja. On Proto-Altaic language semantics" happiness "- * kùt" á ; on Proto-Turkic language - * kut. As can be seen, the shape 阿史德 praaltaysky translated into the language as follows: "* p" ĕro bằǯá * kùt "á"; on Turkic language - "* er baja kut". Therefore, the token on Proto-Turkic language "kut" was the name of one of the dominant clan - Turkuts.

In the body of Talas inscriptions has reported Qutlugh clan. "Qutluγ (a) oγulan ïn ulatïq" - "to raise a son [of the clan] Qutlugh" (written monument Talas IX); "Qutluγ Özünčü esiz Özüge" - "Ozunchu [clan of] Qutlugh left without master Ozuge" (written monument Talas IX).

Consequently, the comparative analysis Old Chinese and Turkic languages, as well as analysis of the housing Talas written sources allows the following conclusions:

1. Form 阿史德 ["Ashide"] is the semantic aspect.

2. In the form 阿史德 ["Ashide"] hieroglyph 德 is the name of one of the dominant clan of Turkuts.

3. Form 阿史德 ["Ashide"] translated into Turkic language follows "* er baja kut" - "dear old [race] happiness"

4. Character 德 [kut] means the token "Qutlugh" - "Happy", where the affix "meadow" is the affix of belonging, referred to the original form, for example "+ molecules meadow" - "having a slave"

5. One of the dominant clan of Turkuts ("Ashide") called "Qutlugh|Kutlug"

{{homicide}}
'''Assassination''' is the killing of a prominent person, either for political or religious reasons or for payment.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary "the act of deliberately killing someone especially a public figure, usually for hire or for political reasons" (''Legal Research, Analysis and Writing'' by William H. Putman [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0nlVU6M26AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 215] and [http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive Assassination Policy Under International Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206230433/http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive |date=December 6, 2010 }}, Harvard International Review, May 6, 2006 by Kristen Eichensehr).&lt;/ref&gt;

An assassination may be prompted by religious, political, or military [[Motive (law)|motives]]; it is an act that may be done for [[contract killing|financial gain]], to [[revenge|avenge]] a grievance, from a desire to acquire [[celebrity|fame]] or [[infamy|notoriety]], or because of a military, security or insurgent group's command to carry out the [[homicide]].

{{Main|Hashshashin}}
[[File:Assassination of Nizam al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|260px|left|14th-century painting of the successful assassination of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Seljuq Empire]], by an Assassin.]]
The word ''assassin'' is often believed to derive from the word ''[[Hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also Hashishin, Hashashiyyin, or [[Assassins]]),&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').&lt;ref name="The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam"&gt;''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a group of [[Nizari]] [[Shia Muslims]] who worked against various political targets.

Founded by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], the Assassins were active in the fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in Persia from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and later expanded by capturing forts in Syria. The group killed members of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], and [[Christian]] [[Crusades|Crusader]] elite for political and religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-84403-416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.&lt;ref name="C:AH"&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=hashishiyya&amp;f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-42494-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of the verb "to assassinate" in printed English was by [[Matthew Sutcliffe]] in ''A Briefe Replie to a Certaine Odious and Slanderous Libel, Lately Published by a Seditious Jesuite'', a pamphlet printed in 1600, five years before it was used in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).&lt;ref&gt;''A briefe replie to a certaine odious and slanderous libel, lately published by a seditious Iesuite.''

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|[[Assassination of Julius Caesar]]]]

===Ancient to medieval times===

Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

In the [[Old Testament]], King [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was recorded as being assassinated by his own servants;&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 12:19-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joab]] assassinated [[Absalom]], [[King David]]'s son;&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 3:26-28 RSV&lt;/ref&gt; and King [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 32:21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. His student [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of [[Alexander the Great]]'s generals, [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink = Roger Boesche | first = Roger | last = Boesche |date=January 2003 | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.1boesche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous victims are [[Philip II of Macedon]] (336&amp;nbsp;BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman consul [[Julius Caesar]] (44&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kloWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=famous+assassinations#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Famous assassinations of history&amp;nbsp;... |publisher= |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010|author1=Johnson|first1=Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim [[Shia Imam]]s hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] king [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]] in 227&amp;nbsp;BC. Whilst many assassinations were performed by individuals or small groups, there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination. The earliest were the [[sicarii]] in 6 A.D., who predated the Middle Eastern [[assassins]] and Japanese [[ninja]]s by centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Pichtel, John, ''Terrorism and WMDs: Awareness and Response'', CRC Press (April 25, 2011) p.3-4. {{ISBN|978-1439851753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian, ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present'', Routledge (January 15, 2011), Chapter: Sicarii. 978-0765620484&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the "Curse of King Zvonimir" is based on the legend of his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf |title=FFZG.hr |format=PDF |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was killed by an [[Assassins|assassin]].

The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) were all ended by assassins.

===Modern history===
In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Russian Empire|Russia]] alone, two emperors, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and his grandson [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], were assassinated within 80 years. In the [[United Kingdom]], only one [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] has ever been [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|assassinated]]—[[Spencer Perceval]] on May 11, 1812.&lt;ref name="Gillen"&gt;M. Gillen 1972 ''Assassination of the Prime Minister: the shocking death of Spencer Perceval''. London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson {{ISBN|0-283-97881-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, a group of assassins called the [[Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu]] killed a number of people, including [[Ii Naosuke]] who was the head of administration for the Tokugawa shogunate, during the [[Boshin War]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen.

In the United States, within 100 years, four presidents—[[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]], [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|James A. Garfield]], [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley]] and [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]]—died at the hands of assassins. There have been at least [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts|20 known attempts]] on U.S. presidents' lives. [[Huey Long]], a Senator, was assassinated on September 10, 1935. [[Robert F. Kennedy]], a Senator and a presidential candidate, was also [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on June 6, 1968 in the United States.

In Austria, the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]] in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, carried out by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Serbian national and a member of the [[Serbia]]n nationalist [[Insurgency|insurgents]] ([[Black Hand (Serbia)|The Black Hand]]), is blamed for igniting [[World War I]] after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in [[World War II]] used operatives specifically trained for assassination. [[Reinhard Heydrich]] died after an attack by British-trained Czechoslovak soldiers on behalf of the Czechoslovak government in exile in [[Operation Anthropoid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/images/id_7001_8000/7419/assassination-en.pdf |title=Assassination&amp;nbsp;— Operation Arthropoid, 1941–1942 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 |last=Burian |first=Michal |author2=Aleš |format=PDF |year=2002 |publisher=Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the United States to carry out [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|a targeted attack]], killing Japanese [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] while he was travelling by plane. The Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] conducted a regular [[Operation Heads|campaign of assassinations]] against top Nazi German officials in occupied Poland. [[Adolf Hitler]] was almost [[July 20 Plot|killed by his own officers]], and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as [[Operation Foxley]], though this plan was never put into practice).

During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] leader [[Yevhen Konovalets]], [[Ignace Poretsky]], [[Fourth International]] secretary Rudolf Klement, [[Leon Trotsky]], and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) leadership in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman.

India's "Father of the Nation", [[Mahatma Gandhi]], was [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|shot to death]] on January 30, 1948 by [[Nathuram Godse]].

The African-American civil rights activist, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel (now the [[National Civil Rights Museum]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Three years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, [[Malcolm X]], was assassinated at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] on February 21, 1965. Two years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, [[Medgar Evers]], was assassinated on June 12, 1963. [[Fred Hampton]] of the [[Black Panther Party]] was assassinated on December 4, 1969.

[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], was assassinated by [[Saad Akbar]], a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of Communists and antagonism towards the [[Soviet Union]], were potential reasons for his assassination.

In 1960, [[Inejiro Asanuma]], Chairman of the [[Japan Socialist Party|Japanese Socialist Party]], was assassinated in a stabbing by an extreme rightist.

The U.S. Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]] (the [[Church Committee]]) reported in 1975 that it had found "concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm Church Committee – Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders Part III.B, page 71] from the 'history-matters.com' website. Retrieved August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major powers repudiated Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, [[Israel]], the U.S., [[Argentina]], Paraguay, [[Chile]], and other nations accused of engaging in such operations.&lt;ref&gt;John Dingles (2004) The Condor Years {{ISBN|978-1-56584-764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (who survived an assassination attempt himself) ordered the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] air raid on [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2012)|Libya]] in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Gaddafi escaped unharmed; however, his adopted daughter [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)#Casualties|Hanna]] was claimed to be one of the civilian casualties.

In the [[History of the Philippines (1965–1986)#The Fourth Republic (1981–1986)|Philippines]], the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Aquino, a former [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the [[Manila]] [[International Airport]] (now the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]) upon returning home from [[exile]]. His death thrust his widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], into the limelight and, ultimately, the presidency following the peaceful [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]].

After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, the new Islamic government of Iran began an international campaign of assassination that lasted into the 1990s. At least 162 killings in 19 countries have been linked to the senior leadership of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/No-Safe-Haven_May08.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902192858/http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/No-Safe-Haven_May08.pdf | archivedate=September 2, 2010| title=English front cover – No Safe Haven | accessdate=June 2, 2010 | format=PDF | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign came to an end after the [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations]], because a German court publicly implicated senior members of the government and issued arrest warrants for [[Ali Fallahian]], the head of the Iranian Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/Murder-at-Mykonos_Mar07.pdf |title=Mykonos front cover |format=PDF |accessdate=May 13, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100902192942/http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/Murder-at-Mykonos_Mar07.pdf| archivedate=September 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence indicates that Fallahian's personal involvement and individual responsibility for the murders were far more pervasive than his current indictment record represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/Condemned-by-Law_Nov08.pdf |title=Condemned by Law – Report 11-10-08.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=May 13, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100307043035/http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/Condemned-by-Law_Nov08.pdf| archivedate=March 7, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Ministers]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and her son [[Rajiv Gandhi]] (neither of whom were related to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was assassinated in 1948), were assassinated in 1984 and 1991 respectively. The assassinations were linked to [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and northern [[Sri Lanka]], respectively.

In [[Israel]], Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was assassinated on November 4, 1995. [[Yigal Amir]] confessed and was convicted of the crime.

Israeli tourist minister [[Rehavam Ze'evi]] was assassinated on October 17, 2001, by [[Hamdi Quran]] and three other members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)]]. The PFLP stated that the assassination was in retaliation for the August 27, 2001, killing of [[Abu Ali Mustafa]], the Secretary General of the PFLP, by the [[Israeli Air Force]] under its policy of [[Israeli targeted killings|targeted killings]].

In [[Lebanon]], the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] on February 14, 2005, prompted an investigation by the United Nations. The suggestion in the resulting ''[[Mehlis report]]'' that there was [[Syria]]n involvement, prompted the [[Cedar Revolution]], which drove Syrian troops out of Lebanon.

In [[Pakistan]], former prime minister and opposition leader [[Benazir Bhutto]] was [[Benazir Bhutto assassination|assassinated in 2007]], while running for re-election. Bhutto's assassination drew unanimous [[International reaction to the Benazir Bhutto assassination|condemnation from the international community]].&lt;ref&gt;''Benazir Bhutto shot dead at suicide bombing of rally; 20 feared dead'' – ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', Thursday December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Guinea Bissau]], President [[João Bernardo Vieira]] was assassinated in the early hours of March 2, 2009, in the capital, [[Bissau]]. Unlike typical assassinations his death was not swift; he first survived an explosion at the Presidential Villa, was then shot and wounded, and finally was butchered with machetes. His assassination was carried out by renegade soldiers who were apparently revenging the killing of General [[Tagme Na Waie]], the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Guinea Bissau, who had been killed in a bomb explosion the day before.

==Further motivations==

===As military and foreign policy doctrine===
{{See also|Manhunt (military)}}
[[File:Hokusai-sketches---hokusai-manga-vol6-crop.jpg|thumb|The functions of the [[ninja]] included [[espionage]], [[sabotage]] and assassination.]]

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500&amp;nbsp;BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also argued assassination could be useful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.

For similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.&lt;ref name="iraja"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503–539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R. Schilling | last2= Schilling | first2=Jonathan L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will "[[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]" a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:

* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).&lt;ref name="iraja"/&gt;
* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.
* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as "The Desert Fox").&lt;ref name="Skor"&gt;''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:
* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and killed between 6,000 and 41,000 people, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===As tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

==Techniques==

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]
A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.&lt;ref name="Austria"&gt;''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' – [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).&lt;ref name="SS"/&gt;

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella]. [[BBC]] World Service, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CIA]] made several [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro]], many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed [[cyanide]] ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]].

[[Basic Books]], 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00312-9}} p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 case in the UK concerned the [[Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko|assassination of Alexander Litvinenko]] who was given a lethal dose of radioactive [[polonium]]-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food.

Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko's death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20082851241951 Putin 'Deplores' Spy Death]'' – [[Sky News]] Friday November 24, 2006 {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or "[[unlawful combatant]]" who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Note that this is a different term and concept from that of "targeted violence" as used by specialists who study violence.

On the other hand, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The law of armed conflict&amp;nbsp;... – Gary D. Solis |publisher=Google Books |date=February 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 27, 2011|isbn=978-1-139-48711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  writes: "Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts".&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;  The use of the term assassination is opposed, as it denotes murder, whereas the terrorists are targeted in self-defense, and thus it is viewed as a killing, but not a crime.&lt;ref name="HOV"&gt;''[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/26/EDGK65QPC41.DTL Targeted killing is a necessary option]'', Sofaer, Abraham D., [[Hoover Institution]], March 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Abraham D. Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people call a targeted killing an "assassination," they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States&amp;nbsp;... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests&amp;nbsp;... But killings in self-defense are no more "assassinations" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.&lt;ref name="sfgate2004"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that "there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing&amp;nbsp;... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.  Assassination&amp;nbsp;... constitutes an illegal killing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QP1Bq7HVQtwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Impact+of+9/11+and+the+New+Legal+Landscape:+The+Day+That+Changed+Everything#v=onepage&amp;q=major%20difference%20between%20assassination%20and%20targeted%20killing&amp;f=false|author=Matthew J.

David|Steve David]],  Professor of International Relations at [[Johns Hopkins University]], writes:  "There are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination". [[Syracuse University College of Law|Syracuse Law]] Professor William Banks and [[George Washington University Law School|GW Law]] Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write:  "Targeted killing of terrorists is&amp;nbsp;... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination", Rory Miller writes:  "Targeted killing&amp;nbsp;... is not 'assassination'". Associate Professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: "Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/cwrint36&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|author=[[Amos Guiora]] |title=Targeted Killing as Active Self-Defense |publisher=36 Case W.

Rich. L. Rev.'' 667 (2002–03). Retrieved October 89, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, "A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article "By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860.html |accessdate=March 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120314201721/http%3A//www%2Ecarnegiecouncil%2Eorg/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860%2Ehtml |archivedate= March 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Targeted killing has become a frequent tactic of the [[United States]] and [[Israel]] in their fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&amp;pg=PA542&amp;dq=%22targeted+killing%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22targeted%20killing%22&amp;f=false |title=The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War|author= [[Gary D.

[[File:Sattar Bodyguard.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.5|This bodyguard was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] during [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha#Death|Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha's assassination]] in 2007]]
One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing [[bodyguard]]s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' – Fein, Robert A. &amp; Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]].

[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil]]
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&amp;nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher= [[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Secret Service]] protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Pelley |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/14/60II/main171812.shtml |title=Mind of the Assassin |publisher= CBS 60&amp;nbsp;Minutes II |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate= March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bēot''' is [[Old English]] for a ritualized boast, vow, threat, or promise.&lt;ref name="Einarsson 1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einarsson|first1=Stefán|title=Old English ''Beot'' and Old Icelandic ''Heitstrenging''|journal=PMLA|date=1934|volume=49|issue=4|pages=980|JSTOR=458120|doi=10.2307/458120|quote=For these and other instances of different meaning, see the dictionaries. They give three chief meanings: (1) a threatening, menace; (2) danger; and (3) boasting promise. It seems that the third one is the most usual, and logically the meanings would seem to have developed in the order: promise—boasting—threatening—danger.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hall 1960 p42"&gt;[[Clark Hall, John R.]] ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary''. Cambridge University Press, 1960, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of a ''bēot'' is to proclaim one's acceptance of a seemingly impossible challenge in order to gain tremendous glory for actually accomplishing it.

Anglo-Saxon warriors would usually deliver ''bēot''s in the [[mead hall]] the night before a military engagement&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 976-978&lt;/ref&gt; or during the battle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 978-979&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a typical warrior may boast that he will be the first to strike a blow in a battle, that he would claim a renowned sword from an enemy warrior as spoil of battle, that he will slay a particular monster that has been wreaking havoc on a town or village, and so on. ''Bēot''s were usually accompanied by grand stories of one's past glorious deeds. Although other cultures and times might disdain boasting as a sign of arrogance, or sinful pride, the pagan Anglo-Saxons highly regarded such behavior as a positive sign of one's determination, bravery, and character.

Examples of the ''bēot'' can be seen throughout the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', such as when Beowulf vows to fight [[Grendel]] without using any weapons or armor.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Old English]] word ''bēot'' comes from earlier ''bíhát'' meaning ‘promise’. The original noun-form of ''bēot'' corresponds to the verb ''bi-'', ''be-ˈhátan''. A shifting of the stress from ''bíhát'' to ''bi-ˈhát'', on analogy of the verb, gave the late [[Old English]] ''beˈhát'', from which the [[Middle English]] word ''behote'' derives.&lt;ref&gt;http://oed.com/view/Entry/17815?redirectedFrom=beot# Retrieved 06FEB2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of a ''bēot''==
# '''Pledge''' - The individual pledges to endeavor a specific challenge&lt;ref&gt;[[Beowulf]], lines 679-685&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2510-2525&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Einarsson 1934 p975-976"&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 975-976, "In both instances we have to do with a solemn promise to carry out a feat—a fight—under very difficult circumstances, partly self-imposed to add glory"&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Speculation of outcomes''' - The individual predicts two possible outcomes—success or failure—and elaborates the effects of either outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, line 687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2535-2537&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Commissioning to a higher power''' - The individual commissions the outcome of the challenge to a higher power (e.g. ''God'', ''fate'').&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 685-687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2526-2527&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3730">'''Celia Griffin''' (1841 &amp;ndash; March 1847), Irish famine victim. 

Griffin was born and raised on the Martin estate in [[Connemara]], being a native of Corindulla, near Ross. The family were badly hit by the famine, and in February 1847 walked the thirty miles to Galway in search of relief. "However, many city dwellers shunned these refugees arriving amongst them, a situation born more out of fear of contacting disease rather than selfishness or indifference." [http://galwayindependent.com/stories/item/3041/2012-27/Celia-Griffin]

Brother Paul O'Connor ran the Orphans' Breakfast Institute in Lombard Street, where Celia and her siblings were fed. However, more and more people arrived each day, and the Institute could not feed them all. 

What became of Griffin's parents is unknown. She and her two sisters were taken into the Presentation Convent on Presentation Road in the second week of March when Celia collapsed on the street. Attempts by the nuns to save her failed and she died as a result of the effects of starvation. An inquest into her death was held on Thursday 11 March 1847. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;" An inquest was held on Thursday last, before Michael Perrin, Esq., D.C., at the Presentation Convent, on view of the body of Celia Griffin, a girl about six years of age, from the village of Corindulla, near Ross, in this county. It appeared in evidence that the poor creature had been reduced to extreme poverty and that the family to whom she belonged, eight in number, were in the same pitiful condition. She had been recommended to the Ladies of the Presentation, by Rev. George Usher, as a fit object for relief, and accordingly she and her two sisters received a daily breakfast at that excellent Institute. They met Mr Usher on the Rahoon road about a fortnight ago, but famine had so preyed upon her feeble constitution, that, on the morning of Wednesday, she was unable to taste food of any description – so that on the post mortem examination made by Doctor Staunton, there was not a particle found in her stomach."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"She with her father, mother, brothers, and sisters, came to Galway about six weeks ago, in the hope of obtaining some charitable relief, and during that period have been begging in the streets, and about the country. The parents of the deceased formerly resided on the estate of [[Thomas Barnwall Martin|Thomas Martin]], Esq, MP. When Doctor Staunton was called on he found deceased is a state of inanition, except an occasional convulsive action of the muscles, and her body might be said to be literally skin and bone – with all the appearance of starvation. She was so exhausted, as not to be able to use the food supplied to her. The Jury found that her death was caused for want of the common necessaries of life, before she received relief at the Presentation Convent."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the 4 July 2012 the Galway Famine Ship Memorial was dedicated at the Celia Griffin Memorial Park at Grattan Beach, Galway. According to the [[Galway Independent]], "The unveiling of the monument will be Galway’s tribute to Celia Griffin and the many thousands of children like her who perished in the Famine, and also to the ships and crews which carried so many of our people to safety ... [as] ... Celia Griffin has come to symbolise all the children who lost their lives in the Great Famine."

The centre's founding was announced in November, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;AP News, [https://www.yahoo.com/news/cambridge-study-technologys-risk-humans-190948884--finance.html Cambridge to study technology's risk to humans], 25 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name stems from Oxford philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]]'s concept of ''existential risk'', or risk "where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential".&lt;ref name="bostrom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date=2002 |title=Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.pdf |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=9 |issue=1 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes technologies that might permanently deplete humanity's resources or block further scientific progress, in addition to ones that put the species itself at risk.

Among the [[global catastrophic risks]] to be studied by CSER are those stemming from possible future advances in artificial intelligence. The potential dangers of [[artificial general intelligence]] have been highlighted in early discussions of CSER, being likened in some press coverage to that of a robot uprising à la ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name="technorati"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technorati.com/technology/article/risk-of-a-terminator-style-robot/|title=Risk of a Terminator Style Robot Uprising to be Studied|last=Gaskell|first=Adi|date=27 November 2012|work=[[Technorati]]|accessdate=2 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130053807/http://technorati.com/technology/article/risk-of-a-terminator-style-robot/|archivedate=30 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/02/ai-robots-google-car-humans-john-naughton|title=Could robots soon add to mankind's existential threats?|last=Naughton|first=John|date=2 December 2012|work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price explained to the AFP news agency, "It seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology". He added that when this happens "we're no longer the smartest things around," and will risk being at the mercy of "machines that are not malicious, but machines whose interests don't include us".&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hui|first=Sylvia|title=Cambridge to study technology's risks to humans |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cambridge-study-technologys-risk-humans |publisher=Associated Press |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price has also mentioned [[synthetic biology]] as being dangerous because "[as a result of] new innovations, the steps necessary to produce a weaponized virus or other bioterror agent have been dramatically simplified" and that consequently “the number of individuals needed to wipe us all out is declining quite steeply.”&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|title = Rise of the machines: Cambridge University to study technology’s ‘existential risk’ to mankind |url = http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/29/rise-of-the-machines-cambridge-university-to-study-technologys-existential-risk-to-mankind/ |work = Time |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |first=Kharunya|last=Paramaguru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cser.org/emerging-risks-from-technology/developments-in-biotechnology/|title=Biological and Biotechnological Risks|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
CSER has been covered in many different newspapers (particularly in the United Kingdom),&lt;ref name = "herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name='technorati' /&gt;&lt;ref name='guardian' /&gt;&lt;ref name = "AP" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "time" /&gt;&lt;ref name='ibtimes' /&gt;&lt;ref name="media page"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cser.org/media-coverage | title=CSER media coverage | publisher=Centre for the Study of Existential Risk | accessdate=19 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630042953/http://cser.org/media-coverage/ | archivedate=30 June 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly covering different topics of interest. University of Cambridge Research News' coverage of it focuses on risks from artificial general intelligence.&lt;ref name=SFR&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/humanitys-last-invention-and-our-uncertain-future | title = Humanity's Last Invention and Our Uncertain Future | work=University of Cambridge Research News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSER was profiled in the special [[Frankenstein]] issue of ''Science'' in 2018. &lt;ref name="ScienceMag"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6372/152|title=Taming the monsters of tomorrow||first1=Kai|last1=Kupferschmidt|journal=Science|date=2018-01-12|doi=10.1126/science.359.6372.152}}&lt;/ref&gt; On existential risks to humanity, many scientists think the only serious one is the risk of global nuclear war. The Science article quoted [[Joyce Tait]] of the [[Imogen Institute]] in Edinburgh: "There is nothing [else] on the horizon." &lt;ref name="ScienceMag"/&gt;

'''Christopher Cornelius''' "'''Chris'''" '''Byrd''' (born August 15, 1970) is an American former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1993 to 2009. He is a two-time world [[heavyweight]] champion, having first won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title in 2000 after an upset [[corner stoppage]] over then-undefeated [[Vitali Klitschko]]. In his first title defense later that year, he lost to Vitali's brother [[Wladimir Klitschko]]. In 2002, Byrd defeated [[Evander Holyfield]] to win the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] heavyweight title for his second reign as world champion. He made four successful defenses until losing his title again to Wladimir Klitschko in a 2006 rematch. Byrd's cousin, [[Lamon Brewster]], has a shared history with Wladimir Klitschko: Brewster defeated him in 2004, but lost in a 2007 rematch.

As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Byrd represented the United States at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and won a silver medal in the [[middleweight]] division. He is also a three-time [[United States national amateur boxing championships|national amateur champion]], winning the [[light middleweight]] title in 1989, and the middleweight title in 1991 and 1992.

==Early life==
Chris Byrd was the youngest of eight children growing up in [[Flint, Michigan]]. He began boxing at age 5, training in his father (Joe Sr.)'s Joe Byrd Boxing Academy.  His father continued to train and manage Byrd as a professional.  Byrd attended [[Flint Northwestern High School]].

==Amateur career==
Byrd began competing in the ring at age 10, and compiled an impressive 275 wins in the amateur ranks. He was a three-time U.S. amateur champion (1989, 1991, and 1992). He was on the 1991 U.S. National boxing Team that became the first (and only) U.S. team to score a tie against the heralded Cuban team.
Byrd won the silver medal in the 1992 [[Barcelona]] summer [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] as a [[middleweight]], losing to [[Cuba]]'s [[Ariel Hernández (boxer)|Ariel Hernández]] in the final.

==Professional career==

===1993–1998: early career===

Byrd turned professional on January 28, 1993, knocking out 10 of his first 13 opponents. Byrd moved up to [[heavyweight]] three fights into his professional career.

Byrd remained undefeated for his first 26 fights, knocking off then-notable opponents like [[Phil Jackson (boxer)|Phil Jackson]], [[Lionel Butler]], [[Uriah Grant]], [[Bert Cooper]], [[Craig Peterson]], [[Frankie Swindell]], [[Jimmy Thunder]], undefeated [[Eliecer Castillo]] and [[Ross Puritty]].

===1999: Byrd vs. Ibeabuchi, comeback victories===
However, in 1999, Byrd's undefeated record came to a dead end when he fought undefeated [[Ike Ibeabuchi]]. With 48 seconds left in the fifth round, a left-handed [[bolo punch]] followed with a right hook sent Byrd to the canvas, face first.

===2000: first world title, facing the Klitschkos===
{{Main article|Vitali Klitschko vs. Chris Byrd|Chris Byrd vs. Wladimir Klitschko}}
During the last week of March 2000, Byrd was offered the chance to be the replacement (for [[Donovan Ruddock]]) against undefeated champion [[Vitali Klitschko]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] (Klitschko's adopted home country) for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Heavyweight Title. He therefore had only seven days to prepare for the fight (not the customary 6–12 weeks). Byrd struggled greatly in the fight, trailing after nine rounds by scores of 88–83 (on two cards) and 89–82 (on one card), i.e. losing seven or eight of those rounds. However, Klitschko severely injured his shoulder and was unable to continue after the ninth round. The injury that Klitschko suffered was a torn shoulder rotator cuff, which required major surgery and a 7-month lay-off. Despite trailing on all three of the judges' scorecards, Byrd walked away the winner by a [[technical knockout]] due to the injury to Klitschko.

Six months later, Byrd was back in Germany to defend the title against [[Wladimir Klitschko]], Vitali's younger, more agile brother. Twelve rounds later, Byrd had lost a lopsided unanimous decision and the WBO belt after being knocked down twice.

===2001–2002: comeback victories, second world title===
{{Main article|Chris Byrd vs. Evander Holyfield}}
Byrd returned to the U.S., signed with [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and beat [[Maurice Harris]] to win the United States Boxing Association heavyweight belt in Madison Square Garden. He was now a top-five contender for the IBF title. After winning his next match (a title defense against New Zealand's top contender [[David Tua]]) Byrd eventually received his mandatory shot at the vacant IBF world Heavyweight Championship against [[Evander Holyfield]] in [[Atlantic City]]. On December 14, 2002, Byrd won a unanimous decision and the IBF title.

===2003–2005: four successful title defenses===
Byrd has successfully defended the IBF belt against: [[Fres Oquendo]] in 2003 (match ended in a controversial win for Byrd in which most people felt Oquendo won), a highly entertaining draw with [[Andrzej Gołota|"Andrew" Golota]] and a decision win over friend [[Jameel McCline]] in 2004, and [[DaVarryl Williamson]] in 2005. Byrd's fight with Golota did 75,000 buys on Pay per View&lt;ref&gt;https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2004-05-11-heavyweights_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006: Klitschko rematch===
{{Main article|Chris Byrd vs. Wladimir Klitschko II}}

On April 22, 2006, Byrd faced [[Wladimir Klitschko]] for the second time. Byrd was making his fifth defense of his IBF title and the fight was also sanctioned by the  [[International Boxing Organization]] for its title, which had been vacated upon the retirement of [[Lennox Lewis]]. The fight took place at [[SAP Arena]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]]. Byrd was heavily dominated throughout the fight, was down in the fifth, and again in the seventh. Referee Wayne Kelly stopped the fight after the second knockdown when Byrd had an open cut near his eyes. Klitschko won in a TKO

===2007–2010: Povetkin bout, move to light heavyweight, and retirement===
After losing to [[Alexander Povetkin]], Byrd would drop about 40 pounds to return to the light heavyweight division. He fought [[Shaun George (boxer)|Shaun George]] on May 16, 2008, at the [[Thomas and Mack Center]] in Las Vegas. Byrd was dropped by George in round one and rocked again in round two. George then hammered Byrd with his right hand at will, finally flooring Byrd twice in the ninth round. Byrd beat the count after the first knockdown, but was then battered down again and the bout was waved off by the referee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines//EkEpAApuFFAtKlReLa.html] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Byrd officially announced his retirement from boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxing247.com/weblog/archives/128485|title=Chris Byrd: Nobody beats Wladimir Klitschko right now|work=eastsideboxing.com|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2365">'''Coccas''' ({{lang-el|Κόκκας}}, died 552) was an [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] soldier who deserted to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogoths]] during the final stages of the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]]. [[Procopius]] calls him "a Roman soldier" and "a man of the Gothic army".{{sfn|Amory|2003|p=368}} His name is not [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and might be [[Thracian language|Thracian]].{{sfn|Amory|2003|p=368}}

Coccas was part of Ostrogothic king [[Totila]]'s army at the [[Battle of Taginae]] in June/July 552. He is described as a cavalryman of great physical strength. In order to gain time for the arrival of 2,000 reinforcements led by [[Teia]], Coccas rode towards the Romans and requested them to send forth a champion to engage him in [[single combat]]. [[Anzalas]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] retainer of the Roman commander [[Narses]], accepted the challenge. Coccas charged at Anzalas and aimed at his stomach, but at the last moment, Anzalas swerved his horse and stabbed Coccas in the side, mortally wounding him.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=265}} Although Coccas' sacrifice gained him the necessary time for the arrival of Teia, Totila died in the ensuing battle, which was a disaster for the Goths.{{sfn|Bury|1958|pp=265ff.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56806">In [[academia]], '''computational immunology''' is a [[field of science]] that encompasses high-throughput [[genomic]] and [[bioinformatics]] approaches to [[immunology]]. The field's main aim is to convert immunological data into computational problems, solve these problems using [[mathematical]] and computational approaches and then convert these results into immunologically meaningful interpretations.

== Introduction ==

The [[immune system]] is a complex system of the human body and understanding it is one of the most challenging topics in biology. Immunology research is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the defense of human body and to develop drugs for immunological diseases and maintain health. Recent findings in genomic and proteomic technologies have transformed the immunology research drastically. Sequencing of the [[Human genome|human]] and other [[model organism]] [[genome]]s has produced increasingly large volumes of data relevant to immunology research and at the same time huge amounts of functional and clinical data are being reported in the scientific literature and stored in clinical records. Recent advances in [[bioinformatic]]s or [[computational biology]] were helpful to understand and organize these large scale data and gave rise to new area that is called '''''Computational immunology''''' or '''''immunoinformatics'''''.

Computational immunology is a branch of bioinformatics and it is based on similar concepts and tools, such as [[sequence alignment]] and [[protein structure]] prediction tools. [[Immunomics]] is a discipline like [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]]. It is a science, which specifically combines [[Immunology]] with [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]] for large-scale analysis of immune system functions. It aims to study the complex [[protein–protein interaction]]s and networks and allows a better understanding of [[immune response]]s and their role during normal, diseased and reconstitution states. Computational immunology is a part of immunomics, which is focused on analyzing large scale experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tong JC, Ren EC |title=Immunoinformatics: current trends and future directions |journal=Drug Discov.

== History ==

Computational immunology began over 90 years ago with the theoretic modeling of malaria epidemiology. At that time, the emphasis was on the use of mathematics to guide the study of disease transmission. Since then, the field has expanded to cover all other aspects of immune system processes and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ross, R. |authorlink=Ronald Ross |title=An application of the theory of probabilities to the study of a priori pathometry. Part I |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=92 |issue=638 |pages=204–230 |date=1 February 1916 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1916.0007 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/92/638/204.full.pdf+html |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immunological database ==

After the recent advances in sequencing and proteomics technology, there have been many fold increase in generation of molecular and immunological data. The data are so diverse that they can be categorized in different databases according to their use in the research. Until now there are total 31 different immunological databases noted in the [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) Database Collection], which are given in the following table, together with some more immune related databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 Oxford Journals | Life Sciences | Nucleic Acids Research | Database Summary Paper Categories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The information given in the table is taken from the database descriptions in [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 NAR Database Collection].

Attempts are being made for the extraction of interesting and complex patterns from non-structured text documents in the immunological domain. Such as categorization of allergen cross-reactivity information,&lt;ref name=Miotto05/&gt; identification of cancer-associated gene variants and the classification of immune epitopes.

Immunoinformatics is using the basic bioinformatics tools such as ClustalW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson JD, Higgins DG, Gibson TJ |title=CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=22 |issue=22 |pages=4673–80 |date=November 1994 |pmid=7984417 |pmc=308517 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7984417 |doi=10.1093/nar/22.22.4673}}&lt;/ref&gt; BLAST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altschul SF, Madden TL, Schäffer AA |title=Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=25 |issue=17 |pages=3389–402 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9254694 |pmc=146917 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9254694 |doi=10.1093/nar/25.17.3389|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TreeView, as well as specialized immunoinformatics tools, such as EpiMatrix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elfaki|first=ME|title=Immunogenicity and immune modulatory effects of in silico predicted L. donovani candidate peptide vaccines|journal=Human Vaccines and Immunotheraputics|date=24 Aug 2012|pmid=22922767|doi=10.4161/hv.21881|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1769–74|pmc=3656064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Groot|first=AS|title=HIV vaccine development by computer assisted design: the GAIA vaccine|journal=Vaccine|date=March 2005|pmid=15755584|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.01.097|volume=23|issue=17–18|pages=2136–48|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMGT/V-QUEST for IG and TR sequence analysis, IMGT/ Collier-de-Perles and IMGT/StructuralQuery&lt;ref&gt;Kaas, Q. &amp; Lefranc, M.

There are also some computational models which focus on protein–protein interactions and networks. There are also tools which are used for T and B cell epitope mapping, proteasomal cleavage site prediction, and TAP– peptide prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montañez R, Navas-Delgado I, Medina MA, Aldana-Montes JF, Sánchez-Jiménez F |title=Information integration of protein-protein interactions as essential tools for immunomics |journal=Cell.

Computational immunology tools is the game between experimental data and mathematically designed computational tools.

== Applications ==

=== Allergies ===
[[Allergy|Allergies]], while a critical subject of immunology, also vary considerably among individuals and sometimes even among genetically similar individuals. The assessment of protein allergenic potential focuses on three main aspects: (i) immunogenicity; (ii) cross-reactivity; and (iii) clinical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oehlschlager S, Reece P, Brown A |title=Food allergy—towards predictive testing for novel foods |journal=Food Addit Contam |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=1099–107 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11761121 |doi=10.1080/02652030110050131 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunogenicity is due to responses of an [[IgE]] [[antibody]]-producing B cell and/or of a [[T cell]] to a particular [[allergen]]. Therefore, immunogenicity studies focus mainly on identifying recognition sites of [[B-cells]] and T-cells for allergens. The three-dimensional structural properties of allergens control their allergenicity.

The use of immunoinformatics tools can be useful to predict protein allergenicity and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the [[Codex alimentarius]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/ CODEX Alimentarius: Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li KB, Issac P, Krishnan A |title=Predicting allergenic proteins using wavelet transform |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=20 |issue=16 |pages=2572–8 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15117757 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bth286 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15117757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases and host responses ===

In the study of infectious diseases and host responses, the mathematical and computer models are a great help. These models were very useful in characterizing the behavior and spread of infectious disease, by understanding the dynamics of the pathogen in the host and the mechanisms of host factors which aid pathogen persistence. Examples include ''Plasmodium falciparum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Noort SP, Nunes MC, Weedall GD, Hviid L, Gomes MG |title=Immune selection and within-host competition can structure the repertoire of variant surface antigens in ''Plasmodium falciparum''—a mathematical model |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=e9778 |year=2010 |pmid=20339540 |pmc=2842302 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nematode infection in ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan MS, Isham VS |title=A stochastic model of schistosomiasis immuno-epidemiology |journal=Math Biosci |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=179–98 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9711049 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025556498100147 |doi=10.1016/S0025-5564(98)10014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has been done in understanding immune responses to various pathogens by integrating genomics
and proteomics with bioinformatics strategies. Many exciting developments in large-scale screening of pathogens are currently taking place. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801103537/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)] has initiated an endeavor for systematic mapping of B and T cell epitopes of category A-C pathogens. These pathogens include ''Bacillus anthracis'' (anthrax), ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin (botulism), ''Variola major'' (smallpox), ''Francisella tularensis'' (tularemia), viral hemorrhagic fevers, ''Burkholderia pseudomallei'', ''Staphylococcus enterotoxin'' B, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, Chikungunya virus etc. Rule-based systems have been reported for the automated extraction and curation of influenza A records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miotto O, Tan TW, Brusic V |title=Rule-based knowledge aggregation for large-scale protein sequence analysis of influenza A viruses |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=9 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S7 |year=2008 |pmid=18315860 |pmc=2259408 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-S1-S7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development would lead to the development of an algorithm which would help to identify the conserved regions of pathogen sequences and in turn would be useful for vaccine development. This would be helpful in limiting the spread of infectious disease. Examples include a method for identification of vaccine targets from protein regions of conserved HLA binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsen LR, Simon C, Kudahl UJ, Bagger FO, Winther O, Reinherz EL, Zhang GL, Brusic V |title=A computational method for identification of vaccine targets from protein regions of conserved human leukocyte antigen binding |journal=BMC Medical Genomics |volume=8(Suppl 4) |issue=S1 |pages= S1|year=2015 |pmid= 26679766|pmc=4682376 |doi=10.1186/1755-8794-8-S4-S1 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682376/pdf/1755-8794-8-S4-S1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computational assessment of cross-reactivity of broadly neutralizing antibodies against viral pathogens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun J, Kudahl UJ, Simon C, Cao Z, Reinherz EL, Brusic V |title=Large-Scale Analysis of B-Cell Epitopes on Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin – Implications for Cross-Reactivity of Neutralizing Antibodies |journal=Frontiers in Immunology |volume=5 |issue=38 |pages= 38|year=2014 |pmid= 24570677|pmc=3916768 |doi=10.3389/fimmu.2014.00038 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3916768/pdf/fimmu-05-00038.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These examples illustrate the power of immunoinformatics applications to help solve complex problems in public health. Immunoinformatics could accelerate the discovery process dramatically and potentially shorten the time required for vaccine development. Immunoinformatics tools have been used to design the vaccine against Dengue virus &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali M, Pandey RK, Khatoon N, Narula A, Mishra A, Prajapati VK |title=Exploring dengue genome to construct a multi-epitope based subunit vaccine by utilizing immunoinformatics approach to battle against dengue infection |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9232 |year=2017 |pmid=28835708 |pmc=5569093 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09199-w |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09199-w}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leishmania &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khatoon N, Pandey RK, Prajapati VK |title=Exploring Leishmania secretory proteins to design B and T cell multi-epitope subunit vaccine using immunoinformatics approach |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=8285 |year=2017 |pmid=28811600 |pmc=5557753 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-08842-w |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08842-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immune system function ===

Using this technology it is possible to know the model behind immune system. It has been used to model T-cell-mediated suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=León K, Peréz R, Lage A, Carneiro J |title=Modelling T-cell-mediated suppression dependent on interactions in multicellular conjugates |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology|J.

There are also several models which are helpful in understanding the nature of specificity in immune network and immunogenicity.

For example, it was useful to examine the functional relationship between TAP peptide transport and HLA class I antigen presentation.&lt;ref name="model"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brusic V, van Endert P, Zeleznikow J, Daniel S, Hammer J, Petrovsky N |title=A neural network model approach to the study of human TAP transporter |journal=In Silico Biol. (Gedrukt) |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=109–21 |year=1999 |pmid=11471244 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500791
}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence the ability of a particular peptide to gain access to the MHC class I pathway. Artificial neural network (ANN), a computer model was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.&lt;ref name="model"/&gt;

There exist also methods which integrate peptide prediction tools with computer simulations that can provide detailed information on the immune response dynamics specific to the given pathogen's peptides 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rapin N, Lund O, Bernaschi M, Castiglione F. |title=Computational immunology meets bioinformatics: the use of prediction tools for molecular binding in the simulation of the immune system. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e9862|date=2010  |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009862|pmid=20419125 |pmc=2855701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.


  
=== Cancer Informatics ===

Cancer is the result of somatic mutations which provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaminker JS, Zhang Y, Watanabe C, Zhang Z |title=CanPredict: a computational tool for predicting cancer-associated missense mutations |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=35 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W595–8 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17537827 |pmc=1933186 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm405 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17537827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly. Protein–protein interaction networks provide valuable information on tumorigenesis in humans. Cancer proteins exhibit a network topology that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jonsson PF, Bates PA |title=Global topological features of cancer proteins in the human interactome |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=18 |pages=2291–7 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16844706 |pmc=1865486 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btl390 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16844706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun J, Zhao Z |title=A comparative study of cancer proteins in the human protein-protein interaction network |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=11 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=S5 |year=2010 |pmid=21143787 |pmc=2999350 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-11-S3-S5 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11%20Suppl%203/S5 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunoinformatics have been useful in increasing success of tumour vaccination.

Other simulation tools use predicted cancer peptides to forecast immune specific anticancer responses that is dependent on the specified HLA&lt;ref name="woelke"/&gt;.
These resources are likely to grow significantly in the near future and immunoinformatics will be a major growth area in this domain.

==Study and importance==

Cosmic dust was once solely an annoyance to astronomers, as it obscures objects they wish to observe. When [[infrared astronomy]] began, the dust particles were observed to be significant and vital components of astrophysical processes. Their analysis can reveal information about phenomena like the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Natalie | last = Starkey | title = Your House is Full of Space Dust – It Reveals the Solar System's Story | date = 22 November 2013 | url = http://www.space.com/23712-your-house-is-full-of-space-dust-it-reveals-the-solar-system-s-story.html | work = Space.com | accessdate = 2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, cosmic dust can drive the mass loss when a [[star]] is [[Stellar evolution#The later years and death of stars|nearing the end of its life]], play a part in the early stages of [[star formation]], and form [[planet]]s. In the [[Solar System]], dust plays a major role in the [[zodiacal light]], [[Saturn]]'s [[B Ring]] [[spokes]], the outer diffuse [[planetary ring]]s at [[Jupiter]], Saturn, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], and [[comet]]s.
[[File:Three Bands of Light.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zodiacal light]] caused by cosmic dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Bands of Light|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1614a/|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[interdisciplinary]] study of dust brings together different scientific fields: [[physics]] ([[solid state physics|solid-state]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]], surface physics, [[statistical physics]], [[thermal physics]]), [[fractal mathematics]], [[surface chemistry]] on dust grains) [[meteoritics]], as well as every branch of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref name="Grün"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Grün|title=Interplanetary dust|date= 2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3-540-42067-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWRKx_QulUcC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=astronomy++pressure+interplanetary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These disparate research areas can be linked by the following theme: the cosmic dust particles evolve cyclically; chemically, physically and dynamically. The evolution of dust traces out paths in which the Universe recycles material, in processes analogous to the daily recycling steps with which many people are familiar: production, storage, processing, collection, consumption, and discarding. 

Observations and measurements of cosmic dust in different regions provide an important insight into the Universe's recycling processes; in the clouds of the diffuse [[interstellar medium]], in [[molecular cloud]]s, in the [[circumstellar dust]] of [[young stellar object]]s, and in [[planetary systems]] such as the [[Solar System]], where astronomers consider dust as in its most recycled state. The astronomers accumulate observational ‘snapshots’ of dust at different stages of its life and, over time, form a more complete movie of the Universe's complicated recycling steps.

Parameters such as the particle's initial motion, material properties, intervening [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[magnetic field]] determined the dust particle's arrival at the dust detector. Slightly changing any of these parameters can give significantly different dust dynamical behavior. Therefore, one can learn about where that object came from, and what is (in) the intervening medium.

== Detection methods ==
[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|250px|Cosmic dust of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] as revealed in infrared light by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].]]

Cosmic dust can be detected by indirect methods that utilize the [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiative]] properties of the cosmic dust particles.

Cosmic dust can also be detected directly ('in-situ') using a variety of collection methods and from a variety of collection locations. Estimates of the daily influx of extraterrestrial material entering the Earth's atmosphere range between 5 and 300 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[NASA]] collects samples of star dust particles in the Earth's atmosphere using plate collectors under the wings of stratospheric-flying [[airplane]]s. Dust samples are also collected from surface deposits on the large Earth ice-masses (Antarctica and Greenland/the Arctic) and in deep-sea sediments.

[[Donald E. Brownlee|Don Brownlee]] at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle first reliably identified the extraterrestrial nature of collected dust particles in the latter 1970s. Another source is the [[meteorite]]s, which contain [[#Stardust|stardust]] extracted from them. Stardust grains are solid refractory pieces of individual presolar stars. They are recognized by their extreme isotopic compositions, which can only be isotopic compositions within evolved stars, prior to any mixing with the interstellar medium. These grains condensed from the stellar matter as it cooled while leaving the star.

In interplanetary space, dust detectors on planetary spacecraft have been built and flown, some are presently flying, and more are presently being built to fly. The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10–40&amp;nbsp;km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector). Over the years dust detectors have measured, among others, the impact light flash, acoustic signal and impact ionisation. Recently the dust instrument on [[Stardust Mission|Stardust]] captured particles intact in low-density [[aerogel]].

Dust detectors in the past flew on the [[HEOS-2]], ''[[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', ''[[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]]'', and ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' space missions, on the Earth-orbiting [[LDEF]], [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]], and Gorid satellites, and some scientists have utilized the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'' spacecraft as giant [[Langmuir probe]]s to directly sample the cosmic dust. Presently dust detectors are flying on the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'', ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'', [[PROBA|Proba]], ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'', ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'', and the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft. The collected dust at Earth or collected further in space and returned by sample-return space missions is then analyzed by dust scientists in their respective laboratories all over the world. One large storage facility for cosmic dust exists at the NASA Houston JSC.

Infrared light can penetrate the cosmic dust clouds, allowing us to peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies. [[NASA]]'s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] is the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space. The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility) was launched into space by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. During its mission, Spitzer will obtain images and spectra by detecting the infrared energy, or heat, radiated by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. The findings from the Spitzer already revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. A recent report from a Spitzer team shows some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Markwick-Kemper|author2=Gallagher, S.

Another detection mechanism is polarimetry. Dust grains are not spherical and tend to align to interstellar magnetic fields, preferentially polarising starlight that passes through dust clouds. In nearby interstellar space, where cosmic reddening is not sensitive enough to be detected, high precision optical polarimetry has been used to glean the structure of dust within the [[Local Bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The linear polarization of Southern bright stars measured at the parts-per-million level | last=Cotton | first=D.

==Radiative properties==

A dust particle interacts with [[electromagnetic radiation]] in a way that depends on its [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]], the [[wavelength]] of the electromagnetic radiation, and on the nature of the grain: its [[refractive index]], size, etc. The radiation process for an individual grain is called its ''[[emissivity]]'', dependent on the grain's ''efficiency factor''. Furthermore, we have to specify whether the emissivity process is [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or [[polarization (waves)|polarisation]]. In the radiation emission curves, several important signatures identify the composition of the emitting or absorbing dust particles.

Dust particles can scatter light nonuniformly. Forward-scattered light means that light is redirected slightly by [[diffraction]] off its path from the star/sunlight, and back-scattered light is reflected light.

The scattering and extinction ("dimming") of the radiation gives useful information about the dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter in forward-scattered visible light than in back-scattered visible light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.

The scattering of light from dust grains in long exposure visible photographs is quite noticeable in [[reflection nebula]]e, and gives clues about the individual particle's light-scattering properties. In X-ray wavelengths, many scientists are investigating the scattering of X-rays by interstellar dust, and some have suggested that [[Astrophysical X-ray source|astronomical X-ray sources]] would possess diffuse haloes, due to the dust.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith RK|author2=Edgar RJ|author3=Shafer RA|title=The X-ray halo of GX 13+1|journal=Astrophys.

==Stardust==
{{main|Presolar grains}}
Stardust grains (also called [[presolar grains]] by meteoriticists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = E. | date = 1998 | title = Stellar nucleosynthesis and the isotopic composition of premolar grains from primitive meteorites | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 147–188 | doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.26.1.147|bibcode = 1998AREPS..26..147Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are contained within meteorites, from which they are extracted in terrestrial laboratories. Stardust was a component of the dust in the interstellar medium before its incorporation into meteorites. The meteorites have stored those stardust grains ever since the meteorites first assembled within the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Formation|planetary accretion disk]] more than four billion years ago. So-called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are especially fertile reservoirs of stardust. Each stardust grain existed before the Earth was formed. ''Stardust'' is a scientific term referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars and incorporated into the cloud from which the Solar System condensed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald D. Clayton,  Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Moon &amp; Planets 19, 109 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain. These refractory mineral grains may earlier have been coated with volatile compounds, but those are lost in the dissolving of meteorite matter in acids, leaving only insoluble refractory minerals. Finding the grain cores without dissolving most of the meteorite has been possible, but difficult and labor-intensive (see [[presolar grains]]).

Many new aspects of [[nucleosynthesis]] have been discovered from the isotopic ratios within the stardust grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. D. Clayton|author2=L. R. Nittler|last-author-amp=yes|title=Astrophysics with Presolar Stardust|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=42|date=2004|issue=1| pages=39–78|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.42.053102.134022|bibcode=2004ARA&amp;A..42...39C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important property of stardust is the hard, refractory, high-temperature nature of the grains. Prominent are [[silicon carbide]], [[graphite]], [[aluminium oxide]], aluminium [[spinel]], and other such solids that would condense at high temperature from a cooling gas, such as in stellar winds or in the decompression of the inside of a [[supernova]]. They differ greatly from the solids formed at low temperature within the interstellar medium.

Also important are their extreme isotopic compositions, which are expected to exist nowhere in the interstellar medium. This also suggests that the stardust condensed from the gases of individual stars before the [[isotope]]s could be diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium. These allow the source stars to be identified. For example, the heavy elements within the silicon carbide (SiC) grains are almost pure [[S-process]] isotopes, fitting their condensation within [[Asymptotic Giant Branch|AGB]] star red giant winds inasmuch as the AGB stars are the main source of S-process nucleosynthesis and have atmospheres observed by astronomers to be highly enriched in dredged-up s process elements.

Another dramatic example is given by the so-called supernova condensates, usually shortened by acronym to SUNOCON (from SUperNOva CONdensate&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Clayton, Moon and Planets 19, 109 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;) to distinguish them from other stardust condensed within stellar atmospheres. SUNOCONs contain in their calcium an excessively large abundance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Extinct &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti in Presolar Graphite and SiC: Proof of a Supernova Origin | last1 = Nittler | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Amari | first2 = S. | last3 = Zinner | first3 = E. | last4 = Woosley | first4 = S.E. | date = 1996 | url = | journal = Astrophys.

The outflowing &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti nuclei were thus still "alive" (radioactive) when the SUNOCON condensed near one year within the expanding supernova interior, but would have become an [[extinct radionuclide]] (specifically &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca) after the time required for mixing with the interstellar gas. Its discovery proved the prediction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | date = 1975 | title = 22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 257 | issue = | pages = 36–37 | doi=10.1038/257036b0|bibcode = 1975Natur.257...36C }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1975 that it might be possible to identify SUNOCONs in this way. The SiC SUNOCONs (from supernovae) are only about 1% as numerous as are SiC stardust from AGB stars.

Stardust itself (SUNOCONs and AGB grains that come from specific stars) is but a modest fraction of the condensed cosmic dust, forming less than 0.1% of the mass of total interstellar solids. The high interest in stardust derives from new information that it has brought to the sciences of [[stellar evolution]] and [[nucleosynthesis]].

Laboratories have studied solids that existed before the Earth was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | date = 2000 | title = Planetary solids older than the Earth | url = | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5466| page = 619 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5466.617f }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was once thought impossible, especially in the 1970s when cosmochemists were confident that the Solar System began as a hot gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Condensation in the primitive solar nebula | last1 = Grossman | first1 = L. | date = 1972 | url = | journal = Geochim.

The existence of stardust proved this historic picture incorrect.

==Some bulk properties==
[[File:Smooth chondriteIDP.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Smooth chondrite interplanetary dust particle.]] Cosmic dust is made of dust grains and aggregates of dust grains. These particles are irregularly shaped, with [[porosity]] ranging from ''fluffy'' to ''compact''. The composition, size, and other properties depend on where the dust is found, and conversely, a compositional analysis of a dust particle can reveal much about the dust particle's origin. General diffuse [[interstellar medium]] dust, dust grains in [[interstellar clouds|dense clouds]], [[planetary rings]] dust, and [[circumstellar dust]], are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than dust particles in the diffuse interstellar medium. ''Interplanetary dust particles'' (IDPs) are generally larger still.

[[File:IDPmajorelements.png|thumb|350px|right|Major elements of 200 stratospheric interplanetary dust particles.]]
Most of the influx of extraterrestrial matter that falls onto the Earth is dominated by meteoroids with diameters in the range 50 to 500 micrometers, of average density 2.0 g/cm³ (with porosity about 40%). The total influx rate of meteoritic sities of most IDPs [[Interplanetary dust cloud#Collecting interplanetary dust on Earth|captured]] in the Earth's [[stratosphere]] range between 1 and 3 g/cm³, with an average density at about 2.0 g/cm³.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Love S. G.|author2=Joswiak D. J.|author3=Brownlee D. E.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Densities of stratospheric micrometeorites |journal=Icarus |date=1992|volume=111| issue=1| pages=227–236|doi=10.1006/icar.1994.1142| bibcode= 1994Icar..111..227L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other specific dust properties:
*In ''circumstellar dust'', astronomers have found molecular signatures of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[silicon carbide]], [[silicate|amorphous silicate]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[ice|water ice]], and [[polyformaldehyde]], among others (in the diffuse [[interstellar medium]], there is evidence for silicate and carbon grains).
*''[[Comet dust|Cometary dust]]'' is generally different (with overlap) from ''[[asteroid dust|asteroidal dust]]''. Asteroidal dust resembles [[carbonaceous chondrite|carbonaceous chondritic meteorites]]. Cometary dust resembles [[interstellar dust|interstellar grains]] which can include silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and water ice.

==Dust grain formation==
The large grains in interstellar space are probably complex, with refractory cores that condensed within stellar outflows topped by layers acquired subsequently during incursions into cold dense interstellar clouds. That cyclic process of growth and destruction outside of the clouds has been modeled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liffman | first1 = Kurt | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Donald D. | year = 1988 | title = Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust | url = | journal = Proceeding of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 637–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liffman | first1 = Kurt | last2 = Clayton | first2 = Donald D. | year = 1989 | title = Stochastic evolution of refractory interstellar dust during the chemical evolution of a two-phase interstellar medium | url = http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1368&amp;context=physastro_pubs| journal = Astrophys. J. | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 853–68 | doi=10.1086/167440 | bibcode=1989ApJ...340..853L}}&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate that the cores live much longer than the average lifetime of dust mass. Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool oxygen rich red-giant stars and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool [[carbon star]]s. The red-giant stars have evolved off the [[main sequence]] and have entered the [[giant star|giant]] phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called Stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. And meteoriticists that study this refractory stardust extracted from meteorites often call it [[presolar grains]], although the refractory stardust that they study is actually only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, perhaps to be destroyed later. Finally, when the Solar System formed, interstellar dust grains were further modified by chemical reactions within the planetary accretion disk. So the history of the complex grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood.

Astronomers know that the dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved stars from specific observational signatures. In infrared light, emission at 9.7 micrometres is a signature of silicate dust in cool evolved oxygen-rich giant stars. Emission at 11.5 micrometres indicates the presence of silicon carbide dust in cool evolved carbon-rich giant stars. These help provide evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the ejected outer envelopes of these stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Humphreys, Roberta M.| author2=Strecker, Donald W.| author3=Ney, E. P.| title=Spectroscopic and Photometric Observations of M Supergiants in Carina| journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=1972| volume=172| pages=75| doi=10.1086/151329| bibcode=1972ApJ...172...75H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evans94|Evans 1994, pp. 164-167]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions in interstellar space are generally not suitable for the formation of silicate cores. This would take excessive time to accomplish, even if it might be possible. The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter ''a'', the time for a grain to attain ''a'', and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evans94|Evans 1994, pp. 147-148]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in [[nova]] and [[supernova]] ejecta, and in [[R Coronae Borealis variable]] stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust. So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed.

Most dust in the [[Solar System]] is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes. During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk.  Some molecules such as CO, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for example, graphite (C) and SiC would condense into solid grains in the planetary disk; but carbon and SiC grains found in meteorites are presolar based on their isotopic compositions, rather than from the planetary disk formation. Some molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the "refractory" (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores. Stardust once more provides an exception to the general trend, as it appears to be totally unprocessed since its thermal condensation within stars as refractory crystalline minerals. The condensation of graphite occurs within supernova interiors as they expand and cool, and do so even in gas containing more oxygen than carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Donald D. | last2 = Liu | first2 = W. | last3 = Dalgarno | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Condensation of carbon in radioactive supernova gas | url = | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = | pages = 1290–92 | doi=10.1126/science.283.5406.1290|bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1290C }}&lt;/ref&gt; a surprising carbon chemistry made possible by the intense radioactive environment of supernovae.

Planetary disk formation of precursor molecules was determined, in large part, by the temperature of the solar nebula. Since the temperature of the solar nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a dust grain's origin(s) with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and at different times in the solar nebula. Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space, or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or comets.

Due to their highly processed nature, IDPs (interplanetary dust particles) are fine-grained mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and [[amorphous]] components. We can picture an IDP as a "matrix" of material with embedded elements which were formed at different times and places in the [[solar nebula]] and before the solar nebula's formation. Examples of embedded elements in cosmic dust are [[Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulfides|GEMS]], [[chondrule]]s, and [[Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusions|CAI]]s.

==From the solar nebula to Earth==
[[File:Grapsdustytrail.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A dusty trail from the early Solar System to carbonaceous dust today.]]
The arrows in the adjacent diagram show one possible path from a collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of the solar nebula.

We can follow the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements. The trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements ("volatile" elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to be formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain "matrix" consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Gruen, Eberhard |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System—Interplanetary Dust and the Zodiacal Cloud |date=1999 |pages=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. [[Solar wind]] ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays. A dust particle that originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40 AU would have many more times the density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt.

Based on 2012 [[computer simulation|computer model studies]], the [[organic compound|complex organic molecules]] necessary for [[life]] may have formed in the [[protoplanetary disk]] of dust grains surrounding the [[Sun]] before the formation of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Space-20120329"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moskowitz |first=Clara |title=Life's Building Blocks May Have Formed in Dust Around Young Sun |url=http://www.space.com/15089-life-building-blocks-young-sun-dust.html |date=29 March 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other [[stars]] that acquire [[planets]].&lt;ref name="Space-20120329" /&gt; (Also see [[Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules|Extraterrestrial organic molecules]].)

==Some "dusty" clouds in the universe==
The Solar System has its own [[interplanetary dust cloud]], as do extrasolar systems. There are different types of nebulae with different physical causes and processes: 
*[[Diffuse nebula]]
*Infrared (IR) [[reflection nebula]]
*[[Supernova remnant]]
*[[Molecular cloud]]
*[[H II region|HII region]]s
*[[Photodissociation region]]s
*[[Dark nebula]]

Distinctions between those types of nebula are that different radiation processes are at work. For example, H II regions, like the [[Orion Nebula]], where a lot of star-formation is taking place, are characterized as thermal emission nebulae. Supernova remnants, on the other hand, like the [[Crab Nebula]], are characterized as nonthermal emission ([[synchrotron radiation]]).

Some of the better known dusty regions in the Universe are the diffuse nebulae in the Messier catalog, for example: [[Crab Nebula|M1]], [[Messier 8|M8]], [[Eagle Nebula|M16]], [[Omega Nebula|M17]], [[Trifid Nebula|M20]], [[Orion Nebula|M42]], [[M43 (nebula)|M43]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/Messier.html |title=Messier Catalog |accessdate=2005-07-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961114190946/http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/Messier.html |archivedate=November 14, 1996 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dust sample return==

The Discovery program's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'' mission]], was launched on 7 February 1999 to collect samples from the coma of comet [[Wild 2]], as well as samples of cosmic dust. It returned samples to Earth on 15 January 2006.  In the spring of 2014, the recovery of particles of interstellar dust from the samples was announced.&lt;ref name="nasa_sidp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/Interstellardust.cfm | title=Stardust Interstellar Dust Particles | work= | publisher=JSC, NASA | date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of dementia vary across types and stages of the [[diagnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dementia – Signs and Symptoms|publisher= American Speech Language Hearing Association|url=http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589935289&amp;section=Signs_and_Symptoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common affected areas include [[memory]], [[Spatial visualization ability|visual-spatial]], [[language]], [[attention]] and [[problem solving]]. Most types of dementia are slow and progressive. By the time the person shows signs of the disorder, the process in the brain has been happening for a long time. It is possible for a patient to have two types of dementia at the same time. About 10% of people with dementia have what is known as ''mixed dementia'', which is usually a combination of Alzheimer's disease and another type of dementia such as [[frontotemporal dementia]] or [[vascular dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200171&amp;documentID=161&amp;gclid=CNfxysiaxK4CFeYhtAodDlEIXQ What is vascular dementia?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172030/http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200171&amp;documentID=161&amp;gclid=CNfxysiaxK4CFeYhtAodDlEIXQ |date=2013-10-19 }} Alzheimer's Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee AY | title = Vascular dementia | journal = Chonnam Medical Journal | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 66–71 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 22111063 | pmc = 3214877 | doi = 10.4068/cmj.2011.47.2.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mild cognitive impairment ===
In the first stages of dementia, the signs and symptoms of the disorder may be subtle. Often, the early signs of dementia only become apparent when looking back in time. The earliest stage of dementia is called [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI). 70% of those diagnosed with MCI progress to dementia at some point.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;  In MCI, changes in the person's brain have been happening for a long time, but the symptoms of the disorder are just beginning to show.  These problems, however, are not yet severe enough to affect the person’s daily function.  If they do, it is considered dementia. A person with MCI scores between 27 and 30 on the [[Mini-Mental State Examination]] (MMSE), which is a normal score. They may have some memory trouble and trouble finding words, but they solve everyday problems and handle their own life affairs well.&lt;ref name="hugo"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4104432|year=2014|last1=Hugo|first1=J.|title=Dementia and Cognitive Impairment: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment|journal=Clinics in Geriatric Medicine|volume=30|issue=3|pages=421–442|last2=Ganguli|first2=M.|pmid=25037289|doi=10.1016/j.cger.2014.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early stages ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
In the early stage of dementia, the person begins to show symptoms noticeable to the people around them. In addition, the symptoms begin to interfere with daily activities. The person usually scores between a 20 and 25 on the [[Mini–Mental State Examination|MMSE]]. The symptoms are dependent on the type of dementia a person has.  The person may begin to have difficulty with more complicated chores and tasks around the house or at work. The person can usually still take care of him or herself but may forget things like taking pills or doing laundry and may need prompting or reminders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dementia care at a glance|last=1960-|first=Jenkins, Catharine|others=Ginesi, Laura, 1956-, Keenan, Bernie, 1957-|isbn=9781118859988|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|oclc=905089525|date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of early dementia usually include memory difficulty, but can also include some word-finding problems (anomia) and problems with planning and organizational skills (executive function). One very good way of assessing a person's impairment is by asking if they are still able to handle their finances independently. This is often one of the first things to become problematic. Other signs might be getting lost in new places, repeating things, personality changes, social withdrawal and difficulties at work.

When evaluating a person for dementia, it is important to consider how the person was able to function five or ten years earlier. It is also important to consider a person's level of education when assessing for loss of function. For example, an accountant who can no longer balance a checkbook would be more concerning than a person who had not finished high school or had never taken care of his/her own finances.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

In Alzheimer's dementia the most prominent early symptom is memory difficulty. Others include word-finding problems and getting lost.  In other types of dementia, like dementia with Lewy bodies and fronto-temporal dementia, personality changes and difficulty with organization and planning may be the first signs.

=== Middle stages ===
As dementia progresses, the symptoms first experienced in the early stages of the dementia generally worsen. The rate of decline is different for each person. A person with moderate dementia scores between 6–17 on the MMSE. For example, people with Alzheimer's dementia in the moderate stages lose almost all new information very quickly. People with dementia may be severely impaired in solving problems, and their social judgment is usually also impaired. They cannot usually function outside their own home, and generally should not be left alone. They may be able to do simple chores around the house but not much else, and begin to require assistance for personal care and hygiene other than simple reminders.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

=== Late stages ===
People with late-stage dementia typically turn increasingly inward and need assistance with most or all of their personal care. Persons with dementia in the late stages usually need 24-hour supervision to ensure personal safety, as well as to ensure that basic needs are being met.  If left unsupervised, a person with late-stage dementia may wander or fall, may not recognize common dangers around them such as a hot stove, may not realize that they need to use the bathroom or become unable to control their bladder or bowels (incontinent).&lt;ref name=hugo/&gt;

Changes in eating frequently occur. Caregivers of people with late-stage dementia often provide [[Purée|pureed diets]], thickened liquids, and assistance in eating, to prolong their lives, to cause them to gain weight, to reduce the risk of choking, and to make feeding the person easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_FmgEACAAJ|title=How We Die Now: Intimacy and the Work of Dying|last=Erickson|first=Karla | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013-09-27|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781439908235|pages=109–111|language=en|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223191201/https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_FmgEACAAJ|archive-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The person's appetite may decline to the point that the person does not want to eat at all. They may not want to get out of bed, or may need complete assistance doing so.  Commonly, the person no longer recognizes familiar people. They may have significant changes in sleeping habits or have trouble sleeping at all.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

== Causes ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}

=== Reversible causes ===
There are four main causes of easily reversible dementia: [[hypothyroidism]], [[vitamin B12 deficiency]], [[Lyme disease]], and [[neurosyphillis]]. All people with memory difficulty should be checked for hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency. For Lyme disease and neurosyphilis, testing should be done if there are risk factors for those diseases in the person. Because risk factors are often difficult to determine, testing for neurosyphillis and Lyme disease, as well as other mentioned factors, may be undertaken as a matter of course in cases where dementia is suspected.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

=== Alzheimer's disease ===
[[File:Alzheimers brain.jpg|thumb|Brain atrophy in severe Alzheimer's]]
[[Alzheimer's disease]] accounts for 50% to 70% of cases of dementia.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ2009/&gt; The most common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are short-term memory loss and [[Anomic aphasia|word-finding difficulties]]. People with Alzheimer's disease also have trouble with visual-spatial areas (for example, they may begin to get lost often), reasoning, judgment, and insight. Insight refers to whether or not the person realizes he/she has memory problems.

Common early symptoms of Alzheimer's include repetition, getting lost, difficulties keeping track of bills, problems with cooking especially new or complicated meals, forgetting to take medication, and word-finding problems.

The part of the brain most affected by Alzheimer's is the [[hippocampus]]. Other parts of the brain that show shrinking (atrophy) include the [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt; Although this pattern suggests Alzheimer's, the brain shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease is very variable, and a scan of the brain cannot actually make the diagnosis. The relationship between undergoing [[anesthesia]] and AD is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hussain M, Berger M, Eckenhoff RG, Seitz DP | title = General anesthetic and the risk of dementia in elderly patients: current insights | journal = Clinical Interventions in Aging | volume = 9 | pages = 1619–28 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25284995 | pmc = 4181446 | doi = 10.2147/CIA.S49680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vascular dementia ===
[[Vascular dementia]] is the cause of at least 20% of dementia cases, making it the second most common cause of dementia.&lt;ref name=pmid24267647&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iadecola C | title = The pathobiology of vascular dementia | journal = Neuron | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 844–66 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24267647 | pmc = 3842016 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is caused by disease or injury affecting the blood supply to the brain, typically involving a series of minor strokes. The symptoms of this dementia depend on where in the brain the strokes have occurred and whether the vessels are large or small.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss"/&gt;  Multiple injuries can cause progressive dementia over time, while a single injury located in an area critical for cognition (i.e. hippocampus, thalamus) can lead to sudden cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=pmid24267647 /&gt;

On scans of the brain, a person with vascular dementia may show evidence of multiple strokes of different sizes in various locations. People with vascular dementia tend to have risk factors for  [[vascular disease|disease of the blood vessels]], such as [[Cigarette smoking|tobacco use]], [[high blood pressure]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] or [[diabetes]], or other signs of vascular disease such as a previous [[heart attack]] or [[angina]].

=== Dementia with Lewy bodies ===
{{update|see PMID 28592453|date=March 2018}}
[[Dementia with Lewy bodies]] (DLB) is a dementia that has the primary symptoms of visual hallucinations and "Parkinsonism". Parkinsonism is the symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]], which includes tremor, rigid muscles, and a face without emotion. The visual hallucinations in DLB are generally very vivid hallucinations of people or animals and they often occur when someone is about to fall asleep or just waking up. Other prominent symptoms include problems with attention, organization, problem solving and planning (executive function), and difficulty with visual-spatial function.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

Again, imaging studies cannot necessarily make the diagnosis of DLB, but some signs are particularly common.  A person with DLB often shows occipital [[hypoperfusion]] on [[SPECT scan]] or occipital hypometabolism on a [[PET scan]]. Generally, a diagnosis of DLB is straightforward and unless it is complicated, a brain scan is not always necessary.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

=== Frontotemporal dementia ===
[[Frontotemporal Dementia|Frontotemporal dementia]]s (FTDs) are characterized by drastic personality changes and language difficulties. In all FTDs, the person has a relatively early social withdrawal and early lack of insight into the disorder. Memory problems are not a main feature of this disorder.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

There are three main types of FTD.  The first has major symptoms in the area of personality and behavior. This is called behavioral variant FTD (bv-FTD) and is the most common. In bv-FTD, the person shows a change in personal hygiene, becomes rigid in their thinking, and rarely recognize that there is a problem, they are socially withdrawn, and often have a drastic increase in appetite. They may also be socially inappropriate. For example, they may make inappropriate sexual comments, or may begin using pornography openly when they had not before. One of the most common signs is apathy, or not caring about anything. Apathy, however, is a common symptom in many different dementias.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

The other two types of FTD feature language problems as the main symptom.  The second type is called semantic dementia or temporal variant dementia (TV-FTD). The main feature of this is the loss of the meaning of words. It may begin with difficulty naming things. The person eventually may also lose the meaning of objects as well. For example, a drawing of a bird, dog, and an airplane in someone with FTD may all appear just about the same.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;  In a classic test for this, a patient is shown a picture of a pyramid and below there is a picture of both a palm tree and a pine tree. The person is asked to say which one goes best with the pyramid. In TV-FTD the person would not be able to answer that question.

The last type of FTD is called progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA). This is mainly a problem with producing speech. They have trouble finding the right words, but mostly they have a difficulty coordinating the muscles they need to speak. Eventually, someone with PNFA only uses one-syllable words or may become totally mute.

=== Progressive supranuclear palsy ===
[[Progressive Supranuclear Palsy|Progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP) is a form of dementia that is characterized by problems with eye movements. Generally the problems begin with difficulty moving the eyes up or down (vertical gaze palsy). Since difficulty moving the eyes upward can sometimes happen in normal aging, problems with downward eye movements are the key in PSP. Other key symptoms of PSP include falling backwards, balance problems, slow movements, rigid muscles, irritability, apathy, social withdrawal, and depression. The person may also have certain "frontal lobe signs" such as perseveration, a grasp reflex and [[utilization behavior]] (the need to use an object once you see it). People with PSP often have progressive difficulty eating and swallowing, and eventually with talking as well. Because of the rigidity and slow movements, PSP is sometimes misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]].

On scans of the brain, the [[midbrain]] of people with PSP is generally shrunken (atrophied), but there are no other common brain abnormalities visible on images of the person's brain.

=== Corticobasal degeneration ===
[[Corticobasal degeneration]] is a rare form of dementia that is characterized by many different types of neurological problems that get progressively worse over time. This is because the disorder affects the brain in many different places, but at different rates. One common sign is difficulty with using only one limb. One symptom that is extremely rare in any condition other than corticobasal degeneration is the "alien limb." The alien limb is a limb of the person that seems to have a mind of its own, it moves without control of the person's brain. Other common symptoms include jerky movements of one or more limbs ([[myoclonus]]), symptoms that are different in different limbs (asymmetric), difficulty with speech that is due to not being able to move the mouth muscles in a coordinated way, numbness and tingling of the limbs and neglecting one side of the person's vision or senses. In neglect, a person ignores the opposite side of the body from the one that has the problem. For example, a person may not feel pain on one side, or may only draw half of a picture when asked. In addition, the person's affected limbs may be rigid or have muscle contractions causing strange repetitive movements ([[dystonia]]).&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

The area of the brain most often affected in corticobasal degeneration is the posterior [[frontal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]]. Still, many other part of the brain can be affected.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

=== Rapidly progressive ===
[[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] typically causes a dementia that worsens over weeks to months, and is caused by [[prion]]s. The common causes of slowly progressive dementia also sometimes present with rapid progression: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], [[frontotemporal lobar degeneration]] (including [[corticobasal degeneration]] and [[progressive supranuclear palsy]]).

On the other hand, [[encephalopathy]] or [[delirium]] may develop relatively slowly and resemble dementia. Possible causes include brain infection ([[viral encephalitis]], [[subacute sclerosing panencephalitis]], [[Whipple's disease]]) or inflammation ([[limbic encephalitis]], [[Hashimoto's encephalopathy]], [[cerebral vasculitis]]); tumors such as [[Primary central nervous system lymphoma|lymphoma]] or [[glioma]]; drug toxicity (e.g., [[anticonvulsant]] drugs{{Specify |reason=there are many different types of anticonvulsant drugs with different mechanisms of action|date=November 2016}}); metabolic causes such as [[Hepatic encephalopathy|liver failure]] or [[kidney failure]]; and chronic [[subdural hematoma]].

=== Immunologically mediated ===
Chronic inflammatory conditions that may affect the brain and cognition include [[Behçet's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[celiac disease]], and [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]].&lt;ref name=Schofield2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schofield P | title = Dementia associated with toxic causes and autoimmune disease | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 17 Suppl 1 | pages = S129–47 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16240488 | doi = 10.1017/s1041610205001997 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RosenbloomSmith2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenbloom MH, Smith S, Akdal G, Geschwind MD | title = Immunologically mediated dementias | journal = Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 359–67 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19664365 | pmc = 2832614 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-009-0053-2 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of dementias can rapidly progress, but usually have a good response to early treatment. This consists of [[Immunotherapy|immunomodulators]] or [[steroid]] administration, or in certain cases, the elimination of the causative agent.&lt;ref name=RosenbloomSmith2009 /&gt;

=== Other conditions ===
There are many other medical and neurological conditions in which dementia only occurs late in the illness. For example, a proportion of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] develop dementia, though widely varying figures are quoted for this proportion.&lt;ref name=AarslandKurz2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aarsland D, Kurz MW | title = The epidemiology of dementia associated with Parkinson disease | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume = 289 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 18–22 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19733364 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2009.08.034 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; When dementia occurs in Parkinson's disease, the underlying cause may be [[dementia with Lewy bodies]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]], or both.&lt;ref name=pmid17101891&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galvin JE, Pollack J, Morris JC | title = Clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease dementia | journal = Neurology | volume = 67 | issue = 9 | pages = 1605–11 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17101891 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000242630.52203.8f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive impairment also occurs in the Parkinson-plus syndromes of [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] and [[corticobasal degeneration]] (and the same underlying pathology may cause the clinical syndromes of [[frontotemporal lobar degeneration]]). Although the acute [[porphyria]]s may cause episodes of confusion and psychiatric disturbance, dementia is a rare feature of these rare diseases.

Aside from those mentioned above, inherited conditions that can cause dementia (alongside other symptoms) include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cognitive Decline in a Young Adult with Pre-Existent Developmental Delay – What the Adult Neurologist Needs to Know |url=http://pn.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/2/70 |journal=Practical Neurology |volume=4 |pages=70–87 |year=2004 | vauthors = Lamont P |doi=10.1111/j.1474-7766.2004.02-206.x |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007200227/http://pn.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/2/70 |archive-date=2008-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mild cognitive impairment ===
[[Mild cognitive impairment]] means that the person exhibits memory or thinking difficulties, but those difficulties are not severe enough to meet criteria for a diagnosis of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langa KM, Levine DA | title = The diagnosis and management of mild cognitive impairment: a clinical review | journal = JAMA | volume = 312 | issue = 23 | pages = 2551–61 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25514304 | pmc = 4269302 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.13806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They should score between 25–30 on the MMSE.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt; Around 70% of people with MCI go on to develop some form of dementia.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt; MCI is generally divided into two categories. The first is one that is primarily memory loss (amnestic MCI). The second category is anything that is not primarily memory difficulties (non-amnestic MCI).  People with primarily memory problems  generally go on to develop Alzheimer's disease. People with the other type of MCI may go on to develop other types of dementia.

Diagnosis of MCI is often difficult, as cognitive testing may be normal.  Often, more in-depth [[neuropsychological]] testing is necessary to make the diagnosis. the most commonly used criteria are called the Peterson criteria and include:
* Memory or other cognitive (thought-processing) complaint by the person or a person who knows the patient well.
* The person must have a memory or other cognitive problem as compared to a person of the same age and level of education.
* The problem must not be severe enough to affect the person's daily function.
* The person must not have dementia.

=== Fixed cognitive impairment ===
Various types of brain injury may cause irreversible cognitive impairment that remains stable over time. [[Traumatic brain injury]] may cause generalized damage to the white matter of the brain ([[diffuse axonal injury]]), or more localized damage (as also may [[neurosurgery]]). A temporary reduction in the brain's supply of blood or oxygen may lead to [[cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic-ischemic injury]]. [[Stroke]]s (ischemic stroke, or intracerebral, subarachnoid, subdural or extradural hemorrhage) or infections ([[meningitis]] or [[encephalitis]]) affecting the brain, prolonged epileptic [[seizure]]s, and acute [[hydrocephalus]] may also have long-term effects on cognition. Excessive alcohol use may cause [[alcohol dementia]], [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], or [[Korsakoff's psychosis]].

=== Slowly progressive ===
Dementia that begins gradually and worsens progressively over several years is usually caused by [[neurodegenerative disease]]—that is, by conditions that affect only or primarily the neurons of the brain and cause gradual but irreversible loss of function of these cells. Less commonly, a non-degenerative condition may have secondary effects on brain cells, which may or may not be reversible if the condition is treated.

Causes of dementia depend on the age when symptoms begin. In the elderly population (usually defined in this context as over 65 years of age), a large majority of dementia cases  are caused by [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[vascular dementia]], or both. [[Dementia with Lewy bodies]] is another commonly exhibited form, which again may occur alongside either or both of the other causes.&lt;ref name=pmid11213093&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neuropathology Group.

[[Normal pressure hydrocephalus]], though relatively rare, is important to recognize since treatment may prevent progression and improve other symptoms of the condition. However, significant cognitive improvement is unusual.

Dementia is much less common under 65 years of age. Alzheimer's disease is still the most frequent cause, but inherited forms of the disorder account for a higher proportion of cases in this age group. [[Frontotemporal lobar degeneration]] and [[Huntington's disease]] account for most of the remaining cases.&lt;ref name=pmid12058088&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratnavalli E, Brayne C, Dawson K, Hodges JR | title = The prevalence of frontotemporal dementia | journal = Neurology | volume = 58 | issue = 11 | pages = 1615–21 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12058088 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.58.11.1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vascular dementia]] also occurs, but this in turn may be due to underlying conditions (including [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[CADASIL]], [[MELAS]], [[homocystinuria]], [[moyamoya]], and [[Binswanger's disease]]). People who receive frequent head trauma, such as boxers or football players, are at risk of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McKee AC, Cantu RC, Nowinski CJ, Hedley-Whyte ET, Gavett BE, Budson AE, Santini VE, Lee HS, Kubilus CA, Stern RA | title = Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in athletes: progressive tauopathy after repetitive head injury | journal = Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology | volume = 68 | issue = 7 | pages = 709–35 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19535999 | pmc = 2945234 | doi = 10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181a9d503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called [[dementia pugilistica]] in boxers).

In young adults (up to 40 years of age) who were previously of normal intelligence, it is very rare to develop dementia without other features of neurological disease, or without features of disease elsewhere in the body. Most cases of progressive cognitive disturbance in this age group are caused by psychiatric illness, alcohol or other drugs, or metabolic disturbance. However, certain genetic disorders can cause true neurodegenerative dementia at this age. These include [[Early-onset Alzheimer's disease|familial Alzheimer's disease]], [[Spinocerebellar ataxia|SCA17]] ([[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] inheritance); [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] ([[Sex linkage|X-linked]]); [[Gaucher's disease]] type 3, [[metachromatic leukodystrophy]], [[Niemann-Pick disease type C]], [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]], [[Tay-Sachs disease]], and [[Wilson's disease]] (all [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]). Wilson's disease is particularly important since cognition can improve with treatment.

At all ages, a substantial proportion of patients who complain of memory difficulty or other cognitive symptoms have [[major depressive disorder|depression]] rather than a neurodegenerative disease. Vitamin deficiencies and chronic infections may also occur at any age; they usually cause other symptoms before dementia occurs, but occasionally mimic degenerative dementia. These include deficiencies of [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[folate deficiency|folate]], or [[pellagra|niacin]], and infective causes including [[cryptococcal meningitis]], [[AIDS dementia complex|AIDS]], [[Lyme disease]], [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]], [[subacute sclerosing panencephalitis]], [[syphilis]], and [[Whipple's disease]].

== Diagnosis ==
As seen above, there are many specific types and causes of dementia, often showing slightly different symptoms. However, the symptoms are very similar and it is usually difficult to diagnose the type of dementia by symptoms alone. Diagnosis may be aided by [[Neuroimaging|brain scanning]] techniques. In many cases, the diagnosis cannot be absolutely sure except with a [[brain biopsy]], but this is very rarely recommended (though it can be performed at [[autopsy]]). In those who are getting older, general screening for [[cognitive impairment]] using cognitive testing or early diagnosis of dementia has not been shown to improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin JS, O'Connor E, Rossom RC, Perdue LA, Eckstrom E | title = Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: A systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 9 | pages = 601–12 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24145578 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-159-9-201311050-00730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been shown that screening exams are useful in those people over the age of 65 with memory complaints.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;

Normally, symptoms must be present for at least six months to support a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Def&gt;{{cite web |title=Dementia definition |url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/dementia/definition |work=MDGuidelines |publisher=Reed Group |access-date=2009-06-04 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629080241/http://www.mdguidelines.com/dementia/definition |archive-date=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive dysfunction of shorter duration is called ''[[delirium]]''. Delirium can be easily confused with dementia due to similar symptoms. Delirium is characterized by a sudden onset, fluctuating course, a short duration (often lasting from hours to weeks), and is primarily related to a somatic (or medical) disturbance. In comparison, dementia has typically a long, slow onset (except in the cases of a stroke or trauma), slow decline of mental functioning, as well as a longer duration (from months to years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caplan JP, Rabinowitz T | title = An approach to the patient with cognitive impairment: delirium and dementia | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 1103–16, ix | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20951272 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcna.2010.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Mental disorder|mental illness]]es, including [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[psychosis]], may produce symptoms that must be differentiated from both delirium and dementia.&lt;ref name=Glea&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gleason OC | title = Delirium | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–34 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12643363 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030301/1027.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110228/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030301/1027.html | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, any dementia evaluation should include a depression screening such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the [[Geriatric Depression Scale]].&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt; Physicians used to think that anyone who came in with memory complaints had depression and not dementia (because they thought that those with dementia are generally unaware of their memory problems). This is called pseudodementia.  However, in recent years researchers have realized that many older people with memory complaints in fact have MCI, the earliest stage of dementia. Depression should always remain high on the list of possibilities, however, for an elderly person with memory trouble.

Changes in thinking, hearing and vision are associated with normal ageing and can cause problems when diagnosing dementia due to the similarities.&lt;ref name="Worrall, L. 2003 pp. 297-298"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Worrall L, Hickson LM | year = 2003 | chapter = Implications for theory, practice, and policy | pages = 297–298 | veditors = Worrall LE, Hickson LM | title = Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention | location = Clifton Park, NY | publisher = Delmar Learning | isbn = 978-0-7693-0015-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to screening for dementia is to ask an informant (relative or other supporter) to fill out a questionnaire about the person's everyday cognitive functioning. Informant questionnaires provide complementary information to brief cognitive tests. Probably the best known questionnaire of this sort is the ''[[Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly]] (IQCODE)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorm AF | title = The Informant Questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE): a review | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–93 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15559753 | doi = 10.1017/S1041610204000390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not sufficient evidence to determine how accurate the IQCODE is for diagnosing or predicting dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrison JK, Stott DJ, McShane R, Noel-Storr AH, Swann-Price RS, Quinn TJ | title = Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) for the early diagnosis of dementia across a variety of healthcare settings | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD011333 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27869298 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd011333.pub2 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD011333/DEMENTIA_using-structured-questionnaire-iqcode-detect-individuals-who-may-go-develop-dementia | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161126132113/http://www.cochrane.org/CD011333/DEMENTIA_using-structured-questionnaire-iqcode-detect-individuals-who-may-go-develop-dementia | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2016-11-26 }}url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011333.pub2/abstract|&lt;/ref&gt; The Alzheimer's Disease Caregiver Questionnaire is another tool. It is about 90% accurate for Alzheimer's and can be completed online or in the office by a caregiver.&lt;ref name="Memory Loss" /&gt;  On the other hand, the ''[[General Practitioner Assessment Of Cognition]]'' combines both, a patient assessment and an informant interview. It was specifically designed for the use in the primary care setting.

Clinical neuropsychologists provide diagnostic consultation following administration of a full battery of cognitive testing, often lasting several hours, to determine functional patterns of decline associated with varying types of dementia. Tests of memory, executive function, processing speed, attention, and language skills are relevant, as well as tests of emotional and psychological adjustment. These tests assist with ruling out other etiologies and determining relative cognitive decline over time or from estimates of prior cognitive abilities.

=== Laboratory tests ===
Routine [[blood test]]s are also usually performed to rule out treatable causes. These tests include [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[folic acid]], [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[C-reactive protein]], [[full blood count]], [[electrolyte]]s, [[calcium in biology|calcium]], [[renal function]], and [[liver enzyme]]s. Abnormalities may suggest [[vitamin deficiency]], [[infection]], or other problems that commonly cause confusion or disorientation in the elderly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Imaging ===
A [[computed axial tomography|CT scan]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI scan) is commonly performed, although these tests do not pick up diffuse metabolic changes associated with dementia in a person that shows no gross neurological problems (such as paralysis or weakness) on neurological exam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} CT or MRI may suggest [[normal pressure hydrocephalus]], a potentially reversible cause of dementia, and can yield information relevant to other types of dementia, such as infarction ([[stroke]]) that would point at a vascular type of dementia.

The [[functional neuroimaging]] modalities of [[SPECT]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] are more useful in assessing long-standing cognitive dysfunction, since they have shown similar ability to diagnose dementia as a clinical exam and cognitive testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonte FJ, Harris TS, Hynan LS, Bigio EH, White CL | title = Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in the differential diagnosis of the dementias with histopathologic confirmation | journal = Clinical Nuclear Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = 7 | pages = 376–8 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16785801 | doi = 10.1097/01.rlu.0000222736.81365.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of SPECT to differentiate the vascular cause (i.e., [[multi-infarct dementia]]) from Alzheimer's disease dementias, appears superior to differentiation by clinical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dougall NJ, Bruggink S, Ebmeier KP | title = Systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in dementia | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 554–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15545324 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajgp.12.6.554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has established the value of PET imaging using carbon-11 Pittsburgh Compound B as a radiotracer (PIB-PET) in predictive diagnosis of various kinds of dementia, in particular [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Studies from Australia have found PIB-PET 86% accurate in predicting which patients with mild cognitive impairment will develop Alzheimer's disease within two years. In another study, carried out using 66 patients seen at the University of Michigan, PET studies using either PIB or another radiotracer, carbon-11 dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), led to more accurate diagnosis for more than one-fourth of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abella HA |title=Report from SNM: PET imaging of brain chemistry bolsters characterization of dementias |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |date=June 16, 2009 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/imaging-trends-advances/cardiovascular-imaging/article/113619/1423022 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adult daycare]] centers as well as special care units in nursing homes often provide specialized care for dementia patients. Adult daycare centers offer supervision, recreation, meals, and limited health care to participants, as well as providing respite for caregivers. In addition, [[home care]] can provide one-on-one support and care in the home allowing for more individualized attention that is needed as the disorder progresses. Psychiatric nurses can make a distinctive contribution to people's mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barker | first = Philip | name-list-format = vanc | title = Psychiatric and mental health nursing: the craft of caring |publisher=Arnold |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-340-81026-2 |oclc=53373798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dementia impairs normal communication due to changes in receptive and expressive language, as well as the ability to plan and problem solve, agitated behaviour is often a form of communication for the person with dementia.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{See also|Dementia praecox}}
Until the end of the 19th century, dementia was a much broader clinical concept. It included mental illness and any type of psychosocial incapacity, including conditions that could be reversed.&lt;ref name=Berr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berrios GE | title = Dementia during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: a conceptual history | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 829–37 | date = November 1987 | pmid = 3324141 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700000623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dementia'' at this time simply referred to anyone who had lost the ability to reason, and was applied equally to psychosis of mental illness, "organic" diseases like [[syphilis]] that destroy the brain, and to the dementia associated with old age, which was attributed to "hardening of the arteries".

Dementia has been referred to in medical texts since antiquity. One of the earliest known allusions to dementia is attributed to the 7th-century BC [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]], who divided the human lifespan into six distinct phases, which were 0–6 (infancy), 7–21 (adolescence), 22–49 (young adulthood), 50–62 (middle age), 63–79 (old age), and 80–death (advanced age). The last two he described as the "senium", a period of mental and physical decay, and of the final phase being where "the scene of mortal existence closes after a great length of time that very fortunately, few of the human species arrive at, where the mind is reduced to the imbecility of the first epoch of infancy".&lt;ref&gt;Berchtold, N.C. and Cotman, C.W. (1998) Evolution in the conceptu-alization of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease: Greco-Roman period to the 1960s. Neurobiol Aging 19, 173–189&lt;/ref&gt; In 550&amp;nbsp;BC, the Greek Athenian statesman and poet [[Solon]] argued that the terms of a man's will might be invalidated if he exhibited loss of judgement due to advanced age. Chinese medical texts made allusions to the condition as well, and the characters for "dementia" translate literally to "foolish old person".{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] from Ancient  Greece spoke of the mental decay of advanced age, but apparently simply viewed it as an inevitable process that affected all old men, and which nothing could prevent. Plato stated that the elderly were unsuited for any position of responsibility because, "There is not much acumen of the mind that once carried them in their youth, those characteristics one would call judgement, imagination, power of reasoning, and memory. They see them gradually blunted by deterioration and can hardly fulfill their function."{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

For comparison, the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] held a view much more in line with modern-day medical wisdom that loss of mental function was not inevitable in the elderly and "affected only those old men who were weak-willed". He spoke of how those who remained mentally active and eager to learn new things could stave off dementia. However, Cicero's views on aging, although progressive, were largely ignored in a world that would be dominated by Aristotle's medical writings for centuries. Subsequent physicians during the time of Roman Empire such as [[Galen]] and [[Celsus]] simply repeated the beliefs of Aristotle while adding few new contributions to medical knowledge.

Byzantine physicians sometimes wrote of dementia, and it is recorded that at least seven emperors whose lifespans exceeded the age of 70 displayed signs of cognitive decline. In [[Constantinople]], there existed special hospitals to house those diagnosed with dementia or insanity, but these naturally did not apply to the emperors who were above the law and whose health conditions could not be publicly acknowledged.

Otherwise, little is recorded about dementia in Western medical texts for nearly 1700 years. One of the few references to it was the 13th-century friar [[Roger Bacon]], who viewed old age as divine punishment for [[original sin]]. Although he repeated existing Aristotelian beliefs that dementia was inevitable after a long enough lifespan, he did make the extremely progressive assertion that the brain was the center of memory and thought rather than the heart.

Poets, playwrights, and other writers however made frequent allusions to the loss of mental function in old age. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] notably mentions it in some of his plays including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''.

During the 19th century, doctors generally came to believe that dementia in the elderly was the result of [[cerebral atherosclerosis]], although opinions fluctuated between the idea that it was due to blockage of the major arteries supplying the brain or small strokes within the vessels of the cerebral cortex. This viewpoint remained conventional medical wisdom through the first half of the 20th century, but by the 1960s was increasingly challenged as the link between neurodegenerative diseases and age-related cognitive decline was established. By the 1970s, the medical community maintained that vascular dementia was rarer than previously thought and Alzheimer's disease caused the vast majority of mental impairments in old age. More recently however, it is believed that dementia is often a mixture of both conditions.

Much like other diseases associated with aging, dementia was comparatively rare before the 20th century, due to the fact that it is most common in people over 80, and such lifespans were uncommon in preindustrial times. Conversely, syphilitic dementia was widespread in the developed world until largely being eradicated by the use of penicillin after WWII. With significant increases in life expectancy following WWII, the number of people in developed countries over 65 started rapidly climbing. While elderly persons constituted an average of 3–5% of the population prior to 1945, by 2010 it was common in many countries to have 10–14% of people over 65 and in Germany and Japan, this figure exceeded 20%. Public awareness of Alzheimer's Disease was greatly increased in 1994 when former US president [[Ronald Reagan]] announced that he had been diagnosed with the condition.

In the more recent history of dementia, some hospitals in London have found that using color, designs, pictures and lights have helped dementia patients adjust to being at the hospital. These adjustments to the layout of the dementia wings at these hospitals have helped patients by preventing confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/09/15/british-hospitals-are-having-a-dementia-friendly-makeover|title=British hospitals are having a dementia-friendly makeover|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Terminology===
Dementia in the elderly has previously been called '''senile dementia''' or '''senility''', and viewed as a normal and somewhat inevitable aspect of growing old, rather than as being caused by any specific diseases. The terminology, "senile dementia" or "senility", is no longer recommended.&lt;ref name="senility-aa"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is dementia? |url=https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia |publisher=Alzheimers Association |accessdate=6 August 2018 |quote=Dementia is often incorrectly referred to as "senility" or "senile dementia," which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senility-mednet"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Danette C. |title=Dementia |url=https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=6 August 2018 |quote=Senile dementia (“senility”) is a term that was once used to describe all dementias; this term is no longer used as a diagnosis.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, a specific organic dementing process of early onset, called [[Alzheimer's disease]], was described. This was associated with particular microscopic changes in the brain, but was seen as a rare disease of middle age because the first person diagnosed with it was [[Auguste Deter|a 50-year-old woman]].

By the period of 1913–20, [[schizophrenia]] had been well-defined in a way similar to today, and also the term ''[[dementia praecox]]'' had been used to suggest the development of senile-type dementia at a younger age. Eventually the two terms fused, so that until 1952 physicians used the terms ''dementia praecox'' (precocious dementia) and ''schizophrenia'' interchangeably. The term ''precocious dementia'' for a mental illness suggested that a type of mental illness like schizophrenia (including paranoia and decreased cognitive capacity) could be expected to arrive normally in all persons with greater age (see [[paraphrenia]]). After about 1920, the beginning use of ''dementia''  for what is now understood as schizophrenia and senile dementia helped limit the word's meaning to "permanent, irreversible mental deterioration". This began the change to the more recognizable use of the term today.

In 1976, neurologist Robert Katzmann suggested a link between senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gina |last=Kolata | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Gina Kolata |title=Drug Trials Test Bold Plan to Slow Alzheimer's |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 17, 2010 |access-date=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409121141/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html |archive-date=April 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katzmann suggested that much of the senile dementia occurring (by definition) after the age of 65, was pathologically identical with Alzheimer's disease occurring before age 65 and therefore should not be treated differently. He noted that "senile dementia" not being considered a disease, but rather part of aging, was keeping millions of aged patients experiencing what otherwise was identical with Alzheimer's disease from being diagnosed as having a disease process, rather than simply considered as aging normally.&lt;ref name="Katzman1976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Katzman R | title = Editorial: The prevalence and malignancy of Alzheimer disease. A major killer | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 217–8 | date = April 1976 | pmid = 1259639 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.1976.00500040001001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katzmann thus suggested that Alzheimer's disease, if taken to occur over age 65, is actually common, not rare, and was the fourth- or 5th-leading cause of death, even though rarely reported on death certificates in 1976.

This suggestion opened the view that dementia is never normal, and must always be the result of a particular disease process, and is not part of the normal healthy aging process, ''per se''. The ensuing debate led for a time to the proposed disease diagnosis of "senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type" (SDAT) in persons over the age of 65, with "Alzheimer's disease" diagnosed in persons younger than 65 who had the same pathology. Eventually, however, it was agreed that the age limit was artificial, and that ''Alzheimer's disease'' was the appropriate term for persons with the particular brain pathology seen in this disorder, regardless of the age of the person with the diagnosis. A helpful finding was that although the incidence of Alzheimer's disease increased with age (from 5–10% of 75-year-olds to as many as 40–50% of 90-year-olds), there was no age at which all persons developed it, so it was not an inevitable consequence of aging, no matter how great an age a person attained. Evidence of this is shown by numerous documented supercentenarians (people living to 110 or more) that experienced no serious cognitive impairment. There is some evidence that dementia is most likely to develop between the ages of 80 and 84 and individuals who pass that point without being affected have a lower chance of developing it. Women account for a larger percentage of dementia cases than men, although this can be attributed to their longer overall lifespan and greater odds of attaining an age where the condition is likely to occur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Also, after 1952, mental illnesses like schizophrenia were removed from the category of ''[[organic brain syndrome]]s'', and thus (by definition) removed from possible causes of "dementing illnesses" (dementias). At the same, however, the traditional cause of senile dementia – "hardening of the arteries" – now returned as a set of dementias of vascular cause (small strokes). These were now termed ''multi-infarct dementias'' or ''[[vascular dementia]]s''.

In the 21st century, a number of other types of dementia have been differentiated from Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementias (these two being the most common types). This differentiation is on the basis of pathological examination of brain tissues, by symptomatology, and by different patterns of brain metabolic activity in nuclear medical imaging tests such as [[SPECT]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]scans of the brain. The various forms of dementia have differing prognoses (expected outcome of illness), and also differing sets of epidemiologic risk factors. The causal etiology of many of them, including Alzheimer's disease, remains unclear, although many theories exist such as accumulation of protein plaques as part of normal aging, inflammation (either from bacterial pathogens or exposure to toxic chemicals), inadequate blood sugar, and traumatic brain injury.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] has described dementia as being a "national crisis", affecting 800,000 people in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/26/dementia-research-funding-to-double |title=Dementia research funding to more than double to £66m by 2015 |first=Sarah |last=Boseley | name-list-format = vanc |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2012 |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |access-date=27 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020053209/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/26/dementia-research-funding-to-double |archive-date=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, as with all mental disorders, where people with dementia could potentially be a danger to themselves or others, they can be detained under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] for the purposes of assessment, care and treatment. This is a last resort, and usually avoided if the person has family or friends who can ensure care.

Some hospitals in Britain are working to provide enriched and friendlier care. To make the hospital wards calmer and less overwhelming to the residents, the staff is replacing the usual nurses' station with a collection of smaller desks, similar to a receptionist’s. The incorporation of bright lighting helps increase positive mood and allow for the residents to see more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/09/15/british-hospitals-are-having-a-dementia-friendly-makeover|title=British hospitals are having a dementia-friendly makeover|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Driving]] with dementia could lead to severe injury or even death to self and others. Doctors should advise appropriate testing on when to quit driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drivers with dementia a growing problem, MDs warn |date=September 19, 2007 |publisher=CBC News, Canada |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/09/19/drivers-dementia.html?ref=rss |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002100058/http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/09/19/drivers-dementia.html?ref=rss |archive-date=October 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom [[DVLA]] (Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency) states that people with dementia who specifically have poor short term memory, disorientation, or lack of insight or judgment are not fit to drive, and in these instances the DVLA must be informed so that the driving licence can be revoked. They do, however, acknowledge low-severity cases and those with an early diagnosis, and those drivers may be permitted to drive pending medical reports.
 
Many support networks are available to people with dementia and their families and caregivers. Several charitable organisations aim to raise awareness and campaign for the rights of people living with dementia. There is also support and guidance on assessing testamentary capacity in people who have dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson SB | year = 2009 | title = Testamentary capacity and cognitive rehabilitation: implications for head-injured and neurologically impaired individuals | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Rehabilitation | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 11–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Atlantic Philanthropies announced a $177 million gift aimed at understanding and reducing dementia. The recipient was Global Brain Health Institute, a program co-led by the [[University of California, San Francisco]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]]. This donation is the largest non-capital grant Atlantic has ever made, and the biggest philanthropic donation in Irish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/briefly_noted80 |title=Tackling dementia |work=Philanthropy magazine |date=Winter 2016 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211210606/http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/briefly_noted80 |archive-date=2016-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dental health ==
There is limited evidence that links poor oral health to cognitive decline. However, failure to perform tooth brushing and gingival inflammation can be used as dementia risk predictors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daly B, Thompsell A, Sharpling J, Rooney YM, Hillman L, Wanyonyi KL, White S, Gallagher JE | title = Evidence summary: the relationship between oral health and dementia | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 223 | issue = 11 | pages = 846–853 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29192686 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.992 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2017.992 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180509175543/https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2017.992 | archivedate = 2018-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oral bacteria ===
The link between Alzheimer's and [[periodontal disease|gum disease]] is [[Oral microbiology#Oral bacteria|oral bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Miklossy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miklossy |first1=J |title=Historic evidence to support a causal relationship between spirochetal infections and Alzheimer's disease. |journal=Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience |date=2015 |volume=7 |pages=46 |doi=10.3389/fnagi.2015.00046 |pmid=25932012|pmc=4399390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the oral cavity, a large number of bacterial species can be found including ''[[Porphyromonas gingivalis|P. gingivalis]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium nucleatum|F. nucleatum]]'', ''[[Prevotella intermedia|P. intermedia]]'', and ''[[Tannerella forsythia|T. forsythia]]''. Six oral trepomena [[spirochete]]s have also been examined in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.&lt;ref name = "Olsen_2015" /&gt; Spirochetes are neurotropic in nature, meaning they act to destroy nerve tissue and create inflammation.

=== Oral viruses ===
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been found in over 70% of the 50 and older population.

'''Developmental biology''' is the study of the process by which [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s grow and develop. Developmental biology also encompasses the biology of regeneration, [[asexual reproduction]], [[metamorphosis]], and the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the adult organism.

In the late 20th century, the discipline largely transformed into [[evolutionary developmental biology]].

== Perspectives ==
The main processes involved in the [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] of animals are: [[regional specification]], [[morphogenesis]], [[cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]], [[Cell growth|growth]], and the overall control of timing explored in [[evolutionary developmental biology]]:

* [[Regional specification]] refers to the processes that create spatial pattern in a ball or sheet of initially similar cells. This generally involves the action of [[cytoplasmic determinant]]s, located within parts of the fertilized egg, and of inductive signals emitted from signaling centers in the embryo. The early stages of [[regional specification]] do not generate functional differentiated cells, but cell populations committed to develop to a specific region or part of the organism. These are defined by the expression of specific combinations of [[transcription factors]]. 
* [[Morphogenesis]] relates to the formation of three-dimensional shape. It mainly involves the orchestrated movements of cell sheets and of individual cells. Morphogenesis is important for creating the three germ layers of the early embryo ([[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]]) and for building up complex structures during organ development. 
* [[Cell differentiation]] relates specifically to the formation of functional cell types such as nerve, muscle, secretory epithelia etc. Differentiated cells contain large amounts of specific proteins associated with the cell function. 
* [[Cell growth|Growth]] involves both an overall increase in size, and also the differential growth of parts ([[allometry]]) which contributes to morphogenesis. Growth mostly occurs through cell division but also through changes of cell size and the deposition of extracellular materials. 
* The control of timing of events and the integration of the various processes with one another is the least well understood area of the subject. It remains unclear whether animal embryos contain a master clock mechanism or not.

The development of plants involves similar processes to that of animals. However plant cells are mostly immotile so morphogenesis is achieved by differential growth, without cell movements. Also, the inductive signals and the genes involved are different from those that control animal development.

== Developmental processes ==
=== Cell differentiation ===
[[File:Slack Essential Dev Biol Fig 14.12a.jpg|thumb|left|The Notch-delta system in neurogenesis.(Slack Essential Dev Biol Fig 14.12a)]][[Cell differentiation]] is the process whereby different functional cell types arise in development. For example, neurons, muscle fibers and hepatocytes (liver cells) are well known types of differentiated cell. Differentiated cells usually produce large amounts of a few proteins that are required for their specific function and this gives them the characteristic appearance that enables them to be recognized under the light microscope. The genes encoding these proteins are highly active. Typically their [[chromatin]] structure is very open, allowing access for the transcription enzymes, and specific transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences in the DNA in order to activate gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li B. |author2=Carey M. |author3=Workman J.L. | year = 2007 | title = The role of chromatin during transcription | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = | pages = 707–719 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.015 | pmid=17320508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heintzman N.D. | year = 2007 | title = Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 311–318 | doi=10.1038/ng1966|display-authors=etal | pmid=17277777}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[NeuroD]] is a key transcription factor for neuronal differentiation, [[myogenin]] for muscle differentiation, and [[HNF4]] for hepatocyte differentiation.
Cell differentiation is usually the final stage of development, preceded by several states of commitment which are not visibly differentiated. A single tissue, formed from a single type of progenitor cell or stem cell, often consists of several differentiated cell types. Control of their formation involves a process of lateral inhibition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meinhardt H., Gierer A. | year = 2000 | title = Pattern formation by local self-activation and lateral inhibition | url = http://www.me.ucsb.edu/~moehlis/APC514/2002_1.pdf | journal = BioEssays | volume = 22 | issue =  | pages = 753–760 | doi = 10.1002/1521-1878(200008)22:8&lt;753::aid-bies9&gt;3.0.co;2-z | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025156/https://me.ucsb.edu/~moehlis/APC514/2002_1.pdf | archivedate = 2017-10-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the properties of the [[Notch signaling pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sprinzak D. | year = 2010 | title = Cis-interactions between Notch and Delta generate mutually exclusive signalling states | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = | pages = 86–90 | doi=10.1038/nature08959|display-authors=etal| pmc = 2886601 | pmid=20418862}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the neural plate of the embryo this system operates to generate a population of neuronal precursor cells in which NeuroD is highly expressed.

=== Regeneration ===
[[Regeneration (biology)|Regeneration]] indicates the ability to regrow a missing part.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, B.M. (2007) Principles of Regenerative Biology. Academic Press, Burlington MA.&lt;/ref&gt; This is very prevalent amongst plants, which show continuous growth, and also among colonial animals such as hydroids and ascidians. But most interest by developmental biologists has been shown in the regeneration of parts in free living animals. In particular four models have been the subject of much investigation. Two of these have the ability to regenerate whole bodies: ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', which can regenerate any part of the polyp from a small fragment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bosch T.C.G. | year = 2007 | title = Why polyps regenerate and we don't: Towards a cellular and molecular framework for Hydra regeneration | url = | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 303 | issue = | pages = 421–433 | doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.12.012 | pmid=17234176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[planarian]] worms, which can usually regenerate both heads and tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reddien P.W., Alvarado A.S. | year = 2004 | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | url = | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 725–757 | doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 | pmid=15473858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples have continuous cell turnover fed by [[stem cells]] and, at least in planaria, at least some of the stem cells have been shown to be [[cell potency|pluripotent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wagner D.E. |author2=Wang I.E. |author3=Reddien P.W. | year = 2011 | title = Clonogenic Neoblasts Are Pluripotent Adult Stem Cells That Underlie Planarian Regeneration | url = | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = | pages = 811–816 | doi=10.1126/science.1203983|pmc=3338249 | pmid=21566185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two models show only distal regeneration of appendages. These are the insect appendages, usually the legs of hemimetabolous insects such as the cricket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakamura T. | year = 2008 | title = Dissecting insect leg regeneration through RNA interference | url = | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 64–72 | doi=10.1007/s00018-007-7432-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the limbs of [[urodele amphibians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simon A., Tanaka E.M. | year = 2013 | title = Limb regeneration | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 291–300 | doi=10.1002/wdev.73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable information is now available about amphibian limb regeneration and it is known that each cell type regenerates itself, except for connective tissues where there is considerable interconversion between cartilage, dermis and tendons. In terms of the pattern of structures, this is controlled by a re-activation of signals active in the embryo.
There is still debate about the old question of whether regeneration is a "pristine" or an "adaptive" property.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, J.M.W. (2013) Essential Developmental Biology. Chapter 20. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; If the former is the case, with improved knowledge, we might expect to be able to improve regenerative ability in humans. If the latter, then each instance of regeneration is presumed to have arisen by natural selection in circumstances particular to the species, so no general rules would be expected.

== Embryonic development of animals ==
{{Main |Embryogenesis}}
[[File:Slack Essential Dev Biol Fig 02-08.jpg|thumb|left|Generalized scheme of embryonic development. Slack "Essential Developmental Biology" Fig.2.8]]
[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|300px|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]].]]
The sperm and egg fuse in the process of fertilization to form a fertilized egg, or [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jungnickel M.K. |author2=Sutton K.A. |author3=Florman H.M. | year = 2003 | title = In the beginning: lessons from fertilization in mice and worms | doi = 10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00648-2 | journal = Cell | volume = 114 | issue = | pages = 401–404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This undergoes a period of divisions to form a ball or sheet of similar cells called a [[blastula]] or [[blastoderm]]. These cell divisions are usually rapid with no growth so the daughter cells are half the size of the mother cell and the whole embryo stays about the same size. They are called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] divisions. Morphogenetic movements convert the cell mass into a three layered structure consisting of multicellular sheets called [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], which are known as [[germ layers]]. This is the process of [[gastrulation]]. During cleavage and gastrulation the first regional specification events occur. In addition to the formation of the three germ layers themselves, these often generate extraembryonic structures, such as the mammalian [[placenta]], needed for support and nutrition of the embryo,&lt;ref&gt;Steven, D.H. (ed.) (1975) Comparative Placentation. Academic Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; and also establish differences of commitment along the anteroposterior axis (head, trunk and tail).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimelman D., Martin B.L. | year = 2012 | title = Anterior-posterior patterning in early development: three strategies | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 253–266 | doi=10.1002/wdev.25| pmc = 5560123 | pmid=23801439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regional specification]] is initiated by the presence of [[cytoplasmic determinant]]s in one part of the zygote. The cells that contain the determinant become a signaling center and emit an inducing factor. Because the inducing factor is produced in one place, diffuses away, and decays, it forms a concentration gradient, high near the source cells and low further away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slack J.M.W. | year = 1987 | title = Morphogenetic gradients - past and present | url = | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 200–204 | doi=10.1016/0968-0004(87)90094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rogers K. W., Schier A. F. | year = 2011 | title = Morphogen Gradients: From Generation to Interpretation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 377–407 | doi=10.1146/annurev-cellbio-092910-154148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining cells of the embryo, which do not contain the determinant, are competent to respond to different concentrations by upregulating specific developmental control genes. This results in a series of zones becoming set up, arranged at progressively greater distance from the signaling center. In each zone a different combination of developmental control genes is upregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dahmann C. |author2=Oates A. C. |author3=Brand M. | year = 2011 | title = Boundary formation and maintenance in tissue development | url = | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 43–55 | doi=10.1038/nrg2902}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes encode [[transcription factors]] which upregulate new combinations of gene activity in each region. Among other functions, these transcription factors control expression of genes conferring specific adhesive and motility properties on the cells in which they are active. Because of these different morphogenetic properties, the cells of each germ layer move to form sheets such that the ectoderm ends up on the outside, mesoderm in the middle, and endoderm on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hardin J., Walston T. | year = 2004 | title = Models of morphogenesis: the mechanisms and mechanics of cell rearrangement | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 399–406 | doi=10.1016/j.gde.2004.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hammerschmidt M., Wedlich D. | year = 2008 | title = Regulated adhesion as a driving force of gastrulation movements | url = | journal = Development | volume = 135 | issue = | pages = 3625–3641 | doi=10.1242/dev.015701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphogenetic movements not only change the shape and structure of the embryo, but by bringing cell sheets into new spatial relationships they also make possible new phases of signaling and response between them.

[[Human development (biology)|Growth]] in embryos is mostly autonomous.&lt;ref&gt;O'Farrell, P. H. (2003). How metazoans reach their full size: the natural history of bigness. In Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size,  (ed. M. N. Hall, Raff, M., and Thomas, G. (eds)), pp. 1-21: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press&lt;/ref&gt; For each territory of cells the growth rate is controlled by the combination of genes that are active. Free-living embryos do not grow in mass as they have no external food supply. But embryos fed by a placenta or extraembryonic yolk supply can grow very fast, and changes to relative growth rate between parts in these organisms help to produce the final overall anatomy.

The whole process needs to be coordinated in time and how this is controlled is not understood. There may be a master clock able to communicate with all parts of the embryo that controls the course of events, or timing may depend simply on local causal sequences of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moss E.G., Romer-Seibert J. | year = 2014 | title = Cell-intrinsic timing in animal development | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 365–377 | doi=10.1002/wdev.145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metamorphosis ===
Developmental processes are very evident during the process of [[metamorphosis]]. This occurs in various types of animal. Well-known are the examples of the frog, which usually hatches as a tadpole and metamorphoses to an adult frog, and certain insects which hatch as a larva and then become remodeled to the adult form during a pupal stage.

All the developmental processes listed above occur during metamorphosis. Examples that have been especially well studied include tail loss and other changes in the tadpole of the frog ''Xenopus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tata J.R. | year = 1996 | title = Amphibian metamorphosis: an exquisite model for hormonal regulation of postembryonic development in vertebrates | url = | journal = Dev.

== Plant development ==
{{further|Plant development}}
Plant '''development''' is the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows.  It is studied in [[plant anatomy]] and [[plant physiology]] as well as plant morphology.

Plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from [[meristem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=961–70|pmid= 14505363|year=2003|last1=Bäurle|first1=I|last2=Laux|first2=T|title=Apical meristems: The plant's fountain of youth|volume=25|issue=10|doi=10.1002/bies.10341|journal=BioEssays}}  Review.&lt;/ref&gt; located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues. By contrast, an animal [[embryo]] will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature.

The properties of organization seen in a plant are [[emergence|emergent properties]] which are more than the sum of the individual parts.  "The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. C. ''Plant Growth and Development'', page 183. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===
A [[vascular plant]] begins from a single celled [[zygote]], formed by [[fertilisation]] of an egg cell by a sperm cell.  From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant [[embryo]] through the process of [[embryogenesis]].  As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root, while the other end forms the tip of the shoot.  In [[seed]] plants, the embryo will develop one or more "seed leaves" ([[cotyledon]]s).  By the end of embryogenesis, the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin in its life.

Once the embryo [[germination|germinates]] from its seed or parent plant, it begins to produce additional organs (leaves, stems, and roots) through the process of [[organogenesis]].  New roots grow from root [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=134–41|pmid=11169586|year=2001|last1=Brand|first1=U|last2=Hobe|first2=M|last3=Simon|first3=R|title=Functional domains in plant shoot meristems|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200102)23:2&lt;134::AID-BIES1020&gt;3.0.CO;2-3|journal=BioEssays}} Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone [[cellular differentiation]] to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot.  Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed [[primary growth]] and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. [[Secondary growth]] results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=533–41|pmid= 15832381|year=2005|last1=Barlow|first1=P|title=Patterned cell determination in a plant tissue: The secondary phloem of trees|volume=27|issue=5|doi=10.1002/bies.20214|journal=BioEssays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to growth by [[cell (biology)|cell]] division, a plant may grow through '''cell elongation'''. This occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length.  When cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend to the side of the slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light ([[phototropism]]), gravity ([[gravitropism]]), water, ([[hydrotropism]]), and physical contact ([[thigmotropism]]).

Plant growth and development are mediated by specific [[plant hormone]]s and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983).&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;Ross, S.D.; Pharis, R.P.; Binder, W.D. 1983. Growth regulators and conifers: their physiology and potential uses in forestry. p. 35–78 ''in'' Nickell, L.G. (Ed.), Plant growth regulating chemicals. Vol. 2, CRC Press, Boca Raton FL.&lt;/ref&gt; Endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age, cold hardiness, dormancy, and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod, drought, temperature, and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of PGRs, e.g., externally applied and of rhizospheric origin.

=== Morphological variation ===
Plants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure.  While all organisms vary from individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation.  Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts.  This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation.  There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.

=== Evolution of plant morphology ===
Transcription factors and transcriptional regulatory networks play key roles in plant morphogenesis and their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex morphogenesis of land plants.&lt;ref name="MBE_1767"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP, et al. |title=An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767–1773 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602063847/http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |archivedate=2016-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental model organisms ==

Much of developmental biology research in recent decades has focused on the use of a small number of [[model organisms]]. It has turned out that there is much conservation of developmental mechanisms across the animal kingdom. In early development different vertebrate species all use essentially the same inductive signals and the same genes encoding regional identity. Even invertebrates use a similar repertoire of signals and genes although the body parts formed are significantly different. Model organisms each have some particular experimental advantages which have enabled them to become popular among researchers. In one sense they are "models" for the whole animal kingdom, and in another sense they are "models" for human development, which is difficult to study directly for both ethical and practical reasons. Model organisms have been most useful for elucidating the broad nature of developmental mechanisms. The more detail is sought, the more they differ from each other and from humans.

'''Flora Jean "Flo" Hyman''' (July 31, 1954 – January 24, 1986) was an American athlete who played [[volleyball]]. She was an [[1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] silver medalist and played professional volleyball in Japan.

==Early life and education==
Hyman was the second of eight children. As a child, Hyman was self-conscious about her size, her rapid growth and the fact that she towered over her peers. In 1983 she recalled "When they were three feet tall, I was four foot tall. When they reached four foot tall, I reached five".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flohyman.com/womens-sports-1983.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her nickname at school was "Jolly green giant"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flohyman.com/womens-sports-1983.html&lt;/ref&gt;, but her family and friends persuaded her to be proud of her height and to use it to her advantage.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Hyman's parents were tall. Her father was 6'1" (1.85 m) tall and her mother 5'11" (1.80 m), but Flo outgrew both of them. Her sister recalled Flo being 5'9" tall in the [[third grade]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wacotrib.com/sports/texas_sports_hall_of_fame/all-time-great-houston-teammates-blazed-path-for-volleyball-s/article_cadaee43-2299-5cfb-b218-b625a07443cf.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Flo's final adult height was just over 6'5" (1.96 m). Her shoe size was a size 12 USA men's or an EU 46. In January 1979, in an interview, Hyman said that she found the stares and questions about her height that she got from people irritating but she had learned to live with it.

When she was 12, and standing 6ft 2in tall, she began playing two-on-two tournaments on the beach, usually with her sister Suzanne as partner. In 1970, at the age of 16, Hyman started playing volleyball professionally. By the time Flo was a senior in high school, she had developed a lethal spike.

Hyman graduated from [[Morningside High School]] in [[Inglewood, California]] and then attended [[El Camino College]] for one year before transferring to the [[University of Houston]] as that school's first female scholarship athlete. She spent three years there and led the [[Houston Cougars]] to two top-five national finishes, but did not complete her final year, instead focusing her attention on her volleyball career.&lt;ref name=Hou/&gt; Hyman said she would graduate once her volleyball career was over and that "You can go to school when you're 60. You're only young once, and you can only do this once".

==Contribution to volleyball==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I had to learn to be honest with myself. I had to recognize my pain threshold. When I hit the floor, I have to realize it's not as if I broke a bone. Pushing yourself over the barrier is a habit. I know I can do it and try something else crazy. If you want to win the war, you've got to pay the price."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Hyman left Houston to play for the national team, based in Colorado. When Hyman joined, the squad was sorely in need of leadership. Operating without a coach, it had a host of talented players with no one at the helm to guide them.

In 1975 the U.S. team floundered through qualifying rounds for the 1976 Olympic games and failed to make it. In 1977 the team finished fifth at the World Championships. Hyman and her teammates looked forward to qualifying for and playing in the 1980 Olympics, but their dreams were curtailed when the United States boycotted the Moscow games.

Hyman played in the 1981 World Cup and the 1982 World Championship, when the US won the [[bronze]] medal. A speciality of Hyman was the "Flying Clutchman", a fast, hard-impacting volleyball spike that travels at 110&amp;nbsp;mph (180&amp;nbsp;km/h). It was perfected under Dr. [[Gideon Ariel]], a former 1960 and 1964 Israeli Olympic [[shot put]]ter in [[Coto de Caza, California]]. At the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]], Hyman, by now both the tallest and oldest member of the team, led the US to the [[silver]] medal, beaten by [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] in the final. The United States had defeated them earlier in the tournament.

==Death==

After the Olympics, Hyman moved to Japan to play volleyball professionally, joining the [[Daiei]] women's squad in the Japan Volleyball League. She was so popular in Japan that she began a modeling and acting career there and was constantly in demand. She intended to return to the United States permanently in the Summer of 1986, but never got the chance to do so. On January 24, 1986, Hyman collapsed while sitting on the sidelines after being substituted out in a game against [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] in Matsue City. She told her team to keep fighting, then moments later slid to the floor. She was pronounced dead at 9:36 that evening.

At first, the cause of Hyman's death was stated to be a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Not fully accepting this finding, her family requested that an autopsy be performed in [[Culver City]], California. The autopsy, which was held on January 30, dismissed the possibility of a heart attack. It found that Hyman had a very healthy heart, and instead it was determined that she had suffered from undiagnosed [[Marfan syndrome]], which had caused a fatal [[aortic dissection]]. Apart from her height, nearsightedness, very long arms and large hands, she showed few other physical symptoms. The pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Victor Rosen, said that Hyman physically had been in superb condition except for a single fatal flaw—a dime-sized weak spot in her aorta. That small spot, less than an inch above her heart, had been there since her birth, and the artery had burst at that point as she sat on the sideline in Matsue. There was a three-week-old blood clot around the tear, indicating that an earlier rip in the same spot had already begun to heal when the fatal second rupture occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Demak |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1986/02/17/638281/marfan-syndrome-a-silent-killer |title=Marfan Syndrome: A Silent Killer |website=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=February 17, 1986 |access-date=November 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Kessel |url=http://www.teamusa.org/usa-volleyball/features/2014/june/23/please-know-what-marfan-syndrom-is?p=1 |title=Please know what Marfan syndrome is |publisher=Team USA Volleyball |date=June 23, 2014 |type=blog |access-date=November 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors later discovered Hyman's brother had Marfan syndrome as well, and he underwent an [[open heart surgery]] afterwards. Experts believed Hyman was lucky to have survived as long as she did, playing a physically demanding sport such as volleyball.

She was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California, on January 31, 1986. Over 500 people attended the funeral service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Gildea |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1986/02/03/hyman-was-an-athlete-of-strength-and-spirit/250cdd9e-2d06-44f3-9f39-e4030f090a89/ |title=Hyman Was an Athlete Of Strength and Spirit |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 3, 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Volleyball star buried |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/66041139/ |newspaper=[[San Bernardino County Sun]] |date=February 1, 1986 |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1463">'''Gaius Aculeo''' was a Roman knight who married the sister of Helvia, the mother of [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Aculeo, C.  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 1  | place = Boston, MA  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0026.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was unsurpassed in his day in his knowledge of the [[Roman law]], and possessed great acuteness of mind, but was not distinguished for other attainments.  He was a friend of [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]], renowned as the greatest Roman orator of his day, and was defended by him upon one occasion.  The son of Aculeo was [[Gaius Visellius Varro]]; from which it would appear that Aculeo was only a surname given to the father from his acuteness, and that his full name was '''Gaius Visellius Varro Aculeo'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Oratore]]'' i. 43, ii. 1, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 76&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15194">Genetics play some role in the development of [[PTSD]]. Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused from genetics alone. For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin's having PTSD compared to twins that were dizygotic (non-identical twins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=True WR, Rice J, Eisen SA, Heath AC, Goldberg J, Lyons MJ, Nowak J |title=A twin study of genetic and environmental contributions to liability for posttraumatic stress symptoms |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=257–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8466386 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820160019002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that those with a genetically smaller [[hippocampus]] are more likely to develop PTSD following a traumatic event. Research has also found that PTSD shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders. Panic and generalized anxiety disorders and PTSD share 60% of the same genetic variance. Alcohol, nicotine, and [[drug dependence]] share greater than 40% genetic similarities.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Skelton K, Ressler KJ, Norrholm SD, Jovanovic T, Bradley-Davino B |title=PTSD and gene variants: New pathways and new thinking |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=628–637 |year=2012 |pmid=21356219 |pmc=3136568 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.02.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) is the major inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain. A recent study reported significant interactions between three [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in the GABA alpha-2 receptor gene and the severity of childhood trauma in predicting PTSD in adults. A study found those with a specific genotype for G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2), a protein that decreases [[G protein-coupled receptor]] signaling, and high environmental stress exposure as adults and a diagnosis of lifetime PTSD. This was particularly prevalent in adults with prior trauma exposure and low social support.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

Recently, it has been found that several [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in [[FKBP5|FK506 binding protein 5]] (FKBP5) interact with childhood trauma to predict severity of adult PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Newton |first=Phil |date=16 November 2008 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/200811/gene-anxiety-depression-and-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-fkbp5 |title=A gene for anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder; FKBP5 |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Binder EB, Bradley RG, Liu W, Epstein MP, Deveau TC, Mercer KB, Tang Y, Gillespie CF, Heim CM, Nemeroff CB, Schwartz AC, Cubells JF, Ressler KJ |title=Association of FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood abuse with risk of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=299 |issue=11 |pages=1291–305 |year=2008 |pmid=18349090 |pmc=2441757 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.11.1291}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that individuals with these SNPs who are abused as children are more susceptible to PTSD as adults.

This is particularly interesting given that FKBP5 SNPs have previously been associated with [[wikt:peritraumatic|peritraumatic]] dissociation in medically injured children (that is, [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] at the time of the birth trauma),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koenen KC, Saxe G, Purcell S, Smoller JW, Bartholomew D, Miller A, Hall E, Kaplow J, Bosquet M, Moulton S, Baldwin C |title=Polymorphisms in FKBP5 are associated with peritraumatic dissociation in medically injured children |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1058–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16088328 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001727}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has itself been shown to be predictive of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birmes P, Brunet A, Carreras D, Ducassé JL, Charlet JP, Lauque D, Sztulman H, Schmitt L |title=The predictive power of peritraumatic dissociation and acute stress symptoms for posttraumatic stress symptoms: a three-month prospective study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1337–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12832251 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jtraumastress"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schnurr PP, Lunney CA, Sengupta A |title=Risk factors for the development versus maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=J Trauma Stress |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=85–95 |year=2004 |pmid=15141781 |doi=10.1023/B:JOTS.0000022614.21794.f4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, FKBP5 may be less [[gene expression|expressed]] in those with current PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yehuda R, Cai G, Golier JA, Sarapas C, Galea S, Ising M, Rein T, Schmeidler J, Müller-Myhsok B, Holsboer F, Buxbaum JD |title=Gene expression patterns associated with posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to the World Trade Center attacks |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=708–11 |date=24 April 2009 |pmid=19393990 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study found a single SNP in a putative [[estrogen response element]] on [[ADCYAP1R1]] (encodes pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor or PAC1) to predict PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ressler KJ, Mercer KB, Bradley B, Jovanovic T, Mahan A, Kerley K, Norrholm SD, Kilaru V, Smith AK, Myers AJ, Ramirez M, Engel A, Hammack SE, Toufexis D, Braas KM, Binder EB, May V |title=Post-traumatic stress disdorder is associated with PACAP and the PAC1 receptor |journal=Nature |volume=470 |issue=7335 |pages=492–497 |date=February 24, 2011 |pmid=21350482 |pmc=3046811 |doi=10.1038/nature09856 |laysummary=http://www.sciguru.com/newsitem/6364/Fear-Factor-Researchers-on-Trail-of-Marker-to-Predict-Risk-of-PTSD/ |laydate=March 2, 2011 |laysource=SciGuru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, this SNP is also associated with fear discrimination. The study suggests that perturbations in the [[PACAP]]-PAC1 pathway are involved in abnormal stress responses underlying PTSD.

PTSD is a [[psychiatric disorder]] that requires an environmental event that individuals may have varied responses to so [[gene-environment interaction|gene-environment]] studies tend to be the most indicative of their effect on the probability of PTSD then studies of the main effect of the gene. Recent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFBP5 and childhood environment to predict the severity of PTSD. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in FKBP5 have been associated with peritraumatic dissociation in mentally ill children. A study of highly traumatized African-American subjects from inner city primary-care clinics indicated 4 polymorphisms of the FKBP5 gene, each of these functional. The interaction between the polymorphisms and the severity of childhood abuse predicts the severity of the adult PTSD symptoms. A more recent study of the African-American population indicated that the TT genotype of the FKBP5 gene is associated with the highest risk of PTSD among those having experienced childhood adversity, however those with this genotype that experienced no childhood adversity had the lowest risk of PTSD. In addition [[alcohol dependence]] interacts with the FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood adversity to increase the risk of PTSD in these populations. Emergency room expression of the FKPB5 mRNA following trauma was shown to indicate a later development of PTSD.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

[[Catechol-O-methyl transferase]] (COMT) is an [[enzyme]] that catalyzes the extraneuronal breakdown of [[catecholamines]]. The gene that codes for COMT has a functional polymorphism in which a [[valine]] has been replaced with a [[methionine]] at codon 158. This polymorphism has lower enzyme activity and has been tied to slower breakdown of the catecholamines. A study, of Rwandan Genocide survivors, indicated that carriers of the Val allel demonstrated the expected response relationship between the higher number of lifetime traumatic events and a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. However, those with homozygotes for the Met/Met genotype demonstrated a high risk of lifetime PTSD independent of the number of traumatic experiences. Those with Met/Met genotype also demonstrated a reduced extinction of conditioned fear responses with may account for the high risk for PTSD experienced by this genotype.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

Many genes impact the limbic-frontal neurocircuitry as a result of its complexity. The main effect of the D2A1 allele of the [[dopamine receptor D2]] (DRD2) has a strong association with the diagnosis of PTSD. The D2A1 allele has also shown a significant association to PTSD in those having engaged in harmful drinking. In addition a polymorphism in the [[dopamine transporter]] SLC6A3 gene has a significant association with chronic PTSD. A polymorphism of the [[serotonin receptor]] 2A gene has been associated with PTSD in Korean women. The short allele of the promoter region of the [[serotonin transporter]] (5-HTTLPR) has been shown to be less efficient then the long allele and is associated with the [[amygdala]] response for extinction of fear conditioning. However, the short allele is associated with a decreased risk of PTSD in a low risk environment but a high risk of PTSD in a high risk environment. The s/s genotype demonstrated a high risk for development of PTSD even in response to a small number of traumatic events, but those with the l allele demonstrate increasing rates of PTSD with increasing traumatic experiences.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

[[Genome-wide association study]] (GWAS) offer an opportunity to identify novel risk variants for PTSD that will in turn inform our understanding of the [[etiology]] of the disorder. Early results indicate the feasibility and potential power of GWAS to identify [[biomarkers]] for anxiety-related behaviors that suggest a future of PTSD. These studies will lead to the discovery of novel loci for the susceptibility and symptomatology of anxiety disorders including PTSD.{{dubious|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

== Epigenetics ==
Gene and environment studies alone fail to explain the importance the developmental stressor timing exposure to the phenotypic changes associated with PTSD. [[Epigenetic]] modification is the environmentally induced change in DNA that alters the function rather than the structure of the gene. The biological mechanism of epigenetic modification typically involves the methylation of cytosine within a gene that produces decreased transcription of that segment of DNA. The [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] alteration seen in animal models parallel those of PTSD in which low basal [[cortisol]] and enhanced suppression of cortisol in response to synthetic [[glucocorticoid]] becomes [[hereditary]]. Lower levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA have been demonstrated in the [[hippocampus]] of suicide victims with histories of childhood abuse. It has not been possible to monitor the state of methylation over time, however the interpretation is early developmental methylation changes are long-lasting and enduring. It is hypothesized that epigenetic-mediated changes in the [[HPA axis]] could be associated with an increased vulnerability to PTSD following traumatic events. These findings support the mechanism in which early life trauma strongly validates as a risk factor for PTSD development in adulthood by recalibrating the set point and stress-responsivity of the HPA axis. Studies have reported an increased risk for PTSD and low cortisol levels in the offspring of female holocaust survivors with PTSD. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be relevant to the intrauterine environment. Mothers with PTSD produced infants with lower salivary cortisol levels only if the traumatic exposure occurred during the third trimester of gestation. These changes occur via transmission of hormonal responses to the fetus leading to a reprogramming of the glucocorticoid responsivity in the offspring.&lt;ref name="Skelton 2012 628–637" /&gt;

== Evolutionary psychology ==
[[Evolutionary psychology]] views different types of fears and reactions caused by fears as [[adaptation]]s that may have been useful in the ancestral environment in order to avoid or cope with various threats. In general, [[mammal]]s display several defensive behaviors roughly dependent on how close the threat is: avoidance, vigilant immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defense, appeasement, and finally complete frozen immobility (the last possibly to confuse a predator's attack reflex or to simulate a dead and contaminated body). PTSD may correspond to and be caused by overactivation of such fear circuits. Thus, PTSD avoidance behaviors may correspond to mammal avoidance of and withdrawal from threats. Heightened memory of past threats may increase avoidance of similar situations in the future as well as be a prerequisite for analyzing the past threat and develop better defensive behaviors if the threat should recur. PTSD [[Fight-or-flight response|hyperarousal]] may correspond to vigilant immobility and aggressive defense. [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|Complex posttraumatic stress disorder]] (and phenomena such as the [[Stockholm syndrome]]) may in part correspond to the appeasement stage and possibly the frozen immobility stage.&lt;ref name="Cantor2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chris Cantor |title=Evolution and posttraumatic stress: disorders of vigilance and defence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBavaOGUd_MC&amp;pg=PR3 |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-58391-771-8 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cantor C, Price J |title=Traumatic entrapment, appeasement and complex post-traumatic stress disorder: Evolutionary perspectives of hostage reactions, domestic abuse and the Stockholm syndrome |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=377–384 |year=2007 |pmid=17464728 |pmc= |doi=10.1080/00048670701261178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be evolutionary explanations for differences in resilience to traumatic events. Thus, PTSD is rare following traumatic fire that may be explained by events such as forest fires' long being part of the evolutionary history of mammals. On the other hand, PTSD is much more common following modern warfare, which may be explained by modern warfare's being a new development and very unlike the quick inter-group raids that are argued to have characterized the [[paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the "Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=827–853 |year=2006 |pmid=16563589 |pmc= |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ginger Fitzgerald''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] in the [[Ginger Snaps (film)|''Ginger Snaps'' trilogy]]. She was portrayed by [[Katharine Isabelle]] and serves as the [[antihero]] of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ginger-snaps.com/interview_katharine_isabelle.htm|title=Katharine Isabelle - GINGER SNAPS - the movie|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;



== Appearances ==

=== ''Ginger Snaps'' ===
In ''[[Ginger Snaps (film)|Ginger Snaps]]'', Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who are both fascinated with death and, as children, formed a pact to die together. One night, while preparing to steal the dog of bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger starts her first period, which causes the girls to be attacked by a [[werewolf]]. Ginger is wounded, but is rescued by Brigitte. The creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam MacDonald, a local drug dealer. Ginger decides not to go the hospital as her wounds heal quickly. She slowly begins to change causing Brigitte to become worried and desperate to find a cure. After several failed cure attempts, Brigitte discovers that a dose of [[monkshood]] helps control the infection. Before Brigitte can inject Ginger with the plant, she completely transforms forcing Brigitte to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/ginger-snaps/|title=Ginger Snaps (2001)|last=|first=|date=|website=Pop Matters|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/ginger-snaps-59115521/|title=Ginger Snaps {{!}} Movie {{!}} 2001|last=|first=|date=|website=Hollywood.com|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed'' ===
In ''[[Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed]]'', while only appearing as a minor character, Ginger is seen in several of Brigitte's hallucinations telling her to give in to the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/ginger-snaps-2-unleashed|title=Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed - Movie Review|last=|first=|date=|website=Common Sense Media|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning'' ===
In ''[[Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning]]'', Ginger returns as a lead character. Ginger and Brigitte are lost with their horse in the Canadian wilderness when they discover an "abandoned camp". An Indian woman gives them each a pendant. Brigitte's foot is caught in a trap. Ginger seeks help, but a hunter frees Brigitte before she returns. They are led to Fort Bailey. A group of [[Werewolf|werewolfs]] attack the camp and Ginger is bitten on the shoulder. After being held prisoner and fighting back, Ginger opens the gates and lets the werewolves enter. Ginger and Brigitte are the only ones left alive. Brigitte cuts her hand and presses it against a cut on Gingers hand mixing their blood and infecting Brigitte.

== Development ==

=== Casting ===
Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/26/ginger_snaps/index.html|title=Ginger Snaps|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=October 26, 2001|work=salon.com|accessdate=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''What Culture'' said:

: "Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when shes bitten by a lycanthrope and the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over-sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail that she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Gingers humanity and her animalistic side."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-badass-female-horror-villains?page=5|title=10 Badass Female Horror Villains|last=|first=|date=|website=What Culture|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Roakes of ''The Toast'' also mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying "Ginger’s body has betrayed her by menstruating. This is a key tenant of the body-horror genre — the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger’s case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2014/10/29/ginger-snaps-menstrual-horror-movie-dreams/|title=Ginger Snaps: The Menstrual Horror Movie Of Your Dreams|last=|first=|date=|website=The Toast|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grauballe Man''' is a [[bog body]] that was uncovered in 1952 from a [[peat]] [[bog]] near the village of Grauballe in [[Jutland]], Denmark. The body is that of a man dating from the late 3rd century BC, during the early [[Germanic Iron Age]]. Based on the evidence of his wounds, he was most likely killed by having his throat slit. His corpse was then deposited in the bog, where his body was naturally preserved for over two millennia. He was not the only bog body to be found in the peat bogs of Jutland: with other notable examples  [[Tollund Man]] and the [[Elling Woman]], Grauballe Man represents an established tradition at the time; it is commonly thought that these killings, including that of Grauballe Man, were examples of [[human sacrifice]], possibly an important rite in Iron Age [[Germanic paganism]].

Grauballe Man has been described as "one of the most spectacular discoveries from Denmark's prehistory"&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to {{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is one of the most exceptionally preserved bog bodies in the world. Upon excavation in 1952, it was moved to the Prehistoric Museum in [[Aarhus]], where it underwent research and conservation. In 1955 the body went on display at the [[Moesgaard Museum]] near Aarhus, where it can still be seen today.

Grauballe Man was initially dated to the late 3rd century BC by analysing the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] layer of peat that his body was found in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page=17 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This date was subsequently confirmed by [[radiocarbon dating]] his liver, the results of which were published in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page=31 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===
[[File:Grauballe Man discovery.jpg|thumb|The body of the Grauballe Man upon his discovery.]]
Information about the Grauballe Man's life have been ascertained from his remains. His hands were smooth and did not show evidence of hard work, indicating that Grauballe Man was not employed in hard labour such as [[farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page=21 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of his [[teeth]] and [[jaw]]s indicated that he had suffered from "periods of starvation or a poor state of health during his early childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ahrenholt-Bindslev |first1= Josephen |authorlink1= |last2= Ahrenholt-Bindslev |first2= Jurik |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= Pauline |editor1-last= Asingh |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Niels |editor2-last= Lynnerup |editor2-link= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|series= |year= 2007 | publisher= Aarhus University press |location= Aarhus |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page=140 |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter= Grauballe Man's teeth and jaws }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man's skeleton showed signs of significant [[calcium]] deficiency, and his spine also suffered the early stages of ''spondylosis deformans'',  a generalized disease of aging that is secondary to the degeneration of intervertebral disks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gregersen |first1= Markil |authorlink1= |last2= Jurik |first2= Anne Grethe |authorlink2= |last3= Lynnerup |first3= Niels |authorlink3= |coauthors= |editor1-first= Pauline |editor1-last= Asingh |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Niels |editor2-last= Lynnerup |editor2-link= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|series= |year= 2007 | publisher= Aarhus University press |location= Aarhus |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page=240 |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Forensic evidence, injuries and cause of death }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the shrinkage that the corpse suffered in the bog, the man's actual height is not known. It is known that he had dark hair, although this too was altered in the bog, and now appears reddish in colour.

===Death===
The corpse was not found with any artifacts or any evidence of clothing, indicating that when he died he was entirely [[naked]], or his clothing had deteriorated, something that had also happened with the [[Tollund Man]].&lt;ref name=Lauber&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauber|first=Patricia G.|title=Tales Mummies Tell|year=1985|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|isbn=0690043899|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page=19 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual manner of his death was by having his throat cut ear to ear, severing his [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[oesophagus]].

==Discovery, preservation and exhibition==
[[File:Grauballemannen3.jpg|thumb|The well preserved hand of Grauballe Man]]
[[File:Grauballe Man reconstruction.jpg|thumb|150px|Facial reconstruction of the Grauballe Man's face]]

The Grauballe Man's body was first discovered buried in the bog on 26 April 1952 by a team of peat diggers. One of the workmen, Tage Busk Sørensen, stuck his spade into something that he knew was not peat; upon revealing more they discovered the head protruding from the ground, and the local postman, who was passing, alerted the local doctor as well as an amateur [[archaeology|archaeologist]] named Ulrik Balslev. With the body still in the peat, various locals came to visit it over the next day, one of whom accidentally stepped on its head. The following morning, Professor [[Peter Glob]] from the Prehistory Museum at [[Aarhus]] came to visit the body, and arranged for it to be removed to the museum, still encased in a block of surrounding peat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page= |pages=16–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glob and his team decided that they should not only research the body but that they should also attempt to preserve it so that it could be exhibited to the public. This concept was new at the time as most of the bog bodies previously discovered had been re-buried, sometimes in [[consecrated ground]], with the [[Tollund Man]] which had been discovered two years earlier having only its head preserved. Despite the warnings of some scientists who believed that the corpse should immediately undergo preservation, it was exhibited straight away in order to capitalise on public interest. Indeed, the scientists' fears were proved right, as mould started to appear on certain areas of the body as a result of it having to be kept permanently moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Asingh. |first1= Pauline |authorlink1= |last2=Lynnerup |first2=Niels |authorlink2= |title= Grauballe man: An Iron Age bog body revisited |trans-title=|year=2007 |publisher=Aarhus University press |location=Aarhus |language= |isbn= 978-87-88415-29-2 |page= |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body then underwent research, including a [[post-mortem]], and then preservation, which was organised by conservator C. Lange-Kornbak, who had to decide on the best way to do this. (No entire bog body had ever been preserved before.) He examined various methods for doing so, before deciding on a programme of [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] the body to turn it into [[leather]] and then stuffing it with oak bark.&lt;ref&gt;Strehle, Helle (2007). ''Grauballe Man: An Iron Age Bog Body Rediscovered''. Jutland Archaeological Society. Page 36-43.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the body went on display at the [[Moesgaard Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], only to be removed for a time in 2001-2002 when it underwent more modern scientific study, including [[radiology|radiological study]], [[CT scanning]], 3D visualisation, [[stereolithography]] and analyses of the gut contents.

==Modern culture==
The Grauballe Man is the subject of a poem by [[Seamus Heaney]], as is the [[Tollund Man]].

The '''health management system''' (HMS) is an [[evolutionary medicine]] regulative process proposed by [[Nicholas Humphrey]]&lt;ref name="Great"&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Nicholas |chapter=19. Great Expectations: The Evolutionary Psychology of Faith-Healing and the Placebo Effect |chapterurl=http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/2002GreatExpectations.pdf |title=The Mind Made Flesh: Essays from the Frontiers of Psychology and Evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages=255–85 |isbn=0-19-280227-5 }} reprinted from {{cite book |author=Hofsten, Claes von |title=Psychology at the Turn of the Millennium: Social, Developmental and Clinical Perspectives |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=2002 |pages=225–46 |isbn=1-84169-199-2 |volume=2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Nicholas |chapter=The Placebo Effect |editor=Gregory, Richard Langton |authorlink=Richard Gregory |title=The Oxford companion to the mind |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-866224-6 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in which actuarial assessment of [[Biological fitness|fitness]] and economic-type [[cost–benefit analysis]] determines the body’s regulation of its [[physiology]] and [[health]]. This incorporation of cost–benefit calculations into body regulation provides a science grounded approach to [[Mind-body connection|mind–body]] phenomena such as [[placebos]] that are otherwise not explainable by low level, noneconomic, and purely feedback based [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] or [[allostasis|allostatic]] theories.

* Many medical [[symptoms]] such as [[inflammation]], [[fever]], pain, [[sickness behavior]], or [[morning sickness]] have an [[evolutionary medicine]] function of enabling the body to protect, heal or restore itself from [[injury]], [[infection]] or other physiological disruption.
* The deployment of self-treatments have [[Deployment cost–benefit selection in physiology|costs]] as well as benefits with the result that evolution has selected management processes in the brain such that self-treatments are used only when they provide an overall [[cost–benefit]] advantage. The brain controls such physiological process through [[Neural top–down control of physiology|top–down regulation]].
* External treatment and the availability of support is factored into the health management system’s cost–benefit assessment as to whether to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

[[Placebos]] are explained as the result of false information about the availability of external treatment and support that mislead the health management system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Selvanski Monsu |title=Healthcare Management Systems |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.nintec.com/healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; into not deploying evolved self-treatments. This results in the placebo suppression of medical symptoms.

==Evolutionary medicine==

Since [[Hippocrates]], it has been recognized that the body has self-healing powers ([[vis medicatrix naturae]]). Modern [[evolutionary medicine]] identifies them with physiologically based self-treatments that provide the body with [[prophylactic]], healing, or restorative capabilities against injuries, infections and physiological disruption.  Examples include:

* [[Immunity (medical)|Immune responses]]
* [[Fever]]
* [[Sickness behavior]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Morning sickness]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|Hypoferremia]]
* [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]
* [[pain#Evolutionary and behavioral role|Pain]]

These evolved self-treatments deployed by the body are experienced by humans as unpleasant and unwanted illness [[symptoms]].

==Deployment==

Such self-treatments according to evolutionary medicine are deployed to increase an individual’s  [[biological fitness]].

Two factors affect their deployment.

First, it is usually advantageous to deploy them on a [[precautionary principle|precautionary basis]].&lt;ref  name="Nesse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03472.x |author=Nesse RM |authorlink=Randolph M. Nesse |title=The smoke detector principle. Natural selection and the regulation of defensive responses |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=935 |issue= |pages=75–85 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11411177 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=935&amp;spage=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, it will often turn out that they have been deployed apparently unnecessarily, though this has in fact been advantageous since in probabilistic terms they have provided an insurance against a potentially costly outcome. As Nesse notes: "Vomiting, for example, may cost only a few hundred calories and a few minutes, whereas not vomiting may result in a 5% chance of death" page 77.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt;

Second, self-treatments are costly both in using energy, and also in their risk of damaging the body.

* Immunity – energy for activating lymphocyte and antibody production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lochmiller R, Deerenberg C |title=Trade-offs in evolutionary immunology: just what is the cost of immunity? |journal=Oikos |volume=88 |issue= |pages=87–98 |year=2000 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880110.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romanyukha AA, Rudnev SG, Sidorov IA |title=Energy cost of infection burden: an approach to understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=241 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16378624 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.11.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(05)00479-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the risk of an immune response resulting in an [[immune disorders|immune related disorder]].
* Fever – energy (each 1&amp;nbsp;°C raise in blood temperature increases energy expenditure by  10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodriguez DJ, Sandoval W, Clevenger FW |title=Is measured energy expenditure correlated to injury severity score in major trauma patients? |journal=J. Surg. Res. |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=455–9 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7564317 |doi=10.1006/jsre.1995.1191 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-4804(85)71191-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000658-196501000-00022 |vauthors=Roe CF, Kinney JM |title=The Caloric Equivalent of Fever II.

Surg. |volume=161 |issue= 1|pages=140–7 |date=January 1965 |pmid=14252624 |pmc=1408758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of the total cost of fighting [[pneumonia]] goes on increased body temperature.&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06/&gt; There is also the risk of [[hyperpyrexia]].
* Sickness behavior – restricted ability by an animal to forage and defend itself
* Nausea – loss of food nutrients, and potential risk of [[Vomiting#Complications|aspiration]]
* Morning sickness – loss of food nutrients when a mother needs additional, not less, nourishment
* Hypoferremia – impairment in biological processes needing iron resulting in [[iron deficiency anemia]]
* Depression – [[Evolutionary approaches to depression|impaired activity and problem solving]].
* Pain – restricted movement and the [[Chronic pain#Related sequelae|inability to concentrate]]

One factor in deployment is low level physiological control by [[proinflammatory cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] triggered by bacterial [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS).

Another is [[Neural top down control of physiology|higher level control]] in which the brain takes into account what it learns about circumstances and how that makes it well and ill. [[Classical conditioning|Conditioning]] shows the existence of such learnt control: give saccharin paired in a drink with a drug that creates [[immunosuppression]], and later on, giving saccharin alone will produce immunosuppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ader R, Cohen N |title=Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |year=1975 |pmid=1162023 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1162023 |doi=10.1097/00006842-197507000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1048 |vauthors=Alvarez-Borda B, Ramírez-Amaya V, Pérez-Montfort R, Bermúdez-Rattoni F |title=Enhancement of antibody production by a learning paradigm |journal=Neurobiol Learn Mem |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=103–5 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7582817 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074742785710489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00031-4 |vauthors=Oberbeck R, Kromm A, Exton MS, Schade U, Schedlowski M |title=Pavlovian conditioning of endotoxin-tolerance in rats |journal=Brain Behav.

==Cost benefit analysis==

=== Economic resource management===
Evolution, according to [[Nicholas Humphrey]], has selected an internal health management system that uses [[cost benefit analysis]] upon whether the deployment of a self-treatment aids [[biological fitness]], and so should be activated. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;a specially designed procedure for “economic resource management” that is, I believe, one of the key features of the “natural health-care service” which has evolved in ourselves and other animals to help us deal throughout our lives with repeated bouts of sickness, injury, and other threats to our well-being.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An analogy is explicitly made with the [[health economics]] consideration used in management decisions involving external medical treatment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, if you wonder about this choice of managerial terminology for talking about biological healing systems, I should say that it is quite deliberate (and so is the pun on NHS.) With the phrase “natural health-care service” I do intend to evoke, at a biological level, all the economic connotations that are so much a part of modern health-care in society.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===External medications===
External medications will affect the cost benefits advantages of deploying an evolved self-treatment. Some animals use [[Zoopharmacognosy|external ones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engel, Cindy |title=Wild Health : Lessons in Natural Wellness from the Animal Kingdom |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-34068-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife|Wild animals]], including [[apes]],  do so in the form of ingested [[geophagy|detoxifying clays]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein N, Fröhlich F, Krief S |title=Geophagy: soil consumption enhances the bioactivities of plants eaten by chimpanzees |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=325–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18188538 |doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; rough leaves that clear gut parasites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fowler A, Koutsioni Y, Sommer V |title=Leaf-swallowing in Nigerian chimpanzees: evidence for assumed self-medication |journal=Primates |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=73–6 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16897194 |doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pharmacologically active plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1079/PNS2003257 |author=Huffman MA |title=Animal self-medication and ethno-medicine: exploration and exploitation of the medicinal properties of plants |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=371–81 |date=May 2003 |pmid=14506884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90368-9 |vauthors=Koshimizu K, Ohigashi H, Huffman MA |title=Use of Vernonia amygdalina by wild chimpanzee: possible roles of its bitter and related constituents |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1209–16 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7878093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to this, research finds that animals have the ability to select and prefer substances that aid their recuperation from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.173.3998.749 |vauthors=Green KF, Garcia J |title=Recuperation from illness: flavor enhancement for rats |journal=Science |volume=173 |issue=3998 |pages=749–51 |date=August 1971 |pmid=5568508 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5568508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support===
The welfare of social animals (including humans) depends upon other individuals ([[Tend and befriend|social buffering]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikusui T, Winslow JT, Mori Y |title=Social buffering: relief from stress and anxiety |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=361 |issue=1476 |pages=2215–28 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17118934 |pmc=1764848 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1941 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17118934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actuarial assessments of the costs and benefits of deploying a self-treatment therefore will depend upon the presence, or not, of  other individuals. The presence of helpful others will affect, for example, the risk of predators when incapacitated, and—in those case in which animals do this (such as humans)—the provision of food, and care during sickness.

The health management system factors in the presence of such external treatment and social support as one aspect of the circumstances needed to determine whether it is advantageous to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

All humans societies use external medications, and some individuals exist that are considered to have special [[healers|healing]] knowledge about illnesses and their treatments. Humans are also usually supportive to those in their group. The availability of these things will affect the cost benefits of the body deploying its own biological ones. This could, in turn, lead to the health management system (given its beliefs (information) about treatments and support) to deploy or not, or doing so differently, the body’s own treatments.

Nicholas Humphrey describes how the health management system explains placebos – an external treatment without direct physiological effects – as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, for example, a doctor gives someone who is suffering an infection a pill that she rightly believes to contain an antibiotic: because her hopes will be raised she will no doubt make appropriate adjustments to her health-management strategy – lowering her precautionary defences in anticipation of the sickness not lasting long.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The health management system, in other words, when faced with an infection is tricked into making a mistaken cost benefit analysis using false information. The effect of that false information is that the benefits of the self-treatment cease to outweigh its costs. As a result, it is not deployed, and an individual does not experience unwanted medical symptoms.

===Lack of harm===
Failure to deploy an evolved self-treatment need not put an individual at risk since evolution has advantaged their deployment on a precautionary basis.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt; As Nicholas Humphrey notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; many of the health-care measures we’ve been discussing are precautionary measures designed to protect from dangers that lie ahead in an uncertain future. Pain is a way of making sure you give your body rest just in case you need it. Rationing the use of the immune system is a way of making sure you have the resources to cope with renewed attacks just in case they happen. Your healing systems are basically tending to be cautious, and sometimes over-cautious, as if working on the principle of better safe than sorry.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, not deploying an evolved self-treatment, and so not having a medical symptom due to placebo false information might be without consequence.

==Central governor==

The health management system’s idea of a top down neural control of the body is also found in the idea that a [[central governor]] regulates [[muscle weakness|muscle fatigue]] to protect the body from the harmful effects (such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and [[hyperglycemia]]) of over prolonged exercise.

The idea of a fatigue governor was first proposed in 1924 by the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Archibald Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill AV, Long CN, Lupton H |title=Muscular exercise, lactic acid and the supply and utilisation of oxygen. Parts I–III |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. |volume=97 |pages=438–75 |year=1924 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/k51611345m783727/fulltext.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, on the basis of modern research, by  [[Tim Noakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200333030-00001  |vauthors=St Clair Gibson A, Baden DA, Lambert MI, etal |title=The conscious perception of the sensation of fatigue |journal=Sports Med |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=167–76 |year=2003 |pmid=12656638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, St Clair Gibson A, Lambert EV |title=From catastrophe to complexity: a novel model of integrative central neural regulation of effort and fatigue during exercise in humans: summary and conclusions |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=120–4 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15665213 |pmc=1725112 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2003.010330 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15665213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, Peltonen JE, Rusko HK |title=Evidence that a central governor regulates exercise performance during acute hypoxia and hyperoxia |journal=J.

Like with the health management system, the central governor shares the idea that much of what is attributed to low level feedback homeostatic regulation is, in fact, due to [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]] control by the brain.  The advantage of this top down management is that the brain can enhance such regulation by allowing it to be modified by information. For example, in endurance running, a [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]] trade exists off between the advantages of continuing to run, and the risk if this is too prolonged that it might harm the body. Being able to regulate fatigue in terms of information about the benefits and costs of continued exercise would enhance biological fitness.

Low level theories exist that suggest that fatigue is due  mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards RHT |chapter=Biochemical bases for fatigue in exercise performance: catastrophe theory in muscular fatigue |veditors=Knuttgen HG, Vogel JA, Poortmans J |title=Biochemistry of exercise |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, IL |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-608-07112-1 |pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low level theories do not explain why running muscle fatigue is affected by information relevant to cost benefit trade offs. For example, [[marathon]] runners can carry on running longer if told they are near the finishing line, than far away. The existence of a central governor can explain this effect.

'''Helen Linda Smith''' (3 January 1956 – 20 May 1979) was a British nurse who died in allegedly suspicious circumstances in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], after apparently falling from a balcony during a party. Her father refused to accept that her death was an accident, and alleged that there was a conspiracy to conceal the truth. 

Mr Smith's campaign led to changes in the rules concerning inquests to violent deaths of UK citizens occurring outside the country. Helen Smith's body was stored for thirty years before being buried in 2009. The official version of her death was never disproved. 

==Death==
Following a party at the house of Dr Richard Arnot and his wife Penny,&lt;ref name=Bingham2&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/6446951/Father-agrees-to-bury-daughters-body-after-30-years-in-mortuary.html|title= Father agrees to bury daughter's body after 30 years in mortuary|publisher= Daily Telegraph|date= 27 October 2009|accessdate= 2 November 2009|first= John|last= Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bodies of Helen (23) and Johannes Otten (35), a [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] [[tugboat]] captain, were found in the street 70 feet below the Arnots' sixth floor balcony.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6892994.ece|title= Funeral to be held for nurse who died in Saudi Arabia 30 years ago|publisher= Times Online|first= Will|last= Pavia|date= 28 October 2009|accessdate= 2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen was found lying in the road clothed but with her underpants partly off&lt;ref name=abc.net.au&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.abc.net.au/austory/transcripts/s141180.htm|title= Australian Story|publisher= abc.net.au|date= 22 June 2000|accessdate= 4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johannes, whose underpants were around his thighs, was impaled upon the spiked railings surrounding the apartment block.

Also present at the Arnots' that night were Tim Hayter, a diver from New Zealand, a marine biologist named Jacques Texier, four German salvage operators and quite a number of other people who were never traced.

The presence of alcohol at the party in a "dry" country, and evidence given by Jacques Texier of a sexual encounter between Tim Hayter and Mrs Arnot at the time of the deaths, led to increased interest in the case, and the prosecution of Mrs Arnot by the Saudi authorities for "unlawful intercourse". Richard Arnot was sentenced to eighty strokes of the cane, to be administered in public, for illegally supplying alcohol – although the sentence was never carried out. Arnot also potentially faced a year in prison for "allowing his wife to talk and dance with other men".&lt;ref name = "fweb"&gt;"I Know That People Still Believe That I Was Helen Smith's Killer; THE DOCTOR AT THE CENTRE OF ONE OF THE GREAT UNSOLVED MYSTERY DEATHS SPEAKS FOR THE FIRST TIME", ''Daily Mail'', 9 February 1999, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Saudi investigation into the incident concluded that the couple had fallen from the balcony while drunk, possibly after or during a sexual encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/8327688.stm|title= Funeral for 1979 Saudi fall nurse|publisher= BBC News|date= 27 October 2009|accessdate= 2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion was endorsed by the British [[Foreign Office]].&lt;ref name=Bingham2/&gt;

==Campaign==
Helen's father Ron Smith, a retired policeman, refused to accept the conclusion and embarked upon a lengthy campaign to expose what he considered to be a Saudi–British coverup.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; He accused Richard Arnot of murdering his daughter. Arnot later wrote the book ''Arabian Nightmare'' about his experience of being prosecuted in Saudi Arabia and being subsequently accused of rape and murder by Ron Smith.&lt;ref name = "fweb"/&gt;

At her father's insistence, Helen's body was left unburied for more than 30 years in storage at [[Leeds General Infirmary]], thought to be the longest time a body has been stored without burial in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Bingham2/&gt; Some six different [[post mortem]] examinations and [[forensic]] investigations were performed over this period, with varying conclusions.

The death of Helen Smith and her father's subsequent campaign led to a change in the rules regarding inquests into violent or unnatural deaths abroad.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; The West Yorkshire Coroner, Philip Gill had declined to hold an inquest, concluding that the case was outside his jurisdiction. Although his decision was upheld by the High Court, in July 1982 the Court of Appeal ordered the inquest to go ahead. The ruling imposed a duty on coroners to investigate deaths abroad where the body was returned to [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name=Bingham&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/6447869/Helen-Smith-Fathers-campaign-which-led-to-Diana-Princess-of-Wales-inquest.html|title= Helen Smith: Father’s campaign which led to Diana, Princess of Wales, inquest|publisher= Daily Telegraph|first= John|last= Bingham|date= 28 October 2009|accessdate= 2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing was billed as the inquest of the century but failed to give Ron Smith the closure he had wanted; the jury returned an open verdict.&lt;ref name=Bingham/&gt; The 1982 ruling affected thousands of cases and was later cited as a reason for the decision to hold an inquest into the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref name=Bingham/&gt; Human Rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson wrote about his time acting for Ron Smith, Helen's father, at the inquest into her death. Robertson theorises that Helen did not fall from the balcony while having sex, but was possibly sexually assaulted before her death. "Usher (the pathologist) thought they (genital injuries) indicated rape, and suggested some violent sexual activity had taken place". Robertson also states in his book that pathologists "Dalgaard, Usher &amp; Green.......produced evidence which precluded a fall from a height".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Justice Game|last=Robertson|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1988|isbn=9781446444504|location=London|pages=|language=English|oclc=742560407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2017}}

==Funeral in 2009==
Although her father had insisted that Helen would not receive a funeral until the full circumstances of her death had been uncovered, following discussions with Helen's mother he agreed to hold a funeral while both of them were still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wainwright [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/28/helen-smith-saudi-party-cremation "British nurse who died at Saudi drinks party to be cremated after 30 years",] ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Smith's remains were cremated on 9 November 2009, over 30 years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/8349764.stm|title= Funeral for nurse killed in 1979|publisher= BBC News|date= 9 November 2009|accessdate= 9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ashes were scattered on [[Ilkley Moor]].

'''''How to Start a Revolution''''' is a [[BAFTA]] Award-winning British [[documentary film]] about [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nominee and political theorist [[Gene Sharp]], described as the world's foremost scholar on [[nonviolent revolution]]. The 2011 film describes Sharp's ideas, and their influence on popular uprisings around the world. Screened in cinemas and television in more than 22 countries it became popular among the [[Occupy Wall Street Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/your-democracy/2013/01/gene-sharp-machiavelli-non-violence ''New Statesman'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Directed by British journalist [[Ruaridh Arrow]] the film follows the use of Gene Sharp's work across revolutionary groups throughout the world.  There is particular focus on Sharp's key text ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp (2010), [http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' (full text online)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209144939/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf |date=9 February 2006 }} (4th ed.). East Boston, NA: [[Albert Einstein Institution]]. {{ISBN|978-1-880813-09-6}}, {{ISBN|1-880813-09-2}}, {{OCLC|706499601}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated by democracy activists into more than 30 languages and used in revolutions from Serbia and Ukraine to Egypt and Syria. The film describes how Sharp's 198 methods of nonviolent action have inspired and informed uprisings across the globe.

==Cast==
A primary character of the film is [[Gene Sharp]], founder of the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], and a 2009 and 2012 nominee for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Oslo Newsroom (27 February 2012). [http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/02/27/former-president-bill-clinton-among-nobel-prize-nominees/ "Former President Bill Clinton among Nobel Prize nominees"]. Reuters. The story states: "[[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], director of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|Peace Research Institute of Oslo]] and one of the individuals eligible to nominate candidates, has released a short list of those names he had submitted.

==Background and production==
Scottish journalist [[Ruaridh Arrow]], who wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, explained that he first learned about Gene Sharp's work as a student, and then heard that Sharp's booklets were turning up on the sites of many revolutions. But Sharp himself remained largely unknown. In explaining his motivation to make the film, Arrow stated that
{{Quote|Here was this old man [Gene Sharp] sitting in a crumpled house in Boston and that is where revolutionaries go for advice. It was one of the world's great little secrets. It was a little bit of magic and I had to make a film about it.&lt;ref name=brown12&gt;{{cite news|first=Annie |last=Brown |title=Scot's battle to make film on little-known guru of uprisings around world |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]] |date=March 24, 2012 |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2012/03/24/scot-s-battle-to-make-film-on-little-known-guru-of-uprisings-around-world-86908-23800123/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The film was privately funded by Ruaridh Arrow and additional funding was raised through the US crowdfunding site [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name=brown12/&gt; The film raised $57,342 in just under 4 weeks&lt;ref name=brown12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page at Kickstarter for [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/172444007/how-to-start-a-revolution-a-new-documentary-film How to Start a Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most successful British crowdfunded film currently completed.  Several high-profile figures are credited by the producers with supporting the crowdfunding project, including director [[Richard Linklater]] and actress [[Miriam Margolyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Film website, [http://howtostartarevolutionfilm.com/index.php/credits/thankyou "Special Thanks"] (from howtostartarevolutionfilm.com) (accessed 2 May 2012))&lt;/ref&gt;  Completion funding was donated by US art collector James Otis who sold the largest collection of [[Gandhi]] possessions including Gandhi's iconic glasses and sandals in 2009. Otis stated that he was selling the items to help fund nonviolent struggle projects and is described as the Executive Producer of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sarlin (1 May 2009).

==Reception==
The film has received a positive critical reception. It received four stars in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] London'', "a reminder of the importance of intellectual thought to the everyday".&lt;ref&gt;Emmajo Read (no date), [http://admin.timeout.com/film/reviews/91285/how-to-start-a-revolution.html Review of "How to Start a Revolution"], ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Huffington Post]] said it was a "vital conversation starter and educational tool in a world awash with violence"&lt;ref name=siegel11/&gt; and the UK's [[Daily Telegraph]] described it as a "World conquering Documentary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Louise |last=Gray |title=Gene Sharp: How to Start a Revolution &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;review of How to Start a Revolution&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=21 October 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8841546/Gene-Sharp-How-to-Start-a-Revolution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name=holden12/&gt; called it a "noble documentary" but criticised the absence of historical context of nonviolent struggles pre-dating Sharp. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as "straightforward", "informative", and "with potential to be updated as world events unfold", stating it "should have a long shelf life". Negative references have been made to the use of dramatic music during certain sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis |last=Harvey |title=How to Start a Revolution &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;film review&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=1 November 2011 |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946474/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''How to Start a Revolution'' was released on 18 September 2011 the day after the first Occupy protests in Wall St, New York.  The film was described as the unofficial film of the Occupy movement&lt;ref&gt;http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2012/01/the-american-academic-gene-sha.php#.UNSxf0IctUQ&lt;/ref&gt; and shown in camps across the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occupybellinghamwa.org/ai1ec_event/film-how-to-start-a-revolution-at-the-pickford-2/?instance_id%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509115938/http://www.occupybellinghamwa.org/ai1ec_event/film-how-to-start-a-revolution-at-the-pickford-2/?instance_id= |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occupymaine.org/voices/25-sun-18-2011-7pm-film-how-to-start-a-revolution |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222034703/http://occupymaine.org/voices/25-sun-18-2011-7pm-film-how-to-start-a-revolution |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.occupyboston.org/2011/11/09/how-start-revolution-film-screening-occupy-boston-tonight-7pm/&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of a number of high-profile events held in London's [[Bank of Ideas]] along with a concert by British band [[Radiohead]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2012 following the Mexican general election one of the country's largest newspapers reported that protestors were circulating a pirated Spanish translation of ''How to Start a Revolution'' which had gone viral in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informador.com.mx/suplementos/2012/422991/6/mr-revolution-y-el-evangelio-de-la-no-violencia.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was viewed over half a million times in the space of three days.  Reports have also been published citing the airing of the film on Spanish television concurrent with widespread discussion of Sharp's work in the Spanish anti-austerity [[15-M Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/the-spanish-15-m-movement-deepens-its-civil-disobedience-with-a-dash-of-gene-sharp/&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic premiere was hosted by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School on 11 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pon.harvard.edu/students/film-screening-of-how-to-start-a-revolution/?cid=72&lt;/ref&gt; and In February 2012, ''How to Start a Revolution'' was screened to an audience of MP's and Lords in the UK [[Houses of Parliament]] by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Conflict Issues (APPGCI) which was attended by Gene Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conflictissues.org.uk/index.php/past-meetings-mainmenu-37/126-how-to-start-a-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;

A film about the making of ''How to Start a Revolution'', entitled ''Road to Revolution'', was screened in January 2012 by [[Current TV]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://current.com/new-year-new-revolution/road-to-revolution Road to Revolution Premieres 1 January at 8.30pm] (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After the screening of the ''Road to Revolution'', the film itself, ''How to Start a Revolution'', was also shown on [[Current TV]]: [http://current.com/new-year-new-revolution/how-to-start-a-revolution/ ''How To Start A Revolution'' Premieres 1 January at 9pm] (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2017, after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the [[PBS America]] channel screened ''How to Start a Revolution'' immediately after a ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' investigation into his election.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbsamerica.co.uk/series/how-to-start-a-revolution/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch Documentary==
In 2012 ''How to Start a Revolution'' was among the first "[[Touch Documentaries]]" to be released using the Apple iPad platform.  The film was integrated into the platform along with four of Gene Sharp's books in several languages, including ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'', and several of Sharp's lectures. The app is supplemented by analysis and satellite mapping which is offered up to the viewer while watching the film.&lt;ref name="internationalpeaceandconflict.org"&gt;http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/pcdn-review-of-the-how-to-start-a-revolution-ipad-app?xg_source=activity#.USUXybR2tUQ&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Revolution Monitor" is also included which fuses Google Earth maps with Twitter displaying tweets and YouTube links from revolutionary groups and individuals when countries of interest are touched by the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;http://howtostartarevolutionfilm.com/index.php/ipad&lt;/ref&gt;
A review by The Peace &amp; Collaborative Network described the app as "simply a must-have among peace studies scholars, those actively working to start or reorganize revolutions, or anyone who is interested in the logistics, history, and outcomes of nonviolent revolutions" &lt;ref name="internationalpeaceandconflict.org"/&gt;
The ''How to Start a Revolution'' [[touch documentary]] was shortlisted for the International Best Digital Media award in the One World Media Awards 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://oneworldmedia.org.uk/awards/shortlist&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Industrial Development &amp; Renovation Organization of Iran''' ('''IDRO''') known as '''IDRO Group''' was established in 1967 in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="IDRO"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.idro.org/enidro/About%20Idro/History.aspx | title= About IDRO: History | publisher= Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran | accessdate= 2012-01-01 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120419071230/http://www.idro.org/enidro/About%20Idro/History.aspx | archivedate= 2012-04-19 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; IDRO Group is one of the largest companies in [[Iran]]. It is also one of the largest conglomerates in [[Asia]]. IDRO's objective is to develop [[Industry of Iran|Iran's industry sector]] and to accelerate the industrialization process of the country and to export Iranian products worldwide.&lt;ref name="IDRO"/&gt; Today, IDRO owns 117 subsidiaries and affiliated companies both domestically as well as internationally.&lt;ref name="IDRO2"/&gt;

== Businesses ==
{{see also|Industry of Iran}}

In the course of its 40 years of activity, IDRO has gradually become a major shareholder of some key industries in Iran. In recent years and in accordance with the country's [[Privatization in Iran|privatization]] policy, IDRO has made great efforts to privatize its affiliated companies. While carrying on its privatization policies and lessening its role as a holding company, IDRO intends to concentrate on its prime missions and to turn into an industrial development agency.
IDRO has focused its activities on the following areas in order to materialize such strategy and to expedite the [[industrial development]] of Iran:

*Promotion of local and [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran|foreign investments]] with minority holdings owned by IDRO (less than 50% of the shares) with particular emphasis on new, hi-tech and export-oriented industries.
*Restructuring the existing industries through participation of reputable foreign companies in order to transfer new technologies and to enhance the [[Iran and International Trade|non-oil exports of Iran]].
*Development of general contracting activities with the participation of the Iranian private sector and credible foreign companies.
*Rendering consultancy and support services to [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran|foreign investors]].
*[[Privatization in Iran|Privatization of the existing subsidiaries]].

==Privatization==
{{See also|Privatization in Iran}}

IDRO had privatized 140 of its companies worth about 2,000 billion rials ($200 million) in the past. The organization will offer shares of 150 industrial units to private investors by March 2010. In 2009, 290 companies were under the control of the IDRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=99914&amp;sectionid=351020102 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402082947/http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=99914&amp;sectionid=351020102 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac ben Reuben Albargeloni''' (born 1043) was a [[Jews of Spain|Spanish]] [[Talmudist]] and liturgical poet born in [[Barcelona]]. He was a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|judge]] in the [[Dénia|Denia]] community, where he became connected with ibn Alḥatosh, likely due to becoming his son-in-law. Among his later descendants was [[Moses ben Naḥman]] (Naḥmanides); [[Judah Albargeloni]] is said to have been Isaac's pupil. He was one of five prominent contemporaneous scholars named Isaac and the regard in which he was held by his own and succeeding generations is indicated by the fact that he is simply designated "Ha-Rab Albargeloni." He wrote commentaries on various sections of the tractate [[Nashim|Ketubot]], and at the age of thirty-five (1078) translated, from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into [[Hebrew]], [[Hai Gaon]]'s ''Ha-Miḳḳaḥ weha-Mimkar,'' on buying and selling (Venice, 1602, and frequently afterward with commentaries). Noteworthy among his liturgical poems are his '' [[:fr:Azharot#Auteurs|Azharot]] '', included in the rituals of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], [[Tlemçen]], [[Tunis]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Oran]]. 

There are 145 strophes in the poem, each consisting of three verses, and it ends with a [[Biblical]] quotation. Contemporaries said that Isaac's use of Biblical verses indicates great skill. [[Al-Ḥarizi]] remarked: "He has put the religious laws into rime, and has fitted them so well to Biblical passages that it almost seems as if the work had been inspired by a higher power." Isaac faithfully copied the division of the laws and interdictions of the ''[[Halakot Gedolot]]''; at times even following its wording, while he also took into account the regulations of traditional literature referring to Biblical prescriptions. The following poems of Isaac are also included in the ''Azharot'': 
* ''Alah Mosheh le-Rosh Har Sinai'' (introduction)
* ''Yom Zeh Horid'' (pizmon preceding the commands)
* ''Yaḥid Nora 'Alilah'' (pizmon between the commands and interdictions)

Isaac also wrote ''Paḥadti mi-Yoẓeri'' and ''Yom Zeh Mekapper le-Shabim,'' both in three-line strophes, the latter with signature and alphabet. [[Samuel Judah Löb Rapoport|Rapoport]] also attributes to Isaac the works ''Ayumati Yonah,'' ''ahabah'' for the Sabbath before the [[Feast of Weeks]], and ''Yaḳush be-'Onyo,'' ''ge'ullah'' for the fifth Sabbath after [[Pesaḥ]], but other scholars dispute whether these works were created by Isaac.

'''Lloyd Barrington Smith''' (1917 – 8 April 1992)&lt;ref&gt;''Jamaica, Civil Registration Birth, Marriage, and Death Records, 1878-1930''&lt;/ref&gt; was a Jamaican [[stamp dealer]] based  who is noted within Jamaican [[philately]] for his patriotic [[Philatelic cover|covers]] supporting the allies during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=PP&gt;"The L Barrington Smith Covers" by R. V. Swarbrick &amp; A. P. D. Sutcliffe in ''Philatelic Paraphernalia'', July 1990, pp. 316–331.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Kathleen Dickson on 18 November 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Gleaner]]'', 19 November 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jamaica, Civil Registration, 1880-1999," database with images, ''FamilySearch''( https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVS5-9N6S : 13 April 2015), Lloyd Smith and Kathleen Dickson, 11 November 1939, Marriage; citing Holy Cross, Saint Andrew, Jamaica, Registrar General's Department, Spanish Town; FHL microfilm 1,855,699.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a stamp dealer, Barrington Smith dealt principally in used British Commonwealth stamps, but the home-made and naive patriotic covers that he sold in bulk during the war years have become collectable in their own right. Barrington Smith traded from 1935 until about 1962, initially as a printer, soon becoming a stamp dealer and later a stamp wholesaler and supplier of "tropical novelties".&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; He is not believed to have been connected with the Leicester, England, firm of philatelic accessary wholesalers ''Barrington Smith''.

He traded under his own name and also as the ''Buccaneer Hobby Club'' from 127 Hagley Park Road, [[Half Way Tree]] Post Office, Jamaica, and was the publisher of ''The West Indian Philatelist''.

'''Machinesmith''' ('''Samuel "Starr" Saxon''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He specializes in [[robot]]ics, and is able to make convincing robotic [[Doppelgänger|doubles]] of other superhumans. His own [[mind]] was ultimately transferred to a robotic body.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #49 (February 1969), and briefly appeared as a character to have used the [[Mister Fear]] identity shortly thereafter in ''Daredevil'' #54 (July 1969). The character first appeared as Machinesmith in ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #47 (January 1979). 

His robotic features looked nothing like his human ones, and it was not established until later in ''Captain America'' #249 (September 1980) that Machinesmith and Starr Saxon are the same character. [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] has stated that back the character was supposed to be presented as gay in ''Daredevil'' #50; however, the early art was not good enough to get the point across.&lt;ref name="fivehundred"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conroy | first = Mike | year = 2004 | title = 500 Comic Book Villains | publisher = Barron's | isbn = 0-7641-2908-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other issues have since revealed the character's sexuality more directly, such as ''Captain America'' #368 and ''Iron Man'' #320.

==Fictional character biography==
Starr Saxon was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], but his family was living in [[Queens|Queens, New York]] by his teenage years. At 14 years old, he discovered an abandoned [[Doombot]] in a NYC subway tunnel, and snuck the robot home piece by piece to deconstruct to learn robotics.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #368&lt;/ref&gt; His original efforts saw to his use of robotics and engineering abilities to be a professional criminal robot maker and construct a variety of androids to be used as assassins for hire/personal gain. At some point during this period, he constructs a facsimile of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and a variety of [[The Demi Men|robotic "mutant" drones]] who went on to battle the [[X-Men]]. Magneto's robot appears several times over the years, believing itself to be the true Magneto until being destroyed by a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]. As of this writing, his employer(s) for the robot's creation is unrevealed.

In his first actual appearance, Saxon is hired by Biggie Benson to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Saxon dispatches a powerful android to do so, and to commit a series of crimes in New York. He discovers Daredevil's secret identity, and kidnaps [[Karen Page]] (Daredevil's girlfriend). He blackmails Daredevil into allowing him to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #49-52&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding to confront Daredevil directly, Saxon murders [[Mister Fear|Zoltan Drago]] and steals the man's costume and weaponry. As "'''[[Mister Fear]]'''", he challenges Daredevil to a public duel in New York City. He rigs Daredevil's billy club to release fear-gas pellets, and begins a crime spree. However, Saxon battles Daredevil and loses, breaking his neck in a fall from a flying hovercraft platform.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxon's robots find his dying body and transfer his brain patterns and consciousness into a computer, from which he could control a variety of android bodies. Now calling himself the "Machinesmith", he is hired by the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]] agent known as the Carnation to defeat the [[Fantastic Four]]. He dispatches his robots to subdue the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to be brainwashed into destroying the Fantastic Four. The Thing encounters [[Jack of Hearts]] instead and is defeated and Machinesmith is then revealed to be a robot.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Captain America]] and [[Nick Fury]] have an encounter with [[Baron Strucker]], Captain America defeats Strucker who is revealed to be a robot, controlled remotely by Machinesmith who plots to destroy Captain America. He comes to despise his artificial life, but his programming prevents him from committing suicide. Machinesmith sends the [[Dragon Man]] to kill Captain America but the attempt is unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #247-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinesmith is hired into the [[Red Skull]]'s exclusive employ, for whom he served as his primary scientist/machinist and member of the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #368, flashback&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Machinesmith undertakes various the Red Skull's field missions, usually confronting Captain America.

As per the Red Skull's orders, he sets mechanisms in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Central against Captain America and Fury.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #351&lt;/ref&gt; As per the Red Skull's orders, he next activates the [[Sleeper (Marvel Comics)|Sleeper]] robot, and attempts to liberate the other robots impounded on [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #354&lt;/ref&gt; He then assists [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] in an attempt to bug the [[Avengers Mansion|Avengers headquarters]], and he battles and overpowers the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #324-325&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Skeleton Crew, he later battles the [[Schutz-Heiliggruppe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #390-391&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the Machinesmith's consciousness is eventually captured (assumed to be Saxon's entire consciousness), and enslaved by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] under [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s thrall.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Machinesmith later claims to have easily recovered the lost fragment which he re-assimilated.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

When the Red Skull is blasted apart by Kubekult's [[Cosmic Cube]] destruction, Machinesmith enacts a series of protocols dictated by the Red Skull to kill Captain America and plunge the world into nuclear holocaust. Machinesmith is defeated.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Later, Machinesmith is employed by the [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].{{issue|date=March 2013}} After the team's defeat by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Machinesmith has since lain low.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

He later resurfaces and appears battling the [[New Warriors]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinesmith later appears in [[Madripoor]], having captured Captain America and deactivated the Super Soldier Serum in his foe's body. It was Machinesmith's intent to reverse-engineer the Super Soldier Serum to sell to various military officials. Captain America is able to regain the enhanced physique and defeats Machinesmith, trapping his consciousness inside a robotic body that he could not wirelessly transfer himself out of. At the end of the issue, Machinesmith was revealed to be an expendable pawn of the mysterious [[Shadow Council]].&lt;ref&gt;''Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier'' #2-4&lt;/ref&gt; But Machinesmith is resurrected a year later by [[Sharon Carter]] to discover how Captain America was consistently reverting to a weaker form, bargaining for his freedom. Machinesmith confessed to having been in league with Captain America's old comrade Codename: Bravo and revealed that Captain America was infected with nanotechnology that mimicked red blood cells. Unbeknownst to Machinesmith, Carter had infected him with a virus that wiped away his memories eliminating him as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (vol. 6) #8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinesmith is later [[parole]]d after helping the U.S. government hack into [[Latveria]]'s computer network. He moves to Miami and gets a menial job performing at children's birthday parties, before he is asked by [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] to help [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] with [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]]'s rescue from [[Cross Technological Enterprises]]. Machinesmith agrees on the condition that Lang gets him a job at Ant-Man Security Solutions as stable employment will help keep his [[parole officer]] off his back.&lt;ref&gt;''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Machinesmith is temporarily hired by [[Augustine Cross]] to hack into the Power Broker Inc. database so that the Cross family could steal its algorithm to be used to create a Hench App knock-off called "Lackey" since [[Darren Cross]] refused to invest with [[Power Broker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Machinesmith and Grizzly join up with the Army of Evil during Hydra's rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire: Brave New World'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and equipment==
Starr Saxon originally had a genius intellect, but no superhuman powers. He is one of the most gifted robot designers in the world, and has vast experience in cybernetic and bionics.

After breaking his neck, his consciousness began to occupy a robot duplicate of himself, programmed with his complete brain patterns, and capable of self-motivated, creative activity. His robotic materials, design and construction provided him with a number of superhuman capacities, including superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes.

Machinesmith exists as a living, cybernetic-system program (artificial consciousness), which is equipped to transmit its program along an infrared laser beam into virtually any electronics system at will; thus he can transfer from one robotic body to another within .25 seconds. Machinesmith can even place his personal program (personality) into multiple bodies at the same time, though the number of complex motions he can make his automata perform simultaneously is limited. His physical properties vary in accordance with the robot form he is inside. Certain robots possess superhuman capacities such as telescoping arms and legs, explosive launchers, special infrared or telescopic eyes. He has yet to inhabit a robot body greatly superior to a standard human-mimicking robot's capacity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} If an electronics system shuts down before he has a chance to project out of it, he can be trapped inside of it. Machinesmith is a genius at creating complex behavioral programs and bionic systems.

Machinesmith has also created a vast arsenal of weaponry, defense systems, and surveillance devices, whose specifications are constantly upgraded.

'''Maria Teresa Felicitas d'Este''' (October 6, 1726 – April 30, 1754) was born a princess of [[Modena]] and was by marriage the Duchess of Penthièvre. She was the mother-in-law of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Égalité]] and thus grandmother to the future [[Louis-Philippe of France]].

==Life==
Born in [[Emilia-Romagna]]&lt;ref name="googlebooks"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2oEBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=S.A.S+madame+la+duchesse+d'orl%C3%A9ans&amp;source=web&amp;ots=daOoMcrbZ5&amp;sig=ahRyv5hu3Z2xIdP_yj-b5QA7ssA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA3,M1 ''Journal de la vie de S.A.S. madame la Dsse. d'Orléans, douairière'']&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Modena]], she was the daughter of [[Francesco III d'Este|Francesco III, Duke of Modena]] and his wife, the French princess [[Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans]].

One of nine children, she was the first daughter of the family but her mother eventually returned to France to live.

==Marriage==
Penthièvre was Maria Teresa's mother's first cousin. Charlotte Aglaé's mother was the sister of the duke's father, Louis-Alexandre Count of Toulouse. According to some contemporaries, the marriage between the duke and his wife was reportedly a happy one, to which numerous children were born.&lt;ref name="googlebooks"/&gt;

==Descendants==
Marie Thérèse died at the [[Château de Rambouillet]] after giving birth to Louis Marie Félicité de Bourbon, who died soon afterwards. Only two of the Penthièvre children survived into adulthood:

* [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, prince de Lamballe|Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon]], her second but only surviving son, married [[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy]], who after his death became the favourite of the future Queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. 
* [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre]], her youngest and only surviving daughter, wed  [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], while he was still known as the [[Duke of Chartres]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">[[Image:Rollinat.jpg|thumb|Maurice Rollinat, 1846-1903]]
'''Maurice Rollinat''' (December 29, 1846 in [[Châteauroux]], [[Indre]] – October 26, 1903 in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]]) was a French [[poet]].

==Early works==
His father represented [[Indre]] in the National Assembly of 1848, and was a friend of [[George Sand]], whose influence is very marked in young Rollinat's first volume, ''Dans les brandes'' (1877), and to whom it was dedicated.

==Brief fame==
After its publication, he abandoned [[Literary realism|realism]] and worked in a very different manner.  He joined a literary circle that called themselves ''[[Les Hydropathes]]'', founded by [[Émile Goudeau]], an [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] group with ties to the [[decadent]] literary movement. Under their influence wrote the poems that made his reputation.  In ''Les Névroses'', with the sub-title ''Les Âmes, Les Luxures, Les Refuges, Les Spectres, Les Ténèbres'', he showed himself as a disciple of [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He constantly returns in these poems to the physical horrors of death, and is obsessed by unpleasant images. Less outre in sentiment are ''L'Abîme'' (1886), ''La Nature'', and a book of children's verse, ''Le Livre de la Nature'' (1893).

He was musician as well as poet, and set many of his songs to music. Several evenings a week, Rollinat would appear at the [[cabaret]] [[Le Chat Noir]], and there he would perform his poems with piano accompaniment.  His gaunt and pale appearance made his portrait a favourite subject for a number of painters, and the startling subjects of his verses brought him short lived fame; at the height of his popularity he drew a number of celebrities to the cabaret to see him perform; among them were [[Leconte de Lisle]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].  Rollinat's friend [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]] wrote that "Rollinat might be Baudelaire's superior in the sincerity and depth of his diabolism".

Rollinat married the actress [[Cécile Pouettre]].  He lost his reason in consequence of his wife's death from [[rabies]]; after several [[suicide]] attempts, he died in an [[insane asylum]] at Ivry-sur-Seine.  He is buried in the Saint-Denis cemetery in Châteauroux.

On Rollinat's death, [[Auguste Rodin]] offered the [[Fresselines]] commune a [[bas-relief]] entitled "Poet and the Muse". This sculpture is on display on the wall of the village church at [[Crozant]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8386">The '''McCaughey septuplets''' (born November 19, 1997), are  [[septuplets]] (seven offspring) born to Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], United States. They are the world's first set of surviving septuplets.

Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey (pronounced "McCoy") had one daughter, Mikayla Marie, born January 3, 1996.&lt;ref name="Mikayla birthdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbaby.com/ab/CDA/featureDetail/0,1349,1323-1,00.html?s=4|title=Bobbi McCaughey's Weekly Journal|date=16 April 2003|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416032145/http://www.americanbaby.com/ab/CDA/featureDetail/0,1349,1323-1,00.html?s=4|archivedate=16 April 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While under treatment with ovulation-stimulating [[urofollitropin|Metrodin]] for infertility,&lt;ref name=great/&gt; Bobbi became pregnant with seven babies. The McCaugheys, residents of the town of [[Carlisle, Iowa|Carlisle]], declined [[selective reduction]] to reduce the number of infants, saying that they would "put it in God's hands". The obstetricians primarily responsible for the medical care of the babies were Karen Drake and Paula Mahone.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The septuplets, four boys and three girls, were born nine weeks prematurely in Des Moines on November 19, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a35592/mccaughey-septuplets-turn-18/|title=See The McCaughey Septuplets All Grown Up!|date=2015-11-18|newspaper=Good Housekeeping|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were born by [[Caesarean section]], all within six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3080203/|title= Septuplets’ mom recalls ‘terror,’ joy|publisher=MSNBC|date=November 26, 1997|accessdate= April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the world's first set of surviving septuplets.&lt;ref name=today&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/parents/worlds-first-set-surviving-septuplets-turn-18-see-mccaughey-family-t44381|title=World's first set of surviving septuplets to turn 18: See the McCaughey family on TODAY|first=Scott|last=Stump|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=April 18, 2017|work=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the septuplets, Alexis (the oldest girl of the set) and Nathan (the 2nd oldest boy of the set), have [[cerebral palsy]]. Both used walkers to get around, and in November 2005 Nathan had spinal surgery in order to improve his walking abilities.&lt;ref name=great&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10867824/ |title=Eight is great for the McCaughey septuplets |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
The birth attracted significant media attention, both positive and negative, including a feature in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19971201,00.html |title=Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In the beginning, for every ten letters we would get that were happy for us, we'd get one letter accusing us of exploiting the kids and being selfish to waste the world's resources on a family this big," said Bobbi in a 2007 interview. "Our neighbors never gawked. Here in Carlisle they gave us privacy. But we had complete strangers come around to the back door, knock, and ask if they could hold a baby."&lt;ref name="Baptist Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baptistbulletin.org/?p=749 |title=The McCaughey Family is Completely Normal |first=Kevin |last=Mungons |publisher=''Baptist Bulletin'' |date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McCaugheys were the recipients of many donations, including a 5500&amp;nbsp;ft² (511 m²) house, a van and diapers for the first two years, as well as nanny services, clothes, and even the State of Iowa offering full college scholarships to any [[state university]] in Iowa upon their maturity and graduation from high school, also by the [[Hannibal–LaGrange University]] in Missouri.{{cn|date=April 2017}} President [[Bill Clinton]] personally telephoned the McCaugheys to wish them his congratulations.&lt;ref name=today/&gt; The surviving [[Dionne quintuplets]]- Yvonne Dionne, Annette Allard, and Cecile Langlois- wrote a letter warning the parents to keep the septuplets out of the public eye and not allow them to fall into the same pitfalls as their parents did, but wished them the best of luck in raising them and their personal congratulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gosselinswithoutpity.blogspot.com/2008/07/open-letter-from-dionne-quintuplets.html "Open letter from the Dionne quintuplets"]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the septuplets' tenth birthday in 2007, the family was declining most requests for interviews, other than annual stories with [[KCCI]] (the Des Moines [[CBS]] affiliate) and [[Ladies' Home Journal]]. Bobbi McCaughey has noted that the level of media attention does not necessarily mean they have granted many interviews, saying, "There was all kinds of stuff in the papers early on but they never actually interviewed us. Most of it is one paper quoting another."&lt;ref name="Baptist Bulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22223331/ |title=After 10 years, new adventures for septuplets: The McCaughey family goes to Spain and the world's first surviving septuplets cope with life getting more complex |first=Ann |last=Curry |date=December 12, 2007 |work=Dateline stories &lt;!-- NBC has followed the septuplets since birth--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey occasionally speak at [[pro-life]] events and continue to oppose [[selective reduction]]. Bobbi has been quoted as saying, "Well, come to our house, and tell me which four I shouldn't have had!"{{cn|date=April 2017}} The family continues to attend a Baptist church in [[West Des Moines]] where Kenny serves as a deacon.&lt;ref name="Baptist Bulletin"/&gt; In 2010, [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] made a documentary for the septuplets' thirteenth birthday that aired on December 28, 2010.

'''Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide''' ('''NAD''') is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] found in all living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two [[nucleotide]]s joined through their [[phosphate]] groups. One nucleotide contains an [[adenine]] [[nucleobase]] and the other [[nicotinamide]]. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms: an [[redox|oxidized]] and [[redox|reduced]] form abbreviated as '''NAD{{+}}''' and '''NADH''' respectively.

In [[metabolism]], nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is involved in [[redox]] reactions, carrying [[electron]]s from one reaction to another. The cofactor is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD{{+}} is an [[oxidizing agent]]&amp;nbsp;– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes [[redox|reduced]]. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a [[reducing agent]] to donate electrons. These [[electron transfer]] reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, most notably a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] of [[enzymes]] that add or remove [[functional group|chemical groups]] from [[proteins]], in [[posttranslational modification]]s. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for [[drug discovery]].

In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks ([[de novo synthesis|''de novo'']]) from the [[amino acid]]s [[tryptophan]] or [[aspartic acid]]. In an alternative fashion, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as [[niacin]]. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a [[salvage pathway]] that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD is converted into [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.

Although NAD{{+}} is written with a superscript plus sign because of the [[formal charge]] on a particular nitrogen atom, at [[physiological pH]] for the most part it is actually a singly charged [[anion]] (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly charged anion.

==Physical and chemical properties==
{{Further|Redox}}
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all ''dinucleotide''s, consists of two [[nucleoside]]s joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The [[nucleoside]]s each contain a [[ribose]] ring, one with [[adenine]] attached to the first carbon atom (the [[Nucleic acid nomenclature|1']] position) and the other with [[nicotinamide]] at this position. The nicotinamide [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] can be attached in two orientations to this [[anomer]]ic carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two [[diastereomer]]s. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD{{+}} that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two [[phosphate]] groups through the 5' carbons.&lt;ref name=Pollak&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollak N, Dölle C, Ziegler M |title= The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides&amp;nbsp;– small molecules with a multitude of functions |journal= Biochem.

[[File:NAD oxidation reduction.svg|thumb|left|250px|The [[redox]] reactions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.]]
In metabolism, the compound accepts or donates electrons in redox reactions.&lt;ref name=Belenky&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Belenky P, Bogan KL, Brenner C |title= NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism in health and disease |journal= Trends Biochem.

The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH{{sub|2}} is oxidized and NAD{{+}} reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring.

:RH{{sub|2}} + NAD{{+}} → NADH + H{{+}} + R;

From the hydride electron pair, one electron is transferred to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD{{+}}, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The [[standard electrode potential#Non-standard condition|midpoint potential]] of the NAD{{+}}/NADH redox pair is −0.32&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s, which makes NADH a strong ''reducing'' agent.&lt;ref name=Unden&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Unden G, Bongaerts J |title= Alternative respiratory pathways of ''Escherichia coli'': energetics and transcriptional regulation in response to electron acceptors |journal= Biochim.

This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD{{+}} and NADH forms without being consumed.&lt;ref name=Pollak/&gt;

In appearance, all forms of this coenzyme are white [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] powders that are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] and highly water-soluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Windholz, Martha |title=[[The Merck Index]]: an encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biologicals |publisher=Merck |location=Rahway NJ, US |year=1983 |page=909 |isbn=0-911910-27-1 |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD{{+}} are colorless and stable for about a week at 4&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] and neutral [[pH]], but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis. Upon decomposition, they form products that are [[enzyme inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Biellmann JF, Lapinte C, Haid E, Weimann G |title= Structure of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor generated from coenzyme |journal= Biochemistry |volume= 18 |issue= 7 |pages= 1212–7 |year= 1979 |pmid= 218616 |doi= 10.1021/bi00574a015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NADNADH.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[ultraviolet|UV]] absorption spectra of NAD{{+}} and NADH.]]
Both NAD{{+}} and NADH strongly absorb [[ultraviolet]] light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD{{+}} is at a [[wavelength]] of 259&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer]]s (nm), with an [[Molar absorptivity|extinction coefficient]] of 16,900&amp;nbsp;[[Concentration#Molarity|M]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[[Centimetre|cm]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD{{+}}/NADH ratio.

==Biosynthesis==
NAD{{+}} is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'']] pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as [[nicotinamide]] back to NAD{{+}}.

===''De novo'' production===
[[File:NAD metabolism.svg|thumb|right|350px|Some [[metabolic pathway]]s that synthesize and consume NAD{{+}} in [[vertebrate]]s. The abbreviations are defined in the text.]]
Most organisms synthesize NAD{{+}} from simple components.&lt;ref name=Belenky/&gt; The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of [[quinolinic acid]] (QA) from an amino acid—either [[tryptophan]] (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or [[aspartic acid]] (Asp) in some bacteria and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katoh A, Uenohara K, Akita M, Hashimoto T |title= Early Steps in the Biosynthesis of NAD in Arabidopsis Start with Aspartate and Occur in the Plastid |journal= Plant Physiol. |volume= 141 |issue= 3 |pages= 851–7 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16698895 |pmc= 1489895 |doi= 10.1104/pp.106.081091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foster JW, Moat AG |title= Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis and pyridine nucleotide cycle metabolism in microbial systems |journal= Microbiol.

An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is [[amide|amidated]] to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.&lt;ref name=Belenky/&gt;

===Salvage pathways===
Besides assembling NAD{{+}} ''de novo'' from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and [[nicotinamide riboside]] (NR).&lt;ref name=Belenky/&gt; These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B{{sub|3}} or ''[[niacin]]''.

The main role of NAD{{+}} in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called [[oxidoreductase]]s.

When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either "above" or "below" the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is [[prochiral]], this can be exploited in [[enzyme kinetics]] to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has [[deuterium]] atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD{{+}} by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen.

For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an [[ionic bond]] is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP{{+}}. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP{{+}} from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as [[aldose reductase]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and [[methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase]] can use both coenzymes in some species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vickers TJ, Orsomando G, de la Garza RD, Scott DA, Kang SO, Hanson AD, Beverley SM |title= Biochemical and genetic analysis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in Leishmania metabolism and virulence |journal= J.

===Role in redox metabolism===
[[File:Catabolism schematic.svg|thumb|250px|A simplified outline of redox [[metabolism]], showing how NAD{{+}} and NADH link the [[citric acid cycle]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].]]

{{Further|Cellular respiration|Oxidative phosphorylation}}

The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as [[glucose]] and [[fatty acids]] are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD{{+}} by reduction to NADH, as part of [[beta oxidation]], [[glycolysis]], and the [[citric acid cycle]]. In [[eukaryote]]s the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the [[cytoplasm]] are transferred into the [[mitochondrion]] (to reduce mitochondrial NAD{{+}}) by [[mitochondrial shuttle]]s, such as the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakker BM, Overkamp KM, Kötter P, Luttik MA, Pronk JT |title= Stoichiometry and compartmentation of NADH metabolism in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' |journal= FEMS Microbiol. Rev. |volume= 25 |issue= 1 |pages= 15–37 |year= 2001 |pmid= 11152939 |doi= 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the [[electron transport chain]], which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Rich PR |title= The molecular machinery of Keilin's respiratory chain |journal= Biochem. Soc. Trans. |volume= 31 |issue= Pt 6 |pages= 1095–105 |year= 2003 |pmid= 14641005 |doi= 10.1042/BST0311095}}&lt;/ref&gt; These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in [[chloroplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heineke D, Riens B, Grosse H, Hoferichter P, Peter U, Flügge UI, Heldt HW |title= Redox Transfer across the Inner Chloroplast Envelope Membrane |journal= Plant Physiol |volume= 95 |issue= 4 |pages= 1131–1137 |year= 1991 |pmid= 16668101 |pmc= 1077662 |doi= 10.1104/pp.95.4.1131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD{{+}} and NADH, with the high NAD{{+}}/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent.&lt;ref name=Nicholls&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholls DG|author2=Ferguson SJ |title=Bioenergetics 3 |edition=1st|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002 |isbn=0-12-518121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in [[anabolism]], with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as [[fatty acid synthesis]] and [[photosynthesis]]. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP{{+}}/NADPH ratio is kept very low.&lt;ref name=Nicholls/&gt;

Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as [[gluconeogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sistare FD, Haynes RC |title= The interaction between the cytosolic pyridine nucleotide redox potential and gluconeogenesis from lactate/pyruvate in isolated rat hepatocytes. Implications for investigations of hormone action |journal= J. Biol.

For example, [[nitrification|nitrifying]] bacteria such as ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Freitag A, Bock E |year=1990 |title=Energy conservation in ''Nitrobacter'' |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=66 |issue=1–3 |pages=157–62 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1990.tb03989.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] to produce enough [[chemiosmosis|proton-motive force]] to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Starkenburg SR, Chain PS, Sayavedra-Soto LA, Hauser L, Land ML, Larimer FW, Malfatti SA, Klotz MG, Bottomley PJ, Arp DJ, Hickey WJ |title= Genome Sequence of the Chemolithoautotrophic Nitrite-Oxidizing Bacterium ''Nitrobacter winogradskyi'' Nb-255 |journal= Appl.

===Non-redox roles===
The coenzyme NAD{{+}} is also consumed in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called [[Glycosyltransferase|ADP-ribosyltransferases]] add the ADP-ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a [[posttranslational modification]] called [[ADP-ribosylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ziegler M |title= New functions of a long-known molecule.

[[File:Cyclic ADP ribose.svg|thumb|left|280px|The structure of [[cyclic ADP-ribose]].]]
Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of [[cyclic ADP-ribose]], which is produced from NAD{{+}} by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, as part of a [[second messenger system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Guse AH |title= Biochemistry, biology, and pharmacology of cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR) |journal= Curr.

NAD{{+}} is also consumed by [[sirtuin]]s, which are NAD-dependent [[histone deacetylase|deacetylases]], such as [[Sir2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=North BJ, Verdin E |title= Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases |journal= Genome Biol |volume= 5 |issue= 5 |page= 224 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15128440 |pmc= 416462 |doi= 10.1186/gb-2004-5-5-224}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes act by transferring an [[acetyl]] group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD{{+}}; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly seem to be involved in regulating [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] through deacetylating histones and altering [[nucleosome]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blander G, Guarente L |title= The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases |journal= Annu.

These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of [[aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trapp J, Jung M |title= The role of NAD+ dependent histone deacetylases (sirtuins) in ageing |journal= Curr Drug Targets |volume= 7 |issue= 11 |pages= 1553–60 |year= 2006 |pmid= 17100594 |doi= 10.2174/1389450110607011553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial [[DNA ligase]]s, which join two DNA ends by using NAD{{+}} as a substrate to donate an [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new [[phosphodiester bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilkinson A, Day J, Bowater R |title= Bacterial DNA ligases |journal= Mol.

The coenzyme NAD{{+}} was first discovered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] biochemists [[Arthur Harden]] and [[William John Young]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= A |last= Harden |last2= Young |first2=WJ |title= The alcoholic ferment of yeast-juice Part II.--The coferment of yeast-juice |work= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |series= Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character |volume= 78 |date= 24 October 1906 |pages= 369–375 |issue= 526 |jstor=80144 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1906.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noticed that adding boiled and filtered [[yeast]] extract greatly accelerated [[alcoholic fermentation]] in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a ''coferment''. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a [[nucleotide]] sugar phosphate by [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf |title=Fermentation of sugars and fermentative enzymes |work=Nobel Lecture, 23 May 1930 |accessdate=2007-09-30 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927170330/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the [[Germany|German]] scientist [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warburg O, Christian W |title=Pyridin, der wasserstoffübertragende bestandteil von gärungsfermenten (pyridin-nucleotide) |language=German |trans-title=Pyridin, the hydrogen-transferring component of the fermentation enzymes (pyridine nucleotide) |journal=Biochemische Zeitschrift |volume=287 |year=1936 |page=291 |doi=10.1002/hlca.193601901199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin precursors of NAD{{+}} were first identified in 1938, when [[Conrad Elvehjem]] showed that liver has an "anti-black tongue" activity in the form of nicotinamide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Elvehjem CA, Madden RJ, Strong FM, Woolley DW |title=The isolation and identification of the anti-black tongue factor |journal=J.

[[File:Frog in frogspawn.jpg|right|thumb|A [[frog]] in [[frog#Eggs / frogspawn|frogspawn]]]]
In [[biology]], '''offspring''' are the young born of living [[organism]]s, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of [[sexual reproduction]], two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a '''brood''' or '''progeny''' in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the [[bird|chicks]] hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the [[brood (honeybee)|honeybee]].

Human offspring ([[kinship and descent|descendants]]) are referred to as [[child]]ren (without reference to age, thus one can refer to a parent's "[[minor (law)|minor]] children" or "[[adult]] children" or "[[infant|infant children]]" or "[[Teenagers|teenage children]]" depending on their age); male children are [[son]]s and female children are [[daughter]]s (see [[kinship and descent]]). Offspring can occur after mating or after [[artificial insemination]].

Offspring contains many parts and properties that are precise and accurate in what they consist of, and what they define. As the offspring of a new species, also known as a child or f1 generation, consist of genes of the father and the mother, which is also known as the parent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these offspring contains numerous genes which have coding for specific tasks and properties. Males and females both contribute equally to the genotypes of their offspring, in which gametes fuse and form. An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome, which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To focus more on the offspring and how it results in the formation of the f1 generation, is an inheritance called sex-linkage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a gene which is located on the sex chromosome and patterns of these inheritance differ in both male and female. The explanation that proves the theory of the offspring having genes from both parent generations, is proven through a process called crossing-over, which consists of taking genes from the male chromosomes and genes from the female chromosome, resulting in a process of [[meiosis]] occurring, and leading to the splitting of the chromosomes evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on which genes are dominantly expressed in the gene will result in the sex of the offspring. The female will always give an X chromosome, whereas the male, depending on the situation, will either give an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. If a male offspring is produced, the gene will consist of an X and a Y chromosome. If two X chromosomes are expressed and produced, it produces a female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is the production of an offspring which represents the identical genes as its parent. Reproductive cloning begins with the removal of the nucleus from an egg, which holds the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to clone an organ, a stem cell is to be produced and then utilized to clone that specific organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception of cloning is that it produces an exact copy of the parent being cloned. Cloning copies the DNA/genes of the parent and then creates a genetic duplicate. The clone will not be a similar copy as he or she will grow up in different surroundings from the parent and may encounter different opportunities and experiences. Although mostly positive, cloning also faces some setbacks in terms of ethics and human health. Though cell division and DNA replication is a vital part of survival, there are many steps involved and mutations can occur with permanent change in an organism's and their offspring's DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnemstudio.org/genetic-algorithms-mutation.htm|title=mutation|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutations can be good as they result in random evolution periods in which may be good for the species, but most mutations are bad as they can change the genotypes of offspring, which can result in changes that harm the species.

[[Image:Hyaloperonospora-parasitica-hyphae-oospore-2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Oospores of ''[[Hyaloperonospora parasitica]]'', agent of the [[downy mildew]] (in the middle)]]
An '''oospore''' is a thick-walled sexual [[spore]] that develops from a fertilized [[oosphere]] in some [[algae]], [[fungi]], and [[Oomycete]]s. They are believed to have evolved either through the [[Somatic fusion|fusion]] of two species or the chemically-induced stimulation of mycelia, leading to oospore formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemical Stimulation of Oospore Formation in Phytophthora capsici|first1=J. Y. |last1=Uchida |first2=M. |last2=Aragaki|journal=Mycologia|volume=72|issue=6|doi=10.2307/3759563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oomycetes, oospores can also result from asexual reproduction, by [[apomixis]]. These are found in Fungi as the sexual spores; these help in the sexual reproduction of Fungi.

'''Phinehas Abraham''' was a [[West Indies|West Indian]] [[merchant]]; born in the island of [[Jamaica]] about the beginning of the nineteenth century; and died 19 Feb. 1887. He was one of the last survivors of the body of West Indian merchants who contributed in a high degree to the prosperity of the West Indian colonial possessions. In former years Abraham was one of the largest landed proprietors in the island of Jamaica. He held various offices outside the Jewish community. He was senior justice of the peace for the [[Trelawny Parish, Jamaica|parish of Trelawny]] in Jamaica, an agent of [[Lloyd's of London]] and the last surviving captain in the Trelawny militia. He was also one of the earliest members of the Berkeley Street Synagogue, [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15591">'''Presence''' is a theoretical concept describing the extent to which media represent the world (in both physical and social environments).&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kwan Min|title=Presence, Explicated|journal=Communication Theory|date=February 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=27–50|doi=10.1093/ct/14.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presence is further described by Matthew Lombard and Theresa Ditton as “an illusion that a mediated experience is not mediated."&lt;ref name=lombard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lombard|author2=Ditton|title=At the heart of it all: the concept of presence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x/full|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=1997|volume=3|series=2|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it often considers the effect that people experience when they interact with a [[Computer mediated environment|computer-mediated]] or [[computer graphics|computer-generated]] environment.&lt;ref name=sheridan5&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=T. B.|title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments (8)5|year=1999|pages=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptualization of presence borrows from multiple fields including [[communication]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[science]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]], and the arts. The concept of presence accounts for a variety of computer applications and Web-based entertainment today that are developed on the fundamentals of the phenomenon, in order to give people the sense of, as Sheridan called it, “being there." &lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;

==Evolution of 'presence' as a concept==

[[File:Typology of human experience in virtual.png|thumb|right|Typology of human experience in the study of presence]]
The specialist use of the word “presence” derives from the term “[[telepresence]]”, coined by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=minsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minsky|first=M|title=Telepresence|journal=MIT Press Journals|date=June 1980|pages=45–51|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/pres}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steuer&gt;{{cite web|last=Steuer|first=J.|title=Defining virtual reality: Dimensions determining telepresence.|url=http://www.presence-research.org/papers/steuer92defining.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924185705/http://www.presence-research.org/papers/steuer92defining.pdf|archivedate=September 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minsky's research explained telepresence as the manipulation of objects in the real world through remote access technology.&lt;ref name=minsky /&gt; For example, a surgeon may use a computer to control robotic arms to perform minute procedures on a patient in another room. Or a NASA technician may use a computer to control a rover to collect rock samples on Mars. In either case, the operator is granted access to real, though remote, places via televisual tools.

As technologies progressed, the need for an expanded term arose. Sheridan extrapolated Minsky’s original definition.&lt;ref name=sheridan1&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=T. B.|title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments (1)|year=1992|pages=120–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the shorter “presence,” Sheridan explained that the term refers to the effect felt when controlling real world objects remotely as well as the effect people feel when they interact with and immerse themselves in virtual reality or virtual environments.&lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;

[[File:Lombard conceptulization of presence.png|thumb|left|Lombard's conceptualization of presence]]

Lombard and Ditton went a step further and enumerated six conceptualizations of presence:&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;

# presence can be a sense of social richness, the feeling one gets from social interaction
# presence can be a sense of realism, such as computer-generated environments looking, feeling, or otherwise seeming real
# presence can be a sense of transportation. This is a more complex concept than the traditional feeling of one being there. Transportation also includes users feeling as though something is “here” with them or feeling as though they are sharing common space with another person together
# presence can be a sense of immersion, either through the senses or through the mind
# presence can provide users with the sense they are social actors within the medium. No longer passive viewers, users, via presence, gain a sense of interactivity and control
# presence can be a sense of the medium as a social actor.

Lombard's work discusses the extent to which 'presence' is felt, and how strong the perception of presence is regarded without the media involved.&lt;ref name=lombard/&gt;  The article reviews the contextual characteristics that contribute to an individual's feeling presence.  The most important variables that are important in the determinants of presence are those that involve sensory richness or vividness - and the number and consistency of sensory outputs.&lt;ref name=steuer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steuer|first=Jonathan|title=Defining virtual realities: Dimensions determining telepresence|journal=Communication in the Age of Virtual Reality|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers believe that the greater the number of human senses for which a medium provides stimulation, the greater the capability of the medium to produce a sense of presence.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;&lt;ref name=steuer /&gt;  Additional important aspects of a medium are visual display characteristics (image quality, image size, viewing distance, motion and color, dimensionality, camera techniques) as well as aural presentation characteristics, stimuli for other senses (interactivity, obtrusiveness of medium, live versus recorded or constructed experience, number of people), content variables (social realism, use of media conventions, nature of task or activity), and media user variables (willingness to suspend disbelief, knowledge of and prior experience with the medium).&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;  Lombard also discusses the effects of presence, including both physiological and psychological consequences of "the perceptual illusion of nonmediation." &lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;
Physiological effects of presence may include arousal, or vection and simulation sickness, while psychological effects may include enjoyment, involvement, task performance, skills training, desensitization, persuasion, memory and social judgement, or [[parasocial interaction]] and relationships.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;

[[File:Lee typology of virtual experience.png|thumb|right|Lee's typology of virtual experience]]

Presence has been delineated into subtypes, such as physical-, social-, and self-presence.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt; Lombard's working definition was "a psychological state in which virtual objects are experienced as actual objects in either sensory or nonsensory ways." &lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;  Later extensions expanded the definition of "virtual objects" to specify that they may be either para-authentic or artificial.  Further development of the concept of "psychological state" has led to study of the mental mechanism that permits humans to feel presence when using media or simulation technologies.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt;  One approach is to conceptualize presence as a cognitive feeling, that is, to take spatial presence as feedback from unconscious cognitive processes that inform conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Thomas W.|title=A New Conception of Spatial Presence: Once Again, with Feeling|journal=Communication Theory|year=2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=161–187|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2009.01340.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

Several studies provide insight into the concept of media influencing behavior.

*Cheryl Bracken and Lombard suggested that people, especially children, interact with computers socially.&lt;ref name=bracken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracken|first=C|author2=Lombard, M|title=Social presence and children: Praise, intrinsic motivation, and learning with computers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=54|pages=22–37|doi=10.1093/joc/54.1.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found, via their study, that children who received positive encouragement from a computer were more confident in their ability, were more motivated, recalled more of a story and recognized more features of a story than those children who received only neutral comments from their computer.
*Nan, Anghelcev, Myers, Sar, and Faber found that the inclusion of anthropomorphic agents that relied on artificial intelligence on a Web site had positive effect on people’s attitudes toward the site.&lt;ref name=nan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nan|first=X|author2=Anghelcev, G. |author3=Myers, J. R. |author4=Sar, S. |author5=Faber, R. J. |title=What if a website can talk? Exploring the persuasive effects of web-based anthropomorphic agents.|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2006|volume=83|issue=3|pages=615–631|doi=10.1177/107769900608300309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research of Bracken and Lombard and Nan et al. also speak to the concept of presence as transportation.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;&lt;ref name=bracken /&gt;&lt;ref name=nan /&gt; The transportation in this case refers to the computer-generated identity. Users, through their interaction, have a sense that these fabricated personalities are really “there”.
*Communication has been a central pillar of presence since the term’s conception.&lt;ref name=presence-research.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Presence-Research.org|url=http://www.presence-research.org/|work=Welcome|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many applications of the Internet today largely depend on virtual presence since its conception.&lt;ref name=ISPR&gt;{{cite web|title=International Society for Presence Research|url=http://www.ispr.info/|work=About ISPR|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and Turkle offered MUDs, or multi-user dungeons, as early examples of how communication developed a sense of [[web presence|presence on the Web]] prior to the graphics-heavy existence it has developed today.&lt;ref name=rheingold /&gt;  “MUDs...[are] imaginary worlds in computer databases where people use words and programming languages to improvise melodramas, build worlds and all the objects in them, solve puzzles, invent amusements and tools, compete for prestige and power, gain wisdom, seek revenge, indulge greed and lust and violent impulses."&lt;ref name=rheingold&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheingold|first=H|title=The virtual community: Homesteading on the electronic frontier.|year=1993|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Rheingold focused on the environmental sense of presence that communication provided, Turkle focused on the individual sense of presence that communication provided.  “MUDs are a new kind of virtual parlor game and a new form of community. In addition, text-based MUDs are a new form of collaboratively written literature. MUD players are MUD authors, the creators as well as consumers of media content. In this, participating in a MUD has much in common with script writing, performance art, street theater, improvisational theater – or even commedia dell’arte." &lt;ref name=rheingold /&gt;&lt;ref name=turkle&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=S|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet.|year=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Further blurring the lines of behavioral spheres, Gabriel Weimann wrote that media scholars have found that virtual experiences are very similar to real-life experiences, and people can confuse their own memories and have trouble remembering if those experiences were mediated or not.&lt;ref name=weimann&gt;{{cite book|last=Weimann|first=G|title=Communicating unreality: Modern media and the reconstruction of reality.|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philipp, Vanman, and Storrs demonstrated that unconscious feelings of social presence in a virtual environment can be invoked with relatively impoverished social representations.&lt;ref name=philipp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philipp|first=MC|author2=Storrs, K|author3=Vanman, E|title=Sociality of facial expressions in immersive virtual environments: A facial EMG study|journal=Biological Psychology|year=2012|volume=91|pages=17–21|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esearchers found that the mere presence of virtual humans in an immersive environment caused people to be more emotionally expressive than when they were alone in the environment. The research suggests that even relatively impoverished social representations can lead to people to behave more socially in an immersive environment.

==Presence in popular culture==
*Sheridan's view of presence earned its first pop culture reference in 1984 with [[William Gibson]]’s pre-[[World Wide Web]] science fiction novel "[[Neuromancer]]", which tells the story of a cyberpunk cowboy of sorts who accesses a virtual world to hack into organizations.&lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;
*[[Joshua Meyrowitz]]'s 1986 "[[Joshua Meyrowitz#No Sense of Place|No Sense of Place]]" discusses the impact of electronic media on social behavior.&lt;ref name=meyrowitz&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyrowitz|first=Joshua|title=No sense of place : the impact of electronic media on social behavior|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-504231-3|edition=12. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel discusses how social situations are transformed by media.  Media, he claims, can change one's 'sense of place,'by mixing traditionally private versus public behaviors - or [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|back-stage and front-stage behaviors]], respectively, as coined by [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=goffman&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=The presentation of self in everyday life|year=1990|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=978-0140135718|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meyrowitz suggests that television alone will transform the practice of front-stage and back-stage behaviors, as television would provide increased information to different groups who may physically not have access to specific communities but through [[media consumption]] are able to determine a mental place within the program.  He references [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s concept that '[[the medium is the message]],' and that media provide individuals with access to information.&lt;ref name=mcluhan&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man|year=1964|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With new and changing media, Meyrowitz says that the patterns of information and shifting accesses to information change social settings, and help do determine a sense of place and behavior.  With the logic that behavior is connected to information flow, Meyrowitz states that front- and back-stage behaviors are blurred and may be impossible to untangle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9890">A '''radial basis function (RBF)''' is a [[real-valued function]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; whose value depends only on the distance from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], so that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi\left(\mathbf{x}\right) = \phi\left(\left\|\mathbf{x}\right\|\right)&lt;/math&gt;; or alternatively on the distance from some other point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''center'', so that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{c}\right) = \phi\left(\left\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{c}\right\|\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Any function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the property &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi\left(\mathbf{x}\right) = \phi\left(\left\|\mathbf{x}\right\|\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[radial function]]. The norm is usually [[Euclidean distance]], although other [[distance function]]s are also possible.

Sums of radial basis functions are typically used to [[function approximation|approximate given functions]]. This approximation process can also be interpreted as a simple kind of [[artificial neural network|neural network]]; this was the context in which they originally surfaced, in work by [[David Broomhead]] and David Lowe in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/rbf/intro/node8.html Radial Basis Function networks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423232029/http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/rbf/intro/node8.html |date=2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = David H. |last = Broomhead |first2 = David |last2 = Lowe |title = Multivariable Functional Interpolation and Adaptive Networks |journal = Complex Systems |volume = 2 |pages = 321–355 |year = 1988 |url = https://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/02-3-5.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714173428/https://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/02-3-5.pdf |archivedate = 2014-07-14 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which stemmed from [[Michael J.

Commonly used types of radial basis functions include (writing &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r = \left\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i\right\|&lt;/math&gt; and using &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; to indicate the inverse of a ''critical radius''{{Definition needed|date=November 2018}}):
* [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi\left(r\right) = e^{-\left(\varepsilon r\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Multiquadric]]:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi\left(r\right) = \sqrt{1 + \left(\varepsilon r\right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

* [[Inverse quadratic]]:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi\left(r\right) = \dfrac{1}{1+\left(\varepsilon r\right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

* [[Inverse multiquadric]]:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi\left(r\right) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\varepsilon r\right)^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

* [[Polyharmonic spline]]:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{aligned}
\phi\left(r\right) &amp;= r^k,&amp; k&amp;=1,3,5,\dotsc
\\
\phi\left(r\right) &amp;= r^k \ln\left(r\right),&amp; k&amp;=2,4,6,\dotsc
\end{aligned}&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Thin plate spline]] (a special polyharmonic spline):&lt;math display="block"&gt;\phi\left(r\right) = r^2 \ln\left(r\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Approximation==
{{main|Kernel smoothing}}

Radial basis functions are typically used to build up [[function approximation]]s of the form&lt;math display="block"&gt;y\left(\mathbf{x}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \, \phi\left(\left\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i\right\|\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the approximating function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is represented as a sum of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; radial basis functions, each associated with a different center &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{x}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and weighted by an appropriate coefficient ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_{i}&lt;/math&gt;''. The weights ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_{i}&lt;/math&gt;'' can be estimated using the matrix methods of [[Weighted least squares|linear least squares]], because the approximating function is ''linear'' in the weights ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_{i}&lt;/math&gt;''.

Approximation schemes of this kind have been particularly used{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} in [[time series prediction]] and [[Control theory|control]] of [[nonlinear systems]] exhibiting sufficiently simple [[chaos theory|chaotic]] behaviour, 3D reconstruction in [[computer graphics]] (for example, [[hierarchical RBF]] and [[Pose Space Deformation]]).

==RBF Network==
{{main|radial basis function network}}

[[File:Unnormalized radial basis functions.svg|thumb|350px|right|Two unnormalized Gaussian radial basis functions in one input dimension. The basis function centers are located at &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x_1 = 0.75&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x_2 = 3.25&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The sum&lt;math display="block"&gt;y\left(\mathbf{x}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \, \phi\left(\left\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i\right\|\right),&lt;/math&gt;can also be interpreted as a rather simple single-layer type of [[artificial neural network]] called a [[radial basis function network]], with the radial basis functions taking on the role of the activation functions of the network.  It can be shown that any continuous function on a [[Compact space|compact]] interval can in principle be interpolated with arbitrary accuracy by a sum of this form, if a sufficiently large number ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;'' of radial basis functions is used. 

The approximant &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y\left(\mathbf{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable with respect to the weights ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_{i}&lt;/math&gt;''. The weights could thus be learned using any of the standard iterative methods for neural networks.

Using radial basis functions in this manner yields a reasonable interpolation approach provided that the fitting set has been chosen such that it covers the entire range systematically (equidistant data points are ideal). However, without a polynomial term that is orthogonal to the radial basis functions, estimates outside the fitting set tend to perform poorly.

'''''Sanctum''''' is a 2011 Australian-American [[3D film|3D]] [[Disaster film|disaster]] [[survival film]] directed by [[Alister Grierson]] and written by John Garvin and [[Andrew Wight]]. It stars [[Richard Roxburgh]], [[Rhys Wakefield]], Alice Parkinson, [[Dan Wyllie]], and [[Ioan Gruffudd]]. Wight also produced the film, with [[James Cameron]] (writer/director of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'') as executive producer. The film was released in the United States on 4 February 2011 by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] to predominantly negative reviews from critics but it was a box office success, earning $108.6 million on a $30 million budget. It also received an [[AACTA Awards|AACTA Award]] nomination for [[AACTA Award for Best Visual Effects or Animation|Best Visual Effects]]. [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] released ''Sanctum'' on DVD, [[Blu-ray Disc]], and Blu-ray 3D on 7 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Tom Woodward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/sanctum.html|title=Universal Studios Home Entertainment announces DVD and Blu-ray releases|author=Tom Woodward|publisher=DVD Active|date=2011-04-04|accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old Joshua "Josh" McGuire ([[Rhys Wakefield]]), expedition bank-roller Carl Hurley ([[Ioan Gruffudd]]) and his girlfriend, Victoria "Vic" Elaine (Alice Parkinson), travel to the Esa'ala Cave, an underwater [[Cave diving|cave exploration]] site in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Josh's father, Frank ([[Richard Roxburgh]]), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. As Josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.

While exploring the entrance to the new system, Judes ([[Allison Cratchley]]) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask forcing Frank to [[Buddy breathing|buddy breathe]]. After a few exchanges, Judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. As Judes drowns, Josh watches on a monitor at "forward camp" and presumes the worst of his father. In a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task Josh didn't do. Meanwhile, their above-ground crew realizes that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. They attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.

While Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a [[cyclone]] causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through "the elevator" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to "forward camp" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape.  Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victoria's line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him. 

The team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Jude's old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully [[Euthanasia|drowns him]].
The team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George - an experienced, veteran diver - has become [[Decompression sickness|ill]] due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realizes that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.

As the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victoria's death, Carl becomes psychotic. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII [[Japanese tanks of World War II|Japanese tank]] collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. They spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.

A little later they discover Carl who has gone completely insane and found Victoria's corpse. Carl attempts to murder Frank but Josh separates the two and temporarily disables Carl. Frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a [[stalagmite]] which punctured his back. When Carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realized and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. In immense pain, Frank requests that Josh drown him. Josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel. 
A short distance in, he encounters Carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit. 
Just as he begins to lose hope, Josh discovers a way out through the cave to open ocean. He emerges from the water and crawls onto the beach, where he is discovered by fishermen.

==Production==
''Sanctum'' was inspired by the film's co-writer [[Andrew Wight]]'s experience with a 1988 [[cave diving]] expedition in Australia that resulted in 13 cavers becoming trapped in one of the world's largest underwater cave systems in [[Nullarbor Plain]] after a freak storm collapsed the entrance.&lt;ref name="13_Hauled_To_Safety_From_Cave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cavediving.com.au/cave-diving-articles/1988/12/4/13-hauled-to-safety-from-cave/|title=Cave Diving|work=Melbourne Sun Herald|accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; That incident was documented in the film ''Nullarbor Dreaming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=Nullarbor dreaming : a real life adventure|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34972528?q&amp;versionId=43409367|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer for ''Sanctum''.&lt;ref name="production_notes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/sanctum/about.php|title=Sanctum (2011) – About the Production|publisher=Visual Hollywood|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the film's plot takes place in Esa'ala Cave, most of the film was shot in [[Australia]] ([[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]]). Sanctum employs 3D photography techniques Cameron developed to film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. All of the underwater sequences took place in a large water tank at the [[Warner Roadshow Studios|Village Roadshow Studios]] in Queensland. Real caves were also filmed in South Australia's cave-diving region around [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]].&lt;ref name="production_notes"/&gt; Stunt diver [[Agnes Milowka]], who appears as a double in the already-released film, drowned in one of these caves on 27 February 2011 when she reportedly ran out of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/victorian-cave-diver-agnes-milowka-dies-at-tank-cave-mt-gambier/story-e6frf7kx-1226013313425 |title=Victorian cave diver Agnes Milowka dies at Tank Cave, Mt Gambier |author=Katherine Firkin, Matt Schulz |publisher=Heraldsun.com.au |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In striking similarities to the movie script, she also left her spare tank behind, to force the way through the tight restriction, and it is actually her playing Judes' drowning scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8254266 |title=In Too Deep |author=Nick Greenaway, [[Allison Langdon]] | publisher=60 Minutes, [[Nine Network]] Australia |date=2011-05-29 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Studios]] and [[Relativity Media]] paid $12&amp;nbsp;million for rights to distribute the film in the United States and Canada, and in several foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/02/movie-projector-the-roommate-and-sanctum-wont-score-on-superbowl-weekend.html|title=Movie Projector: 'The Roommate' and 'Sanctum' won't score on Super Bowl weekend|last=Fritz|first=Ben|last2=Kaufman|first2=Amy|work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2011, ''Sanctum'' was the tenth-highest-grossing Australian film at the international box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/blogs/get-flickd/kings-speech-the-little-nonaussie-that-could/20110303-1bffp.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=King's Speech: The little non-Aussie that could | date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie made $3,838,154 at the Australian box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://if.com.au/2011/05/16/article/HKSHNCVQHE.html Sam Dallas, "Box Office: Insidious posts modest opening", ''If Magazine'' 17 May 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524041729/http://if.com.au/2011/05/16/article/HKSHNCVQHE.html |date=24 May 2014 }} accessed 24 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received predominantly negative reviews in the US. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 30% of 161 critics rated the film positively with an average score of 4.5/10. The consensus states that "''Sanctum'' is beautifully photographed, and it makes better use of 3-D technology than most, but that doesn't make up for its ham-handed script and lifeless cast." It has a [[Metacritic]] rating of 42 out of 100. However, in the rest of the world, where the major part of the gross take occurred,&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; some reviews were slightly better. In Australia, Jim Schembri gave it 3 1/2 stars from 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/sanctum-3d-20110202-1ad7u.html |title=Sanctum 3D |author= Jim Schembri |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-08-22 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the UK's ''Daily Express'' gave it 3 from 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/226923/Sanctum-film-reviewSanctum-film-reviewSanctum-film-review |title=Sanctum film review |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Super Bonk'''''  (released in Europe as '''''Super B.C. Kid''''' and in Japan as '''''Chō Genjin''''') is a 1994 [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is the fourth game in the ''[[Bonk (video game series)|Bonk]]'' series. The game was later re-released for the [[Virtual Console|Wii Virtual Console]] in Japan and Europe in 2010 and in North America in 2011.

==Reception==
In their review, ''[[GamePro]]'' praised the clever usage of Bonk's various forms, the "crisp, cutesy quality" of the graphics, the easy controls, and the numerous bonus rounds, but nonetheless gave ''Super Bonk'' an overall negative assessment, concluding that platformer fans in general and Bonk fans in particular would find very little new about the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Super Bonk|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=67|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1995|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Oliver "Ted" Robledo''' (26 July 1928 – 6 December 1970) was a [[Chile]]an professional [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He played as a left-sided [[defender (association football)|defender]], and is most notable for his time spent with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

==Career==
Robledo was born in [[Iquique]], Chile to a Chilean father and an [[England|English]] mother. He emigrated with his family to [[Wath-on-Dearne]], [[Yorkshire]] in 1932, at the age of four, due to the political instability in Chile at the time. The family lived at Barnsley Rd, [[West Melton]], in the same house where the Anglo-French biographer [[David Bret]] was later raised. 

Robledo started his footballing career at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] with his brother [[George Robledo|George]]. [[Football League First Division|First Division]] Newcastle United signed him on 27 January 1949. Newcastle were only interested in signing his brother, but neither of the Robledo brothers would move without the other. Their appearance together in the [[1952 FA Cup Final]] was the first time more than one foreign player had appeared in a cup final eleven.

The majority of Robledo's appearances for the club came in the 1951–52 season. Robledo played for Newcastle until the end of the 1952–53 season, when he was sold to [[Colo-Colo]]. After retiring from football, Robledo served on an oil tanker where he died in mysterious circumstances in December 1970, at the age of 42. It was rumoured that Robledo was thrown off the tanker and drowned. His body has never been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Richard|title=Football: The story of the fabulous Robledo boys|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-story-of-the-fabulous-robledo-boys-1094964.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=21 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother George outlived him by nearly two decades, dying in April 1989 just before his 63rd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle United legend George Robledo on Lennon sketch|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4826466.Lennon____sketch_of_United_cup_hero___/|newspaper=[[The Northern Echo]]|date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masque of Anarchy cover.jpg|thumb|1832 first edition, printed by Bradbury and Evans, Edward Moxon, London.]][[File:Masque42.jpg|thumb|1842 title page, with added poems "Queen Liberty" and "Song-To the Men of England", J. Watson, London.]]
'''"The Masque of Anarchy"''' (or "The Mask of Anarchy") is a British political poem written in 1819 (see [[1819 in poetry]]) by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] following the [[Peterloo massacre]] of that year. In his call for freedom, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of [[nonviolent resistance]].

The poem was not published during Shelley's lifetime and did not appear in print until 1832 (see [[1832 in poetry]]), when published by Edward Moxon in London with a preface by [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]].&lt;ref name=cocel&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Cox |editor-first=Michael |title=The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=0-19-860634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley had sent the manuscript in 1819 for publication in ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]''. Leigh Hunt withheld it from publication because he "thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind-heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse." The epigraph on the cover of the first edition is from ''[[The Revolt of Islam]]'' (1818): "Hope is strong; Justice and Truth their winged child have found."

Use of ''masque'' and ''mask'' is discussed by Morton Paley;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morton D. |last=Paley |title=Apocalypse and Millennium in English Romantic Poetry |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-19169-882-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley used ''mask'' in the manuscript but the first edition uses ''masque'' in the title.

==Synopsis==
Shelley begins his poem, written on the occasion of the [[Peterloo massacre]], Manchester 1819, with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time, "God, and King, and Law" – and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action: "Let a great assembly be, of the fearless, of the free". The crowd at this gathering is met by armed soldiers, but the protesters do not raise an arm against their assailants:

:''"Stand ye calm and resolute,''
:''Like a forest close and mute,''
:''With folded arms and looks which are''
:''Weapons of unvanquished war.''

:''And if then the tyrants dare,''
:''Let them ride among you there;''
:''Slash, and stab, and maim and hew;''
:''What they like, that let them do.''

:''With folded arms and steady eyes,''
:''And little fear, and less surprise,''
:''Look upon them as they slay,''
:''Till their rage has died away:''

:''Then they will return with shame,''
:''To the place from which they came,''
:''And the blood thus shed will speak''
:''In hot blushes on their cheek:''

:''Rise, like lions after slumber''
:''In unvanquishable number!''
:''Shake your chains to earth like dew''
:''Which in sleep had fallen on you:''
:''Ye are many—they are few!"''&lt;ref name="masque"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelley |first=Percy Bysshe |editor-first=Mrs. |editor-last=Shelley |editor-link=Mary Shelley |title=The works of Percy Bysshe Shelley |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iIgU7b6j6kcC&amp;pg=PA231 |date=1847 |pages=231–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley elaborates on the psychological consequences of violence met with pacifism. The guilty soldiers he says, will return shamefully to society, where "blood thus shed will speak / In hot blushes on their cheek". Women will point out the murderers on the streets, their former friends will shun them, and honourable soldiers will turn away from those responsible for the massacre, "ashamed of such base company". A version was taken up by [[Henry David Thoreau]] in his essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|''Civil Disobedience'']], and later by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] in his doctrine of ''[[Satyagraha]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |title=Liberationist Sexuality and Nonviolent Resistance: The Legacy of Blake and Shelley in Morris's News From Nowhere |first=Ashton |last=Nichols |journal=[[Journal of William Morris Studies]] |volume=10 |number=4 |date=1994 |pages=20-27 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |archivedate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's [[nonviolence]] in protest and political action.&lt;ref name="Weber-Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Weber |title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |pages=28–29 |isbn=978-0-52184-230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's "The Masque of Anarchy" to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber-Gandhi"/&gt;

The poem mentions several members of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s government by name: the Foreign Secretary, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], who appears as a mask worn by Murder, the Home Secretary, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]], whose guise is taken by [[Hypocrisy]], and the Lord Chancellor, [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]], whose ermine gown is worn by Fraud. Led by Anarchy, a skeleton with a crown, they try to take over England, but are slain by a mysterious armoured figure who arises from a mist. The maiden [[Hope]], revived, then calls to the people of England:

:''"Men of England, heirs of Glory,''
:''Heroes of unwritten story,''
:''Nurslings of one mighty Mother,''
:''Hopes of her, and one another!''

:''What is Freedom? Ye can tell''
:''That which Slavery is too well,''
:''For its very name has grown''
:''To an echo of your own''

:''Let a vast assembly be,''
:''And with great solemnity''
:''Declare with measured words, that ye''
:''Are, as God has made ye, free.''

:''The old laws of England—they''
:''Whose reverend heads with age are grey,''
:''Children of a wiser day;''
:''And whose solemn voice must be''
:''Thine own echo—Liberty!''

:''Rise, like lions after slumber''
:''In unvanquishable number!''
:''Shake your chains to earth, like dew''
:''Which in sleep had fallen on you:''
:''Ye are many—they are few!"''&lt;ref name="masque"/&gt;

==Literary criticism==
Political authors and campaigners such as [[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]] and [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]], among others, describe it as "the greatest political poem ever written in English".&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dC8_eLftKwC&amp;pg=PA532 |title=Shelley: The Pursuit |first=Richard |last=Holmes |authorlink=Richard Holmes (biographer) |publisher=New York Review Books |year=2003 |origyear=1974 |page=532 |isbn=1-59017-037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foot"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/46/shelley.shtml |authorlink=Paul Foot (journalist) |first=Paul |last=Foot |title=Shelley: Trumpet of Prophecy |journal=International Socialist Review | issue=46 |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', [[Aldous Huxley]] noted the poem's exhortation to the English to resist assault without fighting back, stating "The Method of resistance inculcated in by Shelley in ''The Mask of Anarchy'' (sic) is the method of non-violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aldous |last=Huxley |authorlink=Aldous Huxley |chapter=Shelley |title=An Encyclopedia of Pacifism |location=London |publisher=Chatto and Windus, in association with the [[Peace Pledge Union]] |year=1937 |pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author, educator, and activist [[Howard Zinn]] refers to the poem in ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''. In a subsequent interview, he underscored the power of the poem, suggesting: "What a remarkable affirmation of the power of people who seem to have no power. Ye are many, they are few. It has always seemed to me that poetry, music, literature, contribute very special power."&lt;ref name="zinn1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780060844257 |first=Howard |last=Zinn |authorlink=Howard Zinn |title=Original Zinn: Conversations on History and Politics |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=0060844256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Zinn uses "The Mask of Anarchy" as an example of literature that members of the American labour movement would read to other workers to inform and educate them.

==Use in politics==
The rallying language of the poem had led to elements of it being used by political movements. It was recited by students at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and by protesters in [[Tahrir Square]] during the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/for-the-man-jeremy-corbyn-percy-bysshe-shelley/ |last=Mulhallen |first=Jacqueline |date=2017 |title=For the Many, Not the Few: Jeremy Corbyn and Percy Bysshe Shelley |website=Pluto Books |accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "like lions after slumber, in unvanquishable number" from the poem is used as a motto/slogan by the [[International Socialist Organization]] in their organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isreview.org/issue |title=Issues |website=International Socialist Review.org |accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line "Ye are many-they are few" inspired the campaign slogan "We are many, they are few" used by protesters during the [[Poll tax riots]] of 1989–90 in the United Kingdom, and also inspired the title of the 2014 documentary film ''[[We Are Many (film)|We Are Many]]'', which focused on the global [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/rise-lions-after-slumber-why-do-jeremy-corbyn-and-co-keep-reciting-19th-century |title="Rise like lions after slumber": why do Jeremy Corbyn and co keep reciting a 19th century poem? |last=Chakelian |first=Anoosh |date=27 June 2017 |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Corbyn]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]], quoted the final stanza from the poem at his rally in [[Islington]], on the final day of campaigning for the [[2017 UK general election]]. Corbyn subsequently quoted the final stanza again during his speech at the [[Pyramid stage]] at the 2017 [[Glastonbury Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/jeremy-corbyn-glastonbury-speech-read-full-pyramid-stage-crowd-size-a7806691.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn at Glastonbury: Read Labour leader's Pyramid Stage speech in full |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=24 June 2017 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic and writer [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] has suggested that the title of the party's 2017 manifesto, "For the Many, Not the Few", was derived from the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/londoners-diary-jeremy-corbyns-romantic-notions-traced-back-to-percy-shelley-a3541276.html |title=Londoner's Diary: Jeremy Corbyn's Romantic notions traced back to Percy Shelley |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=17 May 2017 |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase 'a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few' also appears in the revised version of [[Clause IV]] of the Labour Party Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/clause-iv-of-labour-party-constitution-what-is-all-the-fuss-about-reinstating-it |title=Clause IV: a brief history |first=Aisha |last=Gani |date=9 August 2015 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same variation, "For The Many, Not The Few", was the sub-title to [[Robert Reich]]'s 2016 book, ''[[Saving Capitalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/robert-reichs-saving-capitalism.html |title=Robert Reich's 'Saving Capitalism' |last=Griswold |first=Alison |date=15 November 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Lines from the poem are quoted on the sleeve of [[The Jam]]'s 1980 album ''[[Sound Affects]]''.

Lines from the poem inspired and are featured in the [[John Vanderslice]] song ''Pale Horse''.

The poem's lines "like lions after slumber, in unvanquishable number" are quoted by the title and closing lines of the [[Scritti Politti]] song "[[Songs to Remember|Lions After Slumber]]". They are also referenced in the opening lines of the song "Blaze" by [[Strike Anywhere]].

The chorus of the song "Robin Hood" by [[The Mekons]] contains the lines "Rise like lions, shake your chains, babe. Ye are many, they are few".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mekons.de/lyrics/robin.htm |title=Robin Hood |website=Mekons.de |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' titled "The Heart of a Man", the character played by [[Jeff Hordley]], Stan Keaton, quotes the last verse in its entirety whilst standing outside the Aidensfield Arms with his fellow sacked workers.

"'''The Two Sisters'''" is a Northumbrian [[murder ballad]] that recounts the tale of a girl drowned by her sister.  It is first known to have appeared on a [[broadside (music)|broadside]] in 1656 as "The Miller and the King's Daughter."  At least 21 English variants exist under several names, including "Minnorie" or "Binnorie", "The Cruel Sister", "The Wind and Rain", "Dreadful Wind and Rain", "Two Sisters", "The Bonny Swans" and the "Bonnie Bows of London". The ballad was collected by [[Francis J. Child]] ([[Child ballad|Child]] 10) and is also listed in the [[Roud Folk Song Index]].&lt;ref name=Roud&gt;{{cite web|title=Roud Folksong Index|url=http://library.efdss.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi?cross=off&amp;index_roud=on&amp;query=8&amp;field=20|publisher=[[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (for the [[Vaughan Williams Memorial Library]])|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Two sisters go down by a body of water, sometimes a river and sometimes the sea.  The older one pushes the younger in and refuses to pull her out again; generally the lyrics explicitly state her intent to drown her younger sister.  Her motive, when included in the lyrics, is sexual jealousy – in some variants, the sisters are being two-timed by a suitor; in others, the elder sister's affections are not encouraged by the young man.  In a few versions, a third sister is mentioned, but plays no significant role in events.  In most versions, the older sister is described as dark, while the younger sister is fair.

When the murdered girl's body floats ashore, someone makes a musical instrument out of it, generally a [[harp]] or a [[fiddle]], with a frame of bone and the girl's "long yellow hair" (or "golden hair") for strings.  The instrument then plays itself and sings about the murder.  In some versions, this occurs after the musician has taken it to the family's household, so that the elder sister is publicly revealed (sometimes at her wedding to the murdered girl's suitor) as the murderess.

It should be noted that the variant titled ''The Two Sisters'' typically omits the haunted instrument entirely, ending instead with an unrelated person (often a miller) executed for robbing the murdered girl's corpse and the elder sister sometimes going unpunished, or sometimes boiled in lead.

==Parallels in other languages==
The theme of this ballad was common in many northern European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 119, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; There are 125 different variants known in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] alone. Its general Scandinavian classification is [[The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad|TSB]]&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;38; and it is (among others) known as ''Den talende strængelek'' or ''De to søstre'' ([[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser|DgF]]&amp;nbsp;95) in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''Hørpu ríma'' ([[Corpus Carminum Færoensium|CCF]]&amp;nbsp;136) in [[Faroese language|Faroese]], ''Hörpu kvæði'' ([[Ízlenzk fornkvæði|IFkv]]&amp;nbsp;13) in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], ''Dei tvo systar'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and ''De två systrarna'' ([[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader|SMB]]&amp;nbsp;13) in Swedish. It has also spread further south; for example, as ''Gosli iz človeškega telesa izdajo umor'' (A Fiddle Made from a Human Body Reveals a Murder) in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]].

In the Norse variants, the older sister is depicted as dark and the younger as fair, often with great contrast, comparing the one to soot or the other to the sun or milk.  This can inspire taunts from the younger about the older's looks.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 120, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the Norwegian and some of the Swedish variants, the story ends by the instrument being broken and the younger sister coming alive again.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 121, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In a few, she was not actually drowned, but saved and nursed back to health; she tells the story herself.&lt;ref name="Francis James Child p 123"&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 123, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale is also found in prose form, in fairy tales such as ''[[The Singing Bone]]'', where the siblings are brothers instead of sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 136, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This is widespread throughout Europe; often the motive is not jealousy because of a lover, but the younger child's success in winning the object that will cure the king, or that will win the father's inheritance.&lt;ref name="Francis James Child p 123"/&gt;

In [[Poland|Polish]] literature from the [[romanticism]] period, a similar theme is found in ''[[Balladyna (drama)|Balladyna]]'' (1838) by [[Juliusz Słowacki]]. Two sisters engage in a [[raspberry]]-gathering contest to decide which of them gets to marry Prince Kirkor. When the younger Alina wins, the older Balladyna kills her. Finally, she is killed by a bolt of [[lightning]] in an act of divine retribution.

A [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] version exists, where a king has three daughters. The older two are bad and ugly and envy the younger child sister because of her beauty. One day, they murder her in the forest and place her corpse inside a fiddle. The fiddle plays music on its own and eventually is given to the royal family. The fiddle does not play for the evil sisters, but the princess is restored to life once her father tries to play it. The sisters are imprisoned, but the good princess pardons them once she becomes queen.

The ballad also appears in a number of guises in Scottish Gaelic, under the name 'A' Bhean Eudach' or 'The Jealous Woman'. In many of the Scottish Gaelic variants the cruel sister murders her sibling while she is sleeping by knotting her hair into the seaweed on a rock at low tide. When she wakes the tide is coming in fast and as she is drowning she sings the song 'A' Bhean Eudach' detailing her tragic end.

==Connections to other ballads==

As is frequently found with traditional folksongs, versions of The Twa Sisters are associated with tunes that are used in common with several other ballads. For example, at least one variant of this ballad ("Cruel Sister") uses the tune and [[refrain]] from "Lay the bent to the bonny broom", a widely used song (whose original lyrics are lost) which is also used, for example, by some versions of "[[Riddles Wisely Expounded]]" ([[Child ballad|Child]] 1).

Canadian singer and harpist [[Loreena McKennitt]]'s song "[[The Bonny Swans]]" is a pastiche of several traditional variants of the ballad.  The first stanza mentions the third sister, but she subsequently disappears from the narrative. The song recounts a tale in which a young woman is drowned by her jealous older sister in an effort to gain the younger sister's beloved.  The girl's body washes up near a mill, where the miller's daughter mistakes her corpse for that of a [[swan]].  Later, after she is pulled from the water, a passing [[harp]]er fashions a harp from the bones and hair of the dead girl; the harp plays alone, powered by the girl's soul.  The harp is brought to her father's hall and plays before the entire court, telling of her sister's crime. The song also mentions her brother named Hugh, and her beloved William, and gives a name to the older sister, Anne.

An early [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] poem, "The Sisters", also bears a resemblance to the ballad: a sister scorned in love who murders the lover of her sister, and possibly the sister too, out of jealousy.

A transboundary [[breed]] is a breed which is present in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. August 2012. Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, Seventh Session. http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me588e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Transboundary [[species]] of the five significant [[livestock]] types (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens), have been developed for a hundred years or more in intensive manufacturing systems, which has led to global availability.  A relatively small number of worldwide transboundary breeds compose the ever-increasing share of total global animal products. However, only in [[North America]] and the [[Southwest Pacific]] do the number of transboundary breeds surpass that of local breeds.&lt;ref&gt;Sep. 2013. AgriCultures Network. Livestock breeding and small-scale keepers. http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/resources/learning/mod4-online/learning-block-2/2.3/2.3.1 accessed Nov. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

There can be both regional and international types of transboundary breeds. Regional breeds are breeds that are reported to only be found in one "region", which may include several countries, and an international transboundary breed is one that is reported to be found in multiple regions. For example, the Holstein Fresian cattle is an international transboundary breed, because it is found in several different continents and regions.

The '''weasel program''' or '''Dawkins' weasel''' is a [[thought experiment]] and a variety of [[computer simulation]]s illustrating it.  Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives [[evolution]]ary systems—random [[Mutation|variation]] combined with non-random cumulative [[Selection (biology)|selection]]—is different from pure [[chance (philosophy)|chance]].

The thought experiment was formulated by [[Richard Dawkins]], and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.

== Overview ==
In chapter 3 of his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known [[infinite monkey theorem]]:

Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but just the short sentence 'Methinks it is like a [[weasel]]', and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?}}

The scenario is staged to produce a string of [[gibberish]] letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, so the [[probability]] that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a "target" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".

A [[computer program]] could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire [[Age of the universe|lifetime of the universe]] to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".&lt;ref&gt;For a string of 28 characters, with 27 possible characters (A-Z plus space), any randomly generated string has the probability one in 27^28 of being correct; that is approximately one in 10^40. If a program generating 10 million strings per second had been running since the start of the universe (around 14 billion years, or 10^17 seconds), it would have only generated around 10^24 strings by now.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of [[evolution]]ary change, i.e. that [[DNA]] sequences or [[organic compound]]s such as [[proteins]] are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of [[amino acids]] in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as [[Hoyle's fallacy]]). Rather, evolution proceeds by [[hill climbing]], as in [[adaptive landscape]]s.

Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of ''cumulative'' selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words:

{{quote|We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program. It again begins by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters, just as before ... it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random [[error]] &amp;ndash; 'mutation' &amp;ndash; in the copying. The computer examines the [[mutant]] nonsense phrases, the 'progeny' of the original phrase, and chooses the one which,'' however slightly, ''most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.}}

By repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each [[generation]]. The sequences progress through each generation:

:Generation&amp;nbsp;01:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Note: the 4th character of line 1 is missing in Dawkins' text; however line 2 suggests it was probably a T&lt;/ref&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;02:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBSWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;10:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MDLDMNLS&amp;nbsp;ITJISWHRZREZ&amp;nbsp;MECS&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;20:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MELDINLS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWPRKE&amp;nbsp;Z&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;30:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINGS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWLIKE&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;40:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;43:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;

Dawkins continues:

{{quote|The exact time taken by the computer to reach the target doesn't matter. If you want to know, it completed the whole exercise for me, the first time, while I was out to lunch. It took about half an hour. (Computer enthusiasts may think this unduly slow. The reason is that the program was written in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], a sort of computer baby-talk. When I rewrote it in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], it took 11 seconds.) Computers are a bit faster at this kind of thing than monkeys, but the difference really isn't significant. What matters is the difference between the time taken by'' cumulative ''selection, and the time which the same computer, working flat out at the same rate, would take to reach the target phrase if it were forced to use the other procedure of'' single-step selection: ''about a million million million million million years. This is more than a million million million times as long as the universe has so far existed.}}

==Implications for biology==
The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or [[gene]]s) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival ("fitness") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to "die."

Dawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his "biomorphs" program:

{{quote|The human eye has an active role to play in the story. It is the selecting agent. It surveys the litter of progeny and chooses one for breeding. ...Our model, in other words, is strictly a model of artificial selection, not natural selection. The criterion for 'success' is not the direct criterion of survival, as it is in true natural selection. In true natural selection, if a body has what it takes to survive, its genes automatically survive because they are inside it. So the genes that survive tend to be, automatically, those genes that confer on bodies the qualities that assist them to survive.}}

Regarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations:

{{quote|Although the monkey/Shakespeare model is useful for explaining the distinction between single-step selection and cumulative selection, it is misleading in important ways. One of these is that, in each generation of selective 'breeding', the mutant 'progeny' phrases were judged according to the criterion of resemblance to a'' distant ideal ''target, the phrase METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL. Life isn't like that. Evolution has no long-term goal. There is no long-distance target, no final perfection to serve as a criterion for selection, although human vanity cherishes the absurd notion that our species is the final goal of evolution. In real life, the criterion for selection is always short-term, either simple survival or, more generally, reproductive success.}}

[[File:Dawkins-Weasel.png|thumb | A full run of a weasel program, with 100 offspring per generation, and a 5% mutation chance per character copied. Only the "fittest" string of each generation is shown. Note that, in generation 8, the 25th character, which had been correct (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;), becomes incorrect (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;). The program does not "lock" correct characters, rather it measures at each iteration the closeness of the complete string to the 'target' phrase.]]

==More complex models==
In ''The Blind Watchmaker,'' Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of [[gene selection]] involving  entities he calls biomorphs. These are [[Plane (mathematics)|two-dimensional]] sets of [[Line (mathematics)#Line segment|line segments]] which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of "genes" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as "airplane" or "octopus" biomorphs.

As a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of "genetic space," where each possible gene is treated as a [[dimension]], and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, "however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead". 

In ''Climbing Mount Improbable'', Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the [[spider web]].  He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a "trial and error" process.  Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.

== Example algorithm ==
{{or section|date=August 2016}}
Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a "Weasel" style algorithm could run as follows.

# Start with a random string of 28 characters.
# Make 100 copies of the string (''reproduce'').
# For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (''mutate'') the character with a new random character.
#  Compare each new string with the target string "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).
# If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.

For these purposes, a "character" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not "locked". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.
