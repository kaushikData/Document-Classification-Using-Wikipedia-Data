'''Ana María Zeno de Luque''' (1922–2011) was an Argentine professor, gynaecologist, sexologist, and women's rights activist who specialized in sexual education and social medicine.

==Life==
She was the daughter of the surgeon [[Artemio Zeno]] and the niece of the surgeon [[Lelio Zeno]]. In 1948, she earned her medical degree from the [[National University of the Littoral]], and in 1968, she was awarded a doctorate in medicine.

Zeno was a pioneer in the 1970s in the area of contraception. She wrote in opinion columns and published letters from readers in local and national newspapers. Together with her husband, the psychiatrist Dr. N. Luque, she established a home-centered medical practice.

Zeno was a pioneer in reproductive women's issues. When little was known about sexual education, Zeno promoted and developed counselors and professionals in the field. As a gynecologist, she encouraged the opening of spaces for the care of adolescents with sexual problems in hospitals, proclaiming the importance of talking about these issues and having policies on sexual and reproductive health.

In 1978, she was a founding member of the "Rosarina Association of Sexual Education" (ARES), and in 1983, the [[Kinsey Institute]] of [[Sexology]] Rosario.

She also held positions at the municipal, provincial and national levels.

Although her daughter disappeared during Argentina's military dictatorship, Zeno never abandoned the struggle for women's rights.

==Winners 2007/2008==
In 2007/2008 the final was held at [[Queen Elizabeth II Law Courts, Liverpool]] on Saturday 1 March 2008.  The sixteen Regional Heat winners from across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland competed in three preliminary rounds in order to determine the top two finalist teams that would progress onto the Grand Final.

Queen Elizabeth's Community College, [[Crediton]] (winners of the Plymouth Regional Heat) and Whitley Bay High School (winners of the Newcastle Regional Heat) were announced as the two finalists.

In the Grand Final the teams presented the case of Jordan Potter before a panel of five judges and senior counsel from across the UK: HHJ Clifton, HHJ Harris QC, Brian Kennedy QC, [[Herbert Kerrigan]] QC and HHJ Roddy.

Whitley Bay High School were declared national champions.  HHJ Clifton praised both teams on the high standard of their performances, noting the dramatic flair of the witnesses and the quality of all four barristers.

The new national champions received their trophy and prizes from the judges.

==Winners 2006/2007==
A total of 158 schools had taken part in the Competition since heats began in November the previous year.

Lumen Christi College was the winner of the 2006/2007 competition. The Lumen Christi student who played the role of a barrister said: "The opportunity to work with real barristers and prepare a case has been a great experience. It gave us a real insight into how the justice system works"{{cite this quote|date=December 2013}} Her teacher added: "I was impressed by how a number of shy students flourished and came out of their shells by taking part in the competition and the level of articulation and analytical skills was heartening to see. The actual day in court showed me how readily students rose to the challenge of such a pressurised setting. Their confidence shone through. The school was enlivened by our victory and the level of support has been fantastic."{{cite this quote|date=December 2013}}

Peiser established the [[Benny Peiser#Cambridge Conference Network|Cambridge Conference Network]] in 1997. Peiser acknowledges that he is "not a climate scientist" and has "never claimed to be one." His interest as a social anthropologist, is in "how climate change is portrayed as a potential disaster and how we respond to that."&lt;ref name=timeshighereducation&gt;

As an outspoken [[climate change sceptic]], Peiser became director of the newly established UK lobbying group [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]] in 2009. He serves as co-editor of the journal, ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'' and is a regular contributor to Canada's ''[[National Post]]''.&lt;ref name=NationalPostca2010&gt;

==Background==
Born of German parents in [[Haifa]], Israel, in 1957, Peiser's family soon returned to Germany. He grew up in [[Frankfurt]] and "spent the first 35 years of his life" in Germany.&lt;ref name=profile&gt;

Peiser studied political science, English, and [[sports science]] at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], receiving a doctorate in cultural studies (''Kulturwissenschaften'') from that institution in 1993, for an examination of the history, archaeology and natural history of Greek problems at the time of the ancient Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=naturalcatastrophes1998&gt;

Drawn by "concerns about nuclear energy and its waste", he reportedly was involved with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Green Party]] while a student.&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;

Upon completing his doctoral degree, Peiser moved to [[Liverpool]], England, to take up a position as lecturer at [[Liverpool John Moores University]].&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;

==Career and research interests==
Peiser was previously employed as an historian of ancient sport at the University of Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Conference Schedule: "Reconsidering Velikovsky: The Role of Catastrophism in the Earth Sciences and the History of Mankind," University of Toronto, 17–19 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; He listed his research interests at LJMU as the effects of [[environmental change]] and catastrophic events on contemporary thought and societal evolution; climate change and science communication; international climate policy; the risks posed by [[near-Earth object]]s and [[Clyde Tombaugh#Near-Earth satellite search|satellites]] and the environmental and socio-economic impacts of physical activity.&lt;ref name=staff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/sportandexercisesciences/76407.htm |title=Department staff page |publisher=John Moores University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031124355/http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/sportandexercisesciences/76407.htm |archivedate=31 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambridge Conference Network==

In 1997 Peiser established the Cambridge Conference Network, an email-based discussion group for a conference of the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies about Bronze Age catastrophes. Over time the network began to focus on discussion on climate change and was renamed CCNet (active from 1997 to 2006),&lt;ref name=CCNetArchive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/CCNet-homepage.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507215057/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/CCNet-homepage.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 May 2006|title=CCNet homepage|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a platform for "the minority of people who are climate (change) sceptics or have doubts about the prevailing views."&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation"/&gt;

Peiser acknowledges that he is "not a climate scientist" and has "never claimed to be one." His interest as a social anthropologist, is in "how climate change is portrayed as a potential disaster and how we respond to that."&lt;ref name=timeshighereducation /&gt;

Peiser argued that he is against alarmist, hysterical doomsday scenarios and catastrophic apocalyptic cult thinking but is not "a climate-change sceptic (2008)."&lt;ref name=timeshighereducation /&gt; "Most scientists do seem to accept that there is an effect of CO2 on climate; the big question is how large and dangerous it will be in future. Personally, I'm also sceptical about the doomsday scenarios."&lt;ref name=timeshighereducation /&gt;

===Reclassification of Pluto's Status===

American [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and [[science communication|science communicator]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] described (2008) the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet) as a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group" "moderated" by Benny Peiser with a primary interest in "open discussion of asteroids, comets, and their risk to life on Earth" but open to many other news subjects.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;

Tyson recounted the heated on-line debate on CCNet chat group following Peiser's renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status. Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and Boston Globe spawned from an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' entitled "Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York". Tyson's decision resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', 17 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT22jan2001&gt;

===Involvement in the climate-change debate===

In 11–13 July 1997, Benny Peiser and co-editors introduced the Second Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Cambridge Conference held at Fitzwilliam College, by outlining the background of neo-catastrophism by examining the astronomical and meteoritic background for catastrophic thinking, for example near-earth objects, cometary catastrophes and ecological disasters. The presentations by historians, classicists -researchers in areas such as Chinese studies, mythology, art, religion, literature and ancient civilisations – met with geologists, astrophysics, and a science correspondent for London's Sunday Telegraph, were later compiled in a publication entitled ''Natural Catastrophes during Bronze Age Civilisations''.&lt;ref name=naturalcatastrophes1998p252&gt;

During a debate at the [[Oxford Union]] in 2005, Peiser stated, "The lack of a balanced approach to the issue of global warming has led to an extremely one-sided and alarmist perception of risk.... Climate alarmists habitually ignore the potential economic and health benefits of warming temperatures. While magnifying the probable risks to health and mortality as a result of warmer temperatures, many underrate or simply discount the possible health benefits of moderate warming."&lt;ref name=alarmism2005&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in Local Transport Today in 2006, Peiser argued that environmental concerns in general and concern about [[global warming]] in particular had reached a level of "near hysteria" and was "poisonous for rational policy making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/LTT-interviewNo06.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082425/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/LTT-interviewNo06.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 July 2007 |title=Can we go on building roads and runways and save the planet |work=Local Transport Today |date=30 November 2006 |accessdate=2 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Laurence I. Gould from the University of Hartford, in his editorial entitled 'Global Warming from a Critical Perspective' (2007) included Benny Peiser's argument in favour of the Oxford Union debate proposition entitled "This House believes that alarmism has replaced science in the [[global warming controversy|global warming debate]]."&lt;ref name=APSalarmism2007&gt;

In 2009, in response to a prediction by [[James E. Hansen]] from [[NASA]] that sea levels could rise by 60&amp;nbsp;cm, he said, "The predictions come in thick and fast, but we take them all with a pinch of salt. We look out of the window and it's very cold, it doesn't seem to be warming."&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2013 Benny Peiser spoke to a group of 200 at the 10th annual Calgary, Alberta [[Friends of Science]], a Canadian non-profit advocacy organisation who dispute the value of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and believe "the Sun is the main direct and indirect driver of [[climate change]]", rather than [[Human impact on the environment|human activity]]. Peiser compared the apocalyptic statements surrounding the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL]] pipeline and oil sands climate change debate, to centuries of catastrophic, apocalyptic cult thinking in the Bronze Age for example.&lt;ref name=PRWeb14February2013&gt;

==Global Warming Policy Foundation==

Benny Peiser is director of the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]] (GWPF) and has described the climate change debate as being "near hysteria".&lt;ref name=voicesdenial2009&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that some of the names of members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation are "straight from the Who's Who of current climate change skeptics." Ward was concerned that the GWPF would pump material that was not scrutinised through peer-reviewed into the climate change debate. The Global Warming Policy Foundation's board of trustees includes Lord Barnett, who voted against the Climate Change Bill, and the Bishop of Chester, "who has argued there was no consensus among climate change scientists that carbon dioxide levels are the key determinant".&lt;ref name=voicesdenial2009 /&gt; Professor Ian Plimer, a member of the GWPF's academic advisory council, "argues volcanoes produce more CO2 than humans."&lt;ref name=voicesdenial2009 /&gt; At its launch in 2009 it was described as a "new high-powered all-party think-tank" by global warming critic, [[Nigel Lawson|Lord Lawson of Blaby]], the former Conservative Chancellor, in an interview with ''[[The Times]]''s journalist [[David Aaronovitch]].&lt;ref name=GWPF2009&gt;

The Guardian article cast doubt on the idea that an upsurge in scepticism was underway, noting that "in (the US) Congress, even the most determined opponents of climate change legislation now frame their arguments in economic terms rather than on the science".
&lt;ref name=voicesdenial2009 /&gt;

[[Fred Pearce]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (2010) that the three inquiries Global Warming Policy Foundation looked into were all badly flawed, and that ''The Climategate Inquiries'' report ably dissects their failures. He writes that the report, "for all its sharp—and in many cases justified—rejoinders to the official inquiries ... is likely to be ignored in some quarters for its brazen hypocrisy." Pearce argued that one of the criticisms of the three inquiries was that no [[climate sceptic]]s were on the inquiry teams, and now the critics themselves have produced a review of the reviews that included no one not already supportive of the sceptical position. But, Pearce wrote, Montford "has landed some good blows here."&lt;ref name=Pearce14sept2010&gt;

=== Objections to Oreskes essay ===
In 2004, a paper was published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' by [[Naomi Oreskes]] titled ''Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;
{{cite web
|author=Oreskes, N.

|title=Beyond the Ivory Tower, The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change (including corrections)
|date=21 January 2005
|accessdate=24 April 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It researched the hypothesis that legitimate dissenting opinions on [[anthropogenic climate change]] might be downplayed in scientific papers and concluded that 75% of the examined [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]s either explicitly or implicitly backed the consensus view, none directly dissenting from it. The essay received a great deal of media attention from around the world and has been cited by many prominent people including as [[Al Gore]] in the movie ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', the [[Royal Society]] and former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, [[David King (chemist)|Prof Sir David King]].

Peiser identified an error in this paper in that keywords used in the ISI database search were in fact "global climate change" and not "climate change" as originally stated, which resulted in a correction being published by ''Science''.&lt;ref name=science /&gt;

Noticing that the original research had limited itself to articles in peer-reviewed publications, Peiser then performed a similar survey that included non-scientific, non-peer-reviewed, publications and wrote a letter to ''Science'' claiming that only 29% of such papers agreed with the consensus viewpoint, 3% explicitly disagreeing. ''Science'' chose not to publish Peiser's letter saying that the basic contents of his letter were not novel enough to be published, as they were "widely dispersed on the internet."&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;

In an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Peiser claimed that leading scientific journals were 'censoring debate on global warming' and that ''Science "has a duty to publish [his research]".&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

One of his main points of criticism is that the vast majority of the abstracts referred to in the study do not mention anthropogenic climate change, and only 13 of the 928 abstracts explicitly endorse what Oreskes called the "consensus view".&lt;ref name=PeiserOreskes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Oreskes-abstracts.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060704183216/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Oreskes-abstracts.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 July 2006 |title=Peiser's analysis of Oreskes's abstracts |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peiser later admitted that it was a mistake to include one of the papers in his survey and said that his main criticism of Oreskes' essay its "claim of a unanimous consensus on [[anthropogenic global warming]] (APG) (as opposed to a majority consensus) is tenuous" and that it still was valid. "I accept that it was a mistake to include the abstract you mentioned."&lt;ref&gt;

|date=17 March 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006, letter to Australia's ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', Peiser explained that he had retracted 97% of his original critique and elaborated on some of his comments: "I do not think anyone is questioning that we are in a period of global warming. Neither do I doubt that the overwhelming majority of climatologists is agreed that the current warming period is mostly due to human impact. However, this majority consensus is far from unanimous."&lt;ref name="mediawatch peiser"&gt;

[[File:05. Епрувета што плива и тоне.ogv|thumb|right|Floating and sinking demonstration (Cartesian diver). The tube is filled with water and air. When pressing the bottle, the additional water enters the test tube, thus increasing the average density of the system tube-water-air, resulting with negative buoyancy and the tube sinks.]]

A '''Cartesian diver''' or '''Cartesian devil''' is a classic [[science]] experiment, named for [[René Descartes]], which demonstrates the principle of [[buoyancy]] ([[Archimedes]]’ principle) and the [[ideal gas law]].  René Descartes is said to have invented the toy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} However the first written description of this device is due to [[Raffaello Magiotti]], in his book "Renitenza certissima dell'acqua alla compressione" (Very firm resistance of water to compression) published in 1648.

==Experiment description==
The experiment requires a large water-filled bottle inside which is a "diver" — a small, rigid tube, open at one end, very similar to an [[Pipette|eyedropper]] with just enough air so that it is nearly [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]], but still buoyant enough that it floats at the top while being almost completely submerged. Two alternative 'divers' can be constructed. One sealed but a flexible bulb, and the other a sealed glass bulb (flashlight minus metal base) with wool threads trailing below. The flexible one will compress reducing volume, and the solid glass one will not change, but air bubbles will be trapped in the fibres, and be exposed to the pressure - thus will change volume.

The "diving" occurs when the flexible part of the larger container is pressed inwards, increasing the pressure inside the larger container, causing the "diver" to sink to the bottom until the pressure is released, when it rises back to the surface. If the container is rigid, as with a glass bottle, the cork sealing the bottle would be pressed inwards or drawn outwards.

{{multiple image

 |image1 = Водолаз обратного действия.webm|thumbtime1 = 5|caption1 = A reverse diver
 |image2  =  W150 V1.webm|caption2  =  A double action Diver
}}
There is just enough [[air]] in the diver to make it positively [[buoyant]]. Therefore, the diver floats at the water's surface. As a result of [[Pascal's law]], squeezing the airtight container increases the pressure of the air, part of which pressure is exerted against the water that constitutes one "wall" of the airtight container.  This water in turn exerts additional pressure on the air bubble inside the diver; because the air inside the diver is compressible but the water is an incompressible fluid, the air's volume is decreased but the water's volume does not expand, such that the pressure external to the diver ''a'') forces the water already in the diver further inward and ''b'') drives water from outside the diver into the diver.  Once the air bubble becomes smaller and more water enters the diver, the diver [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] a weight of water that is less than its own weight, so it becomes negatively buoyant and sinks in accordance with [[Archimedes’ principle]]. When the pressure on the container is released, the air expands again, increasing the weight of water displaced and the diver again becomes  positively buoyant and floats.

{{multiple image

 |image1  =  Cartesian devil hg.jpg|caption1 = Hand blown glass toy from [[Lauscha]], [[Thuringian Forest]]
 |image2  = Tanzteufel – пляшущий чертик.webm|caption2 = In the bottle
}}
It might be thought that if the weight of displaced water exactly matched the weight of the diver, it would neither rise nor sink, but float in the middle of the container, however, this does not occur in practice.  Assuming such a state were to exist at some point, any departure of the diver from its current depth, however small, will alter the pressure exerted on the bubble in the diver due to the change in the weight of the water above it in the vessel.  It is an unstable [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If the diver rises, by even the most minuscule amount, the pressure on the bubble will decrease, it will expand, it will displace more water, and the diver will become more positively buoyant, rising still more quickly.  Conversely, should the diver drop by the smallest amount, the pressure will increase, the bubble contract, additional water enter, the diver will become less buoyant, and the rate of the drop will accelerate as the pressure from the water rises still further.  This positive reinforcement will amplify any departure from equilibrium, even that due to random thermal fluctuations in the system.  A range of constant applied pressures exists that will allow the diver either to float at the surface, or sink to the bottom, but to have it float within the body of the liquid for an extended period would require continuous manipulation of the applied pressure.

Divers inside an oval plastic bottle acquire new interesting properties. Indeed, an oval bottle can increase in volume when it is compressed, and if this happens, the drowned diver can ascend.

==Other uses==

In addition, the principle is used to make small toys often called "water dancers" or "water devils". The principle is the same, but the eyedropper is instead replaced with a decorative object with the same properties which is a tube of near-neutral buoyancy, for example, a [[glassblowing|blown-glass]] bubble. If the tail of the glass bubble is given a twist, the flow of the water into and out of the glass bubble creates spin. This causes the toy to spin as it sinks and rises. An example of such a toy is the red "devil" shown here. 
The device also has a practical use for measuring the [[pressure]] of a [[liquid]].

Plastic divers were given away in British cereal boxes as [[cereal box prize|free gifts]] in the 1950s, and "Diving Tony," a version of the toy modeled after [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]] [[Frosted Flakes]] mascot [[Tony the Tiger]], was made available in the 1980s. Another use would be to use as a science class experiment to teach density, buoyancy, and pressure.

'''Casa del Lago''' was instituted in 1959 as the first off-campus [[Cultural Center]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. It is characterized by its extraordinary ability to promote the cultural and generational encounter between the vanguard and tradition.  It was established with [[Juan José Arreola]] as its founding director and is located in the Woods of [[Chapultepec]], a traditional Sunday walk area for the inhabitants of the capital.

In each of the artistic disciplines, that have taken place in this multifaceted enclosure, the originality and experimentation have gathered together and allowed the creators to show how the contemporary is not incompatible with the large popular audience that visit it, turn it into an emblematic place in the cultural scene of the city.

==Activities==

As in the beginning, half a century ago, Casa del Lago, opens its doors to young, national and foreign artists with original and controversial proposals, with a cultural offering where emerging expressions are significant. Intense work is done in the field of visual arts, which provides the necessary means and space for artists of different ages to develop their ideas and their quality curatorial projects. It has also promoted the theatrical work of the younger generation of directors and actors. Dance has brought together the most diverse choreographic styles, all in unconventional spaces.

Alternative and emergent music has been present in diverse groups and soloists playing rock, jazz, tango, flamenco, new song, and new trends of the genres. Chess, driven by Juan José Arreola, is maintained through the various tournaments that are held annually. The Cinema Club has promoted the documentary form in a permanent way through its participation in festivals (Ambulante and DOCSDF) and has opened its spaces to young filmmakers in different film debate cycles. The program of courses and workshops has increased in over 30 disciplines, many with new and critical vision.

It revived, from a contemporary perspective, what initially was known as Poetry Out Loud, just a few years after the inauguration of this university forum in Chapultepec, through a festival that seeks to reclaim this tradition that called thinkers, intellectuals and artist of the time. It links national and international artists of today with prominent poets from different oral traditions, as the “decimistas jarochos”, indigenous poets, and the recent generation of young Mexican artists, from new literary currents, where the new musical technologies are also present, the writing in relation to sound, rhythm and the lyric skills of the artist.

Casa del Lago has multiplied its cultural offers in the same way that the university community and the creators and public communities have increased, keeping alive that “dialogue between history and present as a basis of their identity”, making permanent that spirit of risk, of its vocation in the search for the experimental, emergent and purposeful, becoming an alternative art site, ideal meeting place for young people and for the people, by their tastes and training.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
For example, from 27 August 2009 to 6 September 2009 Caso del Lago staged an exhibition of avante-garde installation art in its grounds featuring ''[[¿Olvida usted algo? – ¡Ojalá!]]'' by artist [[Susana Rodríguez]] and ''Gloria Desierta'' by Emanuel Tovar.&lt;ref name=Granados2009&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
The construction of the building began in 1906, but it was inaugurated as the headquarters of the first Automobile Club in Mexico until April 30, 1908. In 1929, it was home to the Biological Studies Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Development (la Dirección de Estudios Biológicos de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Fomento). University autonomy definitely influenced the fate of Casa del Lago joining it to the National University and housing the new Institute for Biology, until 1959 when it moved to the new facilities created in Ciudad Universitaria (University City). On 10 May 1959 the enclosure opened its doors as a center for the promotion and dissemination of culture, but the official opening took place on September 15 of the same year.

By agreement of the rector Juan Ramón de la Fuente 31 January 2002 it was given the name of its founding director: Juan José Arreola, who turned it into the model of the national cultural centre with deep roots and prestige in Latin America, and where, over the past 50 years, representatives of the artistic vanguard of the country have gathered.

Since 1959, the University has undertaken, with extraordinary energy, the avant-garde, the experimentation and the renewal of many of the anachronistic criteria that had been adapted to culture. A new generation began at Casa del Lago when notorious figures such as José Luis Ibáñez, [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Juan Soriano]], [[Octavio Paz]] and even [[Juan José Arreola]], who along with Miguel Gonzalez Avelar, to name a few, began to promote Poetry Out Loud, Chess Tournaments and the Philatelic Club.

Tomás Segovia, successor of Arreola, poet and essayist, created an extraordinary group of young writers, among whom Juan García Ponce, short story writer, novelist and playwright, stands out; thanks to his essays and notes about visual arts, he examined and promoted artists like: Vicente Rojo, [[Lilia Carrillo]], [[José Luis Cuevas]], Fernando García Ponce, [[Alberto Gironella]] and [[Manuel Felguerez]]; giving also a huge boost to the music of young artists through the program Nueva Música en México (New Music in Mexico), which got together people like Joaquín Gutiérrez Heras, Rocío Sanz and other leading artists and composers.

Other figures that embodied the spirit of Casa del Lago were: Juan Vicente Melo and Juan José Gurrola. Melo dermatologist and music critic replace Segovia and develop a remarkable task: Conference Cycles of literary authors and composers, small exhibitions of the mentioned artists and plays that renewed the scenic work and vanguard music concerts. Juan José Gurrola bright and bold, who began as an actor in Poetry Out Loud, always proposed avant-garde attitudes in his staging. It was an extraordinary period for Casa del Lago, awarded by the Association of Theatre and Music Critics for giving room to the artistic compositions of the twentieth century, positioning itself as one of the most renowned cultural centers in the capital of the country.

In 1982 the group called Los Estridentistas attracted public attention due to the confusion created by an exhibition about this literary group of the 20s. The exhibition at the time was the appropriate framework to exhibit the work of 80 sculptors as part of the meeting of sculptors, where they discussed issues related to sculpture and other disciplines.

Casa del Lago also gave shelter to the artists called “the rupture generation” when in 1989 they made an important exhibition in which works that once were rejected by commercial galleries were included. The Documentary Cinema Club gained special significance as a unique space of its kind in the capital.

The evening walks along the Bosque de Chapultepec (Woods of Chapultepec), with the collaboration of the Directorate of the Forest, since 1999 to date, has been a project that the university community and the population have received with great interest, since it has contributed to the rescue of the historical and artistic values of the largest urban park in Latin America.

Promotion of culture by nature, Casa del Lago has always been the ideal platform for experimentation in arts and to encourage the new generation of creators.

==Location==
It is located in the heart of the Woods of Chapultepec, where significant work in the diffusion of culture has been done in the last fifty years. It is an emblematic space of Mexico City, where the representatives of the country's cultural vanguard have gathered and which endorses the mission of promoting culture as essential in the integral formation of young university students and the large audience who visit it.

It has developed an intense program of activities including expositions, rock concerts and alternative music, conferences, courses and workshops, Festival of Poetry Out Loud and everything related to emerging and experimental arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5241">In [[Chile]], ''universidades tradicionales'' ("traditional universities") is the group of universities founded before the 1980s.  It usually includes universities derived from traditional ones.  A more precise term is ''Universidades del Consejo de Rectores'' (Universities of the Rectors' Council).

== Overview ==
{{Tone|date=November 2008}}
It is not a very specific term since it reflects only the history of a given university and is not a valid description of the university itself or of the way that university is organized. For example, even though the Universidad Católica refers to itself as a "traditional university", it is more correctly described as a "private Catholic university" (e.g., the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Leuven]]), as the government, and the people in extension, do not intervene in the governance of the university.

This distinction (which is not found in most countries) was needed because the [[Pinochet regime]] changed the higher education system, effectively dismembering public universities (like the Universidad de Chile or the Universidad Técnica del Estado) and Catholic universities. This decision, which can be seen as a punitive action against highly "unstable" institutions, or as a mean for better control, also included the opening of the education market, effectively allowing any private citizen to establish a higher education institution.  Several small private universities arose after this, most of them directly linked to the dictatorship government members.

These "traditional" universities receive state financial support through many means—even though many of these universities are not public—receiving as they do most of the better students and making most of the research undertaken by Chilean universities.

== Current division or classification of traditional universities in Chile ==
These universities can be divided into two groups:

*Properly traditional universities, the eight universities existing in 1981: [[Universidad de Chile]], [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]], [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso]], [[Universidad Austral de Chile]], [[Universidad Católica del Norte]], [[Universidad de Concepción]], [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile]] (formerly Universidad Técnica del Estado) and [[Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María]].
* Derivative universities: universities formed by separating a faculty or campus from a traditional one or by merging two campuses, one belonging to Universidad de Chile and the other, to Universidad Técnica del Estado.  For example, what now is the [[Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación]] in 1981 was the Education Faculty of the University of Chile; the present-day [[Universidad de La Frontera]] in 1981 was the University of Chile, [[Temuco]] Campus, and the Technical University of the State, Temuco Campus; and the present [[Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción]] in 1991 was the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]], [[Talcahuano]] campus.  The [[Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana]] (known by its acronym, UTEM) was founded on August 30, 1993.

Currently, there are three types of universities, classified according to characteristics:
* State-owned universities (''universidades estatales''). These are the [[Universidad de Chile (university)|Universidad de Chile]], [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile]] and derivative universities, most of which were created in the 1980s from the regional campuses of the former two.
* Universities of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. Similarly to the regional ''estatales'', some of these were created from the regional campuses of the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]] in the 1970s, while others originated earlier as stand-alone universities.
* Three private universities, owned by non-profit foundations. These are the [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] and the [[Universidad de Concepción]] founded by the citizens respectively of [[Valdivia]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], and the [[Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María]], created, originally in Valparaíso, by the last will and testament of [[Federico Santa María|Federico Santa María Carrera]].

Twenty-five traditional universities are today grouped in the ''Consejo de Rectores'' (Rectors' Council).  Since the 1970s, these universities have managed a common higher education admissions test known as the ''Prueba de Aptitud Académica'' ("scholastic-aptitude test") and, since 2003, as the ''Prueba de Selección Universitaria'' (PSU, "university-selection test").  Some of the more academically accomplished and/or ambitious new private universities, dating from the 1980s and chiefly set up by political groupings, Catholic sects or entrepreneurs, subscribe to PSU for all undergraduate admissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10181">The '''Circle of Courage''' is a model of youth development based on the principles of belonging, mastery, independence and generosity&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/cardev/gr9_found/courage_poster.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  The model integrates child development practices of [[tribal]] peoples and the findings of modern youth development research.

== History ==
The Circle of Courage model portrays four growth needs of all children: Belonging, Mastery, Independence, and Generosity. This philosophy emerged from collaboration of [[Martin Brokenleg]], a professor of [[Native American Studies]], and [[Larry Brendtro]], a professor in children's behavior disorders. They studied how traditional [[indigenous cultures]] reared children without resorting to coercive discipline. The Circle of Courage is illustrated as a [[medicine wheel]] with four directions.

In 1990, the Circle of Courage was outlined in the publication ''Reclaiming Youth at Risk'' by [[Larry Brendtro]], Martin Brokenleg, and Steve Van Bockern who were then colleagues at [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]].

The model was adopted to youth services in [[South Africa]] during the administration of [[Nelson Mandela]] under the leadership of Minister Geraldine Moloketi and Lesley du Toit. This led in 2005 to the Response Ability Pathways (RAP) curriculum which provides training on applying the Circle of Courage to all who work with youth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circleofcourageinstitute.org/content/our-history, retrieved July 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Circle of Courage provides the philosophical foundation for the work of Reclaiming Youth International (RYI), a 501(c)(3) non-profit company dedicated to helping adults better serve children and youth who are in emotional pain from conflict in the family, school, community, peer groups or with self.

The '''conscience clause''' was an important term in [[education]] in [[England]] throughout much of 19th century. In this context, it referred to permitting parents of schoolchildren to withdraw them from [[Church of England]] worship services or other school activities that violated the parents' religious principles.

'''Cultural imperialism''' comprises the [[Culture|cultural]] aspects of [[imperialism]]. Imperialism here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between [[civilization]]s, favoring the more powerful civilization. Thus, cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture, usually that of a politically powerful [[nation]], over a less powerful society; in other words, the [[cultural hegemony]] of [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] or [[Developed country|economically influential countries]] which determine general cultural values and standardize civilizations throughout the world. The term is employed especially in the fields of history, [[cultural studies]], and [[postcolonial theory]]. It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. Cultural imperialism can take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action, insofar as it reinforces cultural hegemony.

==Background and definitions==
Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a 1921 reference to the "cultural imperialism of the Russians",&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', within "cultural"&lt;/ref&gt; John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0CFMS0z5-gcC&amp;dq=cultural+imperialism&amp;q=%221960s+and+has%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%221960s%20and%20has%22&amp;f=false Tomlinson (1991)], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, (2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "[[media imperialism]]", "structural imperialism", "cultural dependency and domination",  "cultural synchronization", "[[electronic colonialism]]", "ideological imperialism", and "[[economic imperialism]]" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

Various academics give various definitions of the term. American [[media critic]] [[Herbert Schiller]] wrote: "The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting."&lt;ref name="Schiller 76"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiller|first=Herbert I.|title=Communication and cultural domination|publisher=International Arts and Sciences Press, 901 North Broadway, White Plains, New York 10603 |year=1976|pages=9–10|isbn=978-0-87332-079-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom McPhail]] defined "Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that vicariously establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes."&lt;ref name="McPhail"&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhail|first=Thomas L.|title=Electronic colonialism: the future of international broadcasting and communication|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1987|series=Volume 126 of Sage library of social research|page=18|isbn=978-0-8039-2730-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sui-Nam Lee observed that "communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture."&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee |first=Siu-Nam Lee |year=1988|title=Communication imperialism and dependency: A conceptual clarification|journal=International Communication Gazette|publisher=Kiuwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|issue= 41|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ogan saw "media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home."&lt;ref name="Ogan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogan|first=Christine|date=Spring 1988|title=Media Imperialism and the Videocassette Recorder: The Case of Turkey|journal=Journal of Communication|volume= 38|issue= 2|page=94|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1988.tb02049.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: "Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of [[colonialism]], (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downing,|first=John|author2=Ali Mohammadi |author3=Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi |title=Questioning the media: a critical introduction|publisher=SAGE|year=1995|edition=2, illustrated|page=482|isbn=978-0-8039-7197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Needless to say, all these authors agree that cultural imperialism promotes the interests of certain circles within the imperial powers, often to the detriment of the target societies.

The issue of cultural imperialism emerged largely from [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="Salwen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen |first=Michael B. |title=Cultural imperialism: A media effects approach  |date=March 1991|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume= 8|issue= 1 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1080/15295039109366778}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural imperialism has been used as a framework by scholars to explain phenomena in the areas of [[international relations]], [[anthropology]], education, science, history, literature, and sports.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

==Theoretical foundations==
Many of today's academics that employ the term, ''cultural imperialism,'' are heavily informed by the work of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Edward Said|Said]], and other [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] and postcolonialist theorists.&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Livingston A. "Reconsidering Cultural Imperialism Theory" ''Transnational Broadcasting Studies'' no.6 Spring/Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the realm of postcolonial discourse, ''cultural imperialism'' can be seen as the cultural legacy of colonialism, or forms of social action contributing to the continuation of Western [[hegemony]]. To some outside of the realm of this discourse, the term is critiqued as being unclear, unfocused, and/or contradictory in nature.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

===Michel Foucault===
The work of French philosopher and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]] has heavily influenced use of the term ''cultural imperialism,'' particularly his philosophical interpretation of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and his concept of [[governmentality]].

Following an interpretation of power similar to that of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], Foucault defines power as immaterial, as a "certain type of relation between individuals" that has to do with complex strategic social positions that relate to the subject's ability to control its environment and influence those around itself.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1979. "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of [[truth]]. "Truth", as he defines it, is a "system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements" which has a "circular relation" with systems of power.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1979. "Truth and Power" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always "truth", which is culturally specific, inseparable from [[ideology]] which often coincides with various forms of [[hegemony]]. ''Cultural imperialism'' may be an example of this.

Foucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure.  In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of "governing", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing "a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1978. "Governmentality" in  Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; This relates directly back to Machiavelli's [[The Prince]], and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of [[truth]] and [[Power (philosophy)|power]]. (i.e. various [[Subjectivity|subjectivities]] are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as [[neoliberal]] governmentality.)

===Edward Saïd===
Informed by the works of [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault, and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Edward Saïd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a [[Humanism|humanist]] critique of [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]], which criticizes Western knowledge of "The East"—specifically the English and the French [[Social construct|constructions]] of what is and what is not "Oriental".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Young, ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/said08052003.html Orientalism 25 Years Later, by Said in 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orientalism"&gt;Saïd, Edward. 1978. ''Orientalism.'' New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt; Whereby said "knowledge" then led to cultural tendencies towards a [[binary opposition]] of the Orient vs. the Occident, wherein one concept is defined in opposition to the other concept, and from which they emerge as of unequal value.&lt;ref name="Orientalism" /&gt; In ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993), the sequel to ''Orientalism'', Saïd proposes that, despite the formal end of the “age of empire” after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), colonial imperialism left a cultural legacy to the (previously) colonized peoples, which remains in their contemporary civilizations; and that said ''cultural imperialism'' is very influential in the international systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward. 1993. ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak===

A self-described "practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LAHIRI|first=BULAN|title=Speaking to Spivak|url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2011/02/06/stories/2011020650020100.htm|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2011-02-06|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] has published a number of works challenging the "legacy of colonialism" including ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present'' (1999), ''Other Asias'' (2005), and "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988).&lt;ref name=speak&gt;[http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf  Spivak, Gayatri Chakravorty. 1988. "Can the Subaltern Speak"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105154619/http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf |date=5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Can the Subaltern Speak?" Spivak critiques common representations in the West of the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], as being controlled by authors other than the participants (specifically English colonizers and Hindu leaders). Because of this, Spivak argues that the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]], referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;

Throughout "Can the Subaltern Speak?", Spivak cites the works of Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Edward Said, among others.

In ''A critique of Postcolonial Reason'', Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.

==Contemporary ideas and debate==
''Cultural imperialism'' can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will.  Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.

Cultural influence can be seen by the "receiving" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its [[cultural identity]]. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.

The imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as [[consumerism]]). According to one argument, the "receiving" [[culture]] does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as "''banal imperialism''." For example, it is argued that while "American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers", "cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy", a process which "may sound appealing" but which "masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations |year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|page=31|edition=2nd|author2=Cynthia King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology.  This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called "[[soft power]]". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from [[Viacom]], [[Time-Warner]], [[Disney]], [[News Corp]], to [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.

===Cultural diversity===
One of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of [[cultural diversity]], a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of [[biodiversity|ecological diversity]].  Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.

===Ideas relating to African colonization===
Of all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive "age of imperialism" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonization in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]], particularly through neocolonization of public education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monga, C. 1996.

Abdi]], claims that imperialism inherently "involve[s] extensively interactive regimes and heavy contexts of identity deformation, misrecognition, loss of self-esteem, and  individual and social doubt in self-efficacy."(2000: 12)&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; Therefore, all imperialism would always, already be cultural.

===Ties to neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] is often critiqued by sociologists, anthropologists, and cultural studies scholars as being culturally imperialistic. Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism.&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; Other Scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that [[neoliberalism]] requires and creates its own form of [[governmentality]].&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Elizabeth C. 2004. ''Privatizing Poland: Baby Food, Big Business, and the Remaking of Labor'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elyachar&gt;Elyachar, Julia. 2005. ''Markets of Dispossession: NGOs, Economic Development, and the State in Cairo'' US: Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dunn's work, ''Privatizing Poland'', she argues that the expansion of the [[multinational corporation]], Gerber, into Poland in the 1990s imposed Western, neoliberal [[governmentality]], [[Ideology|ideologies]], and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] upon the post-soviet persons hired.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt; Cultural conflicts occurred most notably the company's inherent [[Individualism|individualistic]] policies, such as promoting competition among workers rather than cooperation, and in its strong opposition to what the company owners claimed was [[bribery]].&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

In Elyachar's work, ''Markets of Dispossession'', she focuses on ways in which, in [[Cairo]], [[NGO]]s along with [[International nongovernmental organization|INGO]]s and the state promoted neoliberal [[governmentality]] through schemas of economic development that relied upon "youth microentrepreneurs."&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt; Youth microentrepreneurs would receive small loans to build their own businesses, similar to the way that [[microfinance]] supposedly operates.&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt; Elyachar argues though, that these programs not only were a failure, but that they shifted cultural opinions of [[value (personal and cultural)]] in a way that favored Western ways of thinking and being.&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt;

===Ties to development studies===
Often, methods of promoting development and social justice to  are critiqued as being imperialistic, in a cultural sense. For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western [[feminism]], claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the "third world woman" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance.&lt;ref name=Mohanty&gt;Mohanty, Chandra. 1988. "Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses" ''Feminist Review'' no. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the "white man" saving the "brown woman" from the "brown man." Other, more radical critiques of [[development studies]], have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to "develop" the [[Global South]] were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dossa | first1 = Shiraz | year = 2007 | title = Slicing Up 'Development': Colonialism, political theory, ethics | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 887–899 | doi=10.1080/01436590701371595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties to media effects studies===
The core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book ''Critical Studies in Mass Communication'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Salwen, Michael B. 1991. "Cultural Imperialism: A Media Effects Approach." Critical Studies In Mass Communication 8, no. 1: 29. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete, EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt; claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognizes both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. 
The first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, A.s., Tan, G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviors remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the “liberation” of women with exposure to Western media&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Sparkes, V. (1977). TV across the Canadian border: Does it matter? Journal of Communication,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of "cultural imperialism theory"===
Critics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. ''Cultural imperialism'' is a term that is only used in discussions where [[cultural relativism]] and [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, ''cultural imperialism'' on those terms.

John Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book ''Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction'', he delves into the much debated “[[media imperialism]]” theory. Summarizing research on the Third World’s reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J. and Boli, John (2009). ''The Globalization Reader'' (4th ed), Wiley-Blackwell. p.341&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticizing the concept that [[Americanization]] is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.

Other major critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that ''cultural imperialism'' is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of [[colonialism]] is not always true.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

===Rothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance===
[[David Rothkopf]], managing director of [[Kissinger Associates]] and an adjunct professor of [[international relations|international affairs]] at [[Columbia University]] (who also served as a senior [[US Commerce Department]] official in the [[Clinton Administration]]), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled ''In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?'' in the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace "cultural imperialism" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the [[English language]] and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that [[globalization]] and the [[Internet]] are accelerating the process of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=rothkopf&gt;Rothkopf, David, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm "In Praise of Cultural Imperialism"], ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1997, Volume 107, pp. 38–53; all descriptions of Rothkopf's points and his quotes are from this article {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117105019/http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm |date=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture is sometimes used by the organizers of society—politicians, theologians, academics, and families—to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's [[genocide]]s. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.

Rothkopf then cites genocide and [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]s in [[Armenia]], Russia, the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Cambodia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Rwanda]] and [[East Timor]] as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of "political culture" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the [[Inquisition]], ''"and during the expansion of virtually every [[empire]]."''.The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:

:Successful multicultural societies, be they nations, federations, or other conglomerations of closely interrelated states, discern those aspects of culture that do not threaten union, stability, or prosperity (such as food, holidays, rituals, and music) and allow them to flourish. But they counteract or eradicate the more subversive elements of culture (exclusionary aspects of religion, language, and political/ideological beliefs). History shows that bridging cultural gaps successfully and serving as a home to diverse peoples requires certain social structures, laws, and institutions that transcend culture. Furthermore, the history of a number of ongoing experiments in [[multiculturalism]], such as in the European Union, India, South Africa, Canada and the United States, suggests that workable, if not perfected, integrative models exist. Each is built on the idea that tolerance is crucial to social well-being, and each at times has been threatened by both intolerance and a heightened emphasis on cultural distinctions. The greater public good warrants eliminating those cultural characteristics that promote conflict or prevent harmony, even as less-divisive, more personally observed cultural distinctions are celebrated and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = Patrick. | last2 = Mehlinger | first2 = Howard D. | last3 = Krain | first3 = Matthew. | title = Globalization and the challenges of a new century : a reader | year = 2000 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Ind. | isbn = 978-0-253-21355-6 | pages = 445–446 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;dq=Globalization+and+the+challenges&amp;q=445+chinese#v=snippet&amp;q=445%20chinese&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people. The British settlers tried to biologically alter the skin colour of the Australian Aboriginal people through mixed breeding with white people. The policy also made attempts to forcefully conform the Aborigines to western ideas of dress and education.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Caruso, Australian Feminist Studies, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==
Although the term was popularized in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.

===Ancient Rome===
The [[Roman Empire]] has been seen as an early example of cultural imperialism.

Early Rome, in its conquest of Italy, assimilated the people of [[Etruria]] by replacing the [[Etruscan language]] with Latin, which led to the demise of that language and many aspects of [[Etruscan civilization]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Kolb, RW., [https://books.google.com/books?id=v751AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT607&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M-meVaXiFKe27Abz8K7QCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20rome&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of Business Ethics and Society''], SAGE Publications, 2007, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] was imposed on many parts of Rome's empire by "many regions receiving Roman culture unwillingly, as a form of cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Ermatinger, JW., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdBEHD4XQ-0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p-ieVZusJKnD7gbzloLQBQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20rome&amp;f=false ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Greece was conquered by the Roman armies, Rome set about altering the culture of Greece to conform with Roman ideals. For instance, the Greek habit of stripping naked, in public, for exercise, was looked on askance by Roman writers, who considered the practice to be a cause of the Greeks' effeminacy and enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=rbwCTL507fsC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p-ieVZusJKnD7gbzloLQBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=naked%20plutarch%20open%20air&amp;f=false ''Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire''], Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 2 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman example has been linked to modern instances of European imperialism in African countries, bridging the two instances with Slavoj Zizek's discussions of 'empty signifiers'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pax Romana]] was secured in the empire, in part, by the "forced acculturation of the culturally diverse populations that Rome had conquered."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

===British Empire===
British worldwide expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries was an economic and political phenomenon. However, "there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which [[Rudyard Kipling]] termed the '[[white man's burden]]'." One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the [[London Missionary Society]], which was "an agent of British cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, JS.; Shadle, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VnzMelzm8C&amp;pg=PA682&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5o6fVaTwEump7Ab4r4PoCQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20british%20empire%20-sport&amp;f=false ''Historical Dictionary of the British Empire, Volume 2''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p. 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an "imperial curriculum". Morag Bell writes, "The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=sGa7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+curriculum#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20curriculum&amp;f=false ''Geography and Imperialism, 1820-1940''], Manchester University Press, 1995, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that "Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis."&lt;ref&gt;Peers, DM.; Gooptu, N., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTYfAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+science#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20science&amp;f=false ''India and the British Empire''], OUP Oxford, 2012. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of cultural imperialism carried out by Edward Said drew principally from a study of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbgNECex-mkC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''The Debate on the Rise of British Imperialism''], Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Danilo Raponi, the cultural imperialism of the British in the 19th century had a much wider effect than only in the British Empire. He writes, "To paraphrase Said, I see cultural imperialism as a complex cultural hegemony of a country, Great Britain, that in the 19th century had no rivals in terms of its ability to project its power across the world and to influence the cultural, political and commercial affairs of most countries. It is the 'cultural hegemony' of a country whose power to export the most fundamental ideas and concepts at the basis of its understanding of 'civilisation' knew practically no bounds." In this, for example, Raponi includes Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Raponi, D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=gw5HBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+manifest#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20manifest&amp;f=false ''Religion and Politics in the Risorgimento: Britain and the New Italy, 1861-1875''], Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other pre-Second World War examples===
The [[New Cambridge Modern History]] writes about the cultural imperialism of [[Napoleonic France]]. Napoleon used the [[Institut de France]] "as an instrument for transmuting French universalism into cultural imperialism." Members of the Institute (who included Napoleon), descended upon Egypt in 1798. "Upon arrival they organised themselves into an Institute of Cairo. The Rosetta Stone is their most famous find. The science of Egyptology is their legacy."&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, CW. (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mfV7qQ_oiVEC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+nazi+war&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+egypt+126#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20egypt%20126&amp;f=false ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 9, War and Peace in an Age of Upheaval, 1793-1830'']. Cambridge University Press, 1965, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First World War]], Germans were worried about the extent of French influence in the annexed [[Rhineland]], with the French [[occupation of the Ruhr]] Valley in 1923. An early use of the term appeared in an essay by Paul Ruhlmann (as "Peter Hartmann") at that date, entitled ''French Cultural Imperialism on the Rhine''.&lt;ref&gt;Poley, J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=q__sRFdeKeIC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+french&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+french+rhine+1923#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20french%20rhine%201923&amp;f=false ''Decolonisation in Germany: Weimar Narratives of Colonial Loss and Foreign Occupation''], Peter Lang, 2007, pp. 165 &amp; 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi colonialism===
''Cultural imperialism'' has also been used in connection with the expansion of German influence under the [[Nazis]] in the middle of the twentieth century. Alan Steinweis and Daniel Rogers note that even before the Nazis came to power, "Already in the Weimar Republic, German academic specialists on eastern Europe had contributed through their publications and teaching to the legitimization of German territorial [[revanchism]] and cultural imperialism. These scholars operated primarily in the disciplines Of history, economics, geography, and literature."&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, AE; Rogers, DE., [https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ7igJKC6YQC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgKahUKEwj5n8CUo9_GAhUDPhQKHYxuAHk#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''The Impact of Nazism: New Perspectives on the Third Reich and Its Legacy']', U of Nebraska Press, 2003, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of music, Michael Kater writes that during the WWII German occupation of France, [[Hans Rosbaud]], a German conductor based by the Nazi regime in [[Strasbourg]], became "at least nominally, a servant of Nazi cultural imperialism directed against the French."&lt;ref&gt;Kater, MH., [https://books.google.com/books?id=JGSDC5w-pfMC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwj5n8CUo9_GAhUDPhQKHYxuAHk#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Composers of the Nazi Era: Eight Portraits''], Oxford University Press, USA, 1999, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy during the war, Germany pursued "a European cultural front that gravitates around German culture". The Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] set up the European Union of Writers, "one of Goebbels's most ambitious projects for Nazi cultural hegemony. Presumably a means of gathering authors from Germany, Italy, and the occupied countries to plan the literary life of the new Europe, the union soon emerged as a vehicle of German cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ghiat, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=MBFe5v2ZTy4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBWoVChMI6_-fgarfxgIVAVYUCh3gCgAb#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945''], University of California Press, 2001, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

For other parts of Europe, [[Robert Gerwarth]], writing about cultural imperialism and [[Reinhard Heydrich]], states that the "Nazis' Germanization project was based on a historically unprecedented programme of racial stock-taking, theft, expulsion and murder." Also, "The full integration of the [Czech] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]] into this New Order required the complete Germanization of the Protectorate's cultural life and the eradication of indigenous Czech and Jewish culture."&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yUz33XJnJOMC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgoahUKEwjr3IjAsd_GAhVKOhQKHdsQC1E#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich''], Yale University Press, 2011, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions by [[Nazi Germany]] reflect on the notion of race and culture playing a significant role in imperialism. The idea that there is a distinction between the Germans and the Jews has created the illusion of Germans believing they were superior to the Jewish inferiors, the notion of us/them and self/others.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek, Johnston, Ron, and Pratt, Geraldine, eds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5586">'''Desmond Doyle''' (16 January 1932 – July 1991) was a South African ballet dancer who performed in England in the 1950s and 1960s before becoming ballet master of [[The Royal Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, "Doyle, Desmond," in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance'' (Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and training==
Desmond Doyle was born in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. [[Dulcie Howes]] (1908-1993), a ballet dancer, choreographer and teacher, established the University of Cape Town Ballet School in 1934. Among her most promising students during the 1940s were [[Johaar Mosaval]] and Doyle.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Glasstone, ''Dulcie Howes: Pioneer of Ballet in South Africa'' (Cape Town: Human &amp; Rousseau, 1996), pp. 54, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; After some years' study with her, and performing under her direction in the University of Cape Town Ballet, both of them went to London to continue their training at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School.

==Professional career==
In 1951, Doyle was accepted into the Sadler's Wells Ballet, under the direction of [[Ninette de Valois]], and was promoted to soloist in 1953. During his years with the company, renamed the [[Royal Ballet]] in 1956, he created roles in a number of new ballets by [[Frederick Ashton]], [[Kenneth MacMillan]], and [[John Cranko]]. MacMillan often cast him in "cruel, overbearing roles because of his height and narrow face, as lethal as a knife blade."&lt;ref&gt;Jann Parry, ''Different Drummer: The Life of Kenneth MacMillan'' (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 2010), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not always villainous, however. He danced many roles in classical and romantic works already in the active repertory, including ''Les Sylphides, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, Coppélia,'' and ''Sylvia'', and took prominent roles in such important ballets as de Valois's ''The Rake's Progress'', Ashton's 'Symphonic Variations'', and Alfred Rodrigues's ''The Miraculous Mandarin''. Upon his retirement, he served as the company's [[ballet master]] from 1970 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Zoë Anderson, ''The Royal Ballet: 75 Years'' (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles created==
Among the ballets in which Doyle created roles are the following.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Koegler, "Doyle, Desmond," in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet'', 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1947. ''Les Diversions'', choreography by Dulcie Howes, music by Giaochino Rossini, arranged by Benjamin Britten.
* 1951. ''Daphnis and Chloë'', choreography by Frederick Ashton, music by Maurnce Ravel.
* 1953. ''The Shadow'', choreography by John Cranko, music by Ernõ Dohnányi.
* 1953. ''Veneziana'', choreography by Andrée Howard, music by Gaetano Donizaetti, arranged by Denis Aplver.
* 1955. ''Madame Chrysanthème'', choreography by Frederick Ashton, music by Alan Rawsthorne. Role: Yves, brother of Pierre, danced by Alexander Grant, with [[Elaine Fifield]] in the title role.
* 1955. ''The Lady and the Fool'', choreography by John Cranko, music by Giuseppe Verdi, arranged by Charles Mackerras. Role: Signor Midas.
* 1956. ''Noctambules'', choreography by Kenneth MacMillan, music by Humphrey Searle. Role: The Rich Man, with Leslie Edwards as the Hypnotist, Nadia Nerina as the Faded Beauty, Anya Linden as the Poor Girl, Brian Shaw as the Soldier, and Maryon Lane as the Hypnotist's Assistant.
* 1956. ''Birthday Offering'', choreography by Frederick Ashton, music by Alexander Glazunov, arranged by Robert Irving. Role: principal dancer.
* 1960. ''The Invitation'', choreography by Kenneth MacMillan, music by Mátyás Seiber. Role: Older Man, who rapes the Girl, danced by Lynn Seymour.
* 1960. ''Sweeney Todd'', choreography by John Cranko, music by Malcolm Arnold. Role: Mark Ingestre, the hero who destroys the "demon barber" in the end.
* 1963. ''Symphony'', choreography by Kenneth MacMillan, music by Dmitri Shostakovich. Role: dancer in one of the two lead couples, with Georgina Parkinson.
* 1965. ''Romeo and Juliet'', choreography by Kenneth MacMillan, music by Sergei Prokofiev. Role: Tybalt.
* 1968. ''Jazz Calendar'', choreography by Frederick Ashton, music by Richard Rodney Bennett. Role: Saturday, with Michael Coleman, Wayne Sleep, and others.
* 1968. ''Enigma Variations (My Friends Pictured Within)'', choreography by Frederick Ashton, music by Edward Elgar. Role: A.J. Jaeger (Nimrod), an Anglo-German music publisher and close friend. Elgar called him Nimrod, described in the Old Testament as "a mighty hunter," because ''jäger'' is German for "hunter." The variation recalls a summer's evening stroll while Jaeger and Elgar (Derek Rencher) discuss Beethoven's music before being joined by Alice Elgar (Svetlana Beriosova). Ashton's deceptively simple choreography is based on walking, which has caused the variation to be known as "the walking trio." It wonderfully evokes the meaning of affection and friendship.

==Personal and later life==
Doyle married fellow dancer Brenda Taylor. They had two children, Philip and Anthony, and five grandchildren who live in Brazil. He died in the seacoast municipality of Maricá, Brazil, in 1991, at the age of fifty-nine. His reason for being in Maricá, a small city about forty miles north of Rio de Janeiro, is not known. If he had traveled from Cape Town, directly across the South Atlantic from Brazil, he had possibly gone there in search of work.

'''Educational games''' are [[game]]s explicitly designed with [[educational]] purposes, or which have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are [[game]]s that are designed to help people to learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and [[video game]]s.
An educational game is a game designed to teach humans about a specific subject and to teach them a skill. As educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits of gaming have on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teach us goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy our fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.

==Video games==
{{main|Educational video game|Video games in education}}
With the increase and availability of technological devices, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional [[board game]]s. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as "a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context".&lt;ref&gt;p. 991&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of such play spaces is to have the "gamer" engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates "empathetic embodiment" which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barab|first1=S. A.|last2=Scott|first2=B.|last3=Siyahhan|first3=S.|last4=Goldstone|first4=R.|last5=Ingram-Goble|first5=A.|last6=Zuiker|first6=S. J.|last7=Warren|first7=S.|title=Transformational Play as a Curricular Scaffold: Using Videogames to Support Science Education|journal=Journal of Science Education and Technology|date=2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=305–320|doi=10.1007/s10956-009-9171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game-based learning==
Game-based learning (GBL) is a type of [[game play]] that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game-based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain, and apply said subject matter to the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edtechreview.in/dictionary/298-what-is-game-based-learning|title=What is GBL (Game-Based Learning)?|last=Team|first=Editorial|work=EdTechReview|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to spend hours playing hide and seek, learning the steps of digital games, such as chess, and engaging in creative games. Therefore, it can be said that play and learning are synonymous, leading to cognitive and emotional development inside a social and cultural context. For instance, the game of hide and seek. Good hiders need visual and spatial perspective to define the best hiding places, while seekers must be skilled at searching for cues from the surroundings and choosing the most probable location for the hider among various possible places. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512000139?via%3Dihub|title= Building virtual cities, inspiring intelligent citizens: Digital games for developing students’ problem solving and learning motivation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Systematic review|systematic review]] investigated the effects of educational games for mental health students:

==Origins==
In his classical essay, "Upon the Aesthetic Education of Man", [[Friedrich Schiller]] discusses play as a force of civilization, which helps humans rise above their instincts and become members of enlightened communities. He states that "humans are only fully human when they play". While the text is limited by the author's beliefs in concepts such as freedom and beauty, it nevertheless sets the stage for [[Johan Huizinga]]'s classical study, ''[[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]]''.

Games have long been employed as a means of education. Using the ancient game of chess, noblemen of the Middle Ages learned strategies of war. During the Civil War, volunteers from Rhode Island played [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|American Kriegsspiel]], which had originally been created in 1812 for training Prussian officers-of-war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instituteofplay.org/about/context/history-of-games-learning/ | title=Institute of Play, History of Games &amp; Learning |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the early 19th century, came the creation of Kindergarten by [[Friedrich Fröbel]], which was based on learning through play. Children delighted in his [[Fröbel Gifts]], simple educational toys such as blocks, sewing kits, clay, and weaving materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.eduxtive.com/news/historical-perspectives-on-games-and-education | title=Historical Perspectives on Games and Education |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===

According to Richard N. Van Eck, there are three main approaches to creating software that stimulates cognitive growth in the gamer. These three approaches are: building games from scratch created by educators and programmers; integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS); and creating games from scratch by the students. The most time- and cost-effective approach to designing these educational games is to incorporate COTS games into the classroom with the understanding of the [[learning]] outcomes the instructor has for the course.&lt;ref&gt;Van Eck, R. (2006). Digital game-based learning: It’s not just the digital natives who are restless… Educase Review, 41,2, 1-16.
&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the teacher to buy into the positive results of using digital games for education. It also requires teachers to have adequate self-efficacy concerning the use of these games and their technology. The students usually have high amounts of self-efficacy in usage of digital games, while the lack of confidence teachers have in incorporating the digital games usually results in less effective educational use of the games. However, Gerber and Price (2013) have found that teachers' inexperience with digital games does not preclude them from the desire to incorporate them in class instruction, but districts must have in place support through regular professional development, supportive learning communities with their colleagues, and adequate financial support to implement game-based learning in their class instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, H. R. &amp; Price, D. P.

Games often have a [[fantasy]] element that engages players in a learning activity through [[narrative]] or storylines. [[Educational video game]]s can motivate children and allow them to develop an awareness of consequentiality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inkido.indiana.edu/research/onlinemanu/papers/QA_ETRD.pdf "Making Learning Fun: Quest Atlantis, A Game Without Guns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930214854/http://inkido.indiana.edu/research/onlinemanu/papers/QA_ETRD.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}  by Barab, Thomas, Dodge, Carteaux, Tuzun&lt;/ref&gt; Children are allowed to express themselves as individuals while learning and engaging in social issues. Today's games are more [[social action|social]], with most teens playing games with others at least some of the time and can incorporate many aspects of civic and political life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf "Teens, Video Games, and Civics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306023013/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }} by Lenhart, Pew Internet Project&lt;/ref&gt; In classrooms, social game-based learning platforms are increasing in popularity, as they purport to enable students to reinforce knowledge and develop social and leadership skills.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The success of game-based learning strategies owes to active participation and interaction being at the center of the experience, and signals that current educational methods are not engaging students enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=C.

The built-in learning process of games is what makes a game enjoyable. The progress a player makes in a game is through learning. It is the process of the human mind grasping and coming to understand a new system. The progress of understanding a new concept through gaming makes an individual feel a sense of reward whether the game is considered entertainment (''[[Call of Duty]]'') or serious (FAA-approved [[flight simulator]]). Well-designed games that motivate players are what make them ideal learning environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Real-world challenges are easier faced within a game containing effective, interactive experiences that actively engage people in the learning process. In a successful game-based learning environment, choosing actions, experiencing consequences, and working toward goals allows players to make mistakes through experimentation in a risk-free environment.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"/&gt; Games have rules and structure and goals that inspire motivation. Games are interactive and provide outcomes and feedback. Most games also have problem solving situations that spark creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shearer, James D. |url=http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=bgsu1303865257 |title=Development of a Digital Game-based Learning Best Practices Checklist |publisher=Etd.ohiolink.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification with the character within the video game is an important factor in the learning potential of the gamer. Some of the electronic games allow the gamer to create an avatar that is designed and “owned” by the gamer. This character is an expression of the human creating the virtual character.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bainbridge|first1=W. S.|title=The Scientific Research Potential of Virtual Worlds|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=317|issue=5837|pages=472–476|doi=10.1126/science.1146930}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has opened a new set of scientific possibilities. The virtual world can be used as a laboratory. The relationships and space within the games can simulate complex societies and relationships without having to truly participate.

Not just for fun, but serious strategies: Using meta-cognitive strategies in game-based learning. Computers and Education, 52, 800-810.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bainbridge, interviews and ethnographic research could be conducted within the reality of the game space.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"/&gt; This could include experiments in social psychology and cognitive science. The fact that game creators and gamers are wanting new experiences within the games, the introduction of “experiments” could increase the level of play and engagement.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"/&gt; There are also some special games for children with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]].

===Application===
Traditionally, technology used in school operates usually to solve problems in a fun way, particularly in mathematics. They usually make up case studies designed to introduce students to certain technologies in an effort to prepare them for a future major assignment that requires the aforementioned technology. They have also been developed to work in the virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | DOI=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00991.x |year=2011 |last1=Falloon |first1=G |title=Using avatars and virtual environments in learning: what do they offer? |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=108–122 |journal=Journal of Educational Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently educational egames have been developed for Higher Education students, combining real-world case studies in a virtual environment for students to have a consistent, 24/7 educational 'virtual' experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | DOI=10.1111/gto.12058 |year=2014 |last1=Pringle |first1=JK |title=Educational egaming: the future for geoscience virtual learners? |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=147–150 |journal=Geology Today|url=http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/837/1/pringle_Ed_gaming_GT.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some public schools implementing [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core Standards]], game-based learning programs are utilized by educators to supplement their teaching programs. According to a recent case study by an ed tech-based nonprofit organization, teachers find some digital learning games help address issues with alignment in Common Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Game-Based Learning + Formative Assessment = A Perfect Pair - Classroom Inc.|url = http://www.classroominc.org/case_study/game-based-learning-formative-assessmenta-perfect-pair/|website = Classroom Inc.|accessdate = 2015-12-21|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, technology and games are expected to be used in simulation environments to simulate real world issues. In the professional sector, such as flight training, simulations are already used in an effort to prepare pilots for training before actually going out into planes. These training sessions are used to replicate real life stresses without the risk factor associated with flying. Simulation-games are used in other professional areas as well; a spy-themed learning game has been used to improve sales skills at [[Avaya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kapp|first1=Karl|title=The Gamification of Learning and Instruction Fieldbook: Ideas into Practice Paperback|date=November 11, 2013|publisher=Pfeiffer|isbn=111867443X|url=http://bobmorris.biz/the-gamification-of-learning-and-instruction-fieldbook-a-book-review-by-bob-morris}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 3D simulation game has been used to train New York City emergency responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gronstedt|first1=Anders|title=The Five Superpowers of the Learning Age|url=http://www.elearningcouncil.com/the-five-superpowers-of-the-learning-age/|website=E-Learning Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before deciding how to use game-based learning, the trainer must first determine what they would like the trainees to learn. A trainer that fails to focus training around a central idea runs the risk of using a game that fails to connect with the learners. To prevent this, tailor the material to the demographic(age group, familiarity, educational pre-text)so that the material is neither too difficult for, nor too familiar to the learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/games/howtogbl.html |title=How To Teach Using Games |publisher=Serc.carleton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gathering ideas from children early in the design process has yielded useful insights into what children want in technology in general or in a specific type of application.&lt;ref name=hindawi&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahci/2008/284056/ | title=Exploring Children's Requirements for Game-Based Learning Environments | last1=Nousiainen | first1=Tuula | last2=Kankaanranta | first2=Marja | date=July 24, 2008 | accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's early involvement in requirements gathering has revealed clues about gender differences in preferences related to technology, children's navigation skills, ways of presenting textual information, application-specific content-related preferences, the variety of elements to be included in user interfaces and their structures, and children's desire to personalize their applications.&lt;ref name=hindawi/&gt; Multiplayer role playing games (MMO’s) provide opportunities for players to improve such skills as, “complex learning, thinking, and social practices”.&lt;ref&gt;Barab, 2009, p. 990&lt;/ref&gt; MMO`s also provide a social network which can favor collaborative gaming and learning and contribute to the formation of teams, communication within a group and help strengthen individual and communal identities.&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer, E, Osterweil, S and Salen, K.

'''eInstruction''' designs, manufactures and markets [[teaching]] and assessment tools. It is based in the United States. eInstruction has offices in [[Denton, Texas]]; [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]; [[Fort Wright, Kentucky]]; and [[Paris, France]].

==History==
eInstruction was founded in 1981 by university computer science professor Dr. Darrell Ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/people/Ward_Darrell_12689614.aspx |title=Darrell Ward - ZoomInfo Business Information |publisher=Zoominfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Dr. Ward and his team pioneered the use of student response systems in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theclickergirls.com/Research-Articles.html |title=Research/Articles |publisher=theclickergirls |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the creation of a hand-held "clicker" system called CPS ([[Classroom Performance System]]). In addition to CPS, and other interactive classroom technologies, eInstruction works with educators providing [[professional development]] and training opportunities across the globe.

==Products==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
eInstruction introduced the first wireless student response system designed to help educators engage and involve students using real-time feedback.

In the 1990s, eInstruction sold an RF response system manufactured by Fleetwood Corporation. During the late 1990s, eInstruction also began to develop its own student response systems that were infared (IR) instead of radio frequency (RF). At that point, only six student response units could be used in a classroom at a time. In 1999, eInstruction modified their IR signal allowing the response system receiver to receive up to 32 student responses. 

In early 2000, eInstruction modified their "Group Link" IR student response system to support up to 32 IR response pads. That same year, the company created an educational consultant (eC) model allowing sales people to create franchises without earning caps.

eInstruction released The CPS Chalkboard tablet in 2003. In 2003, eInstruction partnered with Fleetwood to build a radio frequency (RF) version of their IR student response system for the K–12 marketplace. In 2004, Fleetwood built an RF response system for eInstruction designed specifically for the higher education market.

[[File:EInstruction Hardware Timeline.PNG|thumb|eInstruction Timeline]]

The company was awarded a U.S. patent for its mobile interactive whiteboard in 2005. 

In 2006, eInstruction acquired FS Creations, which developed the Examview test bank. 

eInstruction scquired Interwrite Learning in 2008, which included GTCO Calcomp. GTCO produced tablets with wireless and bluetooth connectivity. In 2009, eInstruction released the MOBI, which had taken two years to develop. The MOBI was the evolution company's mobile interactive whiteboard tablet, originally called the CPS Chalkboard. The DualBoard, released in 2009, allowed multiple students to use the same board simultaneously. That same year, eInstruction released the vClicker mobile addition which allowed for any smart device to be used in interactive activities and assessments.

eInstruction also created the online resource community eI Community, the enterprise-based administrator tool eI Cornerstone Education Suite, and the Insight 360 Formative Instruction System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2012/01/26/einstruction-launches-insight-360-formative-instruction-system.aspx|title=eInstruction Launches Insight 360 Formative Instruction System -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3481">'''Eshref Ademaj'''{{ref label|names|a|}} (1940&amp;ndash;1994) was an [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] mathematician and education activist of [[Kosovo Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity. A professor of the [[University of Pristina (1969-1999)|University of Pristina]], he played a pivotal role in the early restoration of universitarian activity in [[Kosovo]] after the mass dismissals of academicians and ban of Albanian language education by the [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbian]] government of [[Slobodan Milošević]]{{ref label|names|b|}} in the early 1990s. Ademaj was also a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo]].

== Biography ==
Born on July 20, 1940 in the village of [[Zhur]] near [[Prizren]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Ademaj studied mathematical sciences in the [[University of Belgrade]]. In the 1970s he began his career as assistant professor and later a docent at the faculty of mathematical sciences of the University of Pristina, while in 1987 he received full tenure. Ademaj was the first to initiate postgraduate degree courses at the faculty of mathematical sciences of Pristina.&lt;ref name="ashak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashak.org/?cid=1,28,74|title=Eshref Ademaj - In Memoriam|publisher=[[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo]]|language=Albanian|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he was a member of various doctoral commissions in universities throughout [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1993 he became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="ashak"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Serbian policy focused on the ban of Albanian language education in Kosovo. As regards the University of Pristina, the Serbian government massively dismissed Albanian professors, closed departments and banned the use of Albanian. The reaction of the academic community was centered on the creation of a parallel education system that ensured dissemination of Albanian language textbooks and education on all levels. Eshref Ademaj, head of the Independent Union of University Teaching Staff, co-founded and led the Initiative Council to organise the restoration universitarian system. The organisation has been credited with much of the success of the initial projects towards that goal.&lt;ref name="Kostovicova2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kostovicova|first=Denisa|title=Kosovo: The Politics of Identity and Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtHSCXYFpYkC&amp;pg=PT106|accessdate=10 March 2013|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134276325|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Modern School Movement''' &lt;small&gt;(French: [[:fr:Mouvement de l'École Moderne|Mouvement de l'École Moderne]])&lt;/small&gt; is the community of teachers who follow the educational and social practices of [[Celestin Freinet]], his wife Élise and their successors.

== In francophone countries ==
In [[France]], the Modern School Movement is represented by the Cooperative Institute of the Modern School (ICEM), which was founded in 1947 by Freinet and his regional groups.  Freinet led the movement until his death in 1966. After his death, ICEM has moved away from the ideas of Freinet, with multiple influences.

In [[Belgium]] (Wallonia), there is a branch under the name ''Éducation populaire'' since 1937.  
In [[Switzerland]], in 1998 the ''Swiss Group of the Modern School'' united three smaller groups: theRomand Group of the Modern School (est. 1952), the Genevan Group of the Modern School (est. 1968), and the ''Swiss German Freinet Pedagogy Working Group'' (German: Arbeitsgruppe Pädagogik Deutschschweiz-Freinet, est. 1977).

== In the world ==
The International Federation of Modern School Movements (FIMEM), founded in 1957, united the national movements and has organized an international congress (RIDEF) every two years.  There teachers meet to share and develop their ideas and practice.

== Publications of the Movement ==
The Secular Education Cooperative (CEL) was founded in 1928 to produce teaching materials for those who practiced Freinet's pedagogy, and magazines and brochures for the Movement.  It was taken over by teaches of the movement in 1986, after financial problems, and became the limited liability company French Modern School Publications (PEMF). This publishing house later moved away from publishing exclusively manuscripts for Freinet teachers, embracing the full range of education journals such as ''The New Educator'' or ''[[:fr:Bibliothèque de travail|Library of Work]]''.

'''Fresh Memory''' is a [[spaced repetition]] [[flashcard]] application, similar to [[SuperMemo]].

The study algorithm is based on the SM2 algorithm, created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm|title=Application of a computer to improve the results obtained in working with the SuperMemo method. Piotr Wozniak, 1990.|work=www.supermemo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presented cards may include text and images. The cards are stored in an XML-based format, called dictionary files. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Fresh-Memory-Learning-Aid|title=Fresh Memory: Learning Aid|work=www.linux-magazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cards may have multiple "sides", called fields. The user defines what fields and in which order are used in the cards. The application automatically generates cards for different directions, e.g. from English language to French and in reversed order.

The primary purpose of the application is to learn and repeat foreign words. But other areas can be studied as well, for example, country's capitals, flags, mathematical formulas, etc. The study material is stored as collections of flashcards. The application has two studying modes: classic random browsing of flashcards and Spaced repetition. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fresh-memory.findmysoft.com/|title=Fresh Memory – Tool to Help You Learn|work=findmysoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh Memory is released as a free open-source software under[[GPLv3| GPL 3 license]] with full functionality.

==Description==
Shah outlined his mission as to "Nearly 1 million students in the U.S. are denied the chance to go to the very best college that they can attend because, in part, their test scores are not high enough. However, these students have peers with all of the resources, from tutors to books, at their fingertips. Income should not determine outcome. The mission of INeedAPencil.com is to empower under served students through online resources that maximize access to higher education."&lt;ref name="AboutUs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ineedapencil.ck12.org/aboutus|title=About Our Cause|publisher=INeedAPencil.com|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INeedAPencil was acquired in 2011 by CK-12 Foundation, an educational non-profit with a mission of reducing the cost of high quality educational materials for all.&lt;ref name=AboutINAP /&gt;

{{Primary sources|date=August 2017}}
The '''International Olympiad in Informatics''' ('''IOI''') is an annual [[competitive programming]] [[International Science Olympiad|competition]] for secondary school students. It is the second largest olympiad, after [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], in terms of number of participating countries (83 at IOI 2017). The first IOI was held in 1989 in [[Pravetz]], Bulgaria.

The contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving of [[algorithm]]ic nature. To deal with problems involving very large amounts of data, it is necessary to have not only programmers, "but also creative coders, who can dream up what it is that the programmers need to tell the computer to do. The hard part isn't the programming, but the mathematics underneath it."&lt;ref name=Robson&gt;{{cite web|last=Robson|first=Frank|title=Numbers game|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/numbers-game-20130805-2r9yi.html|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date= 10 August 2013|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students at the IOI compete on an individual basis, with up to four students competing from each participating country (with 81 countries in 2012).  Students in the national teams are selected through national computing contests, such as the [[Australian Informatics Olympiad]], [[British Informatics Olympiad]], [[Indian Computing Olympiad]] or Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (Germany).

The International Olympiad in Informatics is one of the most prestigious computer science competitions in the world. [[UNESCO]] and [[IFIP]] are patrons.

== Competition structure and participation ==
[[File:IOI2009 Banner.JPG|thumb|right|IOI 2009's banner above the competition room]]
On each of the two competition days, the students are typically given three problems which they have to solve in five hours. Each student works on his/her own, with only a computer and no other help allowed, specifically no communication with other contestants, books etc. Usually to solve a task the contestant has to write a computer program (in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ioi2015.kz/content/view/1/264&lt;/ref&gt;) and submit it before the five-hour competition time ends. The program is graded by being run with secret test data. From IOI 2010, tasks are divided into subtasks with graduated difficulty, and points are awarded only when all tests for a particular subtask yield correct results, within specific time and memory limits. In some cases, the contestant's program has to interact with a secret computer library, which allows problems where the input is not fixed, but depends on the program's actions – for example in game problems. Another type of problem has known inputs which are publicly available already during the five hours of the contest. For these, the contestants have to submit an output file instead of a program, and it is up to them whether they obtain the output files by writing a program (possibly exploiting special characteristics of the input), or by hand, or by a combination of these means. Pascal will have been removed as an available programming language by 2019.&lt;ref name="minutes16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of the Meetings held in Kazan, Russian Federation|url=http://www.ioinformatics.org/a_d_m/ga/ioi16/GAMinutesJuly2016.pdf|website=ioinformatics.org|publisher=General Assembly of International Olympiad in Informatics|pages=7, 11|format=PDF|date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:11&lt;/sup&gt;

IOI 2010 for the first time had a live web scoreboard with real-time provisional results.  Submissions will be scored as soon as possible during the contest, and the results posted. Contestants will be aware of their scores, but not others', and may resubmit to improve their scores. Starting from 2012, IOI has been using the Contest Management System (CMS) for developing and monitoring the contest.

The scores from the two competition days and all problems are summed up separately for each contestant. At the awarding ceremony, contestants are awarded medals depending on their relative total score. The top 50% of the contestants are awarded medals, such that the relative number of gold : silver : bronze : no medal is approximately 1:2:3:6 (thus 1/12 of the contestants get a gold medal).

Prior to IOI 2010, students who did not receive medals did not have their scores published, making it impossible for a country to be ranked by adding together scores of its competitors unless each wins a medal. From IOI 2010, although the scores of students who did not receive medals are still not available in the official results, they are known from the live web scoreboard. In IOI 2012 the top 3 nations ranked by aggregate score (Russia, China and USA) were subsequently awarded during the closing ceremony.

Analysis of female performance shows 77.9 % of women obtain no medal, while 49.2 % of men obtain no medal. "The average female participation was 4.4% in 1989–1994 and 2.2% in 1996–2014." It also suggests women participate much more on the national level, claiming sometimes a double-digit percentage of women participate on the first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maggiolo|first1=Stefano|title=An Update on the Female Presence at the IOI|journal=Olympiads in Informatics|volume=9, 127–137|issue=2015|pages=127|doi=10.15388/ioi.2015.10|url=http://ioinformatics.org/oi/pdf/v9_2015_127_137.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2017|publisher=ioinformatics.org|location=London, U.K.|format=PDF|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the IOI, Richard Forster, says the competition has difficulty attracting women and that in spite of trying to solve it, "none of us have hit on quite what the problem is, let alone the solution."&lt;ref name="Robson" /&gt;

In IOI 2017 held in Iran, due to not being able to participate in Iran, the Israeli students participated in an offsite competition organized by IOI in Russia.&lt;ref name="minutes16" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:11&lt;/sup&gt; Due to visa issues, the full USA team was unable to attend, although one contestant Zhezheng Luo&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6410 Zhezheng Luo]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to attend by traveling with the Chinese team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simões|first1=Gabriel|title=IOI 2017, first round - Codeforces|url=http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53550#comment-375744|website=Codeforces|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=31 July 2017|quote=There is really only one USA contestant on site, it looks like he came with the Chinese team (straight from China).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and winning gold medal and 3rd place in standings.&lt;ref name="standings2017"&gt;[http://stats.ioinformatics.org/results/2017 IOI 2017: Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Jakob Gapp''' (26 July 1897 – 13 August 1943) was an [[Austrian people|Austrian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and a professed member from the [[Marianists]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-jakob-gapp/|title=Blessed Jakob Gapp|date=2 September 2016|publisher=Saints SQPN|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gapp first served as a soldier on the Italian front during [[World War I]] at a point in his life where his religious convictions were not of high importance though his return home from a [[prisoner of war]] camp saw him develop [[Socialism|socialist]] views that soon bought him into contact with the Marianists whom he later joined. He studied with them and became a member while later being [[ordained]] and assigned across [[Austria]] as a teacher where he became noted for his vehement opposition to the [[Nazi]] regime; he deemed Nazism as being some warped political tool to create division which was also incompatible with the faith.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90198|title=Blessed Jakob Gapp|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/bios96.htm|title=Biographies of New Blesseds – 1996|publisher=EWTN|date=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His bold activism against the Nazi regime saw him flee when it was clear his life was endangering himself and his colleagues and he settled in both [[France]] and [[Spain]] before returning to France after being duped into accepting two Jewish people who fled from [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=MH&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.marianist.org/site.php?menuaccess=34|title=Blessed Jakob Gapp|date=|publisher=The Marianist Family|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two men were instead the [[Gestapo]] who arrested him and transferred him to Berlin where he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. His interrogation transcripts reveal how he deemed Nazism and Roman Catholicism to be incompatible and his strong adherence to his faith even prompted [[Heinrich Himmler]] and others to refuse his relations to retrieve his remains for it would result in veneration and silent rebellion.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.nacms.org/resources/blessed-jakob-gapp-social-justice-animator|title=Blessed Jakob Gapp: Social Justice Animator|date=|publisher=North American Center for Marianist Studies|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beatification process for the late priest culminated after [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him on 24 November 1996 in [[Saint Peter's Square]].

==Life==
Jakob Gapp was born on 26 July 1897 in [[Wattens]] as the seventh child to Martin Gapp and Antonia Wach; he received his [[baptism]] on 27 July in the local parish church of Saint Lawrence. His niece was Marianne Oberauer. He received a basic education in his hometown and later entered the high school that the [[Order of Friars Minor]] ran at Hall in 1910.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

He served as a soldier on the Italian front from May 1915 until 1916 when he was wounded during a battle; he received the Silver Medal of Courage Second Class as a result of his actions on the battlefield. On 4 November 1918 he became a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Riva del Garda]] and was later released from his internment on 18 August 1919 but became a prisoner of war due to a miscommunication on the ceasefire agreement that was to commence 5 November but never did.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; Gapp later entered the [[Marianists]] at Greisinghof on 13 August 1920 for a formation program and began his [[novitiate]] on 26 September before being assigned to [[Graz]] as a teacher and [[sacristan]] from 1921 until 1925. He joined that order after learning about them from a relative. He made his profession in [[Antony, France|Antony]] in [[France]] on 27 August 1925. He began his studies for the priesthood in September 1925 at [[Fribourg, Switzerland|Fribourg]] in [[Switzerland]] and later received his [[ordination]] as such from Bishop Marius Besson at the Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Fribourg on 5 April 1930.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

The new priest served as a teacher and chaplain at several Marianist schools until 1938. He often gave up his own heating coal to the poor and collected food and other necessities for them. He preached against the errors of [[Nazism]] and how it was incompatible with fundamental Christian ethics and he said himself that it was "irreconcilable with the Catholic faith" thus to be discouraged. Gapp was forced to flee Graz in March 1938 when German troops entered into Austria.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Gapp's superiors sent him to [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] in September 1938 believing he would be in danger if he was not moved and it was there that he served as an assistant pastor at Breitenwant-Reutte until October 1938 when the [[Gestapo]] ordered him not to teach religion. He refused to wear a [[swastika]] badge and to greet people with the '[[Heil Hitler]]' out of conscience and once in public rebuked a fellow teacher who told their students to "hate and kill Czechs and Jews".&lt;ref name=MH/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

Gapp also taught his students that love for all people irrespective of race or religion was crucial to fellowship and taught that people ought to be worshipping [[God]] and not [[Adolf Hitler]]; this got him suspended.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; On 11 December 1938 he gave a sermon in which he defended [[Pope Pius XI]] from Nazi smears and directed the faithful to read Christian literature and not that which the Nazis propagated; one such document he directed others to and spoke about was [[Mit brennender Sorge]] that Pius XI issued in 1937.&lt;ref name=MH/&gt; He was also advised to flee Austria in January 1939 so travelled to [[Bordeaux]] in France where he worked as both a chaplain and librarian. In May 1939 he headed for [[Spain]] and served at Marianist communities in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] as well as [[Cadiz, Spain|Cádiz]] and [[San Sebastian, Spain|San Sebastian]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; While in Valencia in 1942 he went to the British consulate hoping to gain a visa to go to [[England]] but this attempt failed so settled for reading British newspapers in order to find uncensored news that would tell him the truth about [[World War II]]; he also learned of the [[Holocaust]] genocide at the same time. He read [[The Tablet]] which was a Christian British newspaper.&lt;ref name=MH/&gt;

But Gapp was never free from the Nazis for the Gestapo followed his movements and in 1942 devised a devious plot to draw Gapp out from Spain into their arms along the French border. In 1942 he received word of two Jewish males who fled from Berlin and were at the French border desiring his assistance after learning of him. Gapp further learned these two were brothers who wanted baptism so left Spain to go and retrieve them. The three went on a picnic close to the border where he found that the two were not Jews but disguised Nazis who abducted him and arrested him in [[Hendaye]] on 9 November 1942; he was then sent to Berlin for incarceration.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=MH/&gt; It was decided that he would not be sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]] because Gapp was seen to be dangerous to the extent where he needed special surveillance. His resolve while being interrogated prompted [[Heinrich Himmler]] to review all interrogation transcripts and even comment on his steadfast dedication to Catholicism. Himmler said if the Nazis had one Gapp dedicated to the cause as the priest was to the faith the Nazis would have won the war at that stage. On 2 July 1943 he was condemned to death for speaking out against the [[Third Reich]] after a two hour court session and was remanded pending his formal execution – the judgment was condemning: "He will forever be without honor". The burial of his remains was also denied during those proceedings for the Nazis feared that he would be venerated and his grave site would become the site of rebellion and silent demonstration.

In the afternoon on 13 August 1943 at 1:00pm he was advised that he would be executed that evening so in preparation wrote two farewell letters. He was beheaded at 7:08pm and his remains were used for research at the Anatomical-Biological Institute at the [[University of Berlin|Berlin college]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM/&gt; In 1996 the death sentence against him was lifted in a Berlin court on a posthumous level. His surviving remains were moved to [[Innsbruck]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

==Beatification==
[[File:Jakob-Gapp Wattens.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Memorial plaque in his birthplace of Wattens.]]
The beatification process opened in [[Vienna]] in a diocesan process that opened under Cardinal [[Hans Hermann Groër]] on 26 June 1987 and concluded its business on 20 October 1987 in which Gapp was titled as a [[Servant of God]]; a total of 37 witnesses were interviewed including Gapp's niece Marianne.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; The [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated this process on 7 April 1989 and later received the [[Positio]] from the postulation in 1992 for assessment. Theologians issued their approval to the cause on 31 January 1995 while the bishop and cardinal members of the C.C.S. approved the cause too on 4 April 1995.

His cause received approval from [[Pope John Paul II]] on 6 April 1995 after the pope determined that the late Marianist priest was killed "in odium fidei" or "in hatred of the faith". John Paul II beatified Gapp in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 24 November 1996.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the Marianist priest Antonio Gascón Aranda.

The '''Korean Language Proficiency Test''', ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=세계한국말인증시험}}) or '''KLPT''', tests people who are not native speakers of [[Korean language|Korean]] on their [[grasp]] of the language. The goal is to determine whether the test-taker is proficient enough to live in Korea, work as an employee at a Korean company, etc. The Basic-KLPT, or B-KLPT, is also offered; this version of the test simply "assesses whether or not examinees have basic communication ability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klpt.org/english/b-klpt/what.asp Korean Language Proficiency Test]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lautsi v. Italy''''' was a case brought before the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which, on 18 March 2011, ruled that the requirement in Italian law that crucifixes be displayed in classrooms of schools does not violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ECHR&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/resources/hudoc/lautsi_and_others_v__italy.pdf Full text of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&amp;documentId=883171&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Press release of the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2011/03/european-courts-grand-chamber-upholds.html Summary of the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The case==

The case stemmed from a request of Mrs Soile Lautsi, citizen of [[Finland]] and of [[Italy]], against the School Council of a school in [[Abano Terme]] ([[province of Padua]]). When the School Council decided not to comply, Lautsi applied to the Veneto Administrative Court. The administrative Court decided, on 17 March 2005, that the presence of crucifixes in State-school classrooms did not offend the principle of secularism.  Lautsi appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Veneto Court's decision reasoning that in Italy the crucifix symbolized the religious origin of values (tolerance, mutual respect, valorization of the person, affirmation of one's rights, consideration for one's freedom, the autonomy of one's moral conscience vis-à-vis authority, human solidarity and the refusal of any form of discrimination) which characterized  Italian civilization and that keeping the Crucifix did not have any religious connotations.&lt;ref name="echr.coe.int"&gt;Case of Lautsi and Others v. Italy, European Court of Human Rights (Application No. 30814/06) www.echr.coe.int/echr/resources/hudoc/lautsi_and_others_v__italy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Court of Human Rights===
Lautsi then appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on 27 July 2006. On 3 November 2009, a Chamber of the Second Section of the Court declared that there had been a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. This decision caused uproar in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americandailyherald.com/20110328360/religion/rulings-in-europe-and-south-american-affirm-display-of-christian-symbols Rulings in Europe and South America Affirm Display of Christian Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903221947/http://www.americandailyherald.com/20110328360/religion/rulings-in-europe-and-south-american-affirm-display-of-christian-symbols |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lautsi declared that she had received threats and had been a victim of vandalism, and complained about statements by politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanistfederation.eu/download/162-Lautsi%20Albertin%20statement.pdf Open letter by M. Albertin and S. Lautsi]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chamber that considered the case decided that Italy was in violation of Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Article 2 of the first Protocol to the Convention, reasoning that among the plurality of meanings the crucifix might have, the religious meaning was predominant. The Chamber argued that 'the "negative" freedom of religion was not limited to the absence of religious services or religious education: it extended to practices and symbols expressing, in particular or in general, a belief, a religion or atheism. It added that this "negative right" deserved special protection if it was the State which expressed a belief and dissenters were placed in a situation from which they could not extract themselves if not by making disproportionate efforts and sacrifices.'&lt;ref name="echr.coe.int"/&gt;

===Italian Government reaction===
On 28 January 2010, the Italian government lodged an appeal to the Grand Chamber of the Court.&lt;ref name=ECHR/&gt; Its position was supported by the governments of [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Poland]]: "Lithuania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds that the use of crucifixes in public in Catholic countries reflects the European Christian tradition and should not be regarded as a restriction on the freedom of religion", stated its spokesperson&lt;ref&gt;[http://balticreports.com/?p=7933 When a cross is not a cross], ''BalticReports'', 13 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  By July 2010, twenty countries had officially expressed their support for Italy's appeal against the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-29956?l=english]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of the Chamber of the Court was also deplored by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Church of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/greek.orthodox.church.opposes.eu.crucifix.ban/24623.htm Greek Orthodox Church opposes EU crucifix ban]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Parliament===
In the [[European Parliament]], two motions for resolutions were proposed: one by [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|S&amp;D group]], calling for "recognition of [...] the freedom of Member States to exhibit any religious symbol in public",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=B7-2009-0278&amp;language=EN ]&lt;/ref&gt; another by GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups, stating belief that "only states based on the principle of the [[separation of church and state]] – as opposed to theocratic states – can find the proper solutions to safeguard everybody's right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to education and the prohibition of discrimination" and "it should not be compulsory to display religious symbols in premises used by public authorities"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=P7-RC-2009-0275&amp;language=EN]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ECHR 2010 ruling===
In March 2010, the case was referred to Court's Grand Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=863761&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Press release, 02.03.2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten countries, 33 MEPs (jointly) and several NGOs were authorised as third parties to present written observations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=870705&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Press release] 30.06.2010.&lt;/ref&gt; several others were refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanistfederation.eu/download/277-ECtHR%20re%20third%20party%20interventions.pdf ECtHR letter]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2010, a hearing was held by the Grand Chamber,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Press/Multimedia/Webcasts+of+public+hearings/webcastEN_media?&amp;p_url=20100630-1/en/ Grand Chamber hearing]&lt;/ref&gt; which on 18 March 2011 announced its decision, reached by 15 votes to 2, to overturn the ruling of the lower Chamber. It granted that, "by prescribing the presence of crucifixes in State-schools classrooms - a sign which, whether or not it is accorded in addition a secular symbolic value, undoubtedly refers to Christianity - the regulations confer on the country's majority religion preponderant visibility in the school environment." But it declared: "That is not in itself sufficient, however, to denote a process of indoctrination on the respondent State's part and establish a breach of the requirements of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1". It added that "a crucifix on a wall is an essentially passive symbol and [...] cannot be deemed to have an influence on pupils comparable to that of didactic speech or participation in religious activities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/resources/hudoc/lautsi_and_others_v__italy.pdf Grand Chamber's judgement] Para. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leövey Klára Gimnázium''' (in English: '''Klara Leovey High School''') is a high school in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. Students attend the school from age 14 to age 18.

== History of the school ==
The predecessor of the school, Ranolder Institute was founded by Ranolder János, the bishop of Veszprém at the time, in order to give Ferencváros, which was mainly inhabited by German natives in those days, an institute to educate women in Hungarian. The school in charge of the Daughters of Charity was gradually growing receiving girls with the intention to study from all over the country. After the nationalisation in 1948/49 the school became a training (secondary) school for primary school teachers, then taking up the name Leövey Klára in 1955, it was turned into a high school.
== The framework of education in the school ==
In the regular department the students between the age of 14 and 18 take part in a 4 and 5 year school course/education.

This is a school of „the second chance” too, because at the department of adult education there is a chance for youngsters or young adults who for some reason could not obtain a secondary education certificate, are given the chance to get it within a night school or correspondent course system without giving up their jobs and starting a regular (daytime) secondary school course.

The school also offers a practice-oriented 1- or 2- year-long course based on the requirements of the secondary education certificate which gives a qualification to those who do not wish to or temporarily cannot continue their studies at a further education college or university.

In the school year 2008/2009 there are 650 students attending the regular and 210 students the adult department of the school.

== Innovative School ==
This school has been a member of the [[Network of European Innovative Schools]] since June 2003. This gives the opportunity of trying out new pedagogical methods and tools and of joining/participating international programs.

=== Modernising contents in the educational work ===
In the educational work environmental education has a prominent role. Students learn about the importance of environmental protection at elective extra lessons, through doing project work and educational trips. A new project on environmental protection, which is on the way to be state-credited, is being tested at the moment at this school. 

The [[European Language Portfolio]] which help students to keep track of their language learning process was introduced in 2003. The Portfolio is in accordance with the Common European Framework and 
* is an ideal tool to give the parents a clear picture of their children’s headway and 
* develops self-assessment and 
* improves language awareness of the students as well. 

The school was one of the first high schools in Hungary to introduce the teaching of the subject ’Introduction to Economics in’ its curriculum as an elective extra lesson. Within the scope of the subject students could join a student enterprise program called Young Enterprise to gain experience on running a business. From the school year 2005/2006 students have the opportunity of receiving the renowned [[Unified European Economic Certificate]] ([[EBC*L]]).

As the result of the development made in the last few years the teaching of the subject ’Moving picture and Media’ has been introduced as an elective course and for students specialising in it, within the framework of which the students get to know the basics of analysing moving pictures and current phenomena of the media. 
This school is a pioneer in using information and communication technologies. In this field traditions go back to 1983.  These technologies are used in the background work of both teachers and students and in projects work as well.

=== Leövey Klára Secondary Grammar School in projects ===

With the coordination of the [[European schoolnet]] the school has been participating in the e-learning research and development work of the [[Celebrate project]] which has been going on since 2002 with nine Hungarian schools (including Leovey Klara High School) taking part in it. Teachers have been creating and testing e-learning resource materials to be used through the Internet. 
The school is part of the Sulinet Digital Knowledge Base the aim of which is to integrate informatics, learning and teaching materials into the process of school learning.
The SCALE project is an EU sponsored project with 6 countries participating. It aims at developing an Internet-based method which can help to develop students’ argumentative skills in discussions and introduce the method of learning with the help of discussions to them.
Within the ZORKA 2004 project, with the other schools involved in the  Innovative School Network, the school has been developing digital teaching and learning resource materials to be used in teaching natural sciences.
In the school year 2005/2006 the ESZTER project was organised by Sulinet Program Office (Programiroda), with innovative schools taking part, within which students were exploring the ethnic, language, religious and cultural heterogeneity of the EU countries. 
With the HEFOP 3.1.3. project the school can take part in the development program entitled ’Preparation for  Competence-based Teaching’.  All the 9-form students in this school are involved in it. 
The participation in the [[Socrates/Comenius]] school development program financed by the [[European Committee]] gives students the chance to improve their sense of solidarity and empathy. It also helps them to explore and respect the heterogeneity of European Culture and social traditions. This institute is the coordinator for 6 schools in the 3-year project entitled “For a European School of Solidarity” which aims at helping the participants to learn and cohabit with heterogeneity.

== Specialities ==
Students in the 9th and 10th form learn the subjects of their own interest, which they specialise in, in a higher number of lessons. At the beginning of the 11th form they can revise their former choice and make a new one choosing another elective subject to orient themselves towards another aim in their future career. 
Besides the modern pedagogical methods used in the school, the students are attracted by the friendly atmosphere of the institution as well. The extra curricular activities also have an important role to contribute to this good atmosphere.
It is not only the cultural programs which are of great interest to students but they show interest in acting, sports activities and hiking as well.
The students’ self-government operates within a special independent framework.
The excellent atmosphere of the school is also due to the most modern way of keeping contact between parents and the school as well as students and teachers through the internet. This new type of “interpersonal” contact is operated through the Moodle framework and it makes the educational and pedagogical work of teachers much more effective.
The school has owned a certificate of quality management based on the QPSA model since 1999. For the sake of the permanent improvement the school is continuously processing the feedback (measurements, competition results, data of enrolment, final exam results) and survey the indicators of the level of satisfaction of partners (of parents and students)in the educational and pedagogical process. 
As the appreciation of the high quality of the work, the name of the school gets referred to more and more frequently in the leading organs of pedagogical literature.

'''Martin Deutsch''' (1926–2002) was an American [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] known for his research on the education of disadvantaged children. His efforts to develop a [[compensatory education]] program in [[New York City]] served as a predecessor to the national [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] program.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He developed early intervention programs with what he called a "therapeutic curriculum", which aimed to specifically address the deficient experiences of children living in deprived environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/03/archives/classes-to-begin-for-4yearolds-schools-to-admit-950-more-pupils-on.html |title=CLASSES TO BEGIN FOR 4‐YEAR‐OLDS; Schools to Admit 950 More; Pupils on Monday From Underprivileged Areas; 1,600 BY END OF MONTH; Similar Program Will Begin in Suffolk on Oct 15 for Ages 3 and 4 |date=1964-10-03|work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-09-09 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that such environments put children at a disadvantage with respect to beginning school and acquiring basic [[literacy]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqqQKcFmcecC |title=In the Crossfire: Marcus Foster and the Troubled History of American School Reform |last=Spencer |first=John P. |date=2012-08-16 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |isbn=0812207661 |pages=76 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], Deutsch was educated at [[Columbia University]] (B.A., 1943; M.A., 1947; Ph.D., 1951).&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/nyregion/dr-martin-deutsch-an-innovator-in-education-dies-at-76.html |title=Dr. Martin Deutsch, an Innovator in Education, Dies at 76 |last=O'Connor |first=Anahad |date=2002-07-05 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2018-09-09 |language=en |author-link=Anahad O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mRQDwAAQBAJ |title=Early Formal Education: Current Theory, Research, and Practice |last=Hess |first=Robert |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781351312677 |pages=83 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he and his wife founded the Institute for Developmental Studies at [[New York University]], where he became a professor in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Caldwell |first=Bettye |author-link=Bettye Caldwell |date=2003 |title=Obituaries: Martin Deutsch (1926-2002). |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.75 |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |language=en |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=75–75 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.58.1.75 |issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained director of the Institute for Developmental Studies for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was the president of the [[Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bx_cOvQnCwcC |title=The Healing of a Nation |last=Loye |first=David |date=December 1998 |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=9780966551440 |language=en |author-link=David Elliot Loye|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[renal failure]] on June 26, 2002 at [[Norwalk Hospital]] in [[Norwalk, CT|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Research==
In 1962, Deutsch began a pilot [[early childhood education]] program in [[Harlem]] for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds. In the program, Deutsch aimed to give children early exposures to experiences in which they had been lacking, such as music and books.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In the short term, the program aimed to equip children with the skills they would need for formal education; in the long term, it was intended to improve participants' communication and learning skills, thereby benefiting them in adult life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2L6d9bijdDoC |title=The Hidden History of Head Start |last=Zigler |first=Edward |last2=Styfco |first2=Sally J. |date=2010-05-07 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199745500 |page=8 |language=en |author-link=Edward Zigler}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1964 article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' described the program as "the first scientific and concerted attempt by any public school system to confront the problem of educating poor [[preschool]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Blake |first=Patricia |date=1964-04-03 |title=A Big Break for Poverty's Children |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUEEAAAAMBAJ |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |language=en |publisher=Time Inc |page=78B |access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism of hereditarianism==
Deutsch was an early critic of [[Arthur Jensen]]'s controversial essay ''[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]'', published in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'' in 1969. In a subsequent issue of the same journal, Deutsch criticized Jensen's essay for allegedly supporting [[racism]], and claimed that the essay contained "many erroneous statements, misinterpretations, and misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Deutsch |first=Martin |date=September 1969 |title=Happenings on the Way Back to the Forum: Social Science, IQ, and Race Differences Revisited |url=https://pinnacle-secure.allenpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.17763%2Fhaer.39.3.3m44122wh263497n%3Fcode%3Dhepg-site&amp;code=hepg-site |journal=[[Harvard Educational Review]] |language=en-US |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=523–557 |doi=10.17763/haer.39.3.3m44122wh263497n |issn=0017-8055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbMJAgAAQBAJ |title=What's Wrong with the Poor?: Psychiatry, Race, and the War on Poverty |last=Raz |first=Mical |date=2013-11-11 |publisher=[[UNC Press Books]] |isbn=9781469608884 |pages=71 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he debated [[Richard Herrnstein]] over the relative importance of genetics and environment in determining [[human intelligence]].

'''Marty Ralph Klein''' (born 1950) is an American [[sex therapist]], author, educator and [[public policy analyst]]. Klein has spent his career supporting the healthy sexual expression of men, women and couples in a wide range of ways. He is critical of censorship, the concepts of [[sex addiction]] and [[porn addiction]], as well as the [[anti-pornography movement]]. He believes that public policy relating to sexuality should be driven by scientific data rather than emotion, "tradition" or popular but untrue myths.  He has been a participant in various state, federal and international court cases dealing with the [[First Amendment]], obscenity, censorship and "harmful to minors" laws.

==Early life==

Klein grew up in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. While still in elementary school he began to play the recorder and to collect stamps, interests he has continued throughout his life. Collecting stamps led to a lifelong interest in geography and history. He later wrote on these topics frequently when he began to lecture and travel internationally.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=Marty's Travel Blog |url=https://martystravels.wordpress.com/about/ |accessdate=16 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416225204/https://martystravels.wordpress.com/about/ |archivedate=April 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1967 he attended the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]]. There he developed a passion for sociology and went on to attend PhD programs in sociology at [[Indiana University]] and the [[University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sexualintelligence.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Klein was trained in the doctoral programs of two different branches of sociology: the first was survey research, the use of statistical analysis to gather data about human behavior in order to understand, correlate and predict it; the second was [[ethnomethodology]], which is the study of how people create meaning as a prelude to creating orderly social interactions and predictable social institutions.&lt;ref name="Chip August"/&gt;

While at the University of California, Klein worked at the local weekly newspaper the ''[[Santa Barbara Independent|Santa Barbara News &amp; Review]]'', his first job was a writer. In 1976 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published his op-ed piece on contraceptive advertising; together these two outlets began his career as a professional writer.

First as a volunteer and then as a staff member, Klein worked for the Santa Barbara branch of [[Planned Parenthood]] (1976-1980). While there he became intrigued with the recurring experience of women returning for pregnancy tests multiple times despite being prescribed or given various types of contraception. These women's explanations surprised him: they didn't want to use birth control because they were afraid their partner would think they were a slut, or that they had actually planned to have sex with a stranger they'd just met at a bar.&lt;ref name="Chip August"/&gt;

Planned Parenthood then asked him to run a group for the male partners of women coming to the birth control clinic. He also received a grant from the state Office of Family Planning relating to male sexuality. His interest already piqued by his experiences at the clinic, he began his career in human sexuality.&lt;ref name="Chip August"/&gt;  
{{Cquote|America needs a model of sexual health that is ''sex-positive''.&lt;ref name="Siecus 2003" /&gt;}}

==Sexuality==

Klein is best known for promoting changes in personal and social attitudes toward sex and sexuality. He has given several media interviews and written blog posts about his views on topics such sexuality in the media, pornography, and children and sexuality.

{{Cquote|When it comes to finding an expert on all things sex, you can't come much closer than Marty Klein. ...you'll learn a lot from reading what he has to say whether you agree with him or not.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiSalvo|first1=David|title=Six Writers Who Know More About Sex Than You Do (So Read Them)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/05/28/six-writers-who-know-more-about-sex-than-you-do-so-read-them/#6c5a0f3f34da|website=Pharma &amp; Healthcare|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Views on sexuality in the media===

Klein has been outspoken about the way sexuality is discussed in media outlets. For example,  a 2005 ''[[New York Times]]'' article on the phenomenon of self-help books about sexual positions, sex fantasies and increasingly edgy materials stated that the genre is big business, aimed at women and promoting the idea that "It is a woman's role to ensure that the couple's sex life remains satisfying." Klein disagrees that the promises that these books make about improving sex with oral, anal and fetishistic techniques and information are not what most couples really need to make them happy. "A book called 'How to Get Your Wife to Hug You a Little Bit More' or 'How to Get Your Husband to Slow Down and Caress Your Hair and Love Doing It,' now those are books that would change people's lives," says Klein.&lt;ref name="NYTimes La Ferla"&gt;{{cite web|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=More Sex, Less 'Joy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/fashion/sundaystyles/more-sex-less-joy.html|website=Fashion &amp; Style|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication is the key to satisfying relationships; things like new positions or removing pornography from a home without your partner's consent is generally not helpful.&lt;ref name="NYT Sohn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sohn|first1=Amy|title=First Comes Sex Talk With These Renegades of Couples Therapy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/fashion/first-comes-sex-talk-with-these-renegades-of-couples-therapy.html?_r=0|website=Fashion &amp; Style|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein told the ''Commonwealth Club'' that what most adults want out of sex is a combination of "pleasure and closeness," and he encourages people to pay more attention to these, rather than to performance anxiety or how they look.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Intelligence: A New View of Sexual Function &amp; Satisfaction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to6cFe6op9s|publisher=The Commonwealth Club of California|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has criticized the mass media for talking about sexuality in what he claims is an exploitative manner. He calls this the "Oprah-ization" factor, where talk shows like ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' and ''[[Dr. Phil]]'' will, for example, put teen prostitutes on stage and talk about how awful it is. What they are really doing, according to Klein, is showing teen girls in skimpy clothing talking about sex, which results in voyeuristic viewers. "If the American media really thought these stories were so terrible it wouldn't give them so much air time ... The key message in American culture is that sex is dangerous. But sex isn't dangerous, bad sexual decision making is dangerous."&lt;ref name="Nava135"/&gt; In an interview with Chip August for ''Personal Life Media'' Klein stated, "I think Oprah has single-handedly launched the victim industry in this country," adding that society is now infantilizing women by saying that they are unable to make decisions for themselves, that they are tricked into drinking at parties, that they can't control whether they get drunk or create circumstances of vulnerability. "It's demeaning to people to say that even though you're an adult, we're not going to hold you accountable for your own decision-making," he says.&lt;ref name="Chip August"&gt;{{cite web|last1=August|first1=Chip|title=Episode 1: Dr. Marty Klein: "America’s War on Sex: The Attack on Law, Lust, and Liberty"|url=http://podcasts.personallifemedia.com/podcasts/222-sex-love-and-intimacy/episodes/2889-dr-marty-klein-america-s-war-on-sex-the-attack-on-law-lust-and-liberty-|publisher=Personal Life Media|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reason.TV"&gt;{{cite web|title=War on Sex|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hLVnNqAKv4|publisher=Reason.TV|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on pornography===

Klein has criticized as unproven the theory of "secondary effects", which posits that people involved with various forms of commercial sexual expression (such as escorts, strip clubs or pornography) will inevitably get involved with other, non-sexual illegal activity such as burglary, vandalism, or assault. He states that there is no evidence for this, but the idea appeals intuitively to many people. Thus instead of looking at the actual causal factors of crime, they seek to ban pornography, strip clubs and other outlets to reduce it.&lt;ref name="Tango Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorman|first1=Melanie|title=War On Sex? An Interview With Dr. Marty Klein|url=https://www.yourtango.com/experts/rachel-kleinman/war-sex-interview-dr-marty-klein-expert|website=Expert Blog|publisher=Your Tango|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[20/20]] Klein told host John Stossel that 150 years ago most people got married as soon as they reached puberty, which was about 14 or 15 years old. Now most Americans reach puberty around ages 10–12 but they delay marriage into their late 20s. "Telling people to not have sex is like telling a depressed person to have a nice day and expecting that to lift their depression."&lt;ref name="20/20"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stossel|first1=John|title=Age of Consent|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDsy72Aqj7U|publisher=20/20|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Klein was a return guest on ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' talking about his book ''His Porn, Her Pain: Confronting America's Porn Panic with Honest Talk about Sex''. He explained that he wrote this book in response to [[Broadband]] internet making porn more available - and the accompanying increase in women complaining about their men viewing porn, as well as to help improve sexual literacy of both adults and minors. Host [[Steven Novella]] asked Klein if anti-pornography groups are trying to justify their opposition by citing health concerns or were just confused about the science. Klein responded that both are true. "The junk science is there for anyone who wants to use it," he said, noting that the common claims that pornography leads to various social problems lack evidence to support them, as rates of sexual violence, divorce, teen pregnancy and child molestation have all gone down since Broadband pornography became common. He observed that couples that don't have sex anymore are quicker to fight about pornography rather than have a meaningful conversation about problems in their sexual relationships. [[Cara Santa Maria]] asked if porn leads to unrealistic expectations by men. "Absolutely yes!" Klein answered. "Some people think porn is a documentary, showing real people in real situations... porn is usually unusual bodies, doing unusual things in unusual circumstances."  "Pornography leaves out so much that we value in sex. Kissing, hugging ... whispering... because if you watch people hug, after about 2 seconds it gets real boring." In addition, he explained that consumer products based on fantasy are mostly about what people want to see, not necessarily what they want to do or experience, as both men and woman fantasize about things they would not do even if given the chance.&lt;ref name="SGU 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Podcast #596 - December 10th, 2016|url=https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/596|publisher=The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on children and sexuality===

In a 2012 interview with ''Your Tango'', Klein stated that in America, children are raised to have negative feelings about sex and their sexuality. In Europe most beaches are clothing optional, yet in America nudity on beaches is a crime. "When children in the United States grow up learning that their sexuality is bad, when every institution that children have contact with reminds them that their sexuality is bad or dirty or shameful or dangerous — when those kids grow up to be adults, they carry those lessons with them. And one of the things those kids decide when they are adults is that 'if there's something wrong with my sexuality, there must be something wrong with everyone else's sexuality. And, therefore, it's not only my sexuality that I need to repress, it's other people's sexuality that I need to be concerned about, too." This is, Klein says, one of the roots of censorship in America. Further, he has been critical of laws which make it risky for parents to take photos of their children in the bathtub, or for teenagers to take sexual photos of themselves for their own private use. In addition, he has spoken out against the way he sees teens being treated as a sexually repressed minority, such as the criminalization and punishment of teen "sexting," and the deliberate withholding of sexual information and sexual health products from them.&lt;ref name="sexting"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Marty|title="Sexting" Can’t—Repeat, Can’t—Kill Anyone|url=https://www.martyklein.com/sexting-cant-repeat-cant-kill-anyone/|website=MartyKlein.com|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 ''New York Times'' interview, Klein was asked how best to talk to children about sex. He responded that it depends on the child, since a younger child will probably not notice the conversation, and older children will need additional information and it is best for parents to respond honestly in a way that reflects their values. A teenager will need to understand what is real and what is fictional entertainment. In all cases, Klein said, it is important to listen, remain calm and make sure the child knows they are not a bad person for having sex questions and that they can ask the parent anything. '"There’s a technical word for the conversations that adults have with their kids when the parents are uncomfortable'" said Klein '"parenting.'"&lt;ref name="NYT Home and Garden"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Learly|first1=Amy|title=How to Talk to Your Kids About Pornography Parents’ Stories and Expert Advice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/10/garden/porn-intro.html|website=Home and Garden|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has also noted that children are learning about sex despite "anti-sex crusaders" and other societal forces trying to keep it from them: "The truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not. Children don't need our help to think about sex ...There are groups of people out there who are devoted to scaring the heck out of Americans about sexuality ...It makes some people feel good because they say, 'Aha, there's the enemy and if only we could do something about that, everything would be better.'

Parents need to educate their children and increase their sexual literacy, so that they understand that what they are seeing on the Internet is fantasy.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISIS Sex Tech 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moral Panic at Sex Tech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KbLukTdduA|publisher=Sex Tech|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|The two best strategies for improving sex are better communication and more self-acceptance. ...Self-acceptance: your body is the way it is; you’re not going to lose 10 pounds this weekend. ... One breast is bigger than the other, one nipple has a few stray hairs, your penis is exactly the size it is. ...Vanilla sex isn’t what makes people bored. Focussing on distracting stuff does. Feeling disconnected does. Having sex when you’re resentful or too tired does. ...If you and your partner(s) enjoy some kink, or a different time/place/activity every time you have sex, by all means have a good time. Nothing wrong with that if it works for you. But for most people, wilder isn’t necessarily better. In fact, wilder actually pulls some people away from the connection and focus that can make sex enjoyable.

=="Sex addiction"==

When the expression "sex addiction" was coined in the mid-1980s by [[Patrick Carnes]], Klein began to lecture and write against this idea. Klein believed then - and continues to believe - that the concept of "sex addiction" is primarily a set of moralistic judgements dressed up as clinical theory. He has written that the concept is a simplistic explanation of poor sexual decision-making that demonizes sexuality. He says it ignores the roles of culture, religion and the psychological means of sex for individuals while portraying sexual desires as dangerous, often unhealthy and in need of strict control channeled into the one proper form of sexual expression. Klein has reservations that sex-addiction exists and believes that an addiction movement whose agenda is based on false assumptions is harmful to patients and to society, namely: that sexual desires are dangerous, controlling, and not healthy, and that there is only one way to express sexuality.

It is unknown, according to Klein, if the sex addiction movement realized that its ideas would become politically exploited. Regardless of their intentions, this is what activists, government and the media have done in order to discredit the profession of [[sexology]]. Issues such as culture, religion, age and disorders must be taken into account. He states that society needs to come up with "sex-positive" models of "sexual health". These models should reflect good education for children as well as for adults, while being sensitive across different cultures.&lt;ref name="Siecus 2003"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Marty|title=Sex Addiction: A Dangerous Clinical Concept|url=http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/SIECUS%20Report%202/31-5.pdf|website=Siecus.org|publisher=Siecus Report|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's concerns with the concept of sexual addiction are that it appears to lend scientific credibility to it and implies that "sex is dangerous."&lt;ref name="New Yorker 1998"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Verghese|first1=Abraham|title=The Pathology of Sex|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/02/16/the-pathology-of-sex|website=Annals of Addiction|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yeung|first1=Bernice|title=Sex and the Single Psychologist|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/sex-and-the-single-psychologist/Content?oid=2151348&amp;showFullText=true|website=News|publisher=SF Weekly|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve-step programs for sex addiction are of limited value because they are typically self-referred for a problem that any lay person can diagnose. There is no serious evaluation, just "Hello Joe, welcome to the group". Joe may suffer from other problems that will not be helped by a twelve-step program, and may in fact be made worse.&lt;ref name="Nava135"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Marty Klein, Marriage Counselor, Sex Therapist|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w-_DtTecLM|publisher=You Tube|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein told [[NPR]] that the idea that going to strip clubs or "watching porn movies can actually be addictive in the same way that heroin is addictive is just silly."&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Marty Klein's NPR Response to Utah's "Porn Crisis"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UabOZlwPKmI|publisher=NPR|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dan Savage"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=Dan|title=Dan Savage Podcast: Porn Addiction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGIKjucEEgk|authorlink=Dan Savage|website=Dan Savage Podcast|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian TV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marty Klein|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rrVoX-X7v8|publisher=Canadian TV Corp|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian TV Corp 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marty Klein|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX35WJ545AY|publisher=Canadian TV Corp|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|There is no proof, no verified scientific data that people who look at pornography are more likely to commit violent or sexually deviant acts than anybody else... there is actually evidence to the reverse.

==Court cases==

Michigan passed a law in 1999 criminalizing the distribution of "sexually explicit" material on the Internet fearing it could fall into the hands of minors. Plaintiffs, which included Marty Klein, challenged the law arguing that it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and it was ruled unconstitutional in June 2001.&lt;ref name="CC vs Engler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberspace Communications, Inc. v. Engler|url=http://mediacoalition.org/cyberspace-communications-v-engler/|website=Press Releases|publisher=The Media Coalition|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000 Arizona Governor [[Jane Hull]] signed law H.B. 2428 which added the Internet to the "harmful to minors" statute. Plaintiffs including Klein sought to have the Internet removed, claiming the law was far too broad  contrary to the First Amendment. After reaching the [[9th Circuit]] in June 2002, the Court struck down the law as unconstitutional in ''American Civil Liberties Union v. Goddard''.&lt;ref name="ACLU vs Goddard"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Civil Liberties Union v. Goddard|url=http://mediacoalition.org/aclu-v-goddard/|website=Press Releases|publisher=The Media Coalition|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Court Cases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marty Klein|url=http://mediacoalition.org/?s=Marty+Klein|publisher=The Media Coalition|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010 an addition was proposed to Massachusetts Senate Bill 997 adding "electronic media" to traditional media in its "harmful to minors" law. This would have criminalized any material posted on the Internet that might be considered harmful if viewed by a minor. The plaintiffs argued that this could "potentially ban constitutionally protected speech about art, literature, sexual health and other topics." The case was heard in October 2010, and in April 2011 the Bill was signed into law, but with the stipulation that it could only be enforced if the "harmful material" was knowingly distributed to a minor. Marty Klein was the only individual among the various institutional plaintiffs.&lt;ref name="ABFFE vs Coakley"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression v. Coakley|url=http://mediacoalition.org/abffe-v-coakley/|website=Press Releases|publisher=Media Coalition|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to lead attorney Michael Bamberger in 2010, the "harmful to minors" law is too broad and will harm adults that have a constitutional right to content on the Internet, '"(T)he injunction was necessary to ensure that all Internet communications were not reduced to the level of what is appropriate for children."'&lt;ref name="Press Release 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Federal District Court Grants Preliminary Injunction Against Online Censorship Law|url=http://mediacoalition.org/press-release-abffe-coakley-massachusetts-preliminary-injunction/|website=Press Releases|publisher=The Media Coalition|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiffs were concerned that fines of up to $10,000 and five years in prison would have a chilling effect on booksellers as websites have no way to determine the age of an Internet user, and it is not possible to block only users located in Massachusetts. Thus the law would threaten Internet users nationwide and even worldwide.&lt;ref name="Press Release July 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Local Booksellers, National Trade Associations, ACLU, and Others Sue to Block Internet Censorship Law|url=http://mediacoalition.org/press-release-abffe-coakley-massachusetts-harmful-to-minors-internet-lawsuit/|website=Press Releases|publisher=The Media Coalition|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Select bibliography==

===Books===
Klein has authored seven books on sexuality. His book ''America's War on Sex'' with a forward by [[ACLU]] President Nadine Strosse was honored as 2006's Best Sexuality Book by [[AASECT]].&lt;ref name="CSPH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monday Reviews: America's War on Sex|url=http://thecsph.org/monday-reviews-americas-war-on-sex|publisher=CSPH|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It documents how the issue of sexual regulation is being used by the [[Religious Right]] to undermine secular democracy. Klein details what he describes as a well-coordinated, deeply funded war on sexuality which is being fought on many fronts.&lt;ref name="Tango Interview"/&gt; Klein explores what he sees as the U.S.'s deep-seated anxiety about sexuality and the lengths to which the U.S. government is willing to go to keep its citizens sexually repressed. Klein challenges American society's (and [[psychotherapy|psychotherapy's]]) assumptions about sexuality; he is particularly critical of what he calls the "Sexual Disaster Industry" and the "Oprah-ization" of psychotherapy and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume9/book38klein.htm | title=America's War On Sex | author=Kernes, Mark | journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality |date=November 2006 | volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Centre for Early Music''' is an educational resource for [[early music]] located in [[York]], England.  It is based in the converted and extended, Grade I listed [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Church (building)|church]] of [[St Margaret's Church, York|St Margaret, Walmgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1256319|desc=Church of St Margaret|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[van Heyningen and Haward Architects]], the Centre was opened in April 2000. It was created, with the aid of a grant from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and partnership money from organisations such as [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/grant-aided-properties/national-centre-for-early-music-st-margarets-church-yo1-9tl/ | title=National Centre for Early Music, St Margaret's Church | publisher=English Heritage | work=Grant-aided Places | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The buildings of the Centre include a performance space (in the former church) and facilities for conferences and other events and recordings.  Historic [[keyboard instrument]]s are available for hire.
The church building, which had been [[Redundant church|redundant]] for some years, was upgraded to meet the needs of varying types and size of performance as well as many alternative uses such as teaching, conferences and exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/archive/1998/06/11/7968927.Dreaming_of_those_early_gates_/?ref=arc Dreaming of those early gates!] [[The Press (York)|''The Press'']]. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The roof has been rebuilt for enhanced acoustics, and there are baffles to allow the acoustics to be modified.

The annual [[York Early Music Festival]] is organised from the church and is administered through the York Early Music Foundation, a UK registered charity.
During the rest of the year, the Foundation promotes an educational programme based at the National Centre: events include seminars, workshops and [[master class]]es.  New music is also promoted, for example there is an annual Young Composers Award to encourage composers to work with early music groups.&lt;ref name="ncem"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncem.co.uk/competitions/ | title=Competitions | publisher=National Centre for Early Music | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Professional Agricultural Student Organization''', regularly referred to as PAS, is a national organization associated with postsecondary institutions offering baccalaureate degrees, associate degrees, diplomas and/or certificates in agriculture/[[agribusiness]] and natural resources. PAS is one of the ten career and technical student organizations that has been approved by the [[United States Department of Education]] as an integral part of career and technical education also referred to as [[vocational education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctesarasota.net/about_students.html#pas: Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cte/vso.html:Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doe.sd.gov/OCTE/docs/CTSO_postsecondary_FactSheets.pdf, South Dakota Department of Education, PDF, Career &amp; Technical Education Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doe.sd.gov/OCTE/docs/CTSO_postsecondary_FactSheets.pdf,TeamAgEd 2008 Annual Report: Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt; PAS is a member of the [[Consortium of Collegiate Agricultural Organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agconsortium.org/Help.aspx :Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAS was originally organized for postsecondary programs awarding associate degrees or certificates and has since expanded to include baccalaureate degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;Career and Technical Student Organizations: A Reference Guide. Fiscus, Lyn et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agedhq.org/agedorganizations.htm :Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Charitable Statistics, N.P.A.S.O. Retrieved on 2009-12-15&lt;/ref&gt; The Illinois PAS has all four of that state's agricultural universities involved in PAS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illinoispas.org/page/page/4327487.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  and Iowa PAS has their state land grant of [[Iowa State University]] in PAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowapas.org/history.aspx |title=History |publisher=Iowa PAS |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift allows students who then transfer to a 4-year university to continue their direct involvement in PAS, provides the opportunities of PAS to university students and further deepens connections between 2 and 4 year agricultural institutions.

The national organization was organized in March 1979 under Draft Bylaws. PAS was officially founded in March 1980 in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iowapas.org/: Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of PAS begins with the expansion of vocational-technical education at the postsecondary level. With state and federal legislation in the 60’s and 70’s, the agricultural education movement expanded greatly with more and more postsecondary agricultural programs.  This movement started the creation of many local college student agricultural organizations at the two-year institutions.

On the national level, the formation of PAS began with a National Seminar in 1966 at [[SUNY Cobleskill]], Cobleskill, New York. A Committee on “Youth Organizations and Activities for Two-Year Post High School Students in Agriculture" was created.  It was decided that PAS should be separate from the [[National FFA Organization]]. It also recommended that the organizations begin first with the local, then state, and proceed to a national organization.

Some states had developed equivalent organizations that proceeded the formation of the National PAS Organization. In Illinois, some 12 community college agriculture students, their advisors, and guests gathered on February 28, 1974, at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in Springfield for the purpose of forming a statewide organization. Copies of the Students With Agriculture Purposes (SWAP) Constitution and Bylaws were revised and developed into a state constitution and bylaws. Seeing the need for a different name for the organization, the  Illinois Association of Community College Agriculturists (IACCA) was passed unanimously to replace SWAP. The IACCA Constitution and Bylaws were officially adopted on April 19, 1974. On February 25, 1989, at the 15th Annual Conference when the 16 delegates assembled voted to change the name from “IACCA” to “PAS” so that Illinois would be aligned with the National PAS Organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illinoispas.org/page/page/4327237.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a National Organization was again reviewed at the National Agricultural Education Seminar held in Muscatine, Iowa in 1969.    However, there was not enough interest in forming a national organization at that time.

In 1973 a National Standards conference hosted by the state of Minnesota recognized the potential need for a student organization.  A NPASO Development Committee was formed and was to meet each year at the American Vocational Association (AVA) convention.

In 1976 the committee held a brainstorming conference in the Quad Cities.  Some of the major decisions included (1) the terminology of “Agriculture and Related Occupations for students enrolled in two-year institutions; (2) that the organization would be independent of the [[National FFA Organization]] and the FFA Alumni; and (3) the development of a procedure for funding and obtaining industry support.

In 1977 with a grant from [[White Farm Equipment]] Company, an ad hoc committee met at the National FFA Center to develop the strategies for a national postsecondary student organization.  The purpose was to verify the need for and feasibility of organizing an organization.

In 1978, as a continuation of the [[White Farm Equipment]] Company grant, a National Seminar for Educators in Postsecondary Institutions was held in Kansas  City, Missouri.  The seminar concluded with acceptance of six reports including the acceptance and endorsement of the need for a National Postsecondary Student Organization for Agriculture/Agribusiness and Natural Resources students and the need to proceed immediately to finalize the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P3-1667923071.html, Western Illinois University Agriculture Education Major Elected Illinois Postsecondary Agriculture Student Vice President: Retrieved on 2009-12-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national conference for the National Postsecondary Agricultural Student Organization was held in April 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iowapas.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==

National PAS membership now totals some 1,115 members from 56 chapters located in 18 states. Membership is available to students in agriculture, agribusiness and natural resources postsecondary programs in approximately 550 institutions in all 50 states.&lt;ref name="teamaged1"/&gt; 

== PAS Associates ==

PAS Associates is an organization of former members of the National Postsecondary Agriculture Students Organization. Advisors, administrators, industry representatives, parents, and other PAS supporters are also welcomed to become members. Despite a generally open membership the PAS Associates has had minimal activity and has been faced with financial issues.

PAS Associates was officially organized at the 10th reunion National Conference in Kansas City, Mo., in March 1988.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalpas.org:Retrieved on 2009-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, NetDay merged with'' Project Tomorrow'' (''tomorrow.org''), a California nonprofit involved with math and science education. The organization is continuing to work with schools to improve the use of technology in education.&lt;ref name=ProjectTomorrow&gt;{{cite web

==Overview==
NetDay was established to take place over the course of one Saturday, whereby designated schools would receive full connection to the [[Internet]]. Activities were coordinated at the website ''netday.org''. The HTML Writers Guild (quoting the NetDay FAQ) defined the day as an:

{{cquote|historic [[grassroots]] effort in the classic American [[barn-raising]] tradition. Using [[Volunteering|volunteer]] labor, our goal is to install all the basic wiring needed to make five classrooms and a library or a computer lab in every school Internet-ready. If the same work were financed by taxpayers, it would cost more than $1,000 per classroom. Volunteers from businesses, education, and the community will acquire all of the equipment and will install and test it at every school site. Your support and participation is crucial to our success. In addition, by bringing together these diverse elements, NetDay establishes a framework for lasting partnerships among business, government, educational institutions, and local communities to provide ongoing support for our schools.&lt;ref name=writersguild&gt;{{cite web

Some argued that access to the Internet should not be a priority when schools lack even basic resources like library books (although in many cases the project added needed materials and efforts to computing projects already underway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Lindhe |title=SF State plugs into NetDay |url=http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/spring96/mar12/01.html |work=Golden Gater |publisher=[[San Francisco State University]] Department of Journalism |date=March 12, 1996 |accessdate=2008-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206025908/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/spring96/mar12/01.html |archivedate=February 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NetDay '96==
[[Image:Phoc96v1.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Bill Clinton]] installing computer cables with Vice President [[Al Gore]] on NetDay at [[Ygnacio Valley High School]] in Concord, CA. March 9, 1996.]]

The first NetDay was held on March 9, 1996. NetDay '96 created considerable excitement amongst participating schools. The day was organized via the website ''netday96.com''. 20,000 volunteers helped to wire 20 percent of California schools to the Internet. 2,500 wiring kits were donated by telephone companies. Of the first event, John Gage commented, "NetDay96 is a demonstration of what can happen when people coalesce around a community project [...] In one day, we can begin to reverse California's abysmal record of putting technology into its classrooms."&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite news

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and Vice President [[Al Gore]] were also involved with NetDay '96, spending the day at [[Ygnacio Valley High School]], as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his challenge the previous September to "Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the [[Information Superhighway]] by the end of this school year" was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of "absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen".&lt;ref name=Clintonspeech/&gt; Clinton acknowledged the support of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction [[Delaine Eastin]], Lieutenant Governor [[Gray Davis]], Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] and Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]].&lt;ref name="Remarks on NetDay in Concord, California, March 9, 1996"&gt;{{cite web

In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the [[Clinton administration]], which was "to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century." Gore also stated that the administration planned "to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000".&lt;ref name=Goreprepared&gt;{{cite web

Another NetDay was held that same year in October in Silicon Valley, involving 80 companies and approximately 3500 volunteers helping to network 172 schools. The campaign was called Smart Schools NetDay II and was coordinated by Smart Valley, Inc., a [[501(c)_organization#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4) nonprofit organization]], part of the initiatives at Joint Venture: Silicon Valley.&lt;ref&gt;SmartSchools NetDay, www.svi.org/netday/, version November 27, 1996, accessed at [https://web.archive.org/web/19961127052934/http://svi.org/netday/ archive.org], accessed June 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==NetDay Activities ==

On April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and "who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country" via "an interactive online session with children across the country."&lt;ref name=honor&gt;{{cite news

'''''Opening Night''''' is a 1995 education/simulation video game by [[MECC]], and developed in cooperation with [[Children's Theatre Company|The Children's Theatre Company]] in Minneapolis. It is aimed at children aged 10 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+Version+of+Storybook+Weaver+Deluxe+Available+Now+With+Enhanced...-a019016748|title=New Version of Storybook Weaver Deluxe Available Now With Enhanced Creativity Features|last=|first=|date=January 13, 1997|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Players create, direct, and perform mystery plays in a lifelike theatre, featuring [[Children's Theatre Company|The Children's Theatre Company]] actors in [[period costume]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62623318.html|title=MINNESOTA MULTIMEDIA; Now the Minnesota Connection is in the CD- ROM business.|last=Covert|first=Colin|date=January 15, 1996|work=Star Tribune|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do this by manipulating multimedia including 40 actors, 100 sets, and 300 props to create stories.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mecc.com/products/lang/on/on.html |title=MECC Product Forum: Opening Night |last= |first= |date=February 3, 1997 |publisher=MECC |access-date=January 23, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970203060001/http://www.mecc.com/products/lang/on/on.html |archivedate=February 3, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting, music, and sound effects can be later added.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To access an item, players first choose the Category Viewer to choose the category, then next the Item Viewer to choose the item.

A timer helps synchronise actions, while the recorder is used to capture action. [[Text-to-speech]] technology allows the player to hear the character say what they have written;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dEpsp-ZqAIEC&amp;q=%22opening+night%22+mecc&amp;dq=%22opening+night%22+mecc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqti-v9jRAhUGNJQKHRGGD5E4ChDoAQgdMAE|title=TakeCharge Computing for Teens and Parents|last=Dixon|first=Pam|date=January 1, 1996|publisher=IDG Books Worldwide|year=|isbn=9780764501012|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however if words are mispronounced they are encouraged to type the words out phonetically instead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Star Tribune'' commented that the dialogue can either appear at the bottom of the screen like movie [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or spoken in a "[[Stephen Hawking]] monotone".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Development ==
The actors were added by first being filmed or photographed then digitized into the game, in a similar vein to ''[[Mortal Kombat#Graphics|Mortal Kombat]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/opening-night|title=Opening Night|last=|first=|date=|website=MobyGames|publisher=|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bonus expansion pack named ''Opening Night Behind the Scenes'' was released in 1995 on Windows 3.1 and Macintosh. It was developed in cooperation with The Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis and published by MECC. The disk illustrated how the game was made and showed how a theatre operates. Players could watch interviews by industry professionals from The Children's Theatre Company and look up terms in a glossary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Opening-Night-Behind-Scenes-Software/dp/B000V7Y7DS|title=Opening Night Behind the Scenes|last=|first=|publisher=Amazon.com|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/opening-night-behind-the-scenes|title=Opening Night: Behind the Scenes back cover|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MECC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CD also include [[QuickTime|Quicktime]] movies showing tours of different aspects of the theatre.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/opening.htm |title=IT'S OPENING NIGHT FOR YOUR PLAY!

== Release ==
[[Dale LaFrenz]], MECC president and chief executive officer, commented that she expected ''Opening Night'', alongside ''[[MayaQuest]]'' and ''[[Math Munchers Deluxe]]'', to be released in time for the pre-holiday selling season of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MINNESOTA+EDUCATIONAL+COMPUTING+CORPORATION+(MECC)+REPORTS+HIGHER...-a017630509|title=MINNESOTA EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING CORPORATION (MECC) REPORTS HIGHER REVENUE, NET INCOME FOR 2ND QUARTER|last=|first=|date=October 17, 1995|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was the 73rd best-selling title during the November–December 1995 period ([[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MECC+MOVES+INTO+TOP+FIVE+IN+EDUCATIONAL+SOFTWARE+SALES+FOR+1995;+9...-a017966979|title=MECC MOVES INTO TOP FIVE IN EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE SALES FOR 1995; 9 TITLES RANK AMONG TOP 100 HOLIDAY SELLERS|last=|first=|date=February 12, 1996|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''[[Star Tribune]]'' positively compared [[MECC]]'s ''Opening Night'' (1995) to [[The Learning Company]]'s ''[[The American Girls Premiere]]'' (1997), which the newspaper considered to be a mere repackaging of the MECC video game. While ''The American Girls Premiere'' offered players the ability to record their own voices, ''Star Tribune'' otherwise considered it to be redundant to the earlier game, and thought ''Opening Night'''s fans would find the newer title unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62616611.html|title=CD-ROM lets girls create historical stage plays; Software industry is remiss no longer.|last=Alexander|first=Steve|date=September 25, 1997|work=Star Tribune|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' thought the game would only appeal to fully-fledged theatre enthusiasts, while turning off more casual creative types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-868203.html|title=Time in a Bottle|last=Oldenburg|first=Don|date=December 27, 1995|work=The Washington Post|last2=Stoltz|first2=Craig|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Macs For Teachers'' described the product as "very cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TpYLAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22opening+night%22+mecc&amp;dq=%22opening+night%22+mecc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinlJDA0tfRAhWLjLwKHSd_BXgQ6AEILjAE|title=Macs For Teachers|last=Robinette|first=Michelle|date=September 19, 1997|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780764502262|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William T. Yates of ''The School House Review'' and ''World Village'' gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, commenting that the game would increase players' interest in and love of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/opening.htm |title=Opening Night |last=Yates |first=William T. |date=December 26, 1996 |publisher=THe School House Play |access-date=January 23, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961226012650/http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/opening.htm |archivedate=December 26, 1996 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/opening.htm |title=Opening Night |date=June 20, 2001 |access-date=January 23, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010620112232/http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/opening.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Bubnic of ''Pep Holiday Hits'' thought the game was for "aspiring actors and actresses", and chose it as one of the best picks for the holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microweb.com/pepsite/Holiday/xmas_anne.html |title=HOLIDAY BEST BETS |last=Bubnic |first=Anne |date=January 17, 1999 |publisher=Parents – Educators – Publishers. |access-date=January 23, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117025457/http://www.microweb.com/pepsite/Holiday/xmas_anne.html |archivedate=January 17, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gamervescent'', for which ''Opening Night'' was their first video game, wrote retrospectively that over time they learnt that the title unleashed the "greatest unintentional hilarity of all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamervescent.com/a-retrospective-on-the-first-best-game-i-ever-owned/|title=A Retrospective on the First (BEST) Game I Ever Owned -|last=Bryan|first=Bethany|date=November 20, 2012|work=|newspaper=Gamervescent|access-date=January 23, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theatre in Cyberspace'' wrote that the game was elegant and that it could be more directly applied to the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Fq8cAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22opening+night%22+mecc&amp;dq=%22opening+night%22+mecc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinlJDA0tfRAhWLjLwKHSd_BXgQ6AEIPjAI|title=Theatre in Cyberspace: Issues of Teaching, Acting and Directing|last=Schrum|first=Stephen Alan|date=January 1, 1999|publisher=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">'''Person-centred thinking''' is a set of values, skills and tools used in [[Person Centred Planning]] and in the personalisation of services used by people who need supports provided by social or health care.

Person-centred thinking is described by the UK Department of Health as "the foundation for person centred planning"&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health (2010) Personalisation through Person Centred Planning: http://www.thinklocalactpersonal.org.uk/_library/Resources/Personalisation/EastMidlands/Workstreams/PCP/Personalisation_through_Person_Centred_Planning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The British Institute of Learning Disabilities advocates Person centred thinking suggesting that such tools "can be really helpful in assisting the process of getting to know a person really well".&lt;ref&gt;British Institute of Learning Disabilities: Hearing from the Seldom Heard: Good Practice Suggestion 1; Getting to know people well: http://www.bild.org.uk/humanrights/docs/seldom_heard/section_3/3_1/Gettingtoknowpeoplewell.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major piece of research into the impact of person centred planning found that the prevalence of person-centred thinking in services was an important condition for services having the capacity and systems for delivering person centred results.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of Person Centred Planning (2005), Robertson, Emerson et al: http://www.lincs.cswebsites.org/Libraries/Local/825/Docs/Planning/PCP/pcpimpactresearch%5B1%5D.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Person-centred thinking tools in common use include one-page profiles, 'working/not working', 'important to/important for', 'good day/bad day', communication charts, 'doughnut' of staff roles and responsibilities, relationship circles, learning logs and person-centred reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Think and Plan: http://www.thinkandplan.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 

These tools provide an agenda which a person and the people who know that person best can think together, focussing on what is important to that person, how they wish to live, and then introduce changes that will move towards those aspirations. 
 
Practitioners of person centred thinking suggest that it's possible to build up from one or two pieces of person centred thinking, piece by piece based on the area of the person's life that they feel is most important to consider next, this process of building gradually creates a collection of person centred information, equivalent to a 'full' person centred plan, and more importantly a range of co-produced actions.  Where a person has a specific budget allocated to pay for their social care, this portfolio of person centred thinking tools (a 'person centred description') can also be extremely useful as a basis to write a support plan, which explains how they will use this budget to meet what is important to and for them.&lt;ref&gt;Max Neill, Helen Sanderson and Gill Bailey: One page profile to person centred plan or support plan {{cite web |url=http://www.helensandersonassociates.co.uk/media/13258/one%20page%20profile%20to%20person%20centred%20or%20support%20plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402185540/http://www.helensandersonassociates.co.uk/media/13258/one%20page%20profile%20to%20person%20centred%20or%20support%20plan.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of person-centred thinking==
Person centred thinking was first developed by a group of people practicing [[Essential Lifestyle Planning]] in the US (now known as 'The Learning Community for Person Centred Practices). These planners realised that while many plans were being written, many of these were not leading to real change in peoples lives. This group decided that person centred planning was something a small group of people needed to know, but that for planning to work, a much wider group of people need skills around listening for what's important to people and how to best support people. [[Michael Smull]] who is a leading figure in this group describes Person centred thinking as "something that virtually everyone who touches a person needs to know"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smull,  in "Conversations on Citizenship and Person Centred Work (Eds John O'Brien and Carol Blessing) 2011, Inclusion Press, Vol III pp45-55"&lt;/ref&gt; because change was most powerful when all staff were using person centred thinking tools in their roles, rather than relying solely on person centred planning facilitators to create plans. To enable these tools to be shared at scale, Essential Lifestyle Planning was 'deconstructed' into a range of person centred thinking tools, that enable staff to participate with the person in a cycle of listening, learning and action by building up a set of tools recording this process to form a person centred description of the person.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson H. Lewis J. (2012) A Practical Guide to Delivering Personalisation; Person-Centred Practice in Health and Social Care. London; Jessica Kingsley Publishers p22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values underpinning person centred thinking==
Person Centred Thinking, like other person centred approaches is based in the values of independence and rights, coproduction, choice and control and inclusive and competent communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson H. Lewis J. (2012) A Practical Guide to Delivering Personalisation; Person-Centred Practice in Health and Social Care. London; Jessica Kingsley Publishers p24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional certification]]s in [[computer|computer technology]] are non-degree awards made to those who have achieved qualifications specified by a certifying authority.   Depending on the particular certification, qualifications may include completing a course of study, proof of professional accomplishments, achieving a specified grade on an examination. The intention is to establish that an individual holding a certification is technically qualified to hold certain types of position within the field.

Certifications, generally, need to be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period (e.g. the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continual learning — often termed continuing education — or earning [[continuing education unit]]s (CEU). Certification is often used in the professions of [[information technology]] industry.

Some certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and are managed by the vendors of these technologies. These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.

== General certification ==
General certification of software practitioners has struggled.

===Information systems security===
In an [[information systems]] environment that requires formal security accreditation, ''Certification'' refers to the comprehensive evaluation of the technical and non-technical security features of an information system.

Certification is formally defined by Krutz and Vines as:
{{cquote|
The comprehensive evaluation of the technical and non-technical security features of an information system and the other safeguards, which are created in support of the accreditation process to establish the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets the set of specified security requirements.

* [[CSTE]]

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Controversies over the term Engineer}}
The current proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained){{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} has led some technologists to question their value.  Advanced training content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise beyond the certification material. Certifying agencies have responded in various ways: some now incorporate hands-on elements, anti-cheating methodologies or have expanded their content. Others have expired and restructured their certificate programs, and/or raised their fees to deter abuse.

==Education==
{{See also|Student engagement}}
Research on college students and high school students has been done to determine whether relevant Information Technology industry certification is an asset to the teaching profession as they appear to be in the business world.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{Citation | first = D. | last = Anderson | title = Information Technology Industry Certification’s Impact on Undergraduate Student Perception of Instructor Effectiveness. | publisher = UMI Dissertation Publishing Group, Volume 7005A. Publication No. 3358241 | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reimer"&gt;{{Citation | first = K. | last = Reimers | title = Impact of Information Technology (IT) Industry Certification on the Achievement of High School Students Enrolled in Technology Courses | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies investigated CIS/IT student perceptions and outcomes of certified and non-certified instructors. As observed by Adelman, many post-secondary CIS/IT faculty were unconcerned about the emergence in the 1990s of “a new, parallel universe of postsecondary credentials”, Anderson and Reimers found that CIS/IT students were keenly aware if their instructors had them.  For example, certain certifications DOD 8570.1M are the only commercial certifications that the Department of Defense will accept towards meeting their Information Assurance hiring requirements.

The studies found a significant difference in learning outcomes between technology courses taught by certified and non-certified instructors; students whose instructors held IT industry certifications had higher levels of achievement than their non-certified peers and that college undergraduate students showed a significantly greater perception of their instructor’s effectiveness, teaching skills, professor technical expertise, and their own engagement in their classes with certified professors. Randall &amp; Zirrkle (2005) noted a distinction between high school students and college students result benefit and the type of certification (vendor neutral and vendor-specific).

IT Certifications are considered as a standard of IT knowledge by most of the giant technology companies around the world. Best knowledge of up to date technologies is ensured by continuously updating the versions of certifications by the specific vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Hunsinger, S. &amp; Smith, M.(2008) Factors that Influence Information Systems. Journal of Information Technology Education Undergraduates to Pursue IT Certification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randall, M. &amp; Zirkle, C. (2005). Information technology student-based certification in formal education settings: Who benefits and what is needed. Journal of Information Technology Education, 4, 287-306.

== DoD Directive 8570.1 and DoD Directive 8140 ==
The U.S. Department of Defense Directive 8570.1, signed in August 2004, requires every full- and part-time military service member, defense contractor, civilian and foreign employee with privileged access to a DoD system, regardless of job series or occupational specialty, to obtain a commercial certification credential that has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
8570.1 established certification requirements in 3 levels: Level I, II, and III was categorized into IAM - Information Assurance Management and IAT - Information Assurance Technician.  Since its implementation the IT enterprise landscape has changed dramatically with the implementation of mobility, cloud computing, and cybersecurity areas of increased emphasis.

As a result, the NICE - [[National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education]] was established to form the NICCS portal - National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and  Studies.  This initiative was a public/private collaboration and resulted in the publishing of The Framework 1.0.  Since the initial framework has established it has been enhanced and published as The Framework 2.0 and has morphed into the DoD 8140 Directive which is anticipated to be in full implementation by December 2015.  This framework breaks down into seven (7) categories and establishes 31 KSA's (Key Specialty Areas), which fundamentally are silos within the IT landscape.

'''Roy Hart''', born '''Rubin Hartstein''' (30 October 1926 – 18 May 1975) was a [[South Africa]]n [[actor]] and [[Singing|vocalist]] noted for his highly flexible voice and extensive vocal range that resulted from training in the [[extended vocal technique]] developed and taught by the [[Germany|German]] singing teacher [[Alfred Wolfsohn]] at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]] in [[London]] between 1943 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. 'The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre'. New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Roy Hart began learning [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]]  [[extended vocal technique]] at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre|Voice Research Centre]] in 1947 where many of his fellow students acquired unusual vocal flexibility and  expressiveness, some of them developing voices with a range in excess of 5 [[octave]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;Luchsinger, R. and Dubois, C.L., 'Phonetische und stroboskopische Untersüchungen an einem Stimmphänomen', Folia Phoniatrica, 8: No. 4, pp201–210. Trans. Ian Halcrow. 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Roy Hart, having been a long-standing attendant of the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]], began teaching [[acting]] classes to actors and [[drama]] students at various venues across [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Alfred Wolfsohn]] in 1962, Roy Hart formed a [[performing arts]] group comprising some who had studied at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]] and others who had attended Hart's [[acting]] classes. This company was called firstly the ''Roy Hart Actor Singers'', and then the [[Roy Hart Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. 'The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre'. New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of Roy Hart, the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] evolved into a group of performers who devised and presented experimental performances noted for the way the members utilized [[extended vocal technique]] to create [[Speech|verbal]] and [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] [[Experimental theatre|drama]] and [[Experimental music|music]], which had a substantial influence on the work of notable contemporaries of the [[Europe]]an [[avant garde]], including [[Peter Brook]] who subsequently incorporated [[extended vocal technique]] into his productions, [[Jerzy Grotowski]], who made vocal expression a central feature to his rehearsal techniques and performances, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] who adapted works for Hart, and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] who composed ''[[Eight Songs for a Mad King]]'' especially for Roy Hart's voice.

Roy Hart died in 1974, shortly after the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] moved permanently from [[London]] to [[Thoiras|Malérargues]], Southern [[France]]. However, the remaining members continued the work begun by [[Alfred Wolfsohn]] and extended by Hart, through teaching [[extended vocal technique]] and staging dramatic and musical performances that utilized a vocal range and flexibility greater than that commonly heard in speech and song.&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P.

==Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre==
Alfred Wolfsohn was a [[Jew]]ish [[Germany|German]] who suffered [[auditory hallucination]]s of screaming soldiers, whom he had witnessed dying whilst serving as a [[stretcher bearer]] in the trenches of [[World War I]]. He was subsequently diagnosed with [[shell shock]], and after failing to benefit from [[psychiatry]], [[hypnosis]], and [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]], cured himself by vocalizing the extreme sounds he had heard and later [[hallucination|hallucinated]], before developing an approach to [[Vocal pedagogy|singing lessons]] intended to be [[Psychotherapy|therapeutic]] for his students.&lt;ref&gt;Günther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn', Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture, 50: pp65–75, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfsohn, A., Die Brücke.

Wolfsohn developed and taught techniques that were originally intended as [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]], to a regular group of students, some of whom studied with him for almost twenty years, at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]] in [[Berlin]] from 1935 - 1939 and in [[London]] from 1943 until 1962 when he died. Among these students was Roy Hart, who began studying with [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental music and theatre==

As a consequence of [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]] [[extended vocal technique]], his students developed highly flexible and expressive voices, some of them in excess of five [[octave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luchsinger, R. and Dubois, C.L., 'Phonetische und stroboskopische Untersüchungen an einem Stimmphänomen', Folia Phoniatrica, 8: No. 4, pp201–210. Trans. Ian Halcrow. 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the three years prior to [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]] death, this group of students began to demonstrate the artistic use of their vocal expressiveness in [[vocal music]], [[poetry]], and [[drama]], to invited guests. After [[Alfred Wolfsohn]] died, Roy Hart expanded upon this tradition, acting as [[Theatre director|stage director]] and [[Performing arts|performer]] in theatre productions that used a range of vocal expression beyond that employed in most [[Western world|Western]] [[drama]] and [[music]] performances of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Roose-Evans J., ''Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavski to Peter Brook'', 4th edn. London: Routledge, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P., The Singing Cure: An Introduction to Voice Movement Therapy. London: Random House, 1993 and Boston: Shambhala, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Roy Hart studied [[English language|English]] and [[Psychology]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand University]], [[Johannesburg]] before coming to [[England]] to train as an [[actor]] at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA). He records:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I came to England from South Africa…I won a scholarship to RADA and was told I had a good voice and stage personality. Yet I had known for some time that my voice was not rooted, not literally embodied... On leaving RADA I was immediately offered a most promising opening in the Theatre…I made an extraordinary choice. I turned down the proffered 'big chance' in order to research into the nature and meaning of the human voice.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., How Voice Gave me a Conscience. Unpublished paper read at the Seventh International Congress for Psychotherapy, Wiesbaden, 1967. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Malérargues, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roy Hart began taking lessons with [[Alfred Wolfsohn]] in 1947. Upon his teacher's death in 1962 the long-standing attendants of the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]] divided with Hart taking leadership of one group who were joined by students of Hart's acting lessons whilst the other group continued their attempts to maintain the centre and its [[Psychotherapy|therapeutic]] focus.

The work of both the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] and the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre]] was documented in [[writing]], [[film]], [[photograph]]s, and [[Phonograph|phonograph recordings]] by  [[author]], [[Filmmaking|film maker]], and [[archivist]] [[Leslie Shepard]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon Smith, R. Tuesday 14 September 2004 'Leslie Shepard: Writer, editor, film-maker and collector', The Independent, 14 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P.

Tigers Eye Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, L. et al, 'The Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', Dartington Theatre Papers Archives. Dartington College of Arts, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

This documentation was used as the primary material upon which to base [[Writing|written]] papers that Hart read in 1963 at the [[C G Jung Institute London|Jung Institute]] in [[London]]; in 1964 at the Sixth [[International Congress for Psychotherapy]] in [[London]]; in 1967 at the Seventh [[International Congress for Psychotherapy]] in [[Wiesbaden]]; in 1968 at the Third [[International Congress of Psychodrama]] in [[Vienna]]; in 1970 at the Sixth [[International Conference for Psychodrama]] in [[Zagreb]]; and in 1972 at the Seventh [[International Congress of Psychodrama]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., Lecture read at the Jung Institute in London, 1963.

The papers presented by Hart made two fundamental points.

:* Firstly, they proposed that an extended vocal range could be used to produce a form of theatre that returned it to its alleged routes in religious [[ritual]] and [[spiritual practice]].&lt;ref&gt;Innes, C. (1981) Holy Theatre: Ritual and the Avant Garde. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Innes, C. (1993) Avant Garde Theatre 1892–'. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, R. (1985) Between Theatre and Anthropology. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of reviving a primitive and provocative [[participatory theatre]] that would use a range of vocal sounds to portray [[myth]]ical [[Character (arts)|characters]] and [[Deity|deities]], and express intense human [[emotion]] was synonymous with [[Jerzy Grotowski|Jerzy Grotowski's]] vision of creating a theatre that made full use of the voice to embody [[Archetype|archetypal]] themes. Furthermore, both Hart and [[Jerzy Grotowski|Grotowski]] agreed that [[theatre]] should provoke and stir what [[Carl Jung]] called the [[collective unconscious]] through such portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Flaszen, L. (1975) 'Akropolis – treatment of the text.' In J. Grotowski (ed) Towards a Poor Theatre. London: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grotowski, J. (1987) 'Dziady jako model teatru nowoczesnego.' Wspolczesnosc, 21, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, A. (1987) 'Revelations in Poland.' Plays and Players, 33–34. .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roose-Evans J., ''Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavski to Peter Brook'', 4th edn. London: Routledge, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumiega, J. (1987) The Theatre of Grotowski. London: Methuen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, R. (1995) The Future of Ritual: Writings on Culture and Performance. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Secondly, Hart, citing [[Alfred Wolfsohn]], suggested that the process of [[individuation]] at the heart of [[Analytical Psychology]] developed by [[Carl Jung]] could be achieved artistically and acoustically through [[singing]], as much as through the [[Speech|speaking]] that remained central to the practice of [[psychotherapy]], which commonly revolves around a verbal conversation, originally named the [[Psychoanalysis|Talking Cure]] by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn', Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture, 50: pp65–75, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., Context. Paper read at the Third International Congress of Psychodrama, Vienna, 1968. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Malérargues, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., Lecture read at the Jung Institute in London, 1963. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Malérargues, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., How Voice Gave me a Conscience. Unpublished paper read at the Seventh International Congress for Psychotherapy, Wiesbaden, 1967. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Malérargues, France.&lt;/ref&gt; This attracted the attention and recruited the support of [[psychologist]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s, and other clinicians, including [[Paul Moses]], and contributed to the development of the therapeutic use of arts in clinical settings, including the [[Expressive therapy|expressive arts therapies]], particularly [[drama therapy]] and [[music therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, S., 'Therapeutic theatre: a para-theatrical model of dramatherapy.' In Sue Jennings (ed) Dramatherapy: Theory and Practice, 2. 1992 London Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. Therapeutic Voicework: Principles and Practice for the Use of Singing as a Therapy. London, Jessica Kingsley Publishers 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. (1988) 'Voicework as Therapy: The Artistic use of Vocal Sound to Heal Mind and Body. In S. K. Levine and E. G. Levine (eds) Foundations of Expressive Therapy: Theoretical and Clinical Perspectives. London. Jessica Kingsley Publishers, pp 89 -112.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first few years following [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]] death, Hart continued seeking to gain recognition of [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] vocalization, [[drama]], and [[Experimental music|experimental vocal music]]  as an efficacious form of [[psychotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, L., An Empirical Therapy Based on an Extension of Vocal Range and Expression in Singing and Drama. Paper read at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy, London, August 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1965, members of the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] began working with patients at [[Shenley Hospital|Shenley Psychiatric Hospital]], [[St. Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther, M., The Human Voice, Paper read at the National Conference on Drama Therapy, Antioch University, San Francisco, November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the ten years after [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]] death, the emphasis of the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] shifted substantially towards [[performing arts]], and the potential [[Psychotherapy|therapeutic]] benefits of singing and [[Vocal music|vocalizing]] became subsidiary and secondary to the work and vision of Hart's company.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Paul Newham]] began vocal training with [[Roy Hart Theatre]] member [[Enrique Pardo]], learning techniques derived from [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn]] and Hart. [[Paul Newham|Newham]] subsequently  collaborated with [[Leslie Sheppard]] in analysing the [[Writing|written]], [[phonograph]]ic, and [[photograph]]ic documentation that the [[archivist]] had curated at the [[Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre]].

[[Paul Newham|Newham]] later reformulated and expanded some of the techniques established by [[Alfred Wolfsohn]] and furthered by Hart, proposing the foundations for a form of [[expressive therapy]] based on the use of [[song]], [[prayer]], and other forms of vocal expression. [[Paul Newham|Newham's]] expansion upon  Wolfsohn's and Hart's work was to some degree appropriated into the [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall S, An Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential of Song in Dramatherapy. Dramatherapy. Volume 27, Issue 1, 2005. pp13-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Baker and Sylka Uhlig (Eds.) Voicework in Music Therapy.

(1999) Using Voice and Song in Therapy. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. (1999) Using Voice and Theatre in Therapy. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of [[song]] in mainstream [[Psychotherapy|therapeutic]] practice remains marginal. At the time of [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]], Hart's and [[Paul Newham|Newham's]] work, there was scant scientific research into the clinical use of singing, whist today there is some evidence to indicate the possible rehabilitative and therapeutic application of nonverbal musical vocalization with some populations.&lt;ref&gt;Wan CY, Rüber T, Hohmann A, Schlaug G.

==Performances==

When Hart began teaching acting classes in [[London]], he appropriated adaptations of [[Alfred Wolfsohn|Wolfsohn's]] [[extended vocal technique]] and also introduced and developed his own physical exercises that involved extensive bodily movement. These exercises became part of the training and [[rehearsal]] process undertaken  by Roy Hart's theatre company, leading to performances that were often described as an example of [[physical theatre]].

In 1965 the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] company began rehearsing a performance of the ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'', and having met [[Philip Vellacott]], used his translation. Initial presentations of the ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'' were attended by [[Peter Brook]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Irene Worth]], [[Jean Louis Barrault]], and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P. 'The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre'. New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Maxwell Davies|Maxwell Davies]] subsequently composed a full length piece for Roy Hart called ''[[Eight Songs for a Mad King]]''. The world premier of this piece was performed at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], [[London]], on 22 April 1969, with subsequent performances given internationally. In a review of ''Eight Songs for a Mad King'' in the newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'', [[Heinz Joachim]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Roy Hart is an artist who commands not only all the voices of the human register – ranging from the deepest bass to the highest soprano, but also (incredibly enough) the ability to produce several sounds simultaneously; added to which he gives an acting performance which stretches from the most tender allusiveness to the most macabre realism. All this is (as banal as the formulation may sound) simply phenomenal, unique, sensational. Yet it lay beyond all 'sensation'. It was so deeply stamped by immediate experience; it was the art of presentation which, at every moment, uses the means available in a conscious way, and yet never transgresses the borderline that leads to trash...the solo part is specifically written for Roy Hart. Probably no other artist could realise this part so penetratingly.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, H, (newspaper), Die Welt, 20 October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1969 and 1974, Roy Hart presented the world premier of a work composed especially for him by [[Hans Werner Henze]] entitled ''Versuch über Schweine'', performed with the [[English Chamber Orchestra]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in [[London]]. He also performed  a piece by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] called ''[[Spiral (Stockhausen)|Spiral]]'', which the composer adapted for Hart's voice.&lt;ref&gt;Pikes, N.

Reviewing a performance at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Round House]], [[Herbert Kretzmer]] wrote in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On an enormous poster on the walls of the Round House are painted the words: 'Language is dead. Long live the voice.' Inside the building about two dozen dedicated and mostly very young people celebrate and explore and bend the human voice…Watching this is like chancing upon a group therapy session in full cry. Rejecting the repressive and limiting cadences of traditional languages, they croak, scream, cry like seagulls, sing sweetly, and shout hoarsely. The impact and the insight are sometimes stunning. I have never seen actors giving quite so much of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Kretzmer, H., 'Stunning – this Trip with the Human Voice', Daily Express (newspaper), Cited in 'Roy Hart Theatre', unpublished anthology of reviews, extracts from articles and other material, compiled by Barrie Coghlan with assistance from Noah Pikes in 1979. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Malérargues, France.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to London-based performances, Roy Hart performed pieces at festivals and venues in [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. Some were solo performances by Hart, others used the whole [[Roy Hart Theatre]] troupe, including ''Mariage de Lux'' by [[Serge Béhar]], and ''Ich Bin'' by [[Paul Pörtner]], both works especially written for the group. The [[Roy Hart Theatre]] also collaborated with some of the actors from [[Peter Brook|Peter Brook's]] troupe in a devised performance.&lt;ref&gt;Roose-Evans J., ''Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavsky to Peter Brook'', 4th edn.

In ''[[Lettres Françaises]]'' under the title of "Voice and Madness – Echo of the Origin of Man", [[Catherine Clément]] described her experience of witnessing a performance by the [[Roy Hart Theatre]] as like being in the presence of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].

[[File:Maléragues 5945.jpg|thumb|Le chateau de Malérargues]]
In the summer of 1974, the group of performers known as The [[Roy Hart Theatre]], which included some who like Hart had worked with Alfred Wolfsohn for many years, as well as others who had studied acting with Hart, moved to the Chateau de Malérargues, in [[Thoiras]], near [[Saint-Jean-du-Gard]], in southern [[France]] intending to establish a permanent rehearsal studio, theatre, and training school to explore further the artistic application of the [[extended vocal technique]].

A year later, Roy Hart, along with his wife and a third member of the troupe, died in a car accident. However, the group retained the name [[Roy Hart Theatre]], and continued to perform locally, nationally, and internationally, as well as teaching [[extended vocal technique]] to [[actor]]s and [[singer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Newham, P.

[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of Suzuki method students performing on violin.]]
{{Music Education|major}}
The '''Suzuki method''' is an internationally known music curriculum and teaching philosophy dating from the mid-20th century, created by Japanese [[violin]]ist and pedagogue [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] (1898–1998). The method aims to create an [[Nature versus nurture|environment]] for learning music which parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good [[moral character]].

==Background==
{{quote|I want to make good citizens.  If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance.  He gets a beautiful heart.|Shinichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Suzuki, a Japanese [[violin]]ist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of [[World War II]]. As a skilled violinist but a beginner at the [[German language]] who struggled to learn it, Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, and even dialects adults consider "difficult" to learn are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their [[first language|native language]], they have the necessary ability to become proficient on a musical instrument.  

He pioneered the idea that preschool age children could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body.  He modeled his method, which he called {{nihongo|"Talent Education"|才能教育|sainō kyōiku}}, after his theories of natural [[language acquisition]]. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with "noble hearts" (as opposed to creating famous musical [[child prodigy|prodigies]]).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|''...all'' children can be well educated...|Shin'ichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their [[Nature versus nurture|environment]].  The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the "right environment" for learning music (he believed that this positive environment would also help to foster excellent [[moral character|character]] in every student).  These components include:

*Saturation in the musical [[community]]. 
::This includes attending local classical music [[concert]]s, developing friendships with other music students, and listening to recordings of professional musicians in the home every day, starting before birth if possible.
*Deliberate avoidance of musical aptitude tests or [[audition]]s to begin music study. 
::Suzuki believed that teachers who test for musical aptitude before taking students, or who look only for "talented" students, are limiting themselves to people who have already started their music education. Just as every child is expected to learn their native language, Suzuki expected every child to be able to learn to play music.
*Emphasis on playing from a very young age,
::typically starting formal instruction between the ages of three and five years old.  (See [[Suzuki method#Technique|Technique]]).
*Using well-trained teachers.
::Suzuki believed in training musicians not only to be better musicians but also to be better teachers. Suzuki Associations worldwide offer ongoing teacher-training programs to prospective and continuing Suzuki teachers.  
*In the beginning, [[learning music by ear]] is emphasized over reading written [[musical notation]].  
::Suzuki observed that children speak before learning to read, and thought that children should also be able to play music before learning to read. To support learning by ear, students are expected to listen to recordings of the music they are learning daily. Other methods—such as [[Simply Music]], the Gordon Music Learning Theory, and Conversational Solfège—have students playing before reading notes, but may not have the same focus on daily listening and learning by ear.
*Memorization of all solo repertoire is expected.
::The focus on memorization continues even after a student begins to use [[sheet music]] to learn new pieces. 
*Music theory and note reading are left to the teacher. 
::The Suzuki method does not include a formal plan or prescribe specific materials for introducing music theory &amp; reading, in part because Suzuki created the method in a culture where music literacy was routinely taught in schools.
*Regular playing in groups (including playing pieces in [[unison]]) is strongly encouraged.
*Retaining and reviewing every piece of music ever learned is also strongly encouraged. 
::This is intended to raise technical and musical ability. Review pieces, along with "preview" parts of music a student is yet to learn, are often used in place of the more traditional [[etude]] books.  Traditional etudes and technical studies are not used in the beginning stages, which focus almost exclusively on a set of performance pieces.
*Frequent public performance makes performing feel like a natural and enjoyable part of being a musician.

The method discourages competitive attitudes between players, and advocates collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level.  However, this does not mean the elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.

The parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day, instead of leaving the child to practice alone between lessons, and to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively. This element of the method is so prominent that a newspaper article once dubbed it "The Mom-Centric Method."&lt;ref name="meyermom"&gt;Meyer, Constance (2003-09-07). The Mom-centric method. LA Times, 7 September 2003. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/07/entertainment/ca-meyer7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Although Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a "school of violin playing" (like the French or the Russian schools of playing) whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin.  However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of "tonalization", were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method.  Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each [[academic discipline|discipline]].

*'''Tonalization''' is a term coined by Suzuki, and is deliberately similar to the word "vocalization" (as it is used by singers when they talk about warming up their voices).  Tonalization is defined as the student's ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments such as the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music (Lavie, Karen, New Zealand Suzuki Journal, 2005).  Outside the Suzuki method, the term used is "tone production," and is part of Western music education stretching back to its beginning. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*Using '''[[sound recording]]s''' is another technique common to all the musical instruments taught in the Suzuki method.  Thibeault's (2018) history of Suzuki's mediated pedagogy presents Suzuki as a technological innovator who created new ways of learning from sound recordings. Pre-recorded music is used to help students learn notes, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[rhythm]], and beautiful tone quality [[learning music by ear|by ear]]. Suzuki pointed out that great artists (such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) were surrounded with excellent performances from birth, and that the advent of recording technology made this aspect of their environment possible to achieve for large numbers of "ordinary" people whose parents were not themselves great musicians &amp; music teachers like [[Leopold Mozart|Mozart's father]] was.  So-called "traditional" (that is, not Suzuki trained) music educators have used this technique since the earliest days of recording technology; the difference in the Suzuki method is the scale on which Suzuki systematically insisted on daily listening in the home, from before birth if possible, and his focus on using recordings of beginner's repertoire alongside recordings of advanced repertoire.
*"Adult" sized '''instruments are adapted''' to meet the demands of a small child's body in various ways.  This lowers the age at which people are developmentally ready to begin studying an instrument.  Scaled down instrument sizes are used for children studying [[stringed instruments]]. Curved headjoint flutes with displaced keys which are closer together than normal flute keys &amp; holes are also available making it possible for children as young as 3 years old to study the flute through the Suzuki method.  Height adjustable chairs, benches, and footrests are used for piano, guitar, cello, and string bass.  Although fractional sized student violins were available when Suzuki began to teach, the success and popularity of his idea that pre-school aged children could also learn to play prompted [[luthier|violinmakers]] to scale violins down to even smaller [[violin#Sizes|sizes]] than before.
*'''Suzuki Institutes''' were established to encourage a musical community, train teachers, and provide a place where master teachers' ideas can be spread to the whole community of Suzuki students, teachers and parents.  These short term music festivals began in Matsumoto, Japan, where teachers &amp; students came to learn from Suzuki.  In the US, they often last for a week or two and include daily [[masterclass]]es; repertoire (group) classes; teacher training courses; concerts; discussion sessions; seminars; and various 'enrichment' classes in different musical styles, instruments, or non-musical (usually arts, crafts, or dancing) activities.  As at any music festival, participants must pay registration and tuition fees to the institute they are attending.  Each national Suzuki association handles registration for teacher training, and policies differ from country to country.
*A '''common repertoire''' for all students of an instrument was established.  This body of music allows each student to participate in group classes, helps foster local and international musical community and camaraderie, and provides motivation for students to learn new music while keeping the 'old' pieces they have learned in top form.  This is in direct contrast to music education outside of the method, in which teachers tailor the repertoire to the current need and level of the individual student.

==Repertoire==
{{quote|...If it is true that "everything in music is preparation" (Gerhart Zimmermann), then the genius of Suzuki is truly expressed in the scope and sequencing of the music....|Edward Kreitman}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The core Suzuki literature is published on [[sound recording|audio recordings]] and in [[sheet music]] books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading.  One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make quality recordings of the beginners' pieces widely available, performed by professional musicians. Many traditional (non-Suzuki trained) music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire, often to supplement their [[curriculum]], and they adapt the music to their own philosophies of teaching.

Another innovation of Suzuki was to deliberately leave out the large amount of technical instructions and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day.  He favored a focus on melodic [[song]]-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises.  Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.

Suzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide, and although it focuses on Western European "classical" music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers: one does not have to share the ethnic or national origin of the composers in order to learn or share the music. Suzuki created a series of rhythmic variations on the theme "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", using rhythms from more advanced literature in units small enough for a beginner to grasp quickly.  Although these variations were created for violin, most of the instruments use them as a starting point for their repertoire.

===Violin===
The violin method was compiled and edited by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Suzuki]].  In ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki's [[Variation (music)|Variations]] on "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" and ending with two [[Mozart]] concertos.  The first 3 books are mostly graded [[arrangements]] of music not originally written for solo violin, although book 1 contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin &amp; piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as [[Bach]], [[Telemann]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Beethoven]], [[Schubert]], [[Handel]], [[Paganini]], [[Boccherini]] and [[Brahms]]. Books 4–10 continue the graded selection by incorporating 'standard' or 'traditional' student violin solos by [[Fritz Seitz|Seitz]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Bach]], [[Veracini]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]], [[Rameau]], [[Handel]], [[Mozart]], [[Fiocco]], and others. The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in books 6-8. The SAA supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by Bach, [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and others (Suggested Supplementary Repertoire, 2013, and Preucil, 1985).

Audio recordings for books 1–4 are available in separate albums by artists such as [[David Nadien]], [[David Cerone]], Yukari Tate and Shin'ichi Suzuki. More recent recordings of volumes 1–4 by William Preucil, Jr. were released in 2007, along with revised versions of the first 4 books.  Recordings for books 5–8 have been made by [[Koji Toyoda]], although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artist's albums. In 2008 [[Takako Nishizaki]] made a complete set of recordings of Books 1-8 for [[Naxos Records]]. There are no official recordings of books 9 and 10 but these books, simply being Mozart's A major and D major violin concertos, have readily available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]],
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]].

===Viola===
The viola repertoire is in nine volumes, compiled and edited by [[Doris Preucil]]. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the [[Baroque]] period. The first 3 volumes have been arranged (or [[transposition (music)|transposed]]) almost directly from the first 3 violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature.  The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Viola volumes 4-8 include works by [[Telemann]], [[Henri Casadesus|Casadesus]], [[Bach]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]],and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]. Books 1–4 have been recorded on two albums by [[William Preucil]], and the rest are available in separate albums.

===Cello===
The cello repertoire is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes, and the first distinct piece (the second) being "French Folk Song".  Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi performs volumes 1 through 4. Volumes 4–10 contain works by: [[Vivaldi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[David Popper|Popper]], [[Breval]], [[Goltermann]], [[William Henry Squire|Squire]], [[Bach]], [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]], [[Henry Eccles|Eccles]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[von Goens]], [[Sammartini]], [[Haydn]], and [[Boccherini]].

===Piano===
The piano repertoire is composed of seven volumes. The first book begins with Variations on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second book, there are pieces written by [[classical period (music)|romantic, classical]] and [[baroque music|baroque]] composers, such as Robert Schumann, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with Minuet 1,  Minuet 2 and the Gigue from Partita in B{{Music|b}} by J.S. Bach.  The fifth book begins with the famous "[[Für Elise]]" by Beethoven and includes Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn.  The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major, K.545 by W.A. Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major by [[Mozart]].  This book also includes "[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]" by [[Handel]] and Romanian Folk Dances by Béla Bartók. There are also many [[minuet]]s in the second book. The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published.  The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been shifted to another volume.  The book/CD combo for Revised Books 4-7 is now available, and was performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.

===Bass===
Currently there are five printed volumes in the [[double bass]] series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). Volume 1 and 2 contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by [[Handel]], [[Gossec]], [[Beethoven]], [[Bach]], Webster, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. Famous pieces include: The Elephant from [[Carnival of the Animals]] by Saint-Saëns, [[Ode to Joy]] by Beethoven, and Largo from the [[New World Symphony]] by Dvořák.

===Flute===
The flute repertoire is compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi. In fourteen volumes, beginning with [[Mary Had a Little Lamb]] and ending in the Flute Concerto by [[Otaka]]. Also included are concerti by [[Mozart]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Ibert]] and [[Quantz]]. Students also study music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Michel Blavet|Blavet]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and other major composers.

===Recorder===
There are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder.  The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", several Bach Minuets, etc.  Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.

===Guitar===
The [[classical guitar]] repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay.  The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the [[lute]] in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by [[Gaspar Sanz|Sanz]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Matteo Carcassi|Carcassi]], [[Mauro Giuliani|Giuliani]], [[Fernando Sor|Sor]], [[Francisco Tárrega|Tarrega]], [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]], [[Alonso Mudarra|Mudarra]], and Yocoh's [[Sakura Sakura|Sakura]] Variations.  Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown.  George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and [[William Kanengiser]] recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of [[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]] in book 9, which was recorded by [[Scott Tennant]].

===Harp===
The harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes.  This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique.  Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note.  Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.&lt;ref&gt;http://suzukiharpinfo.com/whats-new-suzuki-harp/book-status/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
The voice repertoire is in five Levels.  Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.

===Organ===
The [[pipe organ]] repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998.  Currently Volumes 1-4 have been published, Volumes 5 &amp; 6 will be published shortly, and material for Volumes 7 &amp; 8 is being researched. (Suzuki Organ website, 2010). As of 2011, an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===Mandolin===
The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.

===Early childhood education and Suzuki in the schools===
Although [[early childhood education]] (ECE) is not an instrument, a curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE has been developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O'Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI).  Also, a "modified" Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes &amp; string orchestras in schools.

===Trumpet===
Trumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association's list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).

===Supplemental materials===
Supplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, [[duet]]s, [[trio (music)|trio]]s, [[string orchestra]], and [[string quartet]] arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.

==Historical notes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In the late 19th century, Japan's borders were [[Meiji period#Economy|opened to trade with the outside world]], and in particular to the importation of [[Western Culture]].  As a result of this, Suzuki's father, who owned a company which had manufactured the [[Shamisen]], began to manufacture [[violin]]s instead. (''Nurture by Love'' Documentary) In his youth, Shin'ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a [[phonograph]] recording of [[Franz Schubert]]'s Ave Maria, as played on violin by [[Mischa Elman]].  Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father's factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]".  His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son's social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument.  At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him.  Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

At age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies.  While there, he studied privately with [[Karl Klingler]], but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma.  He met and became friends with [[Albert Einstein]], who encouraged him in learning classical music.  He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud.(Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

In 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], [[Japan]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]].  Raising children with "noble hearts" (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and "nurtured by love" in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. (Hermann, 1981)

Eventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto.  TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees).  Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers.  These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in [[Africa]]), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).

[[John D. Kendall]] of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (''Nurtured by Love'' Documentary). [[Vilem Sokol]] of the [[Seattle Youth Symphony]] hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system.  Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include [[Roland and Almita Vamos]], Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, [[Betty Haag]], Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A '''target tug''' is an [[aircraft]] which tows an unmanned [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], a fabric [[drogue]] or other kind of [[wiktionary:target|target]], for the purposes of [[gun]] or [[missile]] target practice. Target tugs are often conversions of transport and utility aircraft, as well as obsolescent combat types. Some, such as the [[Miles Martinet]], were specially designed for the role. It was, and is, a relatively hazardous job, as [[Live fire exercise|live fire]] is typically employed and the people doing the shooting are usually still in training.

==History==
===World War 2===
[[File:IWM ATP 12826D.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boulton Paul Defiant]] TT Mk III target tug, number ''N1697''; [[RAF Desford]], May 1944. Note the wind-driven generator that provided power for the target winch]]
Prior to and during [[World War II]] target tugs were typically operated by the [[Air Force|air arms]] on behalf of which they flew, and were usually conversions of aircraft that had failed in combat or that were otherwise unsuitable or obsolete in their design roles (see [[Fairey Battle]] and [[Short Sturgeon]]). These aircraft typically trailed a [[drogue]] fabric sleeve at the end of a several-thousand metre long cable. Student [[fighter pilot]]s or [[air gunner]]s would shoot at the target from other aircraft using painted bullets so that hits could be recorded and later analysed.

In the RAF, [[Miles Master]] IIs were used for this purpose as part of the Target Towing Flight at the Central Gunnery School whilst the School was based at [[RAF Sutton Bridge]] from April 1942 to March 1944. Other aircraft used in this role were the [[Hawker Henley]], the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]] and the [[Westland Lysander]], although the [[RAF]] was by no means the only air arm to use target tugs. They were used by most air forces. The USAAF used older aircraft such as the [[TBD Devastator]] as target tugs, and the Luftwaffe and the VVS (Red Army) also used them.

The chief modifications to the aircraft were a station for the [[drogue]] operator and a winch to reel in the cable prior to landing. The winch was typically powered by a small [[wind-turbine]] on the outside of the aircraft, driven by the airflow and attached to the winch via a [[clutch]]. Such devices are still used by some [[aerial refueling tanker]]s to retract the refueling hose after the operation is completed. The drogue would often be jettisoned at some location convenient for recovery prior to the aircraft's landing. The drogue itself caused a great deal of drag and could be dangerous, particularly to less-powerful aircraft. If the engine failed, the drag from the drogue could be enough to reduce the airspeed of the aircraft below [[stall speed]] before the drogue could be jettisoned (see [[Hawker Henley]]).

===Post-War===
[[File:Fairey Firefly TT.1 SE-CAW Svensk Flyg RWY 09.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Fairey Firefly TT.1 target tug, painted mustard yellow, of Svensk Flygtjanst at [[Manchester Airport|Manchester (Ringway Airport)]] in 1955]] 
The use of such aircraft continued post-war, although a trend developed whereby ex-military aircraft were purchased, modified and operated by civilian companies under contract. Deutsche-Luftfahrt Beratungsdienst of [[West Germany]] and Svensk Flygtjänst AB of [[Sweden]] were two notable companies in the field in the post-war years, operating such types as the [[Hawker Sea Fury]], [[Fairey Firefly]] and [[Douglas Skyraider]]. Many air arms however continued to operate target tugs on their own behalf.

In later years the use of civilian companies expanded significantly worldwide, with many companies forming or entering the field in the 1960s and 1970s. The trend was still to use ex-military aircraft, for example Fawcett Aviation in [[Australia]] used two ex-[[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[North American Mustang|CAC Mustangs]] from 1960 until the latter part of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Mustangs of the RAAF and RNZAF'' Peter N. Anderson. A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed. {{ISBN|0-589-07130-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Flight Systems Inc. commenced operations at [[Mojave, California]] with [[Canadair Sabre]]s converted as QF-86E missile targets, the first aircraft making its first unmanned flight in April 1975; this company later also operated Sabres as target tugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://f-86.tripod.com/fsi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020403005249/http://f-86.tripod.com/fsi.html |archivedate=2002-04-03 |df= }} Retrieved 2007-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; Flight Systems Inc was later purchased by [[Tracor]] and these operations are still performed by [[BAE Systems Inc.|BAE Systems Flight Systems]] with [[Douglas A-4|Douglas Skyhawks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landings.com Online search of US civil aircraft register database performed July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of using ex-military aircraft as target tugs (and of air arms retaining older aircraft themselves for such use) resulted in them surviving into an era where such aircraft became desirable as [[Warbird]]s; many former target tugs are now to be found on the [[airshow]] circuit or under restoration to fly, and in aviation museums.

==Current usage==
[[File:Dassault.falcon20.g-frak.arp.jpg|thumb|FR Aviation Services Dassault Falcon 20 modified for target towing at the 2006 [[Royal International Air Tattoo]]]]
Today, more air arms have turned to civilian companies for provision of target towing services. Many companies operating in this field today do so using modified [[corporate jet]] aircraft instead of ex-military aircraft. Advantages of operating civil aircraft types include ease of registration (it being difficult in many countries to register ex-military jets as civil aircraft), ease of maintenance and lower operating costs when compared to ex-military aircraft. Companies active in 2007 providing target towing services include [[Cobham plc|FR Aviation Services Ltd.]] in the [[UK]] and associated companies AVdef (in [[France]]) and Falcon Special Air Services (in [[Malaysia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fraviation.com/about.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528160229/http://www.fraviation.com/about.aspx |archivedate=2007-05-28 |df= }} Retrieved 2007-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Dassault Falcon 20|Falcon 20s]]; [[Pel-Air]] in [[Australia]] using [[Gates Learjet|Learjets]] and (in something of a reversal of recent trends) EIS Aircraft Gmbh in [[Germany]] using [[Pilatus PC-9]] aircraft.

Target towing operations are not without risk. On September 17, 1994 a Golden Eagle Aviation [[Learjet 35|Lear 35A]] was accidentally shot down by a ship of the [[Taiwanese Navy]] during a [[live-fire exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19940917-1 Retrieved 2007-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, another Lear 35A [[2014 Olsberg mid-air collision|crashed in Germany]] with an [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] during a training exercise with the [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27979964 |title=German fighter and Learjet collide- one confirmed dead}} Retrieved 2018-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Uganda Rural Fund. Web. 3 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  URF attempts to give community members the tools and resources to better their own lives and the lives of those around them.

==History==
Uganda Rural Fund began in 2005, when John Mary Lugemwa, OSB, Peter Francis Luswata, and Rev. Mike Lillpopp discussed setting up an organization to help rural Ugandans,&lt;ref name=Giardina&gt;. Giardina, Michael. "RHS Grad Helps Bring Hope to Ugandan Village."

Radio.&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of contacts across the globe, they created the organization.&lt;ref name="Ogle"/&gt; The organization began with two branches, one in Uganda and one in the United States. It briefly expanded to a third branch in Canada.,&lt;ref name=Rafael&gt;Rafael, Philip. "Dynamic Duo." ''South Delta Leader'' [Delta, British Columbia]. 20 Nov. 2008: 14.

Web. 29 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

URF's initial project was to build a school on land donated by the Waliggo family,&lt;ref name=OurHistory&gt;"Our History." ''hopeacademyuganda.'' Hope Integrated Academy.  8 Aug. 2009. Web. 1 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in the small village of Molubere, near Kyetume village, in the Masaka District.&lt;ref name=OurHistory /&gt;  From its groundbreaking in January 2006 to its opening on May 26, 2008,&lt;ref name=Giardina /&gt; Hope Integrated Academy relied volunteers both in Uganda and throughout the world.,&lt;ref name=Alderson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alderson2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;Becker, Greg.

URF attempted to find sustainable methods&lt;ref name=Giardina /&gt; and on-going solutions to community needs.&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt;  Following this aim, URF changed paradigms in 2011 to let the communities served, rather than people associated with URF, identify needs and to have URF play a supporting role,&lt;ref name=model&gt;“Community Visits Paving Way for a New URF Service Delivery Model.” ''ugandaruralfund.''

==Branches==

===Uganda===
URF-Uganda, which is a registered [[community-based organization]] (CBO), serves as the home base for URF and is responsible for most of the on-the-ground aspects of the organization. This branch is the most directly involved in all of URF's activities.&lt;ref name=Aanyu&gt;Aanyu, Rehema. "Masaka Orphans Get Free Houses" ''New Vision'' [Uganda]. 2 Sept. 2009. ''Lexis Nexis Academic.'' Web. 29 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kampala Chapter is a group of "young professionals and university students" who support URF's mission, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref name=Kampala&gt;"URF Kampala Chapter." ''ugandaruralfund.'' Uganda Rural Fund. Web. 1 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
URF-USA is a registered [[501(c)3]] organization. It was incorporated in the state of [[Massachusetts]] in 2005,&lt;ref name=AboutURF&gt;"About Uganda Rural Fund." ''ugandaruralfund.'' Uganda Rural Fund. n.d. Web. 1 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but has groups all over the United States.&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt; The functions of this branch are of a more supportive nature. This branch helps raise awareness, raises funding,&lt;ref name=Kandarian&gt;Kandarian, Paul E. "Helping to House Ugandan Orphans." ''The Boston Globe.'' 30 Nov. 2008: Reg8.&lt;/ref&gt; and coordinates volunteers.&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt;

===Canada===
URF-Canada no longer exists.,&lt;ref name=Rafael /&gt;&lt;ref name=URFCanada /&gt;  It also took a supporting role to URF-Uganda.

==Projects==

===Education===
URF’s initial project, Hope Integrated Academy is a secondary school and vocational school,.&lt;ref name=Giardina /&gt;&lt;ref name=SocialServices&gt;"Social Services." ''The Berkshire Eagle'' [Pittsfield, MA]. 25 Oct. 2006. ''Massachusetts Newsstand.'' Web. 29 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vocation&gt;"Vocational programs." ''hopeacademyuganda.'' Hope Integrated Academy. 8 Aug. 2009. Web. 1 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Students receive instruction in accordance with the guidelines set out by Uganda's Ministry of Education (see [[education in Uganda]] for more information). These classes are supplemented with extra life-skill and business-skill courses.&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt;  
Hope Integrated Academy was intended to serve orphans, especially those whose parents had died from the complications of [[AIDS]], as well as youth who could not afford to attend school.,&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Internship /&gt;  Some students pay tuition fees and others’ costs are covered by sponsors.&lt;ref name=Aanyu /&gt;

URF provides other educational services.  Hope Integrated Academy offers an after school program with both instructional and recreational activities.,&lt;ref name=Alderson2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;  URF holds adult [[literacy]] classes and [[computer]] classes.,&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Panian /&gt;

The school houses a small [[library]] and a computing center.,&lt;ref name=Panian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholarship&gt;"SJU Student Receives Peace and Justice Scholarship." ''Community: A Newsletter for the Faculty and Staff of the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University.'' Nov. 2006: 4. Web. 29 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of these resources are geared towards the students attending Hope, they are also open to the public.,&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Durken&gt;Durken, Daniel, OSB. "What's Up?: The Abbey Chronicle." ''The Abbey Banner: Magazine of Saint John's Abbey.'' Saint John's Abbey. Spring, 2007: 20-21. Web. 29 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Development===
URF has several community development projects.  These projects include a number of youth clubs and programs, Women’s groups, and Men’s groups. The organization puts on various workshops.&lt;ref name=Ogle /&gt;&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;&lt;ref name=SocialServices /&gt; It also provides such things as village banking services and microfinance.&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;

URF has also assisted Nazareth Children's home, a nearby [[orphanage]],&lt;ref name=Alderson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuntz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kandarian /&gt; and provided support services to child-headed families—families in which older children care for younger siblings after the parents have died.&lt;ref name=Aanyu /&gt;

URF sponsors a number of agricultural programs that promote sustainability. Most of them function similarly to [[Heifer International]] in that individuals and families are provided with an animal or bit of seeds and are then expected to pass on some of the offspring or resulting seeds to other community members.&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;

During the March 2010 [[mudslide]]s in Uganda, URF helped provide emergency supplies.  Some of the orphans collected food door-to-door.  This type of disaster care was relatively new to Ugandan culture.&lt;ref name=Panian /&gt;

With the new Community Participatory Development Model, URF encouraged local villagers to identify and prioritize needs.,&lt;ref name=model /&gt;&lt;ref name=participatory /&gt;&lt;ref name=outreach /&gt;&lt;ref name=empowered /&gt;

===Health Services Projects===
As possible, URF provides health services to the community. Services include health education, direct care, and transportation to a hospital,&lt;ref name=Rafael /&gt;&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;  URF, in partnership with [[Uganda Cares]], has offered "free HIV testing and counseling".&lt;ref name=HIVAIDS /&gt;  URF worked to reduce the threat of Malaria. For example, part of the reason for building a new dormitory at Nazareth Children's home was that the existing building did not keep out mosquitoes, which contributed to the spread of Malaria.&lt;ref name=Kandarian /&gt; The organization also distributed mosquito nets.&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6074">The study of '''real estate''' at the undergraduate level is commonly contained as a degree of Bachelor of Science in Real Estate or a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in real estate.  A very limited number of universities offer a full "Bachelor of Science in Real Estate" and have "Real Estate" departments in their respective Colleges within the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cob.fsu.edu/content/download/169088/1479911/file/REE-2014-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bus.wisc.edu/bba/academics-and-programs/majors/real-estate|title=Real Estate|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the maturity of [[Graduate real estate education|Master of Real Estate Development]] programs, universities are now looking at also offering specialized undergraduate education in real estate.

Many of the programs ranked by ''U.S. News and World Report'' are Bachelor of Business Administration or Bachelor of Science programs though some, such as [[University of Florida]], [[Cornell University]], and [[University of Illinois]], only offer minors in Real Estate or majors in Finance "with emphasis in Real Estate".&lt;ref name="ufl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warrington.ufl.edu/departments/fire/|title=Department of Finance, Insurance &amp; Real Estate - Warrington|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realestate.cornell.edu/|title=Real Estate at Cornell University|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.illinois.edu/finance/courses9.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; While business schools continue to attract future real estate professionals, many critics of business education have many complaints. Some say the schools have become too scientific, too detached from real-world issues. Others say students are taught to come up with hasty solutions to complicated problems. Another group contends that schools give students a limited and distorted view of their role - that they graduate with a focus on maximizing shareholder value and only a limited understanding of ethical and social considerations essential to business leadership. Such shortcomings may have left business school graduates inadequately prepared to make the decisions that, taken together, might have helped mitigate the financial and real estate crisis, critics say.&lt;ref&gt;http://network.nationalpost.com/NP/blogs/fpposted/archive/2010/03/17/why-a-liberal-arts-education-can-best-prepare-business-leaders.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative course of study to an undergraduate degree in business or real estate is the liberal arts, such as [[economics]], [[public administration]], [[urban planning]], or [[geography]].  An aspiring real estate professional may supplement his education with a [[Master of Real Estate Development]] degree, a common prerequisite for many institutional and corporate real estate firms.

==Business school rankings==

The [[U.S. News and World Report]] ranks the top 13 undergraduate programs which offer a study in real estate.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-real-estate&lt;/ref&gt; However, many schools on the U.S. News and World Reports list (University of Florida&lt;ref name="ufl.edu"/&gt; and Cornell University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/academics/degree-requirements/concentrations-minors/real-estate-minor.html|title=Undergraduate Minor in Real Estate - Cornell SHA|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.cornell.edu/|title=Real Estate at Cornell University|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example)  do not actually offer undergraduate degrees (majors) in Real Estate, and alternatively run a "focus" or "minor" in Real Estate under their Finance departments.  Additionally there are many non-business schools that offer other real estate related degrees. The International Council of Shopping Centers provides an alternative list of active "Real Estate" institutions: http://www.icsc.org/student/resources_undergrad.php

==Notable Faculty==

===Frank Sherwood Rowland===
[[Frank Sherwood Rowland]] was one of the original professors for the University of California, Irvine and became the first Chairman of the Chemistry Department in August 1964. He eventually retired from his Chairman position five years later, but by 1973 Rowland changed his research focus from radiochemistry to atmospheric chemistry. In 1995, Atmospheric Chemist [[Frank Sherwood Rowland|F. Sherwood Rowland]], along with his colleague [[Mario Molina]] both predicted and proved that the ozone layer was being depleted by [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFC's), which was a common compound found in aerosol sprays. They both were awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery since then continued to research on the chemical effects towards the environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/rowland-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frederick Reines===
[[Frederick Reines|Dr.Frederick Reines]] began his research to prove the existence of the [[neutrino]], one of the smallest subatomic particle structures, in 1918. When he came to serve as the founding Dean of Physical Sciences of the University of California, Irvine in 1966 he brought his research along with him. However, by 1974, Reines stepped down as the Dean in order to focus on his research and teaching as a professor. Eventually, Dr. Reined along with his colleague [[Clyde Cowan]] developed a method to detect the neutrino. This led him to receive his 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics. As a faculty member for UCI he received the Distinguished Faculty Lecturer Award in 1979 and the Medal for Outstanding Research in 1985, predating his Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1995/reines-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irwin Rose===
[[Irwin Rose]] was a researcher within the School of Medicine but did extensive collaboration with the School of Physical Sciences. In 1997, Rose moved to the facilities in UCI while sharing a space with Ralph Bradshaw. Dr. Rose, along with colleagues at the [[Israel Institute of Technology]] discovered a major pathway in the body which proteins are regulated by degradation. Because [[ubiquitin]] is an important molecule that impacts cell growth and division, malfunctions or improper breakdowns of ubiquitin causes diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[cystic fibrosis]]. In 2004, Dr. Rose received a Nobel Prize in the field of Chemistry for his discoveries. Since then, he received the Nobel Laureate Parking Permit at UCI, which gives him free parking for a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2004/rose-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Gibraltar''' is a not-for-profit independent [[tertiary institution]] that was established by The University of Gibraltar Act 2015. The Act provides for the establishment or designation of bodies to safeguard the academic standards of the [[university]] and to regulate the conduct of its affairs. The Act also grants the university the right and the power to award degrees (including research and honorary degrees), diplomas and certificates. The university [[curriculum]] portfolio specialises in areas that build on place and partnerships, with a focus on professional engagement and recognition of regional research policy and practice needs, as well as, the building of local capability. In addition, the university has the objective of contributing to Gibraltarian identity, history, current affairs and its role in the future economic, social and sustainable development of [[Gibraltar]].

==Governance==
The University of Gibraltar follows the UK model of education and governance. It appointed Professor [[Daniella Tilbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elmes|first1=John|title=Q&amp;A with Daniella Tilbury|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/daniella-tilbury-university-of-gloucestershire-question-and-answer|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Times Higher Education|publisher=TES Global|date=Q&amp;A with Daniella Tilbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its inaugural [[Vice-Chancellor]] and CEO in March 2015. [[Lord Luce]] was appointed as the inaugural Chancellor in Sept 2015. The University of Gibraltar Act 2015 explicitly defines the academic freedom and institutional autonomy of the university. It conferred degree and research degree awarding powers - making it the only institution on the Rock that can award degrees. The Act outlines the responsibilities of the Vice Chancellor and defines the faculties and core areas of specialism of the institution which include business, sports, health, tourism and hospitality as well as environment and life sciences, Gibraltar and Mediterranean studies. It defines the role of the Board of Governors. The university follows UK standards of provision and has adopted the UK Quality Code for Higher Education ([[QAA]]) as its framework.

==History==
===2011 to 2015===
The idea for the University of Gibraltar came about after the formation of the new [[Government of Gibraltar]] by the [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]] in 2011. Plans for the University were officially launched in October 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Release|first1=Press|title=PLANS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF GIBRALTAR FORMALLY LAUNCHED|url=https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/new/sites/default/files/press/2014/Press%20Releases/537-2014.pdf|website=HM Government of Gibraltar|publisher=Government of Gibraltar|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its location on [[Europa Point]].

The University of Gibraltar was formally established in July 2015, at a cost of approximately £10 million to build. The goal was to develop the campus during the first term of office. The campus was opened on 21 September 2015 by the Hon Min Licudi, Minister for Education and Hon [[Fabian Picardo]], Chief Minister. The university officially opened in September 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CLAPPERTON|first1=GUY|title=The new campus on the Rock – part 2|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/newstatesman-gibraltar/special-features/2015/09/new-campus-rock-part-2|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=New Statesman|publisher=Progressive Digital Media|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, also hosting the International Calpe Conference the same month&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= "Redefining the Neanderthals" at this year's Calpe Conference |url= http://www.gbc.gi/news/redefining-neanderthals-years-calpe-conference-30507 |accessdate= 5 October 2017 |work=GBC |agency=Government of Gibraltar |date= 25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At its opening, it became the first degree-granting university in Gibraltar.

In 2015, the university's Vice Chancellor, Professor Daniella Tilbury, represented the university along with Dr Liesl Mesilio-Torres at the 2015 [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dec 07 - Gibraltar Delegation At COP21 Paris Climate Conference|url=https://www.yourgibraltartv.com/society/10713-dec-07-gibraltar-delegation-at-cop21-paris-climate-conference|website=Your Gibraltar TV|publisher=Fourth Estate Limited|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===2016 to 2017===
In early 2016 the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) set up a Centre of Excellence at the University of Gibraltar,[8] conducting training, analysis and research in customs and international trade.
The University also hosted The University Educators for Sustainable Development (UE4SD) international conference. This event brought together 55 partners in 33 countries, aimed to change University education so that it can prepare students, regardless of course or specialisation, to understand and apply global responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= University of Gibraltar to host an international conference in Higher Education for Sustainable Development |url= https://sunewsinfo.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/university-of-gibraltar-to-host-an-international-conference-in-higher-education-for-sustainable-development/ |publisher= The Sustainable University |accessdate= 5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the same year, the University of Gibraltar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mascarenhas|first1=Alice|title=University seeks community feedback|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/03/university-seeks-community-feedback/|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Gibraltar Chronicle|publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  brought together a number of groups, organisations and individuals to help identify the professional needs of various industries and groups in the community. These Key Advisory Groups (KAGs) which comprise professionals in each sector are tasked with contributing to shaping the academic and professional portfolio of the University. Current KAGs include Business, Law, Tourism and Hospitality, and Sport. The University also convenes a Silver Education KAG that advises on the learning aspirations of those aged over 55 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lancaster|first1=Analiese|title=Open Day at The University of Gibraltar|url=http://gibraltarpanorama.gi/15209/203705/a/open-day-at-the-university-of-gibraltar|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Gibraltar Panorama|publisher=Panorama|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The Sports Key Advisory Group chaired by Reagan Lima, CEO of Gibraltar Sports and Leisure Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Chronicle|title=SPORTS KEY ADVISORY GROUP ESTABLISHED|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/05/sports-key-advisory-group-established/|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Gibraltar Chronicle|publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to guide decisions regarding programme and short courses which could be offered in this area. The group explores opportunities regarding formal degrees, professional body qualifications, practical skills and specialist training as well as leadership development offerings in the sports sector.
Two Government of Gibraltar Departments (Department of the Environment and Climate Change and Department of Education) and the University of Gibraltar, have partnered together to advance the transition to a low carbon economy and support innovative practice in local schools. The project is funded by the [[European Commission]] under the [[INTERREG]] programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Chronicle|title=Gib attends Interreg international partners meeting|url=http://chronicle.gi/2017/02/gib-attends-interreg-international-partners-meeting/|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Gibraltar Chronicle|publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Launched in April 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Gibraltar launches Commonwealth Scholarship|url=https://www.acu.ac.uk/news/view?id=167|website=The Association of Commonwealth Universities|publisher=The Association of Commonwealth Universities|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this Scholarship provides an opportunity for researchers who are citizens of the Commonwealth to study at the University. It aims to support excellence in higher education, enhance individual teaching and research capacity, leading to increased institutional capacity in academic and other sectors in Commonwealth countries, and to contribute to Gibraltar's higher education and research, by attracting international candidates and encouraging links and collaboration. Candidates must demonstrate leadership as well as academic potential. 

===Library facilities===
The University of Gibraltar's library houses the new Gibraltar Repository. This repository is a collection of Gibraltar-related material that is currently being collated. It is intended that the Repository will eventually represent the sum total of published material on Gibraltar or by Gibraltarians.

The University established the Gibraltar Libraries Forum in 2016. The Forum includes nine libraries and information holding institutions to which all students have access:

Garrison Library; [[Gibraltar Botanic Gardens]] and [[GONHS]] Library; Gibraltar Health Authority Library; [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust]]; [[Gibraltar Museum]]; Gibraltar National Archives; John Mackintosh Hall Library; University of Gibraltar Library

The forum is seeking to adopt the [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]] &amp; 2013 which will effectively make it a legal requirement that a copy of any material published on Gibraltar is deposited with the Library Forum. It will mean that the Forum would act as a legal depository in the same way as the British Library does in the UK.

===Centre of excellence===
A UNCTAD Centre of Excellence was established at the University of Gibraltar in 2016. The Gibraltar Centre of Excellence provides specialist training programmes for high level international governmental and private sector officials on Customs related matters.

==Campus==
The University of Gibraltar is located further south than any other in Europe with a clear sight of five lighthouses in three countries: Gibraltar, Morocco and Spain and two continents, Europe and Africa. The Europa Point campus is based in two military buildings dating back to the 19thcentury, including the original fort (the Bomb-house) with its brick-vaulted ceiling. The later Defensible Barracks were designed as accommodation for the soldiers and now hosts most of the University's teaching spaces. Both structures are now joined by a purpose-built modern atrium. The campus is in close proximity to both a mosque and a Catholic church

===Associate campuses===
The University of Gibraltar has developed five Associate Campuses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peralta|first1=Gabriella|title=University formally establishes partnerships with local institutions|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/08/university-formerly-establishes-partnerships-with-local-institutions/|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Gibraltar Chronicle|publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that support research programmes: the Gibraltar Museum; the Gibraltar Health Authority; the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens; the HMGOG Department for Environment and Climate Change; and the Garrison Library. 
Research students are able to access collections that include: bibliographic, historical, archaeological, museological, natural historical and other additional support facilities via these Associate Campuses.

===Research institutes===
The university has two research institutes: the Institute for Gibraltar and Mediterranean Studies (IGMS) and the Institute of Life and Earth Sciences (ILES). 

====The Institute for Gibraltar and Mediterranean Studies==== 
Focuses on areas such as colonial and postcolonial studies exploring identity, ethnicity, self-determination and nationalism, as well as, the historic convergence of three separate and intertwined cultures: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], in Gibraltar and the region. 

====The Institute of Life and Earth Sciences====
Focuses on biology, geology and the environmental sciences and connected disciplines such as [[ecology]], [[evolution]], [[palaeontology]] and [[geomorphology]].

The main areas of activity of the Institutes include interdisciplinary research in themes closely wedded to Gibraltar and the surrounding region; the supervision of students; engagement with other research associations; seeking funding and projecting the University of Gibraltar's research presence internationally.

==Events==
The University hosts a weekly Gibraltar History Lecture Series. Some of the topics covered by the different speakers to date include: the Northern Defences; [[Treaty of Utrecht]]; and Painting the Great Siege&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Chronicle|title=University of Gibraltar history lecture series prove popular|url=http://chronicle.gi/2017/02/university-of-gibraltar-history-lecture-series-prove-popular/|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Gibraltar Chronicle|publisher=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016, the University launched the Beacon Lecture Series with the objective of bringing speakers from the worlds of academia, business, arts and civil society to share their thoughts, ideas and experiences.  

==Motto==
The motto of the University of Gibraltar is ''Scientia est Clavis ad Successum'', which means “knowledge is the key to success”. The use of the metaphorical ''Clavis'' echoes the historical interpretation of Gibraltar as the key to the Mediterranean – as symbolised by the key that hangs from the castle in Gibraltar's flag. The castle and key are also depicted in the university's coat of arms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elmes|first1=John|title=Q&amp;A with Daniella Tilbury|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/daniella-tilbury-university-of-gloucestershire-question-and-answer|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=Times Higher Education|publisher=TES Global|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was established in 1937, long before the birth of the state of Kerala in India, by a promulgation of the Maharajah of [[Travancore]], Sri [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]] who was also the first Chancellor of the university.  [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], the then Diwan (Prime Minister) of Travancore, was the first Vice-Chancellor.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Kerala University in 1940s.jpg|thumb|Kerala University in 1940s]]
One of the first 16 Universities in India and the first in the state of Kerala, the University of Kerala was founded as the University of Travancore in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (now southern part of Kerala and some neighboring parts of state of Tamil Nadu) in 1937. During the 7 decades since the University of Kerala grew and shrunk physically and transformed itself in many ways.

The earliest origins of the University may be traced back to two institutions of modern learning in Kerala, the University College, Thiruvananthapuram and the Trivandrum Observatory. The University College was initially founded as the Maharaja's Free School by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal in 1834, with Mr John Roberts. A Christian Missionary as Headmaster, and soon grew into a college in 1866, affiliated to the Madras University. When the University of Travancore was founded, the Departments of the college became the University Departments, only to switch back again when the transformation to University of Kerala happened in 1957. The University College still retains its connection with the University as an affiliated college. The Trivandrum Observatory was founded in 1838 and had an internationally reputed scientist, John Caldecott FRS as its first Director. It became a part of the Travancore University, but for some time was administered as an independent government institution. It is now the oldest institution under the Kerala University.

The University of Travancore was established in 1937 by a promulgation of the Maharajah of Travancore, Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma who was also the first Chancellor of the University. Sir C. P Ramaswamy Ayyar, the then Diwan (Prime minister) of the State was the first Vice-Chancellor. He was an eminent scholar and an able administrator. It is said the Government made an unsuccessful attempt to invite Albert Einstein to be the first Vice-Chancellor. The University was modelled after the best Universities of the United Kingdom, and even today retains some of these features. The affiliating system of the University however evolved to be different from the college system in British Universities.

Only ten colleges within the State of Travancore, which were at that time affiliated to the Madras University, became the affiliated colleges of the University of Travancore. In 1954, the unified state of Kerala came into being with most of Travancore and whole of state of Cochin and Malabar area of Madras presidency becoming part of it. The Kerala University Act (Act 14 of 1957) was brought into force and the University of Travancore was renamed University of Kerala. The University had three campuses located in three different parts of the State viz. Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode. The number of affiliated colleges grew phenomenally. However, in 1968, the University Centre at Kozhikode became a full-fledged University, the University of Calicut, affiliating the colleges located in Thrissur, Palakkad, Kozhikode and Kannur districts of Kerala and transforming the Kozhikkode Centre into University Departments. The [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]] - CUSAT -(1971), Kerala Agricultural University (1971) and [[Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala|Mahatma Gandhi University]] (1983) were subsequently established, with CUSAT taking over the University's centre at Cochin. These developments have shrunk the jurisdiction of the University of Kerala to Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha Districts and some parts of Pathanamthitta District.

== Departments ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Library Kerala University Karyavattam, Thiruvananthapuram.jpg|University Library|thumb|right]]
At present, the University has sixteen faculties and forty one departments of teaching and research in addition to study centres and other departments. Teaching, Research and Knowledge extension are the mandate of the Departments. They primarily focus on post-graduate (masters) programmes, MPhil programmes (1-year research degree) and doctoral research. In 2007, the University awarded over 100 PhDs. (University's research activities are also going on in select affiliated colleges and other recognised research centres in and outside the state). The University has had in its faculties eminent scholars who were trained under legendary figures (Sir C V Raman's student in Dept of Physics, Prof S R Ranganathan's student in Library Science and Prof Benjamin Bloom's student in Dept of Education). Some of the faculty members themselves were legends, such as famous poet K Ayyappa Panciker, Oriental scholar T Ganapathi Sasthri etc.

== Study centres ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The University has also a number of study centres in specialised areas such as Nano-technology, Kerala Studies, Bioinformatics, Women's Studies, Learning Difficulties, Sree Narayana Studies, Gandhian Studies etc. Some of these centres have taught programmes (Certificate/Diploma/Masters/Mphil) and many offer PhD programmes. The University has also established 10 University College of Teacher Education (UTEC) and 8 University Institute of Technologies (UIT) both of which offer under-graduate programmes (BEd in UTECs and BSc Computer Science/IT, Electronics/BBA in UITs), although masters programmes are available in select UITs. The University College of Engineering at Karyavattom offers Engineering Education at Undergraduate level.

== Affiliated colleges==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
{{Main article|List of colleges affiliated to Kerala University}}

The University has over 150 affiliated colleges. The role of the University is in prescribing courses of study and conducting examinations and issuing certificates. The day-to-day administration of these institutions is not under the purview of the University. However, these institutions form a major part of the University. Of these 60 are Arts and Science colleges. There are 2 Law colleges, 17 Engineering Colleges, 9 MBA/MCA Colleges, 37 Teacher Training Colleges, 4 Medical Colleges, 4 Ayurveda colleges, 2 Homeopathy Colleges, one Siddha Medical College, 3 Dental colleges, 10 Nursing Colleges, 4 Pharmacy Colleges, 2 Fine Arts Colleges, and a Music College. The University also has a National College of Physical Education affiliated to it. The total number of students in these colleges crosses 84,000.

'''Varendra Museum''' ({{lang-bn|বরেন্দ্র জাদুঘর}}) is a museum, research centre, and popular visitor attraction at the heart of [[Rajshahi]] town and maintained by [[Rajshahi University]] in Bangladesh. It is considered the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It was the first museum to be established in East Bengal in 1910. The museum started out as the collection for Varendra Anushandan Samiti (or Varendra Investigation Society) and got its current name in 1919. The Rajahs of Rajshahi and Natore, notably prince Sharat Kumar Ray, donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. Varendra refers to an ancient Janapada roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.

==History==
Varendra (or Barind) was a region of Bengal, now in Bangladesh. It included the Pundravardhana or Pundra Kingdom region. According to Cunningham the boundary of Varendra was the Ganges and the Mahananda on the west, the Karatoya on the east, the Padma on the south, and the land between Koochbihar and the Terai on the north. The Varendra Brahmins originated from this region.

Ancient Bengal did not have any Brahmins in its community. It is popularly believed that Brahmins were brought in to preach Hindutva, though really not the Vedic Hinduism as it is commonly believed, but more of the Pouranik Hinduism type, which evolved after Buddhism flourished. This Pouranik Hinduism is what we know as Brahmanism. Varendra (Barendra) Bhumi, i.e., modern-day North Bengal, had its Brahminism awakening soon after the south got its share. Shyamal Varma, a Kshatriya King brought five Brahmanas from Kanouj — Sanaka, Bhardwaja, Savarna, Sandilya, and Vasistha. The Bhatariya, Maitreya, Satar, Baghshree and Laheria villages soon gave birth to the Brahmin clans of Bhaduri, Moitra, Sanyal, Bagchi and Lahiri. These came to be known as the Varendra (Barendra) Brahmins.

The settlement of Varendra, spoken as Janakabhu (fatherland), was one of the most flourishing territories of the ancient Indian sub-continent. Literary and epigraphic evidence show that a separate school of artisans earned wide reputation here at the reign of Pala dynasty and the streams of art making were uninterrupted until the Sena dynasty.

Some of the leading and enlightened citizens of Rajshahi felt the necessity and justification of establishing such an institution that would explore the precious past of this region. Henceforth, 'The Varendra Research Society' was established in 1910. The founder of the society, Kumar Sarat Kumar Ray, the scion of the Dighapatiya Royal family accompanied by Aksaya Kumar Maitreya, a leading lawyer and renowned historian; [[Ramaprasad Chanda]], a reputed scholar in history, art and archaeology; and others explored archaeological and historical artefacts excavated in villages of Rajshahi.

The conviction grew in Kumar's mind if a centre of archaeological research was to be established at Rajshahi, the finds should be preserved there as the nucleus of a local museum. Accordingly, to collect, preserve, study and research the history and culture of ancient and medieval Bangal in general, and of Varendra region in particular, three worthy sons of the soil mentioned above took the effort to establish a museum.

The Varendra Research Society and Museum was set up at Rajshahi in 1910. It is the premier institution of its kind and the splendid accomplishment of its organisation in Bangladesh. The role of the society concerning the museum was that of proprietor and caretaker. However, this was formally inaugurated on 27 September 1910 and was registered in 1914 in accordance with the Indian Society Act, 1860.

Varendra Museum was the first museum to be established in erstwhile [[East Bengal]] in 1910. It started as the collection for ''Varendra Anushandhan Samiti'' or ''Varendra Investigation Society'' and got its current name in 1919. The [[Rajshahi Raj family|Rajahs of Rajshahi]] and [[Dighapatia Raj|Natore]] (notably [[Prince Sarat kumar Rai of Dighapatia|Prince Sharat Kumar Ray]]) donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. ''[[Varendra]]'' refers to an ancient ''Janapada'' roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.

Excavation at [[Sompur Bihara]] was started by the society along with the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1923. In 1964, the museum became a part of [[Rajshahi University]].

==Collection==
* Gallery One has collections from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and some of its 265 items from Sompur. It also contains old [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] scripts.
* Gallery Two has Buddhist and Hindu stone sculptures and modern wood sculptures.
* Galleries Three and Four display stone sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses.
* Gallery Five offers mostly Buddhist sculpture.
* Gallery Six shows Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit and old [[Bengali language|Bengali]] stone inscriptions and sculptured stones of the Muslim period.
* A gallery has been added displaying the indigenous and tribal culture of Rajshahi region.

==Site surroundings==
In the existing site, three main structures were found. The front part is the Varendra Research Museum and the structural system is load-bearing brick wall. The linear rectangular building has two major functions: Administration and the Library. There is a Residential Block for officers and staff with a limited number of curators and the director. These structures have been constructed with brick. There is a garden in front of the director's residence with large old trees scattered among the entire site.

Services:
Gas, Water, Electricity is available with Internet, Postal, Cable and Phone Services.

Surrounding built form:
North: Hatem Kha boro mosque.
South: Chest disease hospital Jadhughor mor, Choto kutir, Boro kutir and Padma river
East:  Rajshahi Govt. Hospital, Shaheb bazar road and Rajshahi Railway Station
West: Residential zone, shops.

==Museum Extension==
Varenda Research Museum was built in 1910 with the support of Maharaja of Dighapatia. The museum has historical significance and is also a heritage site of Bangladesh. The century-old museum demands restoration and the existing gallery space is not adequate to preserve and display all the artefacts. Also the Archaeological sites were found recently and the artefacts are increasing day by day. The restoration program of existing museum has already begun. With the rise in number of artefacts in its inventory throughout the recent years and its added functional demand, the extension of this project has become inevitable to protect the old museum and to preserve the artefacts that has helped us learn more about our very own past.

*[[John O'Hara]], according to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' contributor and Yale alum [[Brendan Gill]], wanted desperately to have gone to Yale.

Higgins]] opined that the reason [[Yale University Library]] has the manuscript of [[BUtterfield 8 (novel)|''BUtterfield 8'']] and the galley proofs of ''[[Appointment in Samarra]]'' is that O'Hara was "foraging for honors:"
:Former Yale president [[Kingman Brewster]] was forthright &amp;mdash; and supercilious &amp;mdash; in his explanation of O'Hara's disappointments in New Haven: he said Yale didn't give him an LL. D. degree "because he asked for it."{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

:In a newspaper column, O'Hara attempted to make light of the matter, writing: "If Yale had given me a degree, I could have joined the [[Yale Club of New York City|Yale Club]], where the food is pretty good, the library is ample and restful, the location convenient, and I could go there when I felt like it without sponging off friends. They also have a nice-looking [[necktie]]."

Several characters in the ''Doonesbury'' strip were based on people associated with the university. The character [[B.D. (Doonesbury)|B.D.]] was originally based on Yale football quarterback [[Brian Dowling (American football)|Brian Dowling]]; Dowling's teammate [[Calvin Hill]] was featured as "Calvin" in the early years of the strip.[http://wso.williams.edu/orgs/trivia/nasty/questions.html] [[President King]] of the fictional [[Walden College]] was based on Yale president [[Kingman Brewster]], and longtime Yale chaplain Rev. [[William Sloane Coffin]] provided part of the basis for the Rev. [[Scot Sloan]], the chaplain at Walden in the strip.
* In the 2010 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' Dr. Harold Macdougal assists John Marston in tracking down Dutch Vanderline
* [[Batman]] is said to be an alumnus of Yale Law School.
