The '''Amdolese language''' ({{bo|t=ཨ་མདོ་སྐད་|w=A-mdo skad|l=[[Help:IPA/Tibetan|[ámtokɛ́ʔ]]]}}; also called ''Am kä'') is the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] language spoken by the majority of Amdolese,mainly in [[Qinghai]] and some parts of [[Sichuan]] ([[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]]) and [[Gansu]] ([[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]]).

Amdolese is one of the four main spoken Tibetic languages, the other three being [[Central Tibetan language|Central Tibetan]], [[Khams Tibetan]], and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]]. These four related languages share a common written script but their spoken pronunciations, vocabularies and grammars are different. These differences may have emerged due to geographical isolation of the regions of Tibet. Unlike Khams and Standard Tibetan, Amdolese language is not a [[tonal language]]. It retains many word-initial [[consonant cluster]]s that have been lost in Central Tibetan.

==Dialects==
Dialects are:&lt;ref&gt;N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n°25, p.&amp;nbsp;7–56 [http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">'''Beta Colony''' is an important planet (although rarely the setting) in [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s science fiction series the [[Vorkosigan Saga]].
The planet's [[biome]] is almost entirely desert, described as "screaming hot",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

and the colony itself exists primarily underground.&lt;ref name=Companion&gt;{{harvnb|Carl|2008|pp=285–286|loc=Beta Colony description in "An Old Earther's Guide to the Vorkosigan Universe" by Denise Little}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beta Colony's chief industries are weapons R&amp;D and sex tourism.

The concept of Beta Colony was first created and introduced in "Dreamweaver's Dilemma".{{sfn|Bujold|1995|p=75, 203|loc = "Dreamweaver's Dilemma"}}
The idea was later expanded upon in ''Shards of Honor'' when Bujold needed a homeworld for Cordelia Naismith.

==Culture==
Beta Colony is noted for being a remarkably [[egalitarian]] state.
Betan culture is also well known for its [[Toleration|tolerance]] and liberal attitude towards all varieties of sexuality; a number of practices considered immoral on many other worlds, such as [[prostitution]] (in the form of paid sex therapy) and [[recreational drug use]], are legal and accepted on Beta Colony.
Beta Colony is also highly advanced, relative to most other planets, in many areas of technology and medicine.
Many innovations mentioned in the Vorkosigan Saga originated on Beta Colony.
For this reason, Betan dollars are considered one of the most stable and valuable currencies.

Due to its restricted habitats, reproduction is tightly regulated.
After a girl has her first menstrual cycle, she receives a contraceptive implant, has her hymen cut, and has her ears pierced; it's considered a coming of age ceremony and a signal of young adulthood.{{sfn|Bujold|1996|p=328|loc = Chapter 10 of "Barrayar"}}
In order to have children, the two prospective "co-parents" must take a course together and pass a number of physical, [[psychology|psychological]] and [[economics|economic]] tests before being issued parents' licenses.&lt;ref name=Companion/&gt;
Very few families are authorized to have more than two children.
Three-fourths of all Betan children are [[gestation|gestated]] in [[artificial womb]]s,{{sfn|Bujold|1996|p=241|loc = Chapter 3 of "Barrayar"}} although co-parents who prefer to have their children through old-fashioned [[pregnancy]] are free to do so.
Genetically engineered [[Hermaphrodite]]s form a significant minority of the Betan population.

As another ramification of Beta Colony's inhospitable climate and underground development, Betans do not have any noteworthy works of architecture, but are very proud of feats of grand interior design and enclosed public spaces, and consider natural materials such as wood to be almost ludicrously extravagant. [[Cordelia Naismith]] is astounded that [[Barrayar]]ans would use an intricate, antique [[parquetry|parquet]] wooden floor as a dance-floor; on Beta, it would have been preserved and safeguarded as a great work of art.{{sfn|Bujold|1996|p=272|loc = Chapter 5 of "Barrayar"}}

Beta Colony does not have a large military, but what it does have is one of the most technologically advanced in the nexus.
Beta Colony is a major arms supplier for other worlds, but they usually only sell weapons that have been made obsolete by their own most recent developments.
The civilian Betan Astronomical Survey, which serves a largely exploratory and scientific purpose, also acts as a reserve military force.

Many place names on Beta Colony are derived from geological substances and phenomena, such as the city of Silica and its attendant university.
Another notable settlement is the largely hermaphrodite town of Quartz.&lt;ref name=Concordance&gt;{{harvnb|Carl|2008|pp=341–630|loc="The Vorkosigan Saga Concordance" by Kerrie Hughes, John Helfers, and Ed Burkhead}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Betans==
*'''[[Cordelia Naismith]]''' (later Cordelia Vorkosigan) was born on Beta Colony and served in its military until, falsely accused of several crimes, she sought asylum on [[Aral Vorkosigan]]'s homeworld of [[Barrayar]]. They married, and their son [[Miles Vorkosigan]] is 5/8 Betan; his paternal great-grandmother was also from Beta Colony.
*'''[[Admiral Naismith]]''' [[Miles Vorkosigan]] has dual citizenship, through his mother, and uses his Betan name of Miles Naismith when with the [[Dendarii Mercenaries]].
*'''[[Dendarii Mercenaries#Bel Thorne|Bel Thorne]]''' Betan hermaphrodite who was originally involved with the Dendarii Mercenaries. In the novel ''[[Vorkosigan Saga#Diplomatic Immunity|Diplomatic Immunity]]'', it has become a Port Master at Graf Station. It was one of the few [[Dendarii Mercenaries]] who knew Miles Naismiths's true identity and his relationship with ImpSec. It maintained its relationship with ImpSec even after leaving the Dendarii Mercenaries.

==Background==
According to the author, Beta Colony was one of the first two colonies founded by Earth, both by American efforts; the other, Alpha Colony, vanished in a manner likened to [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]].{{sfn|Bujold|1995|p=222|loc = "Answers"}}
Shortly thereafter, a world war destroyed much of America and effectively ended their space program, among others.
As a result, Beta Colony, with its emphasis on personal freedom and tolerance, technological innovation, economic stability and influence, and racial and cultural diversity, came to hold a place in the political landscape reminiscent of an idealized version of America, specifically California.&lt;ref name=Companion/&gt;{{sfn|Carl|2008|p=36|loc="Putting it Together: Live, the Vorkosiverse, and Everything" by Lois McMaster Bujold}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5789">[[File:Blacklight or ultraviolet bulbs.pdf|thumb|Two examples of fluorescent blacklight bulbs with light fixtures and packaging and a novelty incandescent bulb.]]

A '''blacklight poster''' is a poster printed with inks which [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under a [[black light]].&lt;ref name=lincoln2004/&gt; The inks used contain [[phosphor]]s which cause them to glow when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light emitted from black lights.&lt;ref name=mccleary2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris2002/&gt; 

Although black lights date to 1903 with the development of [[Wood's glass]], fluorescent ink was not developed until 1932 when the Switzer brothers were inspired by a &lt;i&gt;Popular Science&lt;/i&gt; article to experiment in their father's pharmacy. Their [[Day-Glo Color Corp.]] marketed the ink chiefly to the military before a counterculture emerged to embrace the aesthetic.&lt;ref name="Ensminger"&gt;Ensminger, David. "Black Light Panthers: The Politics of Fluorescence," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 5 No. 2 (July-August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the pervasive use of illegal drugs, especially mass use of hallucinogenics such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), mescaline, and marijuana for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Gary|title=Hippie Artifacts:Mind Blowing Stuff to Collect|date=2003|publisher=Shiffer Publishing LTD&amp;Design|isbn=0-7643-1758-X|page=72url=http://www.schifferbooks.com/hippie–artifacts–mind–blowing–stuff–to–collect–1573.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the ability to glow and vibrate under ultraviolet light, the posters could simulate the sensations and visual distortions one experienced during an acid trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donahue|first1=Daniel|title=Ultraviolet 69 Classic Blacklight Posters from the Aquarian Age and Beyond|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=Abrams Image|location=China|isbn=0-8109-7999-3|page=6|url=http://www.abramsbooks.com/product/ultraviolet_9780810979994/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, blacklight posters emerged as part of the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic fashion scene]] between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref name=menand2003/&gt; The style was popular in advertisements for concerts at venues like [[the Fillmore]] and [[Avalon Ballroom]], and further promoted and commercialized by companies like Pandora Productions (established in Minneapolis, 1964) and the Houston Black Light Company (Houston, 1969). Designs ranged from respectful copies of concert posters to prurient adolescent fantasies. At its height radical black artists found inspiration in the aesthetic, such as [[Faith Ringgold|Faith Ringgold's]] series of &lt;i&gt;Black Light&lt;/i&gt; paintings that eschewed any white pigment, or [[Barbara Jones-Hogu|Barbara Jones-Hogu's]] prints (especially &lt;i&gt;Relate to Your Heritage&lt;/i&gt;). Commercial producers happily reciprocated by incorporating [[blaxploitation]] themes into their posters, as in George Goode's series for the Houston Black Light Company and George Stowe Jr.'s work for One Stop Posters.&lt;ref name="Ensminger"/&gt;

Since then, the art form has gone out of fashion and is generally viewed as a relic of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=campbell2004/&gt; 

Although blacklight posters have continually been produced since the 1960s, there has been a resurgence in popularity since 2007 as blacklight and glow-in-the-dark parties have become more popular{{Citation needed|reason=Proof of increased glow-in-the-dark parties needed, as well as a location of the increase.|date=October 2017}}.  As of 2014, there are five companies actively producing new and classic flocked blacklight posters in a wide range of content, including music, nature, and pop culture.  The black parts of these posters are overlaid with black flocking, which gives it a velvet feel, and these are often referred to as velvet posters.
[[File:Mr. Experience.JPG|thumb|right|Poster using black light fluorescent inks.]] Artists continue to make use of the material, notably [[Dorothy Cross|Dorothy Cross']] 1998 &lt;i&gt;Ghost Ship&lt;/i&gt; (a decommissioned light ship painted to glow at night, evoking the pigment's original military purposes), or [[Hank Willis Thomas|Hank Willis Thomas']] 2014 screenprints &lt;i&gt;And I Can't Run&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Blow the Man Down&lt;/i&gt; (exposing black victims under fluorescent light, evoking the pigment's historic association with black radicalism).&lt;ref name="Ensminger"/&gt;

'''Building information modeling ''' ('''BIM''') is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. '''Building information models''' ('''BIMs''') are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse [[hard infrastructure|physical infrastructure]]s, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and tunnels.

== BIM origins and elements==
The concept of BIM has existed since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Eastman |first2=David |last2=Fisher |first3=Gilles |last3=Lafue |first4=Joseph |last4=Lividini |first5=Douglas |last5=Stoker |first6=Christos |last6=Yessios |date=September 1974 |title=An Outline of the Building Description System |publisher=Institute of Physical Planning, Carnegie-Mellon University |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED113833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|title=BIM Handbook: a Guide to Building Information Modeling for owners, managers, designers, engineers, and contractors|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780470185285|edition=1st|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|year = 2011 | title =  BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=2nd |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in papers in the mid-1980s: in a 1985 paper by Simon Ruffle eventually published in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Ruffle S. (1986) "Architectural design exposed: from computer-aided-drawing to computer-aided-design" Environments and Planning B: Planning and Design 1986 March 7 pp 385-389. [http://epb.sagepub.com/content/13/4/385.abstract Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish&lt;ref&gt;Aish, R. (1986) "Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7–9 July.&lt;/ref&gt; - then at [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers Ltd]], developer of [[RUCAPS]] software - referring to the software's use at London's Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., ''et al'' (2008), ''op cit'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Building Information Model' first appeared in a 1992 paper by G.A. van Nederveen and F. P. Tolman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0926-5805(92)90014-B |title=Modelling multiple views on buildings |year=1992 |last1=Van Nederveen |first1=G.A. |last2=Tolman |first2=F.P. |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=215–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the terms 'Building Information Model' and 'Building Information Modeling' (including the acronym "BIM") did not become popularly used until some 10 years later. In 2002, [[Autodesk]] released a [[white paper]] entitled "Building Information Modeling,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laiserin.com/features/bim/autodesk_bim.pdf|title=Autodesk (2002). Building Information Modeling. San Rafael, CA, Autodesk, Inc.|author=|date=|website=laiserin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other software vendors also started to assert their involvement in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2002) "[http://www.laiserin.com/features/issue15/feature01.php Comparing Pommes and Naranjas]", ''The Laiserin Letter'', December 16, 2002.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By hosting contributions from Autodesk, [[Bentley Systems]] and [[Graphisoft]], plus other industry observers, in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/bim/index.php The BIM Page]", ''The Laiserin Letter''.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Laiserin helped popularize and standardize the term as a common name for the digital representation of the building process.&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, in his foreword to Eastman, et al (2008, ''op cit'') disclaimed he had coined the term, adding "it is my opinion that the historical record ... shows that Building Information Modeling was not an innovation attributable solely to any individual or entity." (p.xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Facilitating exchange and interoperability of information in digital format had previously been offered under differing terminology by Graphisoft as "Virtual Building", Bentley Systems as "Integrated Project Models", and by Autodesk or Vectorworks as "Building Information Modeling".

The pioneering role of applications such as RUCAPS, [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]] and [[Reflex (building design software)|Reflex]] has been recognized by Laiserin&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the UK's [[Royal Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="RAEng-Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Philip Medal for engineer behind revolution in Building Information Modelling (22 June 2016)|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/news-releases/2016/june/prince-philip-medal-for-engineer-behind-revolution|website=Royal Academy of Engineering|publisher=RAEng|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Graphisoft had been developing such solutions for longer than its competitors, Laiserin regarded its [[ArchiCAD]] application as then "one of the most mature BIM solutions on the market."&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J.

==Definition==
The US National Building Information Model Standard Project Committee has the following definition:

:''Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States - National BIM Standard - United States |publisher=Nationalbimstandard.org |accessdate=17 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional building design was largely reliant upon two-dimensional [[technical drawings]] (plans, elevations, sections, etc.). Building information modeling extends this beyond [[3D modeling|3D]], augmenting the three primary spatial dimensions (width, height and depth) with time as the fourth dimension ([[4D BIM|4D]])&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-01&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1234|title=4D BIM or Simulation-Based Modeling|publisher=structuremag.org|date=|accessdate=29 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528051608/http://structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1234|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost as the fifth ([[5D BIM|5D]]).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-02&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cadsoft-consult.com/blogs/architecture/2009/09/ashrae-introduction-to-bim-4d-and-5d/|title= ASHRAE Introduction to BIM, 4D and 5D |publisher=cadsoft-consult.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
More recently there are also references to a sixth dimension (6D) representing building environmental and sustainability aspects, and a seventh dimension (7D) for through-life facility management, although there are conflicting definitions ([[6D BIM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theory of Evolution BIM 3D-7D|url=https://bimestimate.eu/en/the-theory-of-evolution-bim-3d-7d/|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIM 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D|url=http://www.bimpanzee.com/bim-3d-4d--5d--6d---7d.html|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
BIM therefore covers more than just geometry. It also covers spatial relationships, light analysis, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components (for example, manufacturers' details).

BIM involves representing a design as combinations of "objects" – vague and undefined, generic or product-specific, solid shapes or void-space oriented (like the shape of a room), that carry their geometry, relations and attributes. BIM design tools allow extraction of different views from a building model for drawing production and other uses. These different views are automatically consistent, being based on a single definition of each object instance.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"&gt;{{cite web |last=Eastman |first=Chuck |date=August 2009 |title=What is BIM? |url=http://bim.arch.gatech.edu/?id=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIM software also defines objects parametrically; that is, the objects are defined as parameters and relations to other objects, so that if a related object is amended, dependent ones will automatically also change.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"/&gt; Each model element can carry attributes for selecting and ordering them automatically, providing cost estimates as well as material tracking and ordering.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"/&gt;

For the professionals involved in a project, BIM enables a virtual information model to be handed from the design team ([[architect]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[surveying|surveyor]]s, [[civil engineering|civil]], [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[building services]] [[engineer]]s, etc.) to the main contractor and subcontractors and then on to the owner/operator; each professional adds discipline-specific data to the single shared model. This reduces information losses that traditionally occurred when a new team takes 'ownership' of the project, and provides more extensive information to owners of complex structures.

==BIM throughout the project life-cycle==
Use of BIM goes beyond the planning and design phase of the project, extending throughout the building life cycle, supporting processes including [[cost management]], [[construction management]], [[project management]] and [[facilities management|facility operation]].

===Management of building information models===
Building information models span the whole concept-to-occupation time-span. To ensure efficient management of information processes throughout this span, a BIM manager (also sometimes defined as a [[Virtual design and construction|virtual design-to-construction]], VDC, project manager – VDCPM) might be appointed. The BIM manager is retained by a design build team on the client's behalf from the pre-design phase onwards to develop and to track the object-oriented BIM against predicted and measured performance objectives, supporting multi-disciplinary building information models that drive analysis, schedules, take-off and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=/ep/channel/gsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-24291]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112145341/http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=%2Fep%2Fchannel%2FgsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-24291|date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=588|title=Senate Properties modeling guidelines|publisher=Gsa.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226194436/http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=588|archivedate=26 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are also now considering developing BIMs in various levels of detail, since depending on the application of BIM, more or less detail is needed, and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.027 |title=Analysis of modeling effort and impact of different levels of detail in building information models |year=2011 |last1=Leite |first1=Fernanda |last2=Akcamete |first2=Asli |last3=Akinci |first3=Burcu |last4=Atasoy |first4=Guzide |last5=Kiziltas |first5=Semiha |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=601–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BIM in construction management===
Participants in the building process are constantly challenged to deliver successful projects despite tight budgets, limited manpower, accelerated schedules, and limited or conflicting information. The significant disciplines such as [[Architectural engineering|architectural]], [[Structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] designs should be well coordinated, as two things can’t take place at the same place and time. Building Information Modeling aids in collision detection at the initial stage, identifying the exact location of discrepancies.  
   
The BIM concept envisages virtual construction of a facility prior to its actual physical construction, in order to reduce uncertainty, improve safety, work out problems, and simulate and analyze potential impacts.&lt;ref name = "Smith 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Deke |last1=Smith |year=2007 |title=An Introduction to Building Information Modeling (BIM) |journal=Journal of Building Information Modeling |url=http://www.wbdg.org/pdfs/jbim_fall07.pdf |pages=12–4}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-contractors from every trade can input critical information into the model before beginning construction, with opportunities to pre-fabricate or pre-assemble some systems off-site. Waste can be minimised on-site and products delivered on a just-in-time basis rather than being stock-piled on-site.&lt;ref name = "Smith 2007"/&gt;

Quantities and shared properties of materials can be extracted easily. Scopes of work can be isolated and defined. Systems, assemblies and sequences can be shown in a relative scale with the entire facility or group of facilities. BIM also prevents errors by enabling conflict or 'clash detection' whereby the computer model visually highlights to the team where parts of the building (e.g.:structural frame and building services pipes or ducts) may wrongly intersect.

===BIM in facility operation===
BIM can bridge the information loss associated with handling a project from design team, to construction team and to building owner/operator, by allowing each group to add to and reference back to all information they acquire during their period of contribution to the BIM model. This can yield benefits to the facility owner or operator.

For example, a building owner may find evidence of a leak in his building.  Rather than exploring the physical building, he may turn to the model and see that  a water [[valve]] is located in the suspect location.  He could also have in the model the specific valve size, manufacturer, part number, and any other information ever researched in the past, pending adequate computing power. Such problems were initially addressed by Leite and Akinci when developing a vulnerability representation of facility contents and threats for supporting the identification of vulnerabilities in building emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000171 |title=Formalized Representation for Supporting Automated Identification of Critical Assets in Facilities during Emergencies Triggered by Failures in Building Systems |year=2012 |last1=Leite |first1=Fernanda |last2=Akinci |first2=Burcu |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic information about the building, such as sensor measurements and control signals from the building systems, can also be incorporated within BIM software to support analysis of building operation and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1061/41052(346)10 |chapter=Requirements and Evaluation of Standards for Integration of Sensor Data with Building Information Models |title=Computing in Civil Engineering |year=2009 |last1=Liu |first1=Xuesong |last2=Akinci |first2=Burcu |isbn=978-0-7844-1052-3 |pages=95–104 |editor1-first=Carlos H. |editor1-last=Caldas |editor2-first=William J. |editor2-last=O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts at creating information models for older, pre-existing facilities. Approaches include referencing key metrics such as the [[Facility Condition Index]] (FCI), or using [[3D scanner|3D laser-scanning]] surveys and [[photogrammetry]] techniques (both separately or in combination) to capture accurate measurements of the asset that can be used as the basis for a model. Trying to model a building constructed in, say 1927, requires numerous assumptions about design standards, building codes, construction methods, materials, etc., and is therefore more complex than building a model during design.

One of the challenges to the proper maintenance and management of existing facilities is understanding how BIM can be utilized to support a holistic understanding and implementation of [[Facility management|building management]] practices and “[[Total cost of ownership|cost of ownership]]” principles that support the full life cycle of a building.&amp;nbsp; An [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] entitled ''APPA 1000 – Total Cost of Ownership for Facilities Asset Management'' incorporates BIM to factor in a variety of critical requirements and costs over the [[Life-cycle assessment|life-cycle]] of the building, including but not limited to: replacement of energy, utility, and safety systems; continual maintenance of the building exterior and interior and replacement of materials; updates to design and functionality; and recapitalization costs.

=== BIM in land administration and cadastre ===
BIM can potentially offer some benefit for managing stratified [[cadastre|cadastral]] spaces in urban built environments. The first benefit would be enhancing visual communication of interweaved, stacked and complex cadastral spaces for non-specialists. The rich amount of spatial and semantic information about physical structures inside models can aid comprehension of cadastral boundaries, providing an unambiguous delineation of ownership, rights, responsibilities and restrictions. Additionally, using BIM to manage cadastral information could advance current land administration systems from a 2D-based and analogue data environment into a 3D digital, intelligent, interactive and dynamic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atazadeh|first=Behnam|last2=Kalantari|first2=Mohsen|last3=Rajabifard|first3=Abbas|last4=Ho|first4=Serene|last5=Ngo|first5=Tuan|date=2016-03-01|title=Building Information Modelling for High-rise Land Administration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12199/abstract|journal=Transactions in GIS|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/tgis.12199|issn=1467-9671}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIM could also unlock value in the cadastral information by forming a bridge between that information and the interactive lifecycle and management of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/Global/Land_Journal_March-April_2016.pdf#page24|title=Filling the space|author1=Behnam Atazadeh |author2=Mohsen Kalantari |author3=Abbas Rajabifard |author4=Tom Champion |date=23 February 2016|website=RICS Land Journal|publisher=Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BIM software==
The first software tools developed for modelling buildings emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and included workstation products such as Chuck Eastman's Building Description System and GLIDE, [[RUCAPS]], [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]], Reflex and [[Gable CAD|Gable 4D Series]]. The early applications, and the hardware needed to run them, were expensive, which limited widespread adoption. ArchiCAD's Radar CH, released in 1984 was the first modelling software made available on a personal computer.&lt;ref name=Quirk /&gt;

Due to the complexity of gathering all the relevant information when working with BIM on a building project some companies have developed software designed specifically to work in a BIM framework. These packages differ from architectural drafting tools such as [[AutoCAD]] by allowing the addition of further information (time, cost, manufacturers' details, sustainability and maintenance information, etc.) to the building model.

There is a BIM module in open source CAD software [[FreeCAD]].

===Non-proprietary or openBIM standards===
BIM is often associated with [[Industry Foundation Classes]] (IFCs) and [[aecXML]] – data structures for representing information. IFCs have been developed by [[buildingSMART]] (the former International Alliance for Interoperability), as a neutral, non-proprietary or open standard for sharing BIM data among different software applications (some proprietary data structures have been developed by CAD vendors incorporating BIM into their software).

Poor software interoperability has long been regarded as an obstacle to industry efficiency in general and to BIM adoption in particular. In August 2004 a US National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]]) report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Michael P. |last2=O'Connor |first2=Alan C. |last3=Dettbarn |first3=John L. |last4=Gilday |first4=Linda T. |date=August 2004 |title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry |doi=10.6028/NIST.GCR.04-867 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservatively estimated that $15.8 billion was lost annually by the U.S. capital facilities industry due to inadequate interoperability arising from "the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paperbased business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders".

An early example of a nationally approved BIM standard is the AISC ([[American Institute of Steel Construction]])-approved CIS/2 standard, a non-proprietary standard with its roots in the UK.

====Malaysia====
BIM implementation is targeted towards BIM Stage 2 by the year 2020 led by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB Malaysia). Under the Construction Industry Master Plan 2016-2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CITP|url = http://www.citp.my/|website = www.citp.my|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = CITP}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is hoped more emphasis on technology adoption across the project life-cycle will induce higher productivity.

====Singapore====
The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has announced that BIM would be introduced for architectural submission (by 2013), structural and M&amp;E submissions (by 2014) and eventually for plan submissions of all projects with gross floor area of more than 5,000 square metres by 2015. The BCA Academy is training students in BIM.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bca.gov.sg/publications/BuildSmart/others/buildsmart_11issue9.pdf BuildSmart]'' (BCA magazine), December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Small BIM-related seminars and independent BIM effort existed in South Korea even in the 1990s. However, it was not until the late 2000s that the Korean industry paid attention to BIM. The first industry-level BIM conference was held in April, 2008, after which, BIM has been spread very rapidly. Since 2010, the Korean government has been gradually increasing the scope of BIM-mandated projects. McGraw Hill published a detailed report in 2012 on the status of BIM adoption and implementation in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://analyticsstore.construction.com/index.php/2012-business-value-of-bim-in-korea-smartmarket-report-english.html|title=Lee, G., J.

====United Arab Emirates====
Dubai Municipality issued a circular (196) in 2014 mandating BIM use for buildings of a certain size, height or type. The one page circular initiated strong interest in BIM and the market responded in preparation for more guidelines and direction. In 2015 the Municipality issued another circular (207) titled 'Regarding the expansion of applying the (BIM) on buildings and facilities in the emirate of Dubai' which made BIM mandatory on more projects by reducing the minimum size and height requirement for projects requiring BIM. This second circular drove BIM adoption further with several projects and organizations adopting UK BIM standards as best practice. In 2016, the UAE's Quality and Conformity Commission set up a BIM steering group to investigate statewide adoption of BIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-36590-bim-summit-2015-calls-for-greater-co-operation/|title= BIM Summit 2015 calls for greater co-operation|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline.com|accessdate= 6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Through the new D.l. 50, in April 2016 Italy has included into its own legislation several European directives including 2014/24/EU on Public Procurement. The decree states among the main goals of public procurement the "rationalization of designing activities and of all connected verification processes, through the progressive adoption of digital methods and electronic instruments such as Building and Infrastructure Information Modelling".&lt;ref&gt;D.lgs. 50/2006, art. 38 com. 1 lett. h&lt;/ref&gt; A norm in 8 parts is also being written to support the transition: UNI 11337-1, UNI 11337-4 and UNI 11337-5 were published in January 2017, with five further chapters to follow within a year.

In early 2018 the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport issued a decree creating a governmental BIM Mandate compelling public client organisations to adopt a digital approach by 2025, with an incremental obligation which will start on 1 January 2019.&lt;ref name="Ciribini-21Mar2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ciribini|first1=Angelo|last2=De Giuda|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Valaguzza|first3=Sara|title=UK PROCUREMENT FRAMEWORK INFORMS ITALY’S MOVE TO MANDATE BIM|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/people/uk-procurement-framework-informs-italys-move-manda/|accessdate=22 March 2018|work=BIM Plus|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lithuania====
Lithuania is moving towards adoption of BIM infrastructure by founding a public body "Skaitmeninė statyba" (Digital Construction), which is managed by 13 associations. Also there is a BIM work group established by Lietuvos Architektų Sąjunga (a Lithuanian architects body). The initiative intends Lithuania to adopt BIM, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and National Construction Classification as standard. An international conference "Skaitmeninė statyba Lietuvoje" (Digital Construction in Lithuania) has been held annually since 2012.

====The Netherlands====
On 1 November 2011, the Rijksgebouwendienst, the agency within the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment|Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] that manages government buildings, introduced the Rgd BIM Standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgd.nl/onderwerpen/diensten/bouwwerk-informatie-modellen-bim/rgd-bim-norm/#c16783|title=Vastgoed van en voor het Rijk|publisher=Rgd.nl|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it updated on 1 July 2012.

====Norway====
In Norway BIM has been used increasingly since 2008. Several large public clients require use of BIM in open formats (IFC) in most or all of their projects. The Government Building Authority bases its processes on BIM in open formats to increase process speed and quality, and all large and several small and medium-sized contractors use BIM. National BIM development is centred around the local organisation, buildingSMART Norway which represents 25% of the Norwegian construction industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====Poland====
BIMKlaster (BIM Cluster) is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation established in 2012 with the aim of promoting BIM development in Poland.&lt;ref name="BIMKlaster"&gt;{{cite web|title=BIMKlaster|url=http://www.bimklaster.org.pl/?lang=en|website=BIMKlaster.org.pl|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Construction began a series of expert meetings concerning the application of BIM methodologies in the construction industry.&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=KPMG and Arup|title=Building Information Modeling: Ekspertyza dotycząca możliwości wdrożenia metodyki BIM w Polsce ("Building Information Modeling.

====Portugal====
Created in 2015 to promote the adoption of BIM in Portugal and its normalisation, the Technical Committee for BIM Standardisation, CT197-BIM, has created the first strategic document for construction 4.0 in Portugal, aiming to align the country's industry around a common vision, integrated and more ambitious than a simple technology change.&lt;ref name="BIMplus-4Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguiar Costa|first1=Antonio|title=Construction 4.0 in Portugal|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/people/con2st6ruction-40-portu5gal/|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=Construction Manager: BIM+|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====

The Russian government has approved a list of the regulations that provide the creation of a legal framework for the use of information modeling of buildings in construction.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Slovakia====
The BIM Association of Slovakia, "BIMaS", was established in January 2013 as the first Slovakian professional organisation focused on BIM. Although there are neither standards nor legislative requirements to deliver projects in BIM, many architects, structural engineers and contractors, plus a few investors are already applying BIM. A Slovakian implementation strategy created by BIMaS and supported by the Chamber of Civil Engineers and Chamber of Architects has yet to be approved by Slovakian authorities due to their low interest in such innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bimas.sk BIMaS.sk], BIMaS website. Accessed: 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
A July 2015 meeting at Spain’s Ministry of Infrastructure [Ministerio de Fomento] launched the country’s national BIM strategy, making BIM a mandatory requirement on public sector projects with a possible starting date of 2018.&lt;ref name=BIMplusSpain&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knutt|first1=Elaine|title=Spain launches BIM strategy with pencilled-in 2018 mandate|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/news/spain-launches-bim-strategy-pencilled-2018-mandate/|accessdate=20 August 2015|work=Construction Manager: BIMplus|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a February 2015 BIM summit in Barcelona, professionals in Spain's [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]] established a BIM commission (ITeC) to drive the adoption of BIM in the region.&lt;ref name="ITeC"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Comissió Construïm el Futur (transl: The Commission Building the Future)|url=https://itec.cat/serveis/bim/comissio-construim-el-futur/|website=ITeC|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
Since 2009 through the initiative of buildingSmart Switzerland, then 2013, BIM awareness among a broader community of engineers and architects was raised due to the open competition for [[Basel]]'s Felix Platter Hospital&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.felixplatterspital.ch/fileadmin/pdf/Neubau/Gesamtleistungswettbewerb_Felix_Platter_Spital_simap.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110135358/http://www.felixplatterspital.ch/fileadmin/pdf/Neubau/Gesamtleistungswettbewerb_Felix_Platter_Spital_simap.pdf|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a BIM coordinator was sought. BIM has also been a subject of events by the Swiss Society for Engineers and Architects, SIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sia.ch/de/der-sia/berufsgruppen/technik/jahrestagung-2013|title=jahrestagung 2013 - sia - schweizerischer ingenieur- und architektenverein|work=sia - schweizerischer ingenieur- und architektenverein|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====

In May 2011 UK Government [[Chief Construction Adviser to UK Government|Chief Construction Adviser]] [[Paul Morrell]] called for BIM adoption on UK government construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/roundtable/|title=BIM Roundtable Discussion|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell also told construction professionals to adopt BIM or be "Betamaxed out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/adopt-bim-or-be-betamaxed-out-says-morrell/5018263.article|title=Adopt bim or be 'Betamaxed out' says Morrell|work=Building Design|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 the UK government published its BIM strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ktn.innovateuk.org/web/modernbuiltktn/articles/-/blogs/new-construction-strategy?ns_33_redirect=%2Fweb%2Fmodernbuiltktn%2Farticles|title=Modern Built Environment - innovateuk|publisher=Ktn.innovateuk.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing its intention to require collaborative 3D BIM (with all project and asset information, documentation and data being electronic) on its projects by 2016. Initially, compliance will require building data to be delivered in a vendor-neutral '[[COBie]]' format, thus overcoming the limited interoperability of BIM software suites available on the market. The UK Government [[BIM Task Group]] led the government's BIM programme and requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/|title=BIM Task Group - A UK Government Initiative|publisher=Bimtaskgroup.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a free-to-use set of UK standards and tools that define 'level 2 BIM'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/the-level-2-bim-package|title=The level-2 BIM package|publisher=BIM Task Group|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the UK Government published a new central web portal as a point of reference for the industry for BIM Level 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bim-level2.org/ |title=BIM Level 2|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIM Task Group continues to develop BIM adoption within the government departments.

Outside of government, industry adoption of BIM from 2016 has been led by the UK BIM Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukbimalliance.org/|title=UK BIM Alliance|first=WebCider Business|last=Solutions|date=|website=ukbimalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed to champion and enable the implementation of BIM Level 2 by 2020, and to connect and represent organisations, groups and individuals working towards digital transformation of the UK's built environment industry. Established as an independent, not-for-profit, collaboratively-based organisation, the UK BIM Alliance's structure has been developed around an executive team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukbimalliance.org/about-us/executive-team/|title=UKBIMA Executive Team|first=WebCider Business|last=Solutions|date=|website=ukbimalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three core activity areas: engagement, programme and operations (internal support and secretariat functions).

[[National Building Specification]] (NBS), owned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), publishes research into BIM adoption in the UK. There have now been six annual surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/puttingTheIintoBIM.asp|title=Putting the 'I' into BIM|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/bim/articles/nbsNationalBimSurvey_2012.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2012|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/nbsNationalBimSurvey_2013.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2013|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/bim/articles/nbs-national-bim-report-2014.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2014|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/nbs-national-bim-report-2015.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2015|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBS2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/national-bim-report-2016|title=NBS National BIM Report 2016|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2016 survey of 1,000 UK construction professionals revealed that BIM adoption had increased from 13% in 2010 to 54% in 2015.&lt;ref name="NBS2016" /&gt;

===North America===

====Canada====
Several organizations support BIM adoption and implementation in Canada: the Canada BIM Council (CANBIM, founded in 2008),&lt;ref name="Canada BIM Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canbim.com/ |title=Canada BIM Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institute for BIM in Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibc-bim.ca/ |title=Institute for BIM in Canada (IBC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[buildingSMART Canada]] (the Canadian chapter of [[buildingSMART]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingsmartcanada.ca/ |title=buildingSMART Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States of America====
The [[Associated General Contractors of America]] and US contracting firms have developed various working definitions of BIM that describe it generally as:

:''an object-oriented building development tool that utilizes 3-D modeling concepts, information technology and software interoperability to design, construct and operate a building project, as well as communicate its details.''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Although the concept of BIM and relevant processes are being explored by contractors, architects and [[real estate developers|developers]] alike, the term itself has been questioned and debated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aecbytes.com/newsletter/2004/issue_5.html|title=AECbytes Archived Articles|publisher=Aecbytes.com|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021134606/http://www.aecbytes.com/newsletter/2004/issue_5.html|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with alternatives including [[Virtual Building Environment]] (VBE) and virtual design and construction (VDC) also considered. Unlike some countries such as the UK, the US has not adopted a set of national BIM guidelines, allowing different systems to remain in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/setting-a-standard-in-building-information-modeling_o|title=Setting a Standard in Building Information Modeling (Architect Magazine)|last=Shapiro|first=Gideon Fink|date=May 2, 2014|website=www.architectmagazine.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIM is seen to be closely related to [[Integrated Project Delivery]] (IPD) where the primary motive is to bring the teams together early on in the project.&lt;ref&gt;AIA, C.C., A working Definition: Integrated Project Delivery. 2007, McGraw Hill Construction{{page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full implementation of BIM also requires the project teams to collaborate from the inception stage and formulate model sharing and ownership contract documents.

The [[American Institute of Architects]] has defined BIM as "a model-based technology linked with a database of project information",{{ref|definition}} and this reflects the general reliance on database technology as the foundation. In the future, structured text documents such as [[specifications]] may be able to be searched and linked to regional, national, and international standards.

===Africa===

====Nigeria====
BIM has the potential to play a vital role in the Nigerian AEC sector. In addition to its potential clarity and transparency it may help promote standardization across the industry. For instance, Utiome&lt;ref&gt;Utiome, Erezi, Drogemuller, Robin, &amp; Docherty, Michael (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/76076/ "BIM-based lifecycle planning and specifications for sustainable cities of the future : a conceptual approach"]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that, in conceptualizing a BIM-based knowledge transfer framework from industrialized economies to urban construction projects in developing nations, generic BIM objects can benefit from rich building information within specification parameters in product libraries, and used for efficient, streamlined design and construction. Similarly, an assessment of the current 'state of the art' by Kori&lt;ref&gt;Kori, S. (2013). Toward Adoption of Building Information Modelling in the Nigeria AEC industry. MSc, University of Salford, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; found that medium and large firms were leading the adoption of BIM in the industry. Smaller firms were less advanced with respect to process and policy adherence.
There is little or less adoption of BIM in the built environment due to resistive nature of construction industry to changes or new ways of doing things. Till now, Nigerian construction industry is still working with the 2D conventional CAD system in services and structural designs, although the production could be in 3D system. There is virtually 0% utilization of 4D and 5D systems.

====South Africa====
The South African BIM Institute, established in May 2015, aims to enable technical experts to discuss digital construction solutions that can be adopted by professionals working within the construction sector. Its initial task was to promote the SA BIM Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biminstitute.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no mandated or national best practice BIM standards or protocols in South Africa. Organisations implement company-specific BIM standards and protocols at best (there are isolated examples of cross-industry alliances).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In February 2016, Infrastructure Australia recommended: "Governments should make the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) mandatory for the design of large-scale complex infrastructure projects. In support of a mandatory rollout, the Australian Government should commission the Australasian Procurement and Construction Council, working with industry, to develop appropriate guidance around the adoption and use of BIM; and common standards and protocols to be applied when using BIM.”&lt;ref name="BIMCrunchFeb2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Infrastructure Australia recommend BIM mandate for large-scale projects|url=http://bimcrunch.com/2016/02/infrastructure-australia-recommend-bim-mandate-for-large-scale-projects/|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=BIM Crunch|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
In 2015, many projects in the rebuilding of [[Christchurch]] were being assembled in detail on a computer using BIM well before workers set foot on the site. The New Zealand government started a BIM acceleration committee, as part of a productivity partnership with the goal of 20 per cent more efficiency in the construction industry by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'', Tuesday 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticipated future potential==
BIM is a relatively new technology in an industry typically slow to adopt change. Yet many early adopters are confident that BIM will grow to play an even more crucial role in building documentation.&lt;ref name=kensek2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kensek|first1=Karen|last2=Noble|first2=Douglas|year = 2014 | title =  Building Information Modeling:  BIM in Current and Future Practice | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents claim that BIM offers:
#Improved visualization
#Improved productivity due to easy retrieval of information
#Increased coordination of construction documents
#Embedding and linking of vital information such as vendors for specific materials, location of details and quantities required for estimation and tendering
#Increased speed of delivery
#Reduced costs

BIM also contains most of the data needed for [[building performance]] analysis.&lt;ref name=Kensek1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kensek|first=Karen|year = 2014 | title = Building Information Modeling | location = Hoboken, New York|publisher=Routledge|edition=1st |pages=152–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building properties in BIM can be used to automatically create the input file for [[building performance simulation]] and save a significant amount of time and effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmani Asl|first=Mohammad|author2=Saied Zarrinmehr|author3=Wei Yan|title=Towards BIM-based Parametric Building Energy Performance Optimization|journal=ACADIA 2013|url=http://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?acadia13_101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, automation of this process reduce errors and mismatches in the building performance simulation process.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the Building Information Modeling efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbxml.org/|title=Welcome - Green Building XML Schema|publisher=Gbxml.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of modern computer technology, a large number of building performance simulation tools are available. When choosing which simulation tool to use, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=Abraham |last2=Dong |first2=Bing |last3=Leite |first3=Fernanda |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=612–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

Explorations are underway to pair computer network users' personal, private and public authentication choices, geographic mapping systems and evolving cloud computing security architecture models, together, to offer customers of geospatial securitization services intuitive new ways to organize their personal, private and public applications and storage.  For individuals, businesses and government authorities who generate and manage building information, new ways to discover, share and work on data, within the context of particular places on earth, will be offered.  David Plager, AIA, conjectures that today's web will give way to tomorrow's geo-web where data will be structured first by place (e.g. a postal address) and then by space (Personal (one user), Private (a group of users) and Public (all users)).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===BIM-GIS integration===
#Industrial Foundation Class (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) are two primary and popular standards for BIM-[[GIS]] integration.
#BIM provides improved solutions for satisfying user requirements with BIM-GIS integration supported by spatio-temporal analysis.&lt;ref name=song&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Xiangyu Wang|title=Trends and Opportunities of BIM-GIS Integration in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry: A Review from a Spatio-Temporal Statistical Perspective|journal=ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building information science===
BIM will develop as building information science involving systematic theories, concepts, methods, technologies, applications and management for the digitization, visualization, quantitative analysis and decision-making of whole project life cycles in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.&lt;ref name=song /&gt;

The '''common furniture beetle''' or '''common house borer''' (''Anobium punctatum'') is a [[woodboring beetle]]. In the [[larva]]l stage it bores in wood and feeds upon it. Adult ''Anobium punctatum'' measure {{convert|2.7|–|4.5|mm}} in length. They have brown ellipsodial bodies with a [[prothorax]] resembling a monk's [[cowl]]&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.termite.com/borers-pest-control.html|title=Pest Control of Timber Borers|date=2006-10-22 |publisher=Fumanest Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
Adults do not feed; they just reproduce. The female lays her eggs into cracks in wood or inside old exit holes, if available. The eggs hatch after some three weeks, each producing a {{convert|1|mm}} long, creamy white, C-shaped larva. For three to four years the larvae bore semi-randomly through timber, following and eating the starchy part of the wood grain, and grow up to {{convert|7|mm}}. They come nearer to the wood surface when ready to pupate. They excavate small spaces just under the wood surface and take up to eight weeks to pupate. The adults then break through the surface, making a 1&amp;nbsp;mm to {{convert|1.5|mm}} exit hole and spilling dust, the first visible signs of an infestation.

==Pest control==

The first step in pest control is prevention. Particularly important in this respect is to keep the timber dry - below 16% moisture content. A relative humidity within the building above 60% may lead to an infestation, and timber moisture content below 12% is too dry for an infection to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/woodworm/woodworm.htm |title=Woodworm Anobium Punctatum |publisher=[[Cathedral Communications Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anobium punctatum'' normally only attacks seasoned [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] timber, not live or fresh wood. Also, it usually does not attack [[heartwood]] timbers. This is readily observed from infested structures, where one piece of timber may be heavily attacked but an adjacent one left virtually untouched according to whether it is made from the heartwood or the sapwood part of a tree trunk. Infestations are also usually a problem of old wooden houses built with untreated timbers. Some building regulations state that timbers with more than 25% sapwood may not be used, so that wood borer infections can not substantially weaken structures.

Infection, past or present, is diagnosed by small round exit holes of 1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. Active infections feature the appearance of new exit holes and fine wood dust around the holes.

Because of the 3–4 year life cycle of ''Anobium punctatum'', timber or timber products bought containing an ''A. punctatum'' infection may not manifest holes until years after the timber has been acquired. Infestation can be controlled by application of a residual [[insecticide]] (such as [[permethrin]]) to infected areas, by professional fumigation, or by replacing infected timber&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.ubc.ca/fetch21/FRST308/lab8/anobium_punctatum/furniture.html |title=''Anobium punctatum'' (Anobiidae) |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple aerosol insecticide sprays will only kill the adult borer on the wing but not the burrowing larvae, which remain relatively protected inside infected timbers. Freezing infected timber, or heating to 50&amp;nbsp;°C for a day or more, will kill beetle larvae, but offer no residual protection.

A '''continuing education unit''' ('''CEU''') or '''continuing education credit''' ('''CEC''') is a measure used in [[continuing education]] programs to assist the professional to maintain his or her license in their profession.  Continuing education or professional development is required in many fields, including teachers, insurance professionals, interior designers/interior architects, lighting designers, architects, engineers, [[Emergency management|emergency management professionals]], school administrators, educators, nurses, mental health professionals, psychologists and social workers.  The continuing education unit is described as ten hours of participation in an education program.  

The term CEU is not a trademarked term; therefore, any educational institution may use it to describe their courses.  In this regard, there are no requirements for educator qualifications that are attached to each institutions courses when offering CEUs.  There have been some bodies created which are attempting to standardize and accredit institutions using the term CEU, the International Association for Continuing Education and Training being one of them; however, professions and industries usually regulate their approved continuing education within their bylaws and not one institute or accrediting body has become a standard to accept in this regard.  Professionals should always consult their Association or regulating body prior to embarking on continuing education and not assume a CEU will be accepted as part of their professional development.

'''Cooking Vinyl''' is a UK independent record company, based in [[Acton, London]]. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/cooking-vinyl-reveals-30th-anniversary-plans/065780|title=Cooking Vinyl Reveals 30th Anniversary Plans |publisher=[[Music Week]]|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1986 by former manager and booking agent [[Martin Goldschmidt]] and business partner [[Pete Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/label-profiles-four-independents-under-the-spotlight-8712226.html|title=Label profiles: Four independents under the spotlight|date=2006-05-23|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldschmidt remains the current owner and chairman while Rob Collins holds the position of managing director. The company focusses on artist service based deals where the artist retains ownership of their copyrights &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

==History==

===1986–1992===

Cooking Vinyl was set up in 1986 by former manager and booking agent [[Martin Goldschmidt]] and distribution manager Pete Lawrence, who initially ran the business as a part-time venture out of a spare room in Goldschmidt's council house in Stockwell, South London.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/10/martin-goldschmidt-industry-profile-w-larry-leblanc-interview.html|title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On 30 Years of Indie Music|publisher=HypeBot|accessdate=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Cooking Vinyl recorded an impromptu live performance around a campfire at a folk festival by the singer [[Michelle Shocked]], on a Sony [[Walkman]] with fading batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/03/big-chills-pete-lawrence-and-unbound-crowdfund-alfresco-festival-with-book-release.html|title=New Take On Music Crowdfunding From Cooking Vinyl's Pete Lawrence &amp; Book Publisher Unbound|publisher=Hypebot.com|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its first releases, Cooking Vinyl released the recording as The Campfire Tapes, and it sold 250,000 copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1989, the company was close to bankruptcy when their distributors, [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], went into receivership. Pete Lawrence sold his stake in the business to Martin Goldschmidt who continued the business while servicing the debt of the company of a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On 30 Years of Indie Music |url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/10/martin-goldschmidt-industry-profile-w-larry-leblanc-interview.html |website=Hype Bot |publisher=Hype Bot |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–1999===
Besides traditional royalty agreements, Cooking Vinyl developed ‘artist services’ deals in the 1990s, where the artist retains ownership of the copyright of their recorded material.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/hot-seat-martin-goldschmidt-founder-cooking-vinyl/|title=Hot Seat: Martin Goldschmidt – Founder, Cooking Vinyl|publisher=[[The Music Network]]|date=2013-12-06|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these contracts was done in 1993 for the reissue of [[Billy Bragg]]'s ''[[Back to Basics (Billy Bragg album)|Back To Basics]]'' compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/festival-of-business/9075644/Why-music-is-still-good-business.html|title=Why music is still good business|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|date=2012-02-11|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Bragg has re-engaged with Cooking Vinyl a total of six times, most recently in 2013 for the release of studio album ''[[Tooth &amp; Nail (Billy Bragg album)|Tooth And Nail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/billy-bragg-re-signs-with-cooking-vinyl/053181|title=Billy Bragg re-signs with Cooking Vinyl|publisher=[[Music Week]]|date=2013-01-16|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooking Vinyl has provided similar services for Alison Moyet, Black Spiders, Gary Numan, James Skelly &amp; The Intenders, Madness, Pigeon Detectives, Reverend and The Makers, Ron Sexsmith, and The View.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Label Services Report|date=2013-04-18|publisher=[[Music Week]]|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockol.com/uk/news-499691/cooking-vinyl-cuts-deals-with-ub40s-ali-campbell-seth-lakeman|title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On Universal-EMI Deal, Marilyn Manson, the Rise of Indies|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2013-05-16|accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–2010===
In 2009, Cooking Vinyl partnered on the release of The Prodigy's fifth studio album ''[[Invaders Must Die]]'', which went on to sell 1.2 million units worldwide and was the biggest-selling independent record of the year in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/indies/1097203/cooking-vinyls-martin-goldschmidt-on-universal-emi-deal-marilyn|title=Cooking Vinyl cuts deals with UB40’s Ali Campbell, Seth Lakeman|publisher=Rockol.com|date=2012-05-03|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was funded through a high-profile Kickstarter campaign that raised over $1.2 million in 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/indies/1093012/amanda-palmer-partners-with-uk-indie-cooking-vinyl-for-european|title=Amanda Palmer Partners With U.K. Indie Cooking Vinyl For European Album Release|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2012-06-21|accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural reproduction''' is the transmission of existing cultural values and norms from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Sociological Terms - School of Sociology and Anthropology - University of Canterbury - New Zealand, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural reproduction refers to the mechanisms by which continuity of cultural experience is sustained across time. Cultural reproduction often results in [[social reproduction]], or the process of transferring aspects of society (such as class) from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bilton, Tony, Introductory Sociology (3rd ed) London, Macmillan, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

# Groups of people, notably social classes, act to reproduce the existing [[social structure]] to preserve their advantage&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# The processes of schooling in modern societies are among the main mechanisms of cultural reproduction, and do not operate solely through what is taught in courses of formal instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. "Pierre Bourdieu" Polity Press, Vol. 581, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reproduction]] as it is applied to culture, is the process by which aspects of culture are passed on from person to person or from society to society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There are a number of different ways in which this has happened. Historically, people have moved from different countries taking with them certain cultural norms and traditions. For centuries cultural reproduction has occurred in a profound way through a hidden agenda. Cultures transmit aspects of behavior which individuals learn in an informal way while they are out of the home. This interaction between individuals resulting in the transfer of accepted cultural norms, values, and information is accomplished through a process known as [[socialization]].

==Methods==

The method through which cultural reproduction is perpetuated varies by the socializing agent's relative location, awareness, and intention to reproduce social or cultural norms. 

[[Enculturation]] can be described as "a partly conscious and partly unconscious learning experience when the older generation invites, induces, and compels the younger generation to adopt traditional ways of thinking and behaving".&lt;ref&gt;Learning Commons: What is Culture? http://www.wsu.edu/gened/learn-modules/top_culture/glossary/glossary-text.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although, in many ways [[Enculturation]] duplicates the norms and traditions of previous generations. The degree of similarity between the cultures of each successive generation through enculturation may vary.  This concept could be demonstrated by the tendency of each successive generation to follow cultural norms such as transportation right of way.  These expectations are set forth and replicated by the prior generation.  There may be little if any empirical evidence supporting a choice of driving in one lane or another, yet with each new generation, the accepted norm of that individual's culture is reinforced and perpetuated. Parents and educators prove to be two of the most influential enculturating forces of cultural reproduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Gray, Ann, and Jim McGuigan, eds. Studying Culture: An Introductory Reader. London: Edward Arnold, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comparatively, [[diffusion]] is the dispersion of cultural norms and behaviors between otherwise unrelated groups or individuals. The integration of Chinese food or French [[linguistics]] into American culture represents this concept.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Education as an agent==

Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction  &lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu,Pierre and Jean Claude Passeron, (1990) Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture, Sage Publications Inc, {{ISBN|0-8039-8320-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned with the link between original class membership and ultimate class membership, and how this link is mediated by the education system.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A. 2002. 'Bourdieu and Education: How Useful is Bourdieu's Theory for Researchers?' Netherlands Journal of Social Sciences. 38(2) 144-166.http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/core/documents/download.asp?id=1423&amp;log_stat=1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sullivan (2001),&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A. 2001 'Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment' Sociology 35(4) 839-912. http://soc.sagepub.com/content/35/4/893.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; the theory of cultural reproduction entails three fundamental propositions:
# parental cultural capital is inherited by children.
# children's cultural capital is converted into educational credentials.
# educational credentials are a major mechanism of social reproduction in advanced capitalist societies.

The concept of education as an agent of cultural reproduction is argued to be less directly explained by the material and a subject taught, but rather more so through what is known as the [[Hidden curriculum]]. This refers to the socialization aspect of the education process.  Through this, an adolescent acquires 'appropriate attitudes and values' needed to further succeed within the confines of education.  
An adolescent's success or failure within the formal education system is a function of both their ability to demonstrate both measures of formal educational qualifications, as well as the attainment of the aforementioned qualities acquired through socialization mechanisms.  This nature of education is reproduced throughout all stages of the system; from primary to post secondary.  The ability of a student to progress to each subsequent level requires mastery of the prior. One's ability to successfully complete the process of educational attainment strongly correlates to the capacity to realize adequate pay, occupational prestige, social status, etc. upon workforce participation.&lt;ref name="EduRole"&gt;Jeffery I. Butler and Karen L. Robson, "Reassessing the Role of Education in Social Reproduction: The Impact of School Type on the Cultural and Social Capital of High School Students in the U.S."&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear consensus as to the exact role of education within cultural reproduction; and further to what degree, if any, this system either encourages or discourages topics such as social stratification, resource inequality, and discrepancies in access to opportunities.  It's believed, however, that the primary means in which education determines an individual's social status, class, values, and hierarchy, is through the distribution of cultural capital.  This notion of cultural capital accumulation, and the degree to which an individual attains cultural capital, determines the individual's access to resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction: The Role of Cultural Factors and Educational Mediators, Kathleen Lynch, British Journal of Sociology of Education, Vol. 11, No. 1 (1990), pp. 3-20&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however several competing ideologies and explanations that have been significantly discussed.

Education provides functional prerequisites – known as [[Parsonian Functionalism]] states that education's function is to provide individuals with the necessary values and attitudes for future work.  This forms the assumption that regardless of the trade an individual participates, they will all need a similar set of social skills for their day to day interactions.  From this concept, the idea of education as an Ideological state apparatus emerged. This elaborated on the prior by continuing that both family and school work together to reproduce social classes, occupational hierarchy, value orientation, and ideology.&lt;ref name="EduRole" /&gt;

Education mirrors capitalism – Education mirrors the capitalistic system, in that it sorts individuals, and assigns them the skills necessary to fulfill their destined occupation.  An individual is provided the appropriate attitude that should be observed within the labor force.  Further it establishes an "acceptance to the reproduction of submissive attitude to the established order" &lt;ref name="EduRole" /&gt; With this, education's primary role is believed to be as a method of sorting individuals rather than equally educating.  Those with high levels of accumulated social capital from parents or other sources are more easily able to excel within the system of education.  Thus, these individuals will continue on a track that places these them into specialized and comparatively highly prestigious occupations.  In contrast, those with little social or cultural capital will maintain low levels throughout the process of education and be placed into occupations with little demand for cultural capital – significantly less specialized and prestigious occupation.  With this occupational selection, both the individuals will maintain the cultural norms and social status associated with each outside of their occupations as well.

With any of the concepts, whether considering the intrinsic value of education or the externally perceived value, each unit of educational attainment requires forgone earnings to attain.  Insomuch as an individual would have to sacrifice wages in order to gain an additional unit of education.  Outside of forgone monetary earnings, there are also direct expenses such as tuition, supplies, books, etc. one must consider when acquiring education, as well as less direct psychic costs.  With this there is an economic consideration and tradeoff an individual must consider in their further education aspirations.  One who has resources and the desire to continue education has a significant comparative advantage to an individual who by comparison does not.  This financial aspect of educational acquirement proves as yet another consideration in the reproductive nature of education.

One who successfully completes the process of educational attainment incurs a significant comparative advantage over a similar individual who does not.  Thus the degree to which education reproduces cultural and social norms already present in the underlying society stands to prove a significant factor in the continued propagation of these established norms.  With this harsh divide between individuals who do and do not complete the process of formal education, social stratification and inequality between the two groups emerges.  This further confirms cultural norms and reproduces the same system upon each successive generation.

==History==

The concept of cultural reproduction was first developed by the French sociologist and cultural theorist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in the early 1970s. Initially, Bourdieu's work was on [[education]] in a modern society.&lt;ref name="Jenks, Chris Page 2"&gt;" Jenks, Chris. "Cultural Reproduction Routledge" New York, 1993 Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the education system was used solely to 'reproduce' the culture of the dominant class in order for the dominant class to continue to hold and release power. Bourdieu's ideas were similar to those of [[Louis Althusser]]'s   notion of '[[Ideological State Apparatus]]es' which had emerged around the same time. He began to study [[socialization]] and how dominant culture and certain norms and traditions effected many social relations.&lt;ref name="Jenks, Chris Page 2"/&gt;  

One of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] main concepts on Cultural Reproduction was in their book ''Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction''. Bourdieu's main focus was the structural reproduction of disadvantages and inequalities that are caused by cultural reproduction. According to Bourdieu, inequalities are recycled through the education system and other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre, Distinction: a Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, translated by Richard Nice, Harvard University Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu believed that the prosperous and affluent societies of the west were becoming the "cultural capital".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; High social class, familiarity with the [[bourgeois]] culture and educational credentials determined one's life chances. It was biased towards those of higher social class and aided in conserving social hierarchies. This system concealed and neglected individual talent and academic meritocracy. Bourdieu demonstrated most of his known theories in his books ''The Inheritors'' and ''Reproduction in Education, Culture and Society''. Both books established him as a progenitor of "reproduction theory".&lt;ref&gt;Stones, Robs. "Key Contemporary Thinkers"London and New York: Macmillan, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu also pioneered many procedural frameworks and terminologies such as [[cultural]], [[social]], and [[symbolic capital]], and the concepts of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]], [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]], and [[symbolic violence]]. Bourdieu's work emphasized the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics. Bourdieu's theories build upon the conjectures of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]], and [[Norbert Elias]], among others.

==Debate==

Bourdieu is best known for his [[theoretical principle]]s, [[conceptual device]]s and political intentions. He theorizes that what is taught to younger generations is dependent on the varying degrees of [[social]], [[economic]], and [[cultural capital]]. Those cultures have gained [[cultural capital]] and are considered the dominant group among the rest. However, in order to acquire cultural capital one must undergo indiscernible learning and these cultural norms must be used in the earliest days of life.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre, Distinction: a Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, translated by Richard Nice, Harvard University Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through cultural reproduction, only those members of the dominant culture can acquire knowledge in relation to the way it is taught from within this cultural system. Therefore, those who are not members of the dominant culture are at a disadvantage to receive cultural information, and therefore will remain at a disadvantage. Capitalist societies depend on a stratified social system, where the working class has an education suited for manual labor: leveling out such inequalities would break down the system. Therefore, schools in capitalist societies require a method of stratification, and often choose to do so in a way in which the dominant culture will not lose its hegemony. One method of maintaining this stratification is through cultural reproduction.

==Bourdieu central issues==

Bourdieu's sociological work was dominated by an analysis of the mechanisms of reproduction of social hierarchies. In opposition to [[Marxist]] analyses, Bourdieu criticized the primacy given to the economic factors, and stressed that the capacity of social actors to actively impose and engage their cultural productions and symbolic systems plays an essential role in the reproduction of social structures of domination. What Bourdieu called symbolic violence (the capacity to ensure that the predictability of the social order is ignored—or misrecognized as natural—and thus to ensure the legitimacy of social structures) plays an essential part in his sociological analysis.

'''''Dark Side of the Moon''''' is a French [[mockumentary]] by director [[William Karel]] which originally aired on [[Arte]] in 2002 with the title '''''Opération Lune'''''. The basic premise for the film is the theory that the television footage from the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing was [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|faked and recorded in a studio]] by the [[CIA]] with help from director [[Stanley Kubrick]]. It features some surprising guest appearances, most notably by [[Donald Rumsfeld]], Dr. [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Alexander Haig]], [[Vernon Walters]], [[Buzz Aldrin]] and Stanley Kubrick's widow, [[Christiane Kubrick]].

== Plot==

The first part tells in an apparently neutral way the inception of the [[NASA]]'s lunar program, emphasizing the issues related to its funding and the necessary public support to the program. NASA regards Stanley Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as the prototype of the show that the space program needs to be in order to gain this support, leading them to design the spacesuits and vessels in a "Hollywood"  fashion and even to hire 700 Hollywood technicians, making all of Hollywood stop working on other projects. But the outcome of [[Apollo 11]] is disappointing: although the landing is successful, [[Neil Armstrong]] makes a fool of himself and not a single shot of the moonwalk is usable.
	 
The incapability of shooting images on the moon had been anticipated by [[Richard Nixon]] and his staff who decided to fake the pictures on the moon, using the set of ''2001'' that was still available in [[London]]. Kubrick had refused, then accepted and finally directed the fake footage himself, appalled by the lack of skills of the CIA crew. The [[KGB]] soon realized that "the whole thing was a hoax", that Apollo 11 had indeed landed but it was physically impossible to make pictures in the lunar environment. Besides, they had found a photo showing a portrait of Kubrick lying on the false lunar soil in the studio.
	 
After the success of the fake footage, Nixon gets scared that the truth might be discovered, and in a drunken state asks CIA Colonel [[North by Northwest|George Kaplan]] to dispose of the whole film crew. The next morning he tries to cancel the order, but it is too late: meanwhile Kaplan has gone mad, sent his killers and disappeared. The death squad goes to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] where the film crew has sought refuge, but is immediately caught by the villagers: despite a perfect accent and disguise, their commanding officer was [[African Americans|black]]. Nixon reacts by sending 150,000 men and a half of the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] to find and kill the four members of the crew. They fail, and the CIA takes over and assassinates all but one of them, who takes shelter in a [[yeshiva]] in [[Brooklyn]] where he dies ten years later. Only Kubrick is spared.
	 
Five years after Apollo 11, Kubrick calls NASA to borrow the top-secret wide-aperture [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] lens he needs to make ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''. As a result, Nixon's [[Gerald Ford|successor]] decides to get rid of him as the last witness of the conspiracy. Informed of the threat to his life, Kubrick locks himself up in his home and never leaves it until his death.
	 
As a conclusion, General [[Vernon A. Walters|Vernon Walters]] accepts to reveal the secret of Kubrick's demise, but unexpectedly dies the next evening: he has accepted to break the CIA rule of silence and anonymity.
	 
It is finally revealed that this is a mockumentary as the end credits roll over a montage of [[blooper]] reels, with the main participants laughing over their lines or over their inability to remember them.

==Production==

===Development===
William Karel had just completed ''Hollywood'', a film based on lying, when he and the documentary unit of Arte had the idea of making a mockumentary, to play with the serious tonality of Arte but also for pleasure, and to make a funny film based on the idea that one must not believe everything that one is told, that witnesses can lie, archives can be tricked, and that any subject can be twisted by misleading subtitling or dubbing. They looked for a topic that would be universal and historical but not sensitive like a war. Hence the choice of the Moon landing, which had for more than 30 years been a topic of debate regarding the reality of these images. They found it was a fairly funny topic.&lt;ref name="itv_arte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/fr/histoire-societe/archives/operation-lune/William-Karel/385476.html |title=Interview: Entretien avec William Karel |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228130319/http://www.arte.tv/fr/histoire-societe/archives/operation-lune/William-Karel/385476.html |archivedate = 2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karel took care to avoid any conspiracist tonality. In particular, at no point is it said that Armstrong did not walk on the moon. The script just hypothesizes that the US might have wanted a contingency plan in case the first steps could not be filmed.&lt;ref name="itv_arte" /&gt; The arguments regarding the impossibility to operate a camera on the moon were found in websites.&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt;
 	
Since it was impossible to know at what point of the film the spectators would start having doubts, parodic bloopers were added in the end credits to make the hoax obvious, in case someone would believe it until the end.&lt;ref name="itv_arte" /&gt;

===Elements===
The film uses four main types of elements:&lt;ref name="itv_arte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cerimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Débat avec William Karel autour de son film Opération lune (video in French)|url=http://www.canal-u.tv/video/cerimes/debat_avec_william_karel_autour_de_son_film_operation_lune.9121|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Karel interviewed Kubrick's widow, [[Christiane Kubrick]], and his brother-in-law, [[Jan Harlan]], pretending he was making a documentary on Kubrick, his film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', the Moon or NASA, and asking intentionally vague questions. Karel also interviewed [[Vernon A. Walters|Vernon Walters]], [[Buzz Aldrin]], his wife and some NASA personnel, under the same pretext of making a bona fide documentary.
* He used footage of staff of President Richard Nixon, including [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]], [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]], [[Alexander Haig|Haig]], [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA director]] [[Richard Helms]], recycled from his earlier documentary ''Les hommes de la Maison Blanche'' &lt;ref name=les_hommes&gt;{{cite web|title=Page of "Les hommes de la Maison Blanche" on the Point du Jour catalogue |url=http://www.pointdujour-international.com/catalogueFiche.php?lang=fr&amp;alpha=&amp;typeAlpha=&amp;rub=0&amp;idFiche=16801&amp;projet=|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited in order to twist their words.
* Other "witnesses" are played by actors to make the connections between the sentences pronounced by "real witnesses" and make a credible story. Among many giveaways (mainly in the second half) that the entire film is a hoax in jest, these "staging" witnesses are named after characters in Kubrick and Hitchcock films, for instance an astronaut named "David Bowman" (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)]]''), a film producer named "Jack Torrance" (''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') or Nixon's secretary called "Eve Kendall" (''[[North by Northwest]]'').
* Other elements appearing in the second half are "borrowed" from various documentaries that are mentioned in the end credits. These are the only parts of the film in which deceptive subtitling is used: ''Australie, la route de Tanami'' (Arnaud Mansir, Hervé Rébillon, 1999), ''L'archipel aux savants'' (Laurence Graffin, 1997), ''Philippine : la vallée des rizières éternelles'' (Patrick Boitet, Jacques Massart, 1994), ''Cambodge : Païlin, le refuge des criminels'' (Hubert Dubois, 1999), ''Chine : union furtive'' (Fang Wui Wang, 2000), ''Laos : les montagnards de l'opium'' (Eric Pierrot, 1997).

===Special effects===
The photo showing a portrait of Kubrick on the lunar soil is the only image in which a [[special effect]] was used.&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt;

== Giveaways ==
In addition to the increasingly incredible claims made as the film progresses, several factual errors of note are introduced by the narrator:
* [[John F. Kennedy]]'s "[[We choose to go to the Moon|We choose to go to the moon]]" speech was in 1962,&lt;ref name=kennedy_speech&gt;{{cite web|title=John F. Kennedy Moon Speech - Rice Stadium |url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 1961 as was claimed.
* [[Luna 9]] landed on the moon in February 1966,&lt;ref name=luna9&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mission of Luna 9 |url=http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna09.php|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the narrator states it was in January.
* The narrator states that Apollo 11 was launched on 17 July 1969, when in fact it was launched the day before on July 16.&lt;ref name=apollo11_overview&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 11 Mission Overview |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sergei Korolev|Korolev]] died following surgery to remove a polyp from his intestines,&lt;ref name=korolev_bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Korolev, mastermind of the Soviet space program|url=http://www.cosmos-club.org/journals/1998/harford.html|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129224805/http://www.cosmos-club.org/journals/1998/harford.html|archivedate=29 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not from a tonsillectomy as is claimed.
* [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] is said to have been the [[Governor of Texas]] – an office he never held.&lt;ref name=texas_governors&gt;{{cite web|title=Governors of Texas, 1846-present |url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/governors.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, Richard Nixon is erroneously stated as having once been the [[Governor of California]].&lt;ref name=california_governors&gt;{{cite web|title=List of California Governors |url=http://governors.library.ca.gov/list.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The narrator implies the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape]] was selected in part due to the [[George H. W.

* [[Farouk El-Baz]] is presented as NASA technical director, a position he never held.&lt;ref name=el_baz&gt;{{cite web|title=Farouk El-Baz curriculum vitae |url=http://www.bu.edu/remotesensing/faculty/el-baz/cv/|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the fictitious witnesses are named after characters from movies directed by Stanley Kubrick or [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. "W.A. Koenigsberg" is named after [[Woody Allen]], who was born "Allan Koenigsberg". They are listed in the credits along with the names of the actors portraying them.

The film crew member who takes shelter in a yeshiva in Brooklyn is said to be an "acidic" Jew. In the original French version the giveaway is more obvious: it is said that "he didn't work any more, he checked in with the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]", ("Il ne travaillait plus, il pointait aux Hassidiques", which does not make sense in French but is an obvious pun between a branch of Judaism and [[ASSEDIC]] which was the French employment office at the time the film was made).

The soundtrack also includes the song "The American Dream" from ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' by [[Barry Levinson]], a fiction feature about a secretly government-commissioned Hollywood production of a fake war. At one point, footage featuring the military boarding a plane is underscored by the "right, left, right, left" of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Hartman ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) from Kubrick's own film, ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.

The most obvious giveaway appears in the closing credits with [[blooper]] reels showing the characters, real and fictitious alike, laughing over their lines or over their inability to remember them. But there is a final trick here, a "hoax within a hoax": the real characters are shown joking, giving the false impression that they are voluntarily part of the hoax.&lt;ref name=itv_arte /&gt; In fact at least one of these "jokes" - Kissinger saying that he would do it all over again - appears in ''Les hommes de la Maison Blanche'' &lt;ref name=les_hommes /&gt; where he turns out to be actually talking quite seriously about the war in Vietnam.

==Characters==

=== Actual "witnesses" ===
* [[Christiane Kubrick]] is Stanley Kubrick's widow.
* [[Jan Harlan]] is the executive producer for all Kubrick's films from ''Barry Lyndon'' on. He also is Christiane Kubrick's brother: they both appear discussing the "plot" of the film on the same couch.
* [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Alexander Haig]], and [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] were members of Richard Nixon's cabinet while the latter was president.
* [[Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin]] was the second man to walk on the moon as [[Lunar Excursion Module|LEM]] pilot of Apollo 11. The alcoholism and depression problems mentioned in the film are not fictitious: he discussed them in his autobiographic book "Magnificent Desolation: the long journey home from the moon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon (book presentation on the publisher's web site)|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/1798/magnificent-desolation-by-buzz-aldrin-with-ken-abraham/|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lois Aldrin was Aldrin's wife when the film was shot. They divorced in 2012.
* [[David Scott]] and [[Jeffrey A. Hoffman]] are both retired NASA astronauts. Scott walked on the moon as commander of [[Apollo 15]].
* [[Farouk El-Baz]] is an [[Egyptian Americans|Egyptian American]] scientist who worked with NASA on the [[Apollo programme]], on the training of the astronauts in observations and photography, the analysis of data returned from the moon, and the supervision of the work of geoscientists and engineers in fields related to lunar exploration. Since 1986 he has been a professor and the director of the Center for Remote Sensing at [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name=el_baz /&gt; He was never technical director of NASA as said in the film.
* [[Richard Helms]] was director of the CIA during the Nixon presidency, from June 1966 to February 1973.
* [[Vernon Walters]] has a particular importance in the film because of his involvement in the moon race, and the competition with the Soviet Union. He was interviewed because of his in-depth knowledge of these aspects. He died a week after the first interview he gave to William Karel, preventing a scheduled second interview from taking place.&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt; The sentence in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', saying that he appeared in a French television documentary, is a fake: the actual obituary available on the web site of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kelley | first = Tina | title = Vernon A. Walters, 85, Former Envoy to U.N. | newspaper = New York Times | date = 15 February 2002 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/world/vernon-a-walters-85-former-envoy-to-un.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He was great as our James Bond, getting us in and out secretly, even giving us code names," said [[Winston Lord]], former president of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], who accompanied Mr. Kissinger to the secret talks with the Vietnamese.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

whereas the paper shown in the film says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;General Walters' last known public appearance was on a French Television documentary in which he talked about the White House's involvement with the Apollo program in the late 1960s.  Both the producer and director noted that Walters was in perfect shape.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fictitious witnesses ===

The names of the fictitious witnesses and of the actors impersonating them appear in the end credits. Moreover, Arte (co-producer and original broadcaster of the film) accompanied the airing in France by a web site featuring a quiz&lt;ref name="arte_jeu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/static/c1/021016p_lune/lune_f/olFR.swf|title=Quiz game on Arte website (in French) |accessdate = 2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the player was led to guess in which films the characters having those names originally appeared. The following list reproduces the correct answers of the quiz.

* [[Jack Torrance]] is a fictional character in Kubrick's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', not a Hollywood Producer, and is played by David Winger.
* [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] is a fictional character in Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)]]'', not a real astronaut, and is played by Tad Brown.
* Maria Vargas (lead character in ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'') is played by Jacquelyn Toman and is not Buzz Aldrin's sister.
* Eve Kendall is a fictional character in Alfred Hitchcock's ''North by Northwest'' and was not Nixon's secretary (that woman's name was Rose Marie Woods), and is played by Barbara Rogers.
* Dimitri Muffley is a play on the names from Kubrick's ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (Soviet Premier Dimitri Kisov and American President Merkin Muffley) and is not a "former KGB agent." He is played by Bernard Kirschoff.
* Ambrose Chapel is the name of a place in Hitchcock's ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', not an "ex-CIA agent", and is played by John Rogers.
* George Kaplan (mentioned by narrator) is a fictional character within a fictional character in the Hitchcock film, ''[[North By Northwest]]''.
* W. A. Koenigsberg ("W. A." stands for "[[Woody Allen]]", as Koenigsberg is Woody Allen's true name) is played by Binem Oreg.

==Reception==
Arte aired the film for the first time on 16 October 2002, and a second time on 1 April 2004, followed by a debate and accompanied by a web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/fr/histoire-societe/archives/operation-lune/416762.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228054424/http://www.arte.tv/fr/histoire-societe/archives/operation-lune/416762.html |title=Opération lune - ARTE|archivedate = 2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an interview of William Karel&lt;ref name="itv_arte" /&gt; and a quiz demonstrating some of the giveaways including the fake witnesses and out-of-context quotes from interviews.&lt;ref name="arte_jeu" /&gt; At the press screening before the first airing, some people who had missed the beginning left the screening room infuriated.&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt;

Australian broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS television]] aired the film on 1 April 2003 as an [[April Fools' Day|April fools' joke]], on 17 November 2008 as part of Kubrick week, and again on 27 July 2009. About ten television channels worldwide aired the film on 1 April 2004, and [[Channel 4]] aired it in September the same year.&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt;

The producer proposed the film to the [[BBC]], who liked it but rejected it because they perceived it as being part of an "anti-American campaign" in French documentaries.&lt;ref name="itv_arte" /&gt;

===''Dark Side of the Moon'' and moon landing conspiracy theories===
When the film was shown to a group of sociology students studying conspiracy theories, many mistakenly believed that this was a sincere and serious film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1351398/More_Than_a_Hoax |title=More than a hoax: William Karel's critical mockumentary dark side of the moon. |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, moon-landing hoax advocate Wayne Green cited the film as evidence for his views, apparently believing the out of context footage of Nixon staff was really about a moon landing hoax, as discussed on Jay Windley's "clavius.org" site defending the reality of the moon landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/bibwgreen.html|title=Clavius.org/Bibliography/Response to Wayne Green. |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts ranging from a few minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fake Moon Landing explained- A Film by Kubrick , Nixon, Rumsfeld, Kissinger,CIA Richard Helms|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iPOEDSI_i4|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the whole film stripped of the credits and key sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WE NEVER WENT TO THE MOON - 1 of 3|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3YHMnCQXgU|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been posted on YouTube by [[Apollo moon landing hoax accusations|conspiracy theorists]] as "proof" that, either the images on the moon are fake, or the moon landing itself never happened. Karel himself received e-mails congratulating him for "exposing the moon landing hoax", which amused him.&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt;

==Awards==
* Adolf-Grimme-Preis (Germany / 2002) for best script &amp; director &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=(Grimme Pries) Preisträger 2003 |url=http://www.grimme-institut.de/_old_scripts/preis/preistraeger/pt_2003.html |accessdate=28 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203730/http://www.grimme-institut.de/_old_scripts/preis/preistraeger/pt_2003.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 'GO FIGURE!' Festival, Montreal, 2003: Best film on science and society 
* 'GO FIGURE!' Festival, Montreal, 2003: Award for "Excellence in TV or Film"
* [[7 d'Or]], 2003: Mention in the "Best director" and "Best documentary" categories

==Influences==
William Karel indicated that he found inspiration in [[Orson Welles]]' radio broadcast ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[Capricorn One]]'', and the docudramas by [[Peter Watkins]].&lt;ref name="cerimes" /&gt; He refers to ''Dark side of the moon'' as a "documenteur", a French [[portmanteau word]] meaning "liar documentary" (from ''documentaire'' "documentary" + ''menteur'' "liar"), after the title of a film made by [[Agnès Varda]] in 1980-1981.&lt;ref name="itv_arte" /&gt;

Other influences are the staging of well-known historical events for the camera, such as the raising of the flags at Iwo-Jima and at the Reichstag, the American landing in Somalia which was remade a couple of times for the cameras, examplifying the influence of cinema on news coverage.&lt;ref name="itv_arte" /&gt;

==The Zeiss 1:0.7 / 50 mm lens story==
The starting point of the film is the alleged loan of a unique, secret lens by NASA to Kubrick. The truly rare, but not unique and definitely not secret, [[Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7]] lens was designed by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kämmerer|first=J.|title=When is it advisable to improve the quality of camera lenses?|url=http://www.forums.camera-info.com/contaxinfo/pdf_files/When_is_it_advisable_Zeiss_1979.pdf|publisher=Zeiss|accessdate=23 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150424/http://www.forums.camera-info.com/contaxinfo/pdf_files/When_is_it_advisable_Zeiss_1979.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on special request for NASA for the Apollo program,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and a batch of ten were made. The cinematographer of ''Barry Lyndon'', [[John Alcott]], said that Kubrick bought three left over lenses from this batch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Alcott page on ''Great Cinematographers'', from an article in ''American Cinematographer'', December 1975|url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/alcott.htm|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had them extensively modified to make them usable on his 35&amp;nbsp;mm movie camera.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Special Lenses for "Barry Lyndon"|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other lenses of the batch had been sold to NASA, and the tenth one is at the German Movie Museum in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Curiosities: A NASA lens becomes a filmmaker's obsession|url=http://www.urbanglass.org/glass/detail/glass-curiosities-a-nasa-lens-becomes-a-filmmakers-obsession|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMAGGIO ALL'IMMORTALE KUBRICK ED AL MITICO PLANAR 50mm f/0,7 (in Italian)|url=http://www.marcocavina.com/omaggio_a_kubrick.htm|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that NASA ever lent one of their own lenses to Kubrick.

The '''Dominican Institute for Oriental Studies''' or '''IDEO''' (from [[French language|French]]: ''Institut dominicain d'études orientales'') is a basic research centre located in [[Cairo]]. Its research field covers the ten first centuries of [[Islam]].

==History==
The Dominican Institute for Oriental Studies was founded in the early 50's, after the [[Second World War]] came to an end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5837">The '''''Domus Transitoria''''' was [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]'s first palace destroyed by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD, and then replaced by his [[Domus Aurea]] (or Golden House).
[[File:Domus Transitoria Oppio.png|thumb|300px|Domus Transitoria on the Oppian Hill]]

==History==
The palace was intended to connect all of the imperial estates, which had been acquired in various ways, with the Palatine including the [[Gardens of Maecenas|Horti of Maecenas]] and Horti Lamiani, Lolliani, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Domus_Transitoria.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Suetonius]] (Nero 31.1):
"He built a palace extending all the way from the Palatine to the Esquiline, which at first he called the Domus Transitoria, but when it was burned down shortly after its completion and rebuilt, the Golden House".

==Layout and Discovery==
A few isolated parts of the palace have been discovered but the overall plan remains unclear. 
[[Image:RomaPalatinoCriptoporticoNeroniano.jpg|right|thumb|Cryptoporticus of Nero, Palatine]]

===Temple of Venus and Rome===
5 metres below [[Hadrian]]'s [[Temple of Venus and Rome]] a sumptuous rotunda belonging to the palace was discovered in 1828, cut through by foundations of the Domus Aurea.&lt;ref&gt;The Architecture of the Roman Empire: An Introductory Study, Volume 1, William Lloyd MacDonald, p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oppian Hill===
Another part is thought to be on the western side of the [[Oppian Hill]] under the [[Baths of Trajan]].&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli, Rome, Bari and Rome, Laterza, 2012 p 237&lt;/ref&gt;

The brick walls of the palace were originally covered with marble at the bottom, while the upper parts were frescoed. A portico was in front of the domus along the south side. Almost all of the columns, floors and marble walls were removed when Trajan gave orders to build his baths (in 104 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli, Rome, Bari and Rome, Laterza, 2012 p 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside is a big courtyard with porticos on three sides, while the fourth on the north consisted of a cryptoporticus which supported the rear embankment. At the centre of the courtyard, occupied now by a series of long wall to support the overlying trajanic baths are the remains of a fountain; on the eastern part is a large grotto that opens to the courtyard.
[[File:Affreschi dalla domus transitoria di nerone, ninfeo, 54-64 dc ca, 08.jpg|thumb|300px|Fresco from the nymphaeum of the domus transitoria, 54-64 AD]]
[[File:Frammenti di tarsie marmoree dal triclinio della domus transitoria di nerone, 54-64 dc ca., teste 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of marble (opus sectile) from the triclinium (Antiquarium)]]

====Nymphaeum of Polyphemus====
An elaborate nympheum was unfortunately divided in two by a wall of Trajan. Surrounded by a portico of four columns it was equipped with a cascading fountain on the bottom, whose water was conveyed into a central basin. On the walls of the grotto was a mosaic of which only few traces remain within a frame of shells. The lower part of the walls were originally covered in marble.

The decoration of the vault, 10 m high, is preserved only in part where four corner medallions and a central octagon were inserted, the latter partly preserved representing the Polyphemus scene.

===Palatine Hill===
A large and brilliantly decorated set of rooms of the palace was also located in the central part of the [[Palatine Hill]] under the [[Palace of Domitian]]. This site was excavated in 1721 when considerable damage was done during the excavations. The lower floors contained sunken gardens, two pavilions, a [[nymphæum]], and an art gallery. Beyond these rooms is a very large latrine, which has been wrongly thought to be the machinery chamber of a hydraulic lift, which would, it was supposed, have worked in a shaft over 35 metres (120 feet) deep found not far off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Domus_Transitoria.html|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|author=Samuel Ball Platner|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1929|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frammenti di tarsie marmoree dal triclinio della domus transitoria di nerone, 54-64 dc ca., danzatrici 05.jpg|thumb|dancer in marble from the triclinium]]

In one of these rooms is a rich marble floor found under the oval fountain room of Domitian's [[Flavian Palace|Cenatio Iovis]], and a rich [[nymphaeum]] with marble columns and bronze capitals. Today one corner of the nymphaeum has been rebuilt.

The cryptoporticus of Nero that connected the house with the nearby [[Domus Tiberiana]] was also part of the complex.

Marble and other parts salvaged from the ruins later became part of the [[Domus Aurea]], Nero's main residence.

Painted ceilings with mythological scenes from the Domus Transitoria, the earliest examples of fourth style painting, perhaps by the painter [[Fabullus]] are displayed in the [[Palatine Antiquarium]].

{{History of the Netherlands}}
Historically, many '''Dutch military terms''' have been influential and adopted as [[loanword]]s by many other languages all over the world. Although most of these words are connected to naval activities, some (such as "[[forlorn hope]]") relate to land warfare.

Some Dutch naval terms adopted by the various languages include:

{{IPA notice}}
{{Dutch Grammar}}

'''[[Dutch language|Dutch]] phonology''' is similar to that of other [[West Germanic languages]].

While the spelling of Dutch is officially standardised by an international organisation (the [[Dutch Language Union]]), the pronunciation has no official standard and relies on a ''de facto'' standard documented in reference works such as ''The Phonetics of English and Dutch'' by Beverley Collins and Inger M. Mees,{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003}} ''The Phonology of Dutch'' by Geert Booij,{{sfnp|Booij|1999}} ''Dutch'' by Carlos Gussenhoven,{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999}} ''Belgian Standard Dutch'' by Jo Verhoeven{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005}} or pronunciation dictionaries such as ''{{lang|nl|Uitspraakwoordenboek}}'' ("Pronunciation Dictionary") by Josée Heemskerk and Wim Zonneveld.{{sfnp|Heemskerk|Zonneveld|2000}}

Standard Dutch has two main de facto pronunciation standards: Northern and Belgian. Northern Standard Dutch (henceforth Northern SD) is the most prestigious accent in the Netherlands. It is associated with high status, education and wealth. Even though its speakers seem to be concentrated in the provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] (especially in the [[Randstad]]), it cannot be considered a regional dialect. It is often impossible to tell where its speakers were born or brought up. Belgian Standard Dutch (henceforth Belgian SD) is used by the vast majority of Flemish journalists, which is why it is sometimes called ''VRT-Nederlands'' ("VRT Dutch"; formerly ''BRT-Nederlands'' "BRT Dutch"), after [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], the national public-service broadcaster for the [[Flemish Region]].{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=4–5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anw.inl.nl/article/VRT-Nederlands|title=VRT-Nederlands|website=ANW (Algemeen Nederlands Woordenboek)|language=Dutch|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obstruents===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
* The glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is inserted before vowel-initial syllables within words after {{IPA|/aː/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} and often also at the beginning of a word.
* Apart from {{IPA|/r/}}, all alveolar consonants are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]]{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=75}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=189–202}} and can be realized as [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] in Belgium.
* {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are fully voiced.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=75}}
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is not a native phoneme of Dutch and occurs only in borrowed words, like ''goal''. In native words, {{IPA|[ɡ]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/k/}} when it undergoes voicing assimilation, like in ''zakdoek'' {{IPA|[ˈzɑɡduk]}}.
* In the north, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} often devoices and merges with {{IPA|/x/}}; the quality of that merged sound has been variously described as:
** Voiceless post-velar trill fricative {{IPAblink|ʀ̝̊˖}} which, before {{IPA|/j/}}, can be fronted to {{IPAblink|ç}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=191–192}}. The source says that the main allophone of this sound is a fricative with a "very energetic articulation with considerable scrapiness", i.e. a trill fricative.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Voiceless post-velar {{IPAblink|x̠}} or uvular {{IPAblink|χ}} fricative.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=74}}
* In the south, the distinction between {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is generally preserved as velar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|x}}, {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}} or post-palatal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|x̟}}, {{IPA link|ɣ˖}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=74}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|pp=243, 245}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=191–192}} Some southern speakers may alternate between the velar and post-palatal articulation, depending on the backness of the preceding or succeeding vowel. Velar, post-velar and uvular variants are called ''harde g'' "hard g", while the post-palatal variants are called ''zachte g'' "soft g". There is also a third variant called ''zwakke harde g'' "weak hard g", in which {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|ɦ}} and {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|h}} and is used in Zeeland and West Flanders, which are [[h-dropping]] areas, so that {{IPA|/ɦ/}} does not merge with glottal variants of {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}}.
* In the Netherlands, {{IPA|/v/}} can devoice and merge with {{IPA|/f/}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=74}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=48}} According to {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2003}}, there are hardly any speakers of Northern SD who consistently contrast {{IPA|/v/}} with {{IPA|/f/}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=48}}
* In low-prestige varieties of Netherlandic Dutch (such as the Amsterdam accent){{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=48}} also {{IPA|/z/}} can devoice and merge with {{IPA|/s/}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=74}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=48}}
* Speakers who devoice {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} may also hypercorrectively voice {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}: ''concert'' "concert" may thus be {{IPA|[kɔnˈzɛrt]}} compared to the more usual {{IPA|[kɔnˈsɛrt]}}.
* Some speakers pronounce {{IPA|/ɦ/}} as a voiceless {{IPAblink|h}}. Some dialects, particularly those from the southwest, exhibit [[h-dropping]].
* In the Netherlands, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} may have only mid-to-low pitched friction, and for many Netherlandic speakers, they are [[Relative articulation#Advanced and retracted|retracted]]. In Belgium, they are more similar to English {{IPA|/s, z/}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=75}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=190}}
* The sequences {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}} are often assimilated to palatalised {{IPA|[sʲ, zʲ]}}, [[alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɕ, ʑ]}}, [[postalveolar]] {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ]}} or similar realisations.
* Before {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} is realized as a [[voiceless palatal affricate|voiceless post-palatal affricate]] {{IPA|[c̠͡ç̠]}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=193}}
* The sequences {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}} are assimilated to {{IPA|[c]}} intervocalically and after {{IPA|/n/}} unless they're at the beginning of a stressed syllable, barring loanwords and some names.
* {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}} are not native phonemes of Dutch and usually occur only in borrowed words, like ''show'' and ''bagage'' "baggage". Depending on the speaker and the position in the word, they may or may not be distinct from the assimilated realisations of the clusters {{IPA|/sj, zj/}}. If they are not distinct, they will have the same range of realisations noted above.

===Sonorants===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
* {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} assimilate their articulation to a following obstruent in many cases:
** Both become {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/p, b/}}, and {{IPA|[ɱ]}} before {{IPA|/f, v/}}.
** {{IPA|/n/}} merges into {{IPA|/ŋ/}} before velars ({{IPA|/k, ɡ, x, ɣ/}}). The realisation of {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, in turn, depends on how a following velar fricative is realised. For example, it will be uvular {{IPA|[ɴ]}} for speakers who realise {{IPA|/x, ɣ/}} as uvulars.
** {{IPA|/n/}} is realised as {{IPA|[ɲ]}} before {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=75}} That occurs also before {{IPA|/ʃ/}} or {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and, under assimilation, before {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}}.
* The exact pronunciation of {{IPA|/l/}} varies regionally:
** In the North, {{IPA|/l/}} is 'clear' before vowels and 'dark' before consonants and pauses. Intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} tends to be clear except after the open back vowels {{IPA|/ɔ, ɑ/}}. However, some speakers use the dark variant in all intervocalic contexts.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=197}}
** Some accents, such as the Amsterdam and the Rotterdam ones, have dark {{IPA|/l/}} in all positions. Conversely, some accents in the eastern regions, along the German border (for example around [[Nijmegen]]), as well as some Standard Belgian speakers, have clear {{IPA|/l/}} in all contexts.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=197}}
** The quality of dark {{IPA|/l/}} varies; in the North it is [[Pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] {{IPA|[lˤ]}}, but in a final position, many speakers produce a strongly pharyngealized vocoid with no alveolar contact ({{IPA|[ɤˤ]}}) instead. In Belgium, it is either velarized {{IPA|[lˠ]}} or post-palatalized {{IPA|[lʲ̠]}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=58, 197, 222}}
* The realization of {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme varies considerably from dialect to dialect and even between speakers in the same dialect area:
** The historically original pronunciation is an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, with the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} as a common allophone.
** The [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}} is a common alternative, found particularly in the central and southern dialect areas. Uvular pronunciations appear to be gaining ground in the Randstad.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=209}} Syllable-finally, it may be [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] to {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, much as in German. This is more common in the (south)eastern areas (Limburg, southeast Brabantian, Overijssel).
** The coastal dialects of South Holland produce a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}}.
** The [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} or "bunched approximant" is found at the [[Syllable#Coda|end of a syllable]] by some speakers in the Netherlands, especially those from the [[Randstad]], but not in Belgium. Its use has been increasing in recent years.{{sfnp|Sebregts|2014|pp=196–198}}
* The realization of {{IPA|/ʋ/}} also varies by area (and less so by speaker):
** The main realisation is a labiodental approximant {{IPA|[ʋ]}}, found in central and northern Netherlands.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=8}}
** Speakers in southern Netherlands and Belgium use a bilabial approximant {{IPAblink|β̞}}.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=8}} It is like {{IPA|[w]}} but without [[velarization]].
** In Suriname and among immigrant populations, {{IPA|[w]}} is usual.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}{{clarify|date=March 2017}}
* An epenthetic {{IPA|[ə]}} may be inserted between {{IPA|/l, r/}} and word-final {{IPA|/m, n, p, k, f, x/}}. Thus ''melk'' {{IPA|/mɛlk/}} "milk" may be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈmɛlək]}}. This may extend to compounds, e.g. ''melkboer'' {{IPA|[ˈmɛləkbuːr]}} "milkman". Although this pronunciation is mistakenly thought of as non-standard, it is found in all types of Dutch, including the standard varieties. There is also another type of {{IPA|[ə]}}-insertion that occurs word-medially (e.g. ''helpen'' {{IPA|[ˈɦɛləpə]}} "to help"), which is considered non-standard.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=197–198, 201}}

In many areas the final 'n' of the ending ''-en'' (originally {{IPA|/ən/}}, with a variety of meanings) is pronounced only when a word is being individually stressed; this makes ''-en'' words homophonous with otherwise identical forms ending in ''-e'' alone. The ''-n'' is dropped both word-finally and, in compound words, word-internally. This pronunciation can be morphologically sensitive and serve to distinguish words, since the ''-n'' is dropped only when it is part of the distinct ending ''-en'' and not when the word consists of an indivisible stem which happens to end in ''-en''. Thus, the ''teken'' of ''ik teken'' ('I draw') always retains its ''-n'' because it is part of an indivisible stem whereas in ''teken'' ('ticks') it is dropped because it is part of a plural ending. Such pairs (''teken'' = 'draw'; ''teken'' = 'ticks') are therefore not homophones in dialects that drop ''-n'', despite being written identically.

Final ''-n'' is retained in the North East (Low Saxon) and the South West (East and West Flemish), where it is the schwa that disappears instead. This creates a syllabic {{IPA|[n]}} or (after velars) syllabic {{IPA|[ŋ]}} sounds: ''laten'' {{IPA|[ˈlaːtn̩]}}; ''maken'' {{IPA|[ˈmaːkŋ̍]}}. Some Low Saxon dialects that have uvular pronunciations of {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}} (or one of them) also have a syllabic [[uvular nasal]], like in ''lagen'' and/or ''lachen'' {{IPA|[ˈlaːχɴ̩]}}

===Final devoicing and assimilation===
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{Expand section|more detail on assimilation, the conditions under which it occurs and the effects|date=November 2014}}
}}
Dutch [[Final-obstruent devoicing|devoices]] all [[obstruent]]s at the ends of words, as is partly reflected in the spelling. The voiced "z" in plural ''hui'''z'''en'' {{IPA|[ˈɦœy̑zə]}} becomes ''hui'''s''''' {{IPA|[ɦœy̑s]}} ('house') in singular. Also, ''dui'''v'''en'' {{IPA|[ˈdœy̑və]}} becomes ''dui'''f''''' {{IPA|[dœy̑f]}} ('dove'). The other cases are always written with the voiced consonant, but a devoiced one is actually pronounced: the "d" in plural ''baar'''d'''en'' {{IPA|[ˈbaːrdə]}} is retained in singular spelling ''baar'''d''''' ('beard'), but the pronunciation of the latter is {{IPA|[baːrt]}}, and plural ''ri'''bb'''en'' {{IPA|[ˈrɪbə]}} has singular ''ri'''b''''' ('rib'), pronounced {{IPA|[rɪp]}}.
{{Listen
| filename = Nl-huis.ogg
| title    = [ɦœy̑s]
| description = ''huis'', 'house'
| filename2 = Nl-huizen.ogg
| title2    = [ˈɦœy̑zən]
| description2 = ''huizen'', 'houses'
| plain = yes
| embed = yes

}}
{{Listen
| filename = Nl-duif.ogg
| title    = [dœy̑f]

| title2    = [ˈdœy̑və]
| description2 = ''duiven'', 'doves'
| plain = yes
| embed = yes
| style = float:none; clear:none
}}

Because of assimilation, the initial {{IPA|/v z ɣ/}} of the next word is often also devoiced: ''het vee'' ('the cattle') is {{IPA|[(ɦ)ət feː]}}. The opposite may be true for other consonants: ''ik ben'' ('I am') {{IPA|[ɪg bɛn]}}.

==Vowels==
Dutch has an extensive [[vowel]] inventory consisting of thirteen plain vowels and at least three diphthongs. Vowels can be grouped as front unrounded, front rounded, central and back. They are also traditionally distinguished by [[Vowel length|length]] or [[tenseness]]. The vowels {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} are included in one of the diphthong charts further below because Northern SD realizes them as diphthongs, but they behave phonologically like the other long monophthongs.

===Monophthongs===

* Dutch vowels can be classified as lax and tense,&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|1999|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; checked and free&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=127–128, 132–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or short and long.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1999|pp=4–5}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Phonetically however, the close vowels {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are as short as the phonological lax/short vowels unless they occur before {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|pp=4–6}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}}
* Phonologically, {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ʊ/}} can be classified as either close or close-mid. Carlos Gussenhoven classifies them as the former,{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|pp=337, 339}} whereas Geert Booij says that they are the latter and classifies {{IPA|/ɛ, ɔ/}} and the non-native mid vowels as open-mid.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=5}}
* {{IPA|/ʏ/}} has been traditionally transcribed with {{angbr|{{IPA|œ}}}}, but modern sources tend to use {{angbr|{{IPA|ʏ}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|ɵ}}}} instead.{{sfnp|van Heuven|Genet|2002}}&lt;ref&gt;Sources that use {{angbr|{{IPA|ʏ}}}} include {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1999|pp=4–5}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|1999|pp=75–76}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}. The online dictionary [http://woorden.org woorden.org] also uses that symbol. Sources that use {{angbr|{{IPA|ɵ}}}} include {{Harvcoltxt|van Reenen|Elias|1998}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Rietveld|van Heuven|2009}}. The traditional transcription of {{angbr|{{IPA|œ}}}} is also used in certain modern sources, for example by {{Harvcoltxt|Kooij|van Oostendorp|2003|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beverley Collins and Inger Mees write this vowel with {{angbr|{{IPA|ʉ}}}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=128}}
* The phonemic status of {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is not clear. Phonetically, a vowel of the {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʊ|ʊ̞}} ~ {{IPA link|ɔ̝|ɔ̽}}]}}&lt;ref&gt;Described as close-mid {{IPAblink|ʊ|ʊ̞}} by Geert Booij and as mid {{IPAblink|ɔ̝|ɔ̽}} by Beverley Collins and Inger Mees.&lt;/ref&gt; type appears before nasals as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, e.g. in ''jong'' {{IPA|[jʊŋ]}} ('young'). This vowel can also be found in certain other words, such as ''op'' {{IPA|[ʊp]}} ('on'), which can form a near-minimal pair with ''mop'' {{IPA|[mɔp]}} ('joke'). This, however, is subject to both individual and geographical variation.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|pp=7, 17}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=97–98}}
* Many speakers feel that {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/ʏ/}} belong to the same phoneme, with {{IPAblink|ə}} being its unstressed variant. This is reflected in spelling errors produced by Dutch children, for example {{angbr|binnu}} for ''binnen'' {{IPA|[ˈbɪnə(n)]}} ('inside'). Adding to this, the two vowels have different phonological distribution; for example, {{IPA|/ə/}} can occur word-finally, while {{IPA|/ʏ/}} (along with other lax vowels) cannot. In addition, the word-final allophone of {{IPA|/ə/}} is a close-mid front vowel with some rounding {{IPAblink|ø|ø̜}}, a sound that is similar to {{IPA|/ʏ/}}.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=5}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=129}}
* The native tense vowels {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː, aː/}} are long {{IPA|[eː, øː, oː, aː]}} in stressed syllables and short {{IPA|[e, ø, o, a]}} elsewhere. The non-native oral vowels appear only in stressed syllables and thus are always long.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|pp=342, 344}}
* The native {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː, aː/}} as well as the non-native nasal {{IPA|/ɛ̃ː, œ̃ː, ɔ̃ː, ɑ̃ː/}} are sometimes transcribed without the length marks, as {{angbr|{{IPA|e, ø, o, a, ɛ̃, œ̃, ɔ̃, ɑ̃}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1999}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Heemskerk|Zonneveld|2000}} as well as the online dictionary [http://www.woorden.org woorden.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/aː/}}, a phonological back vowel, is central {{IPAblink|äː}} or front {{IPAblink|aː}} in Standard Dutch.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=5}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=104, 128, 132–133}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}
* The non-native {{IPA|/iː, yː, uː, ɛː, œː, ɔː, ɑː/}} occur only in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, they are replaced by the closest native vowel. For instance, verbs corresponding to the nouns ''analyse'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-analyse.ogg|/aːnaːˈliːzə/|help=no}} ('analysis'), ''centrifuge'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-centrifuge.ogg|/sɛntriˈfyːzjə/|help=no}} ('spinner'), and ''zone'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-zone.ogg|/ˈzɔːnə/|help=no}} ('zone') are ''analyseren'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-analyseren.ogg|/aːnaːliˈzeːrən/|help=no}} ('to analize'), ''centrifugeren'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-centrifugeren.ogg|/sɛntrifyˈɣeːrən/|help=no}} ('to spin-dry'), and ''zoneren'' {{IPA|/zoːˈneːrən/}} ('to divide into zones').{{sfnp|Booij|1999|pp=6, 16}}
* {{IPA|/œː/}} is extremely rare, and the only words of any frequency in which it occurs are ''oeuvre'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-oeuvre.ogg|[ˈœːvrə]|help=no}}, ''manoeuvre'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-manoeuvre.ogg|[maˈnœːvrə]|help=no}} and ''freule''. In the more common words, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} tends to be replaced with the native {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, whereas {{IPA|/ɔː/}} can be replaced by either {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or {{IPA|/oː/}} (Belgians typically select the latter).{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=137–138}}
* The non-native nasal vowels {{IPA|/ɛ̃ː, œ̃ː, ɔ̃ː, ɑ̃ː/}} occur only in loanwords from French.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=75}}{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=6}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=138}} {{IPA|/ɛ̃ː, ɔ̃ː, ɑ̃ː/}} are often nativized as {{IPA|/ɛn, ɔn, ɑn/}}, {{IPA|/ɛŋ, ɔŋ, ɑŋ/}} or {{IPA|/ɛm, ɔm, ɑm/}}, depending on the place of articulation of the following consonant. For instance, ''restaurant'' {{IPA|/rɛstoːˈrɑ̃ː/}} ('restaurant') and ''pardon'' {{IPA|/pɑrˈdɔ̃ː/}} ('excuse me') are often nativized as {{Audio-IPA|Nl-restaurant.ogg|/rɛstoːˈrɑnt/|help=no}} and {{Audio-IPA|Nl-pardon.ogg|/pɑrˈdɔn/|help=no}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=138}} {{IPA|/œ̃ː/}} is extremely rare, just like its oral counterpart&lt;ref name="some"&gt;It is listed by only some sources, namely {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1999}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the only word of any frequency in which it occurs is ''parfum'' {{IPA|/pɑrˈfœ̃ː/}} ('perfume'), often nativized as {{IPA|/pɑrˈfʏm/}} or {{Audio-IPA|Nl-parfum.ogg|/ˈpɑrfʏm/|help=no}}.
* The non-native {{IPA|/ɑː/}} is listed only by some sources.&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1999}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in words such as ''cast'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-cast.ogg|/kɑːst/|help=no}} ('cast').{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=6}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|p=342}}

The following sections describe the phonetic quality of Dutch monophthongs in detail.

====Close vowels====
* {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is close to the canonical value of the IPA symbol {{angbr|{{IPA|ɪ}}}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=128}} The Standard Belgian realization has also been described as close-mid {{IPAblink|ɪ|ɪ̞}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}} In regional SD, the realization may be different: for example, in Antwerp it is closer, more like {{IPAblink|i}}, whereas in places like Dordrecht, Nijmegen, West and East Flanders the vowel is typically more open than the SD counterpart, more like {{IPAblink|e|ë}}. Affected speakers of Northern SD may also use this vowel.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=131}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=246}}
* {{IPA|/i, iː/}} are close front {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|iː}}]}}, close to cardinal {{IPAblink|i}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}
* The majority of sources consider {{IPA|/ʏ/}} to be close-mid central {{IPAblink|ɵ}},{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}&lt;ref name="vanheuvengenet"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van Heuven|Genet|2002}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|2007|pp=337–338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Rietveld|van Heuven|2009}} yet Beverley Collins and Inger Mees consider it to be close-mid front {{IPAblink|ʏ|ʏ̞}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=128}} The study conducted by Vincent van Heuven and Roos Genet has shown that native speakers consider the canonical IPA value of the symbol {{angbr|{{IPA|ɵ}}}} to be the most similar to the Dutch sound, much more similar than the canonical values of {{angbr|{{IPA|ʏ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|œ}}}} (the sound represented by {{angbr|{{IPA|ʉ}}}} was not a part of the study).&lt;ref name="vanheuvengenet"/&gt; In regional SD {{IPA|/ʏ/}} may be raised to near-close {{IPAblink|ɵ̝}}, for example in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. In Antwerp, the vowel may be as high as {{IPA|/y/}} and the two vowels may differ in nothing but length. A more open vowel of the {{IPAblink|ɵ̞}}-type is found in southern accents (e.g. in Bruges) and in affected Northern SD.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=131}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=246}}
* {{IPA|/y, yː/}} have been variously described as close front {{IPA|[{{IPA link|y}}, {{IPA link|yː}}]}},{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|p=338}} near-close front {{IPA|[{{IPA link|y˕}}, {{IPA link|y˕ː}}]}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}} and, in Northern SD, near-close central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʉ̞}}, {{IPA link|ʉ̞ː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}
* {{IPA|/u, uː/}} are close back {{IPA|[{{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|uː}}]}} in Northern SD and close near-back {{IPA|[{{IPA link|u|u̟}}, {{IPA link|u|u̟ː}}]}} in Belgian SD and some varieties of regional SD spoken in Antwerp and Flemish Brabant.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=132–133}}

Word-final {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are raised and end in a voiceless vowel: {{IPA|[ii̥, yẙ, uu̥]}}. The voiceless vowel in the first sequence may sound almost like a palatal fricative {{IPAblink|ç}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}}

{{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are frequently longer in Belgian SD and most Belgian accents than in Northern SD, in which the length of these vowels is identical to that of lax vowels.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}}

Regardless of the exact accent, {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are mandatorily lengthened to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|iː}}, {{IPA link|yː}}, {{IPA link|uː}}]}} before {{IPA|/r/}} in the same word.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=6}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}} In Northern SD and in Randstad, these are laxed to {{IPA|[i̽ː, y˕ː, u̽ː]}} and often have a schwa-like off-glide ({{IPA|[i̽ə, y˕ə, u̽ə]}}). This means that before {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} are less strongly differentiated from {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} in Northern SD and Randstad than is usually the case in other regional varieties of SD and in Belgian SD.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=132, 134, 200}} There is one exception to the lengthening rule: when {{IPA|/r/}} is followed by a consonant different than {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} remain short. Examples of that are words such as ''wierp'' {{IPA|[ʋirp]}}, ''stierf'' {{IPA|[stirf]}}, ''zwierf'' {{IPA|[zʋirf]}}, ''bedierf'' {{IPA|[bəˈdirf]}}, ''kirsch'' {{IPA|[kirʃ]}} and ''Atatürk'' {{IPA|[ˈaːtaˌtyrk]}}. The rule is also suppressed syllable-finally in certain compounds; compare ''roux-room'' {{IPA|[ˈruroːm]}} with ''roerroom'' {{IPA|[ˈruːr(r)oːm]}} and ''Ruhr-Ohm'' {{IPA|[ˈruːroːm]}}.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=6}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|pp=344, 347}}

====Mid vowels====
* {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː/}} are open-mid front {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ}}, {{IPA link|ɛː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=128, 137}} According to Jo Verhoeven, the Belgian SD variants are somewhat raised.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}} Before {{IPA|/n/}} and the velarized or pharyngealized allophone of {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is typically lowered to {{IPAblink|æ}}. In some regional SD (e.g. in Dordrecht, Ghent, Bruges and more generally in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg), this lowering is generalized to most or even all contexts. Conversely, some regional SD varieties (e.g. much of Randstad Dutch, especially the Amsterdam dialect as well as the accent of Antwerp) realize the main allophone of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} as higher and more central than open-mid front ({{IPAblink|ɛ̝|ɛ̝̈}}).{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=92, 128–129, 131}}
* {{IPA|/œː/}} is open-mid front {{IPAblink|œː}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=137}}
* {{IPA|/ə/}} has two allophones, with the main one being mid central unrounded {{IPAblink|ə}}. The allophone used in word-final postions resembles the main allophone of {{IPA|/ʏ/}} as it is closer, more front and more rounded ({{IPAblink|ø|ø̜}}).{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=129}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}
* {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is a very tense, [[Pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] vowel. Its backness has been described as back {{IPAblink|ɔ|ɔˤ}} by Collins and Mees and near-back {{IPAblink|ɔ|ɔ̟ˤ}} by Gussenhoven and Verhoeven. The pharyngeal effect is more pronounced in Northern SD than in the standard Belgian variety. {{IPA|/ɔː/}} is close to {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in terms of height and backness, but it is unclear whether it is has the same secondary articulation of pharyngealization.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=128, 132, 137}}

{{IPA|/ɛ, ɔ/}} are typically somewhat lengthened and centralized before {{IPA|/r/}} in Northern SD and Randstad, usually with a slight schwa-like offglide: {{IPA|[ɛ̈ə̆, ɔ̈ə̆]}}. In addition, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in this position is somewhat less rounded ({{IPA|[ɔ̜̈ə̆]}}) than the main allophone of {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=130}}

The free vowels {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} are realized as monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPA link|eː}}, {{IPA link|øː}}, {{IPA link|oː}}]}} in Belgian SD (Jo Verhoeven describes the Belgian SD realization of {{IPA|/øː/}} as mid central {{IPAblink|ɵ̞ː}}) and in many regional accents. In Northern SD, narrow closing diphthongs {{IPA|[eɪ, øʏ, oʊ]}} are used. The starting point of {{IPA|[oʊ]}} is centralized back ({{IPAblink|o|ö}}), and the starting point of {{IPA|[eɪ]}} has been described as front {{IPAblink|e}} by Collins and Mees and as centralized front {{IPAblink|e|ë}} by Gussenhoven. The monophthongal counterparts of {{IPA|[eɪ, oʊ]}} are peripheral; the former is almost as front as cardinal {{IPAblink|eː}}, whereas the latter is almost as back as cardinal {{IPAblink|oː}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=108, 110, 133–134}} Many speakers of Randstad Dutch as well as younger speakers of Northern SD realize {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} as rather wide diphthongs of the {{IPA|[ɛɪ, œʏ, ɔʊ]}} type, which may be mistaken for the phonemic diphthongs {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} by speakers of other accents.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=135}}{{sfnp|Jacobi|2009}} Using {{IPA|[ɛɪ, œʏ, ɔʊ]}} for {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} goes hand in hand with lowering the first elements of {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} to {{IPA|[aɪ, aʏ, aʊ]}}, a phenomenon termed ''Polder Dutch''. Therefore, the phonemic contrast between {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} and {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} is still strongly maintained, but its phonetic realization is very different from what one can typically hear in traditional Northern SD.{{sfnp|Stroop|1999}} In Rotterdam and The Hague, the starting point of {{IPA|[oʊ]}} can be fronted to {{IPAblink|ə}} instead of being lowered to {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=109–110}}

In Northern SD and in Randstad, {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} lose their closing glides and are raised and slightly centralized to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪː}}, {{IPA link|ʏː}}, {{IPA link|ʊː}}]}} (often with a schwa-like off-glide {{IPA|[ɪə, ʏə, ʊə]}}) before {{IPA|/r/}} in the same word. The first two allophones strongly resemble the lax monophthongs {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ/}}. Dutch children frequently misspell the word ''weer'' ('again') as ''wir''. These sounds may also occur in regional varieties of SD and in Belgian SD, but they are more typically the same as the main allophones of {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} (that is, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|eː}}, {{IPA link|øː}}, {{IPA link|oː}}]}}). An exception to the centralizing rule are syllable-final {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} in compounds such as ''z'''ee'''reis'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-zeereis.ogg|[ˈzeɪˌrɛis]|help=no}} ('sea voyage'), ''mili'''eu'''ramp'' {{Audio-IPA|Nl-milieuramp.ogg|[mɪlˈjøʏˌrɑmp]|help=no}} ('environmental disaster') and ''bur'''eau'''redactrice'' {{IPA|[byˈroʊredɑkˌtrisə]}} ('desk editor (f.)').{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=131, 134, 200–201}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|pp=339, 347}}

In Northern SD, {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} are mid-centralized before the pharyngealized allophone of {{IPA|/l/}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=134}}

Several non-standard dialects have retained the distinction between the so-called "sharp-long" and "soft-long" ''e'' and ''o'', a distinction that dates to early [[Middle Dutch]]. The sharp-long varieties originate from the Old Dutch long ''ē'' and ''ō'' (Proto-Germanic ''ai'' and ''au''), while the soft-long varieties arose from short ''i''/''e'' and ''u''/''o'' that were [[Open syllable lengthening|lengthened in open syllables]] in early Middle Dutch. The distinction is not considered to be a part of Standard Dutch and is not recognised in educational materials, but it is still present in many local varieties, such as Antwerpian, [[Limburgish]], [[West Flemish]] and [[Zealandic]]. In these varieties, the sharp-long vowels are often opening diphthongs such as {{IPA|[ɪə, ʊə]}}, while the soft-long vowels are either plain monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPA link|eː}}, {{IPA link|oː}}]}} or slightly closing {{IPA|[eɪ, oʊ]}}.

====Open vowels====
In Northern SD and some other accents, {{IPA|/ɑ, aː/}} are realised so that the former is a back vowel {{IPAblink|ɑ}}, whereas the latter is central {{IPAblink|äː}} or front {{IPAblink|aː}}. In Belgian SD {{IPA|/aː/}} is also central or front, but {{IPA|/ɑ/}} may be central {{IPAblink|ä}} instead of back {{IPAblink|ɑ}}, so it may have the same backness as {{IPA|/aː/}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=104, 128, 132–133}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}

Other accents may have different realisations:
* Many accents (Amsterdam, Utrecht, Antwerp) realize this pair with 'inverted' backness, so that {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is central {{IPAblink|ä}} (or, in the case of Utrecht, even front {{IPAblink|a}}), whereas {{IPA|/aː/}} is closer to cardinal {{IPAblink|ɑː}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=131, 133}}
* Outside the Randstad, fronting of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} to central {{IPAblink|ä}} is very common. On the other hand, in Rotterdam and Leiden, the short {{IPA|/ɑ/}} sounds even ''darker'' than the Standard Northern realization, being realized as a fully back and raised open vowel, unrounded {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̝}} or rounded {{IPAblink|ɒ|ɒ̝}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=132}}
* In Groningen, {{IPA|/aː/}} tends to be particularly front, similar to the quality of the cardinal vowel {{IPAblink|aː}}, whereas in The Hague and in the affected Standard Northern accent, {{IPA|/aː/}} may be raised and fronted to {{IPAblink|æː}}, particularly before {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=133}}

Before {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is typically a slight centering diphthong with a centralized first element ({{IPA|[ɐə̆]}}) in Northern SD and in Randstad.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=130}}

Dutch also has several diphthongs, but only three of them are indisputably phonemic. All of them end in a non-syllabic close vowel {{IPA|[i̯, y̑, u̯]}} (henceforth written {{IPA|[i, y, u]}} for simplicity), but they may begin with a variety of other vowels.

* {{IPA|/ɔu/}} has been variously transcribed with {{angbr|{{IPA|ɔu}}}},&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1999|pp=4, 6}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|2007|p=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{angbr|{{IPA|ɑu}}}},&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2003|p=135}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Kooij|van Oostendorp|2003|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʌu}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The starting points of {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} tend to be closer ({{IPA|[ɛɪ, œ̈ʏ, ɔ̈ʊ]}}) in Belgian SD than in Northern SD ({{IPA|[ɛ̞ɪ, œ̞̈ʏ, ʌ̞̈ʊ]}}). In addition, the Belgian SD realization of {{IPA|/ɔu/}} tends to be fully rounded, unlike the typical Northern SD realization of the vowel. However, Jo Verhoeven reports rather open starting points of the Belgian SD variants of {{IPA|/œy, ɔu/}} ({{IPA|[œ̞̈ʏ, ɔ̞̈ʊ]}}), so the main difference between Belgian and Northern SD in that regard may be only in the rounding of the first element of {{IPA|/ɔu/}}, but the fully rounded variant of {{IPA|/ɔu/}} is also used by some Netherlands speakers, particularly of the older generation. It is also used in most of Belgium, in agreement with the Belgian SD realization.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=135–136}}
* In conservative Northern SD, the starting points of {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} are open-mid and rounded in the case of the last two vowels: {{IPA|[ɛɪ, œʏ, ɔʊ]}}.{{sfnp|Stroop|1999}}
* The backness of the starting point of the Belgian SD realization of {{IPA|/ɛi/}} has been variously described as front {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=135}} and centralized front {{IPA|[ɛ̈ɪ]}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}
* In ''Polder Dutch'' spoken in some areas of the Netherlands (especially Randstad and its surroundings), the starting points of {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} are further lowered to {{IPA|[aɪ, aʏ, aʊ]}} to facilitate the pronunciation. This typically goes hand in hand with lowering the starting points of {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} to {{IPA|[ɛɪ, œʏ, ɔʊ]}}. These realizations have existed in [[Hollandic dialect|Hollandic]] dialects since the 16th century and now are becoming standard in the Netherlands. They are an example of a [[chain shift]] akin to the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. According to Jan Stroop, the fully lowered variant of {{IPA|/ɛi/}} is the same as the phonetic diphthong {{IPA|[aːi]}}, making ''bij'' 'at' and ''baai'' 'bay' perfect homophones.{{sfnp|Stroop|1999}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=136}}
* The rounding of the starting point of the Northern SD realization of {{IPA|/œy/}} has been variously described as slight {{IPA|[œ̜ʏ]}}{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2007|p=340}} and nonexistent {{IPA|[ɐ̜ʏ]}}.{{sfnp|Rietveld|van Heuven|2009}} The unrounded variant has also been reported to occur in many other accents, for example Leiden, Rotterdam and in some Belgian speakers.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=136}}
* Phonetically, the ending points of the native diphthongs are lower and more central than cardinal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|y}}, {{IPA link|u}}]}}, i.e. more like {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʏ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}} or even {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|ø}}, {{IPA link|o}}]}} (however, Jo Verhoven reports a rather close ({{IPAblink|i|ï}}) ending point of the Belgian SD variant of {{IPA|/ɛi/}}, so this might be somewhat variable). In Belgian SD, the ending points are shorter than in Northern SD, but in both varieties the glide is an essential part of the articulation. Furthermore, in Northern SD there is no appreciable difference between the ending points of {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} and the phonetic diphthongs {{IPA|[eɪ, øʏ, oʊ]}}, with both sets ending in vowels close to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʏ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=127, 135}}
* In some regional varieties of SD (Southern, regional Belgian), the ending points of {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} are even lower than in Standard Dutch: {{IPA|[ɛe̞, œø̞, ɔo̞ ~ ʌo̞]}}, and in the traditional [[The Hague dialect|dialect of The Hague]] they are pure monophthongs {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛː}}, {{IPA link|œː}}, {{IPA link|ɑː}}]}}. Broad Amsterdam speakers can also monophthongize {{IPA|/ɛi/}}, but to {{IPAblink|aː}}. It typically does not merge with {{IPA|/aː/}} as that vowel has a rather back ({{IPAblink|ɑː}}) realization in Amsterdam.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=133, 136}}

Apart from {{IPA|[eɪ, øʏ, oʊ]}} which occur only in Northern SD and regional Netherlands SD, all varieties of SD have phonetic diphthongs {{IPA|[iu, yu, ui, eːu, ɔi, oːi, ɑi, aːi]}}. Phonemically, they are considered to be sequences of {{IPA|/iʋ, yʋ, uj, eːʋ, ɔj, oːj, ɑj, aːj/}} by Geert Booij and as monosyllabic sequences {{IPA|/iu, yu, ui, eːu, oːi, aːi/}} by Beverley Collins and Inger Mees (they do not comment on {{IPA|[ɔi]}} and {{IPA|[ɑi]}}).{{sfnp|Booij|1999|pp=5, 44}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=134–137}} This article adopts the former analysis.

In Northern SD, the second elements of {{IPA|[iu, yu, eːu]}} can be labiodental {{IPA|[iʋ, yʋ, eːʋ]}}. This is especially common in intervocalic positions.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|p=137}}

In Northern SD and regional Netherlands SD, the close-mid elements of {{IPA|[eːu, oːi]}} may be subject to the same kind of diphthongization as {{IPA|/eː, oː/}}, so they may be actually triphthongs with two closing elements {{IPA|[eɪu, oʊi]}} ({{IPA|[eːu]}} can instead be {{IPA|[eɪʋ]}}, a closing diphthong followed by {{IPA|[ʋ]}}). In Rotterdam, {{IPA|[oːi]}} can be phonetically {{IPA|[əʊi]}}, with a central starting point.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=44}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=112, 136–137}}

{{IPA|[aːi]}} is realized with more prominence on the first element according to Booij and with equal prominence on both elements according to Collins and Mees. Other diphthongs have more prominence on the first element.{{sfnp|Booij|1999|p=44}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=136–137}}

The ending points of these diphthongs are typically somewhat more central ({{IPA|[ï, ü]}}) than cardinal {{IPA|[i, u]}}. They tend to be higher than the ending points of the phonemic diphthongs {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=135–137}}

==Stress==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Most native Germanic words (the bulk of the core vocabulary) are stressed on the root syllable, which is usually the first syllable of the word. Germanic words may also be stressed on the second or later syllable if certain unstressed prefixes are added (particularly in verbs). Non-root stress is common in loanwords, which are generally borrowed with the stress placement unchanged. In polysyllabic words, [[secondary stress]] may also be present. Certain prefixes and suffixes will receive secondary stress: {{IPA|/ˌvoːrˈkoːmən/}}, {{IPA|/ˈʋeːrˌloːs/}}. The stressed syllable of a word receive secondary stress within a compound word: {{IPA|/ˈbɔmˌmɛldɪŋ/}}, {{IPA|/ˈɑlkoːɦɔl pɛrsɛnˌtaːʒə/}}.

The vast majority of compound nouns are stressed on the first element: '''''appel'''taart'' {{IPA|/ˈɑpəlˌtaːrt/}}, '''''luid'''spreker'' {{IPA|/ˈlœytˌspreːkər/}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=237–238}}{{fix|text=Please elaborate on exceptions|date=August 2016}}

| filename2 = Nl-voorkomen2.ogg
| title2 = voorkómen
| plain = yes
| embed = yes
| style = float:right}}
While stress is phonemic, minimal pairs are rare,{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|1999|p=76}} and marking the stress in written Dutch is always optional, but it is sometimes recommended to distinguish homographs that differ only in stress. While it is common practice to distinguish ''een'' (indefinite article) from ''één'' (the cardinal number one),&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:wikt:Categorie:Klemtoonhomogram in het Nederlands|The current collection at nl.wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; this distinction is not so much about stress as it is about the pronunciation of the vowel ({{IPA|[ən]}} versus {{IPA|[eːn]}}), and while the former is always unstressed, the latter may or may not be stressed. Stress also distinguishes some verbs, as stress placement on prefixes also carries a grammatical distinction, such as in ''[[wikt:voorkomen#Etymology 1|vóórkomen]]'' ('to occur') and ''[[wikt:voorkomen#Etymology 2|voorkómen]]'' ('to prevent'). In ''vóórkomen'' and other verbs with a stressed prefix, the prefix is separable and separates as ''kom voor'' in the first-person singular present, with the past participle ''vóórgekomen''. On the other hand, verbs with an unstressed prefix are not separable: ''voorkómen'' becomes ''voorkóm'' in the first-person singular present, and ''voorkómen'' in the past participle, without the past participle prefix ''ge-''.

Dutch has a strong [[stress accent]] like other Germanic languages, and it uses [[stress timing]] because of its relatively complex syllable structure. It has a preference for [[trochaic]] rhythm, with relatively stronger and weaker stress alternating between syllables in such a way that syllables with stronger stress are produced at a more or less constant pace. Generally, every alternate syllable before and after the primary stress will receive relative stress, as far secondary stress placements allow: Wá.gə.nì.ngən. Relative stress preferably does not fall on {{IPA|/ə/}} so syllables containing {{IPA|/ə/}} may disrupt the trochaic rhythm. To restore the pattern, vowels are often [[syncope (phonology)|syncopated]] in speech: kín.də.rən &gt; {{IPA|/ˈkɪn.drən/}}, há.ri.ngən &gt; {{IPA|/ˈɦaːr.ŋən/}}, vər.gə.líj.king &gt; {{IPA|/vər.ˈɣlɛi.kɪŋ/}}. In words for which the secondary stress is imposed lexically onto the syllable immediately following the stressed syllable, a short pause is often inserted after the stressed syllable to maintain the rhythm to ensure that the stressed syllable has more or less equal length to the trochaic unit following it: bóm..mèl.ding, wéér..lò.zə.

Historically, the stress accent has reduced most vowels in unstressed syllables to {{IPA|[ə]}}, as in most other Germanic languages. This process is still somewhat productive, and it is common to reduce vowels to {{IPA|[ə]}} in syllables carrying neither primary nor secondary stress, particularly in syllables that are relatively weakly stressed due to the trochaic rhythm. Weakly stressed long vowels may also be shortened without any significant reduction in vowel quality. For example, ''politie'' (phonemically {{IPA|/poːˈlitsi/}}) may be pronounced {{IPA|[poˈli(t)si]}}, {{IPA|[pəˈli(t)si]}} or even {{IPA|[ˈpli(t)si]}}.

==Phonotactics==

The syllable structure of Dutch is (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C). Many words, as in English, begin with three consonants such as '' straat'' (street). Words that end in four consonants are mostly superlative adjectives.

==Historic sound changes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Dutch (with the exception of the Limburg dialects) did not participate in the [[High German consonant shift|second Germanic consonant shift]] except for the last stage:
* {{IPA|/-k-/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-x-/}}: German ''machen'' vs. Dutch {{Audio|Nl-maken.ogg|''maken''}}, English ''make''
* {{IPA|/-p-/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-f-/}}: German ''Schaf'' vs. Dutch {{Audio|Nl-schaap (Belgium).ogg|''schaap''}}, English ''sheep''
* {{IPA|/-t-/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-s-/}}: German ''Wasser'' vs. Dutch {{Audio|Nl-water.ogg|''water''}}, English ''water''
* {{IPA|/-θ-/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-d-/}}: German ''das'', Dutch {{Audio|Nl-dat.ogg|''dat''}} vs. English ''that''
Dutch has preserved the fricative variety of Proto-Germanic {{IPA|*/ɡ/}} as {{IPA|[ɣ]}} or {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, in contrast with some dialects of German, which generalised the stop {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, and English, which lost the fricative variety through regular sound changes.

Dutch also underwent a few changes on its own:
* Words with -old, -olt or -ald and -alt lost the {{IPA|/l/}} in favor of a [[diphthong]] as a result of [[l-vocalisation]]. Compare English ''old'', German ''alt'', Dutch {{Audio|Nl-oud.ogg|''oud''}}.
* {{IPA|/ft/}} changed to {{IPA|/xt/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[χt ~ xt ~ x̟t]}}), spelled {{angbr|cht}}, but it was later reverted in many words by analogy with other forms. Compare English ''loft'', German ''Luft'', Dutch ''lucht'' (pronounced {{Audio-IPA|Nl-lucht.ogg|[lʏxt]}} or {{Audio-IPA|Nl-lucht (Belgium).ogg|[lʏx̟t]}}).
* Proto-Germanic {{IPA|*/uː/}} turned into {{IPA|/yː/}} through palatalisation, which, in turn, became the diphthong {{Audio-IPA|Nl-ui.ogg|/œy/}}, spelled {{angbr|ui}}. Long {{IPA|*/iː/}} also diphthongised to {{Audio-IPA|Nl-ei.ogg|/ɛi/}}, spelled {{angbr|ij}}.

'''''Eight Men Speak''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[play (theatre)|play]] written in 1933 by a committee of Oscar Ryan, E. Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg.  Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]]. 

The [[agit-prop]] play told the story of [[Tim Buck]] and his arrest as a [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist]] under [[Section 98]] of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime.  However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a [[prison riot]] when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way.

The play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at [[Toronto]]'s [[Standard Theatre (Toronto)|Standard Theatre]] on December 4, 1933.  The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in [[Winnipeg]] had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there.

When the [[Progressive Arts Club]] had a meeting to protest this [[censorship]], a former minister, [[Albert Edward Smith|A. E. Smith]], described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader.  As a result, Smith was indicted for [[sedition]], but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court.  Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.

Galley copy of the preface for ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times''. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture.

The term itself is an example of ''[[wasei-eigo]]'', a Japanese combination of English words or abbreviated words: ''ero'' from "ero(tic)", ''guro'' from "gro(tesque)", and ''nansensu'' from "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=William J.|title=Introduction: making sense of ''nansensu''|journal=Japan Forum|date=27 Apr 2009|volume=21|issue=1 (Special Issue: URBAN NONSENSE)|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/09555800902856932|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555800902856932|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In actuality the "grotesqueness" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ''ero guro'', and vice versa. The term is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean "[[Graphic violence|gore]]"—depictions of horror, blood, and guts.

==History==
Ero guro nansensu, characterized as a "prewar, bourgeois cultural phenomenon that devoted itself to explorations of the deviant, the bizarre, and the ridiculous,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichert | first = Jim | title = Deviance and Social Darwinism in Edogawa Ranpo's Erotic-Grotesque Thriller Koto no Ōni | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages =113–114 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.2307/3591938 | author2 = Reichert, Jim | publisher = Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 | jstor = 3591938}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested in the popular culture of [[Taishō period|Taishō]] Tokyo during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Buruma"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Buruma|last=Buruma|first=Ian|title=Inventing Japan, 1853–1964|pages=67–68|year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-679-64085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Ian Buruma]] describes the social atmosphere of the time as "a skittish, sometimes nihilistic hedonism that brings [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] Berlin to mind."&lt;ref name="Buruma"/&gt; Its roots go back to artists such as Tsukioka [[Yoshitoshi]], who, besides erotic [[Shunga (art)|shunga]], also produced woodblock prints showing decapitations and acts of violence from Japanese history. [[Ukiyo-e]] artists such as [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] presented similar themes with bondage, rape and erotic [[crucifixion]].

Ero guro's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s [[Japanese literature]]. The [[Sada Abe|Sada Abe Incident]] of 1936, where a woman [[Erotic asphyxiation|strangled]] her lover to death and [[castration|castrated]] his corpse, struck a chord with the ero guro movement and came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston|first=William|title=Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-13052-X|pages=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other like activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during [[World War II]], but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in [[manga]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark. [http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue12/mclelland.html "A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the ero guro movement's influence expanded into parts of Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]], [[Japanese art|art]], [[manga]], and eventually into film and music.

==Later influences==
Ero guro is also an element of many [[Japanese horror]] films and ''[[Pink film|pinku eiga]]'', particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Examples include [[Teruo Ishii]]'s ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]) and ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and [[Yasuzo Masumura]]'s ''[[Blind Beast]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), the latter two based on the works of [[Edogawa Rampo]]. A more recent example of ero guro in cinema is [[Sion Sono]]'s ''[[Strange Circus]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).

There are modern guro artists, some of whom cite Erotic Grotesque Nonsense as an influence on their work. These artists explore the macabre intermingled with sexual overtones. Often the erotic element, even when not explicit, is merged with grotesque themes and features similar to the works of [[H. R. Giger]]. Others produce ero guro as a genre of [[Japanese pornography]] and [[hentai]] involving [[blood]], [[Disembowelment|gore]], [[disfiguration]], [[violence]], [[Body integrity identity disorder|mutilation]], [[Urolagnia|urine]], [[Klismaphilia|enemas]], or [[Coprophilia|feces]].

Well-known guro [[Mangaka|manga artists]] include [[Suehiro Maruo]], [[Hajime Yamano]], [[Jun Hayami]], [[Go Nagai]], [[Shintaro Kago]], [[Toshio Maeda]], [[Henmaru Machino]], [[Yamamoto Takato]], [[Horihone Saizō]], and [[Waita Uziga]].

The modern genre of [[Tentacle erotica|tentacle rape]] began within the category of ero guro (although it has much older roots in Japanese art; see ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife|Octopi and shell diver]]'') but became so popular that it is now usually considered separately.

==In music==
Some [[visual kei]] bands have a concept or theme relating to ero guro, most notably [[Cali Gari]].&lt;ref name="bounce.com"&gt;[http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ Bounce ''Di(s)ctionary Number 13—Visual Kei''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173324/http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ |date=June 16, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western visual kei fans assumed their theme was a subgenre of visual kei and linked it with other similar bands.

The 2014 [[Flying Lotus]] album ''[[You're Dead!]]'' prominently featured ero guro artwork from Japanese manga artist [[Shintaro Kago]] on the cover and inner sleeve, with further art being utilised in the accompanying live show. Much of the drawings featured men and women being disfigured and mutilated in unrealistic, hi-tech ways with a significant amount of gore and nudity.

In linguistics, a '''filler''' is a sound or word that is spoken in conversation by one participant to signal to others a pause to think without giving the impression of having finished speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Juan, Stephen (2010). "Why do we say 'um', 'er', or 'ah' when we hesitate in speaking?", accessed online [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/06/the_odd_body_language_fillers/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; (These are not to be confused with [[placeholder name]]s, such as ''thingamajig'', ''whatchamacallit'', ''whosawhatsa'' and ''whats'isface'', which refer to objects or people whose names are temporarily forgotten, irrelevant, or unknown.) Fillers fall into the category of [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]], and different languages have different characteristic filler sounds. The term '''filler''' also has a separate use in the syntactic description of [[wh-movement]] constructions.

==In English==
In English, the most common filler sounds are ''ah'' or ''uh'' {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, ''er'' {{IPA|/ɜː/}}, and ''um'' {{IPA|/ʌm/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Disfluency Rates in Conversation: Effects of Age, Relationship, Topic, Role, and Gender |author=BORTFELD &amp; al. |journal=LANGUAGE AND SPEECH |year=2001 |number=2 |volume=44 |pages=123–147 |url=http://psychology.psy.sunysb.edu/sbrennan-/papers/bortetal.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among younger speakers, the fillers "like",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11426737|title=It's, like, so common|last=Winterman|first=Denise|date=2010-09-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; "you know", "I mean", "okay", "so", "actually", "basically", and "right" are among the more prevalent. The use of the [[Valleyspeak]] word "like" as a [[discourse marker]] or vocalized pause is a particularly prominent example of the "Californianization of American youth-speak,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/01/hitchens-like-201001|title=Christopher Hitchens on "Like"|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its further recent spread throughout other English dialects via the mass-media.

Since the advent of computers, especially streaming video, there has been comparison of filler words to "Buffer words."  Buffering, the pause that is experienced while information is retrieved and/or compiled for presentation as a whole, does closely model the cognitive process that accompanies most filler word usage. Similarly, as the increased frequency or duration of buffering in computers indicates data processing deficiencies in a device,the overuse or dependency upon buffering in speech indicate possible cognitive impairment from lack of information, preparation, regard, or confidence, etc.  However, in many cases, buffer words, particularly "like,' "you know," and their ilk, have become parlance in casual conversation, suggesting an imprecise statement that invites the listener to "fill in the gaps" and either acknowledge, confirm, or amend the statement, thus completing the transaction.

== Filler words in different languages ==
* In [[Afrikaans]], {{lang|af|ah}}, {{lang|af|um}}, and {{lang|af|uh}} are common fillers (''um'', and ''uh'' being in common with [[English language|English]]).

Other examples include, {{lang|pl|no}} {{IPA|/nɔ/}} (like English ''well''), {{lang|pl|wiesz}} {{IPA|/vjeʂ/}} ("you know").

The Hungarian {{lang|hu|izé}} (or {{lang|sk|izí}} in its Slovak pronunciation) can also be heard, especially in parts of the country with a large Hungarian population. {{lang|sk|Ta}} is a filler typical of Eastern Slovak and one of the most parodied features.
* In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], {{lang|sl|pač}} ("indeed", "just", "merely"), {{lang|sl|a ne?}} ("right?"), and {{lang|sl|no}} ("well") are some of the fillers common in central Slovenia, including [[Ljubljana]].
* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], fillers are called {{lang|es|muletillas}}. Some of the most common in [[Spanish in the Americas|American Spanish]] are {{lang|es-419|e}} {{IPA|/e/}}, {{lang|es-419|este}} (roughly equivalent to ''uhm'', literally means "this"), and {{lang|es-419|o sea}} (roughly equivalent to "I mean", literally means "or be it").,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spanish.about.com/od/spanishvocabulary/a/filler_words.htm "Filler Words and Vocal Pauses"]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Spain]] the previous fillers are also used, but {{lang|es-ES|¿Vale?}} ("right?") and {{lang|es-ES|¿no?}} are very common too. Occasionally {{lang|es-ES|pues}} ("well"). Young people in Spain tend to use nowadays the filler {{lang|es-ES|en plan}} (meaning "as", "like" or "in [noun] mode").
* In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], fillers are called {{lang|sv|utfyllnadsord}}; some of the most common are {{lang|sv|öhm}} or  {{lang|sv|öh}}, {{lang|sv|ja}} ("yes"), {{lang|sv|ehm}} or {{lang|sv|eh}} (for example {{lang|sv|eh jag vet inte}}) or {{lang|sv|ba}} (comes from {{lang|sv|bara}}, which means "only"), {{lang|sv|asså}} or {{lang|sv|alltså}} ("therefore", "thus"), {{lang|sv|va}} (comes from {{lang|sv|vad}}, which means "what"), and {{lang|sv|liksom}} and {{lang|sv|typ}} (both similar to the English "like").
* In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], {{lang|ta-Latn|paatheenga-na}} ("if you see...") and {{lang|ta-Latn|apparam}} ("then...") are common.
* In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], {{lang|te|ఇక్కడ ఏంటంటే}} ({{lang|te-Latn|ikkada entante}}, "what's here is...") and {{lang|te|తర్వాత}} ({{lang|te-Latn|tarwatha}}, "then...") are common and there are numerous like this.
* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], {{lang|tr|yani}} ("meaning..."), {{lang|tr|şey}} ("thing"), {{lang|tr|işte}} ("that is"), and {{lang|tr|falan}} ("as such", "so on") are common fillers.
* In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], {{lang|uk|е}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|e}}, similar to "um"), {{lang|uk|ну}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|nu}}, "well"), {{lang|uk|і}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|i}}, "and"), {{lang|uk|цей}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|tsey}}, "this"), {{lang|uk|той-во}} ({{lang|uk-Latn|toy-vo}}, "this one") are common fillers.
* In [[Urdu]], {{lang|ur|یعنی}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|yani}}, "meaning..."), {{lang|ur|فلانا فلانا}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|flana flana}}, "this and that" or "blah blah"), {{lang|ur|ہاں ہاں}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|haan haan}}, "yeah yeah") and {{lang|ur|اچھا}} ({{lang|ur-Latn|acha}}, "ok") are also common fillers.
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], {{lang|cy|de}} or {{lang|cy|ynde}} is used as a filler (loosely the equivalent of "You know?" or "Isn't it?"); {{lang|cy|’lly}} (from {{lang|cy|felly}} – so/like in English, used in northern Wales) and also {{lang|cy|iawn}} (translated 'ok' is used as a filler at the beginning, middle or end of sentences); {{lang|cy|’na ni}} (abbreviation of {{lang|cy|dyna ni}} – there we are); {{lang|cy|ym...}} and {{lang|cy|y...}} are used similarly to the English "um...".

Among language learners, a common pitfall is using fillers from their native tongue. For example, "{{lang|es|Quiero una}} umm.... {{lang|es|quesadilla}}".  While less of a [[shibboleth]], knowing the [[placeholder name]]s (sometimes called kadigans) of a language (e.g. the equivalent of "thingy") can also be useful to attain fluency, such as the French {{wikt-lang|fr|truc}}: "{{lang|fr|Je cherche le truc qu'on utilise pour ouvrir une boîte}}" ("I'm looking for the thingy that you use to open up a can").

==In syntax==
{{Main article|Wh-movement}}

The linguistic term "filler" has another, unrelated use in syntactic terminology. It refers to the pre-posed element that fills in the "gap" in a wh-movement construction. Wh-movement is said to create a long-distance or unbounded "filler-gap dependency". In the following example, there is an object gap associated with the transitive verb ''saw'', and the filler is the wh-phrase ''how many angels'': ''"I don't care [how many angels] she told you she saw."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15742">'''Florence Hartley''' was a [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] writer whose work was meant for women of the era, covering topics of [[etiquette]] and [[Needlework Development Scheme|needlework]]. She was also an advocate for [[women's health]].

== Biography ==

Florence Hartley never married. Little else is known about her life, and the place and date of her birth and death are unknown.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=65–68}}

== Etiquette ==

[[Rhetoric]] theorist Jane Donawerth identifies Hartley's ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette''{{r|Hartley-1860}} as part of a distinctive self-consciously feminine discursive tradition of [[conduct book]] rhetoric, developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=41–42}}{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=84}} Donawerth sees Hartley's work as marking the conservative end of the spectrum of works within this tradition, merging the [[conduct book]] tradition with the narrower tradition of the etiquette manual.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=65–66}}{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=83}} Hartley sees good [[elocution]] as natural, not as an art, and avoids the use of the ''word'' [[wikt:elocution|''elocution'']]; she discourages women from speaking in such a way as to draw attention to themselves,{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=84}} or asking professional men (such as physicians, attorneys, artists, merchants, or mechanics) about the subject matter of their work.{{r|Johnson-2002|p=66}} Hartley admonishes women never to phrase what they say as assertions of fact, only as declarations of their own opinions.{{r|Johnson-2002|p=66}} She argues for women's education principally on the ground that it enables women to be better companions.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=66}} Donawerth characterizes Hartley's etiquette as grounded in a profoundly conservative worldview based on wealth and social class.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=66}} Hartley herself sees her etiquette as a logical extension of [[Christian ethics]], specifically, the [[Golden Rule]].{{r|Szczesiul-2017|p=57}}

Hartley's approach to etiquette strongly emphasized its role in hospitality. Of the 26 chapters in ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette'',{{r|Hartley-1860}} ten are devoted to the etiquette of the roles of guest or hostess.{{r|Szczesiul-2017|p=57}} Hartley also placed great emphasis on the etiquette of letter writing.{{r|Johnson-2002|p=91–93}}

=== Response ===

==== Nineteenth century ====

During Hartley's time, her work received favorable reviews, such as this one referring to ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette, and Manual of Politeness'':{{r|Hartley-1860}}
{{Quote
|text    = We should despair of any young lady who, having read this volume attentively, was not sufficiently polished to enter the very best society.
|source  = ''The Crayon'' (November 1860){{r|Crayon-1860-11}}
}}

==== Twentieth and twenty-first centuries ====

Present-day reception of Hartley's work has been mixed. Journalist Tanya Sweeney describes ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette'' as the "definitive tome" of 19th-century etiquette.{{r|Sweeney-2014-12-09}} According to journalist Jessica Leigh Hester, Hartley's 19th-century etiquette advice can still be instructive in the 21st century, particularly in regard to [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVPs]], tasteful dress, avoidance of gossip in places where it can easily be overheard, and loud amateur music at parties.{{r|Hester-2015-12-02}} On the other hand, food and travel writer Anna Brones ridicules Hartley's dictum that a good hostess should not discuss, or even notice, what her guests are eating.{{r|Brones-2014-12-18}} Historian C. Dallett Hemphill sees Hartley's conservative approach to etiquette as having "nativist or racist roots".{{r|Hemphill-1999|p=141}}

Donawerth notes that Hartley never acknowledges the etiquette writers before her. When Hartley tells readers that
: politeness is as necessary to a happy intercourse with the inhabitants of the kitchen, as with those of the parlour; it lessens the pains of service, promotes kind feelings on both sides, and checks unbecoming familiarity{{r|Hartley-1860}}

she is directly quoting [[Eliza Ware Farrar]]'s ''The Young Lady's Friend''{{r|Farrar-1838}} without credit.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=66}}

== Needlework ==

Hartley's ''Ladies’ Hand Book of Fancy and Ornamental Work'' offered instruction in a wide variety of types of [[needlework]], including sewing, knitting, and quilting.{{r|Hartley-1859}}{{r|Shrock-2004|p=136}} Just as with etiquette, Hartley saw skill in needlework as essential to a lady's education, with implications for her overall happiness and for her usefulness to, and acceptance within, society.{{r|Woodard-and-Greenstein-1993|p=10}}

== Women's health ==

Hartley was an advocate of more healthful practices for women, and a critic of social customs that she saw as jeopardizing [[women's health]].{{r|Wagner-1997|p=176}} Despite the conservatism of her general approach to etiquette, Hartley denounced the [[corset]], which some other early women writers on etiquette defended.{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=82–83}} She saw young women of her day as less healthy than their mothers and grandmothers. Hartley warned young women against the practice of staying late at [[Ball (dance party)|dance balls]], so that they would not be utterly exhausted when they left, and would not miss breakfast the next morning. She advocated walking 4–5 miles per day for vigorous young women, as an alternative to dancing in overheated ballrooms.{{r|Wagner-1997|p=176}}

'''''God is Dead''''' (2007) is the [[debut novel]] of [[United States|American]] author [[Ron Currie Jr.]] 

==Summary==
The book is a collection of related shorter stories about a world where God has come to earth and died.

== Plot ==
The book begins in [[Sudan]], where God, disguised as a [[Dinka]] woman, attempts to help out around a refugee camp. She speaks with the American diplomats visiting the camp, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell, about finding the missing brother of the body she inhabits. While she is there, the camp is attacked by the Sudanese government, killing everyone, including God.
The rest of the book focuses on how things unravel after God's death. A high school graduate watches in horror as a priest commits suicide. Soon after, a group of childhood friends form a suicide pact after all their relatives die in the chaos. People later begin to worship their children in the absence of religion, while the psychiatrists tasked to disrupt such unproductive behavior are the most hated people alive. The dogs who ate God's corpse are revealed to possess a higher knowledge, but this brings only death to all but one of them. The book closes with a view into war in this Godless world, where religious wars have been replaced by ideological wars between supporters of [[evolutionary psychology]] versus [[postmodernism]].

==Reception==
In ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]''. Andrew Ervin called ''God is Dead'' "an extraordinary book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200709/?read=review_currie Andrew Ervin, "God is Dead," ''The Believer'', September, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ervin described the chapter "My Brother the Murderer" as "beautiful and profound," the book's "obvious highlight."

The '''Grand Slam''' tournaments, also called '''majors''', are the four most important annual [[tennis]] events. They offer the most ranking points,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx?#points "Q. What is the points breakdown for all tournament categories?"]. ''RANKINGS: Frequently Asked Questions'' (10). ATP World Tour – Official Site of Men's Professional Tennis (atpworldtour.com). Retrieved 7 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and greater number of "best of" sets for men. The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the [[Australian Open]] in mid January, the [[French Open]] around late May through early June, [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in June-July, and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in August-September. Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks. The Australian and United States tournaments are played on [[Hardcourt|hard courts]],{{efn|name=hardcourt|The [[Australian Open]] is played on [[Plexicushion]] while the [[US Open (Tennis)|US Open]] is played on [[DecoTurf]].}} the French on [[Clay court|clay]], and Wimbledon on [[Grass court|grass]]. Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905. However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924–25, when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments. Skipping majors—especially the Australian Open because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money—was not unusual before 1982.

Grand Slam tournaments are not operated by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) or the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA), but by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Slam – Overview|url=http://www.itftennis.com/about/grand-slam%C2%AE/overview.aspx|publisher=International Tennis Federation (ITF)|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ATP and WTA do award ranking points based on a player's performance at a major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Overview |work=ITFTennis.com |date= |accessdate=11 June 2017 |url=http://www.itftennis.com/about/grand-slam%C2%AE/overview.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Sport and the Media: Managing the Nexus |work=Google Books |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lfeCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Grand Slam'', without qualification, and also originally, refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships within a single calendar year within one of the five events: men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles. In doubles, one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/all-time.html USOpen.org].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901230004/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/all-time.html |date=1 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandslamhistory.com/index.php?menu=stats Grandslamhistory.com "STATS"]. ''Grand Slam History Reference Book'' (grandslamhistory.com). Retrieved 7 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, Jerry (22 May 1994). [http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-22/sports/sp-60889_1_grand-slam LA Times "Return to Grand Slam Glory: Rod Laver Was the Last Man to Sweep Four Major Titles and Thinks It Can Be Done Again"]. ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved 7 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam, while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam. Winning the [[Olympic medal|gold medal]] at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] in addition to the four majors in one calendar year is known as a "Golden Grand Slam" or more commonly the "Golden Slam". Also, winning the Year-End Championship (known as [[ATP Finals]] for men's singles and doubles disciplines, and [[WTA Finals]] for both women's disciplines) in the same period is known as a "Super Slam". Together, all four majors in all three disciplines (singles, doubles, and mixed doubles) are called a "boxed set" of Grand Slam titles. No male or female player has won all twelve events in one calendar year, although a "career boxed set" has been achieved by three female players.

==Origin of the term "Grand Slam"==

The term ''[[Glossary of contract bridge terms#S|slam]]'' for winning all of the tricks in the [[:Category:Whist family of card games|whist family card games]] (see also [[Whist#Whist terms|whist terms]]) is attested from early in the 17th century. ''Grand slam'' for all of the tricks, in contrast to ''small slam'' or ''little slam'' for all but one, dates from early in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slam "Slam"]. ''Online Etymological Dictionary'' (etymonline.com). [[Douglas Harper]]. Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This use was inherited by [[contract bridge]], a modern development of whist defined in 1925 that became very popular in Britain and America by 1930.

''Grand slam'' has been [[Grand Slam (golf)|used in golf]] since 1930, when [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] won the four major championships, two British and two American tournaments.&lt;!-- our article cites Keeler of the Atlanta Journal, no specific source. What about baseball?--&gt; Although John F. Kieran of ''[[The New York Times]]'' is widely credited with first applying the term "grand slam" to tennis to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, John (12 September 2017). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/sports/tennis/writings-offer-encyclopedic-insight-on-winners-of-grand-slams.html Writings Offer Encyclopedic Insight on Winners of Grand Slams."] ''[[The New York Times]]'' p. SP8. Retrieved 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Alan (18 July 1933). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19330718&amp;id=c3gzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DeIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2327,2495314 "Sports Slants: {subsection} Tennis 'Grand Slam'&amp;nbsp;"]. ''[[The Reading Eagle]]'' (Reading, Pennsylvania). p. 10. Retrieved 7 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- Note:  The proper disambiguation term for a "true" Grand Slam is "calendar year", not "single-season"; they differ because the Australian Open was held in December from 1977-85.  Stefan Edberg's 1983 Junior Grand Slam (the only one ever achieved) is "calendar year" but not "single-season"; he won the Australian Open in December 1983 but *not* December 1982.  (Martina Navratilova &amp; Pam Shriver's 1984 Grand Slam in doubles counts both ways as they won the Australian Open in both December 1983 &amp; December 1984.)  Do not use "single-season" here; it is inconsistent with the rest of the article (including the exclusion of 1986 &amp; inclusion of Edberg in this very section) &amp; ordinary usage, and jeopardizes Edberg's unique achievement in juniors.  --&gt;

The possibility of being the reigning champion of all the current four majors did not exist until 1924–25, when the [[International Tennis Federation|International Lawn Tennis Federation]] designated the Australasian, French (before 1925 only open to members of French tennis clubs), British and American championship tournaments as the four majors. Before that time only three events: Wimbledon, the [[World Hard Court Championships]] (held in Paris &amp; once in Brussels) and the [[World Covered Court Championships]] (held in various locations) were considered the premier international tennis events by the ILTF.&lt;ref name="wccc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bmarcore.perso.neuf.fr/tennis/avant14/E-champ.html |date=30 April 2001 |work=Histoire du tennis: La légende du grand chelem (www.histoiredutennis.com) &lt;!--this source doesn't know the term before 1938--&gt; |title=(6) 1912–1914: The first World Clay Court Championships | accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eot"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Tennis | publisher=The Viking Press | author=[[Max Robertson|Robertson, Max]] |isbn=067029408X | year=1974 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Wilding]] of New Zealand won all three of those earlier majors in one year: 1913. It has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925. It was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon, the Australian and French opens due to the Second World War, the years from 1970 to 1985 when there was no Australian tournament in mixed doubles, and 1986 when there was no Australian Open at all.

[[Phil Dent]] has pointed out that skipping majors—especially the Australian Open—was not unusual then, before counting major titles became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bonnie DeSimoneArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french07/columns/story?columnist=desimone_bonnie&amp;id=2882705 |title=Chris Evert owned Roland Garros like no other |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, [[William Larned]], [[Maurice McLoughlin]], [[Beals Wright]], [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]], [[Bill Tilden]], [[René Lacoste]], [[Henri Cochet]], [[Bobby Riggs]], [[Jack Kramer]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Pancho Gonzales]], [[Budge Patty]], [[Manuel Santana]], [[Jan Kodeš]] and others, while Brookes, [[Ellsworth Vines]], [[Jaroslav Drobný]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Ilie Năstase]] (at 35 years old) and [[Björn Borg]] came just once. Beginning in 1969, when the first Australian Open was held on the [[Milton Courts]] at Brisbane, the tournament was open to all players, including professionals, who at that point were prohibited from playing the traditional circuit.&lt;ref name=Ausstadiums&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/special/milton.php |title=Milton Tennis Centre|publisher=Australian Stadiums|accessdate=25 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117043727/http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/special/milton.php| archivedate= 17 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed this championship until 1982, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money. In 1970, George MacCall's [[National Tennis League]], which employed [[Rod Laver]], [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Andrés Gimeno]], Pancho Gonzales, [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Fred Stolle]], prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was won by [[Arthur Ashe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23047855-5001023,00.html |title=Hewitt chases amazing slam win |publisher=[[news.com.au]] |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Nikki Tugwell |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201114907/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C23047855-5001023%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the current four majors, the first to win all four in a single year was [[Don Budge]], who completed the feat in 1938. To date, 17 players have completed a Grand Slam, though only six in the most prestigious singles titles. Of these players, three have won multiple majors: [[Rod Laver]] accomplished the feat twice in men's singles; [[Margaret Court]] accomplished the feat three times, in two different disciplines – once in women's singles and twice in mixed doubles; and [[Esther Vergeer]] completed a grand slam twice in Women's wheelchair doubles.

The four Junior disciplines, boys' and girls' singles and doubles, provide limited opportunities to achieve a Grand Slam. Players are only eligible from age 13 to 18, with 18-year-olds likely to hold a physical advantage. Only [[Stefan Edberg]] has completed the Grand Slam in a Junior discipline.

==Non-calendar year Grand Slam==
===Controversy over terminology===
In 1982, the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) began offering a $1 million bonus to any singles player to win four consecutive major titles, no matter the time of completion.  Although groups variously identified as the [[Men's International Professional Tennis Council]], "abetted primarily by some British tennis writers",&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Paul. ''Tennis Confidential'' (2002). 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and "European tennis journalists"&lt;ref name="nytimes1982"&gt;Amdur, Neil. (17 August 1982). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-leave-grand-slam-of-tennis-alone.html Leave Grand Slam of Tennis Alone"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' Retrieved 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; had advocated for the ITF to change the definition of "Grand Slam", ITF General Secretary David Gray made it clear that this was not going to happen.  In a 1983 letter to tennis journalist Paul Fein, Gray clarified: {{quote|There seems to be some confusion.  The ITF's only initiative in this matter has been the organisation of the offer of a bonus of $1m. to any player who holds all four Grand Slam titles simultaneously [...] In spite of all that we have read on this matter, it has never been my Committee of Management's intention to alter the basis of the classic Grand Slam i.e., the capture of all four titles in a year.}}  
The ITF's plan was to offer the cash bonus for three years, apparently to encourage players to compete in all four major tournaments as much as to reward success at them.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Paul. ''Tennis Confidential'' (2002). 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the ITF had announced their bonus, the Grand Slam controversy had taken on a life of its own.  Writing in 1982, Neil Amdur claimed, "Now the sport spins nervously under the influence of big dollars and even bigger egos, and tradition has almost gone the way of white balls and long flannels [...] If the four major tournaments want to offer a $1 million incentive for any player in the future who can sweep their titles—and such talks have been rumored—that bonus would be a welcome addition. But changing what the Grand Slam is all about is like a baseball player believing that he 'hit for the cycle' after slugging a single, double and triple in the first game of a doubleheader and a home run in his first time at bat in the second game."&lt;ref name="nytimes1982"/&gt;  Despite seeming clarity from the ITF, some journalists suggested that the sport's organizing body had turned its back on history and changed the "rules" of tennis by redefining a Grand Slam.  Such confusion continued for years.  For instance, when [[Steffi Graf]] completed the Grand Slam in 1988, George Vecsey wrote, "Even the International Tennis Federation, which should have more respect for history, ruled in 1982 that winning any four straight majors constituted a Grand Slam—and offered a $1 million bonus for it [...] But many tennis people, and most writers, and probably most fans, too, did not accept the new rules, and the I.T.F. has dropped the gimmick."&lt;ref&gt;Vecsey, George. (11 September 1988). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/11/sports/sports-of-the-times-a-champion-for-all-seasons.html A Champion For All Seasons"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' Retrieved 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vecsey was only half right: the ITF dropped the "gimmick" of the cash bonus, but it had never changed any rules.

However, the ambiguous way the ITF described the Grand Slam in their Constitution led to journalists continuing to make the same assumption as Vecsey over two decades later.  For instance, when [[Rafael Nadal]] was on the verge of completing a non-calendar year Grand Slam at the [[2011 Australian Open]], one writer observed, "Most traditionalists insist that the 'Grand Slam' should refer only to winning all four titles in a calendar year, although the constitution of the International Tennis Federation, the sports governing body, spells out that 'players who hold all four of these titles at the same time achieve the Grand Slam'."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Paul. (13 January 2011). "[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/nadal-this-will-be-my-only-shot-at-doing-the-grand-slam-2183008.html Nadal: 'This will be my only shot at doing the Grand Slam'"] [[The Independent]] Retrieved 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This was true until later in 2011, when the ITF edited the description to eliminate all confusion.   As it now stands, "The Grand Slam titles are the championships of Australia, France, the United States of America and Wimbledon. Players who hold all four of these titles in one calendar year achieve the 'Grand Slam'."&lt;ref&gt;ITF Constitution [http://www.itftennis.com/about/organisation/constitution.aspx landing page]. Full text of the [http://www.itftennis.com/media/221225/221225.pdf Memorandum, Articles of Association and Bye-laws of ITF LIMITED].&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Martina Navratilova]] won the 1984 French Open and became the reigning champion of all four women's singles events, she was the first player to receive the bonus prize in recognition of her achievement.  Some media outlets did, indeed, say that she had won a Grand Slam.&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others simply noted the ongoing controversy: "Whether the Slam was Grand or Bland or a commercial sham tainted with an asterisk the size of a tennis ball, Martina Navratilova finally did it."&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, Curry. (18 June 1984). "[https://www.si.com/vault/1984/06/18/638109/worthy-of-really-high-fives Worthy of Really High Fives]" ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' Retrieved 14 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the ITF recognizes what is now unofficially known as the "non-calendar year Grand Slam" on its Roll of Honour, no subsequent player to win four or more majors in a row—Steffi Graf, [[Serena Williams]], or [[Novak Djokovic]]—has received bonus prize money.

Combining ''the'' Grand Slam and non-calendar year Grand Slam, the total number of times that players achieved the feat (of being the reigning champion in all four majors) expands to 18.

===Achievements and near misses===
Three women have won four or more consecutive major titles since 1970, with Navratilova taking six in a row in 1983–1984. On the men's side, [[Novak Djokovic]] was the first singles player since Rod Laver to hold all four major titles at once, which he accomplished between [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon 2015]] and the [[2016 French Open – Men's Singles|2016 French Open]].  Prior to the [[History of tennis#Open era|Open Era]], Don Budge received the same accolades in winning the French Championships in [[1938 French Championships – Men's Singles|1938]], but then completed the more prestigious Grand Slam at the [[1938 U.S. National Championships – Men's Singles|1938 US Championships]], giving him six majors in a row, the only male to ever win more than four consecutive major tournaments.

[[The Bryan brothers]] ([[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan|Mike]]) were the last to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam in men's doubles. Several players and teams came up one title short. [[Todd Woodbridge]] and [[Mark Woodforde]], known collectively as [[The Woodies]], reached the final of the [[1997 French Open – Men's Doubles|1997 French Open]] while holding all the other three titles, but lost to [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] and [[Daniel Vacek]]. In singles, [[Pete Sampras]] lost the [[1994 French Open – Men's Singles|1994 French Open]] quarterfinal to fellow countryman [[Jim Courier]], having won the previous three majors. [[Roger Federer]] in [[2006 French Open – Men's Singles|2006]] and [[2007 French Open – Men's Singles|2007]], and Novak Djokovic in [[2012 French Open – Men's Singles|2012]] repeated this, both ultimately losing the French Open final to [[Rafael Nadal]]. Nadal himself was prevented from achieving this feat by his countryman [[David Ferrer]], who defeated him in the quarterfinal of the [[2011 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2011 Australian Open]], which Nadal entered holding the other three major titles. In women's singles, [[Monica Seles]] lost the [[1992 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|1992 Wimbledon]] final to [[Steffi Graf]], having won the previous three majors. [[Martina Hingis]] had a chance to achieve the feat in the 1998, but lost to Seles in the [[1998 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]] semifinal. In women's doubles, [[Virginia Ruano Pascual]] and [[Paola Suárez]] had won three majors from [[2003 US Open – Women's Doubles|US Open 2003]] to the [[2004 French Open – Women's Doubles|2004 French Open]], lost at the semifinals to [[Cara Black]] and [[Rennae Stubbs]] in the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles|2004 Wimbledon]], and [[Sania Mirza]] together with Hingis had won from [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles|Wimbledon 2015]] to the [[2016 Australian Open – Women's Doubles|2016 Australian Open]], but lost in the third round of the [[2016 French Open – Women's Doubles|2016 French Open]] to [[Barbora Krejčíková]] and [[Kateřina Siniaková]]. In 2017, [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]] and [[Lucie Šafářová]] had the chance to win four consecutive titles at [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles|Wimbledon]], but withdrew from their scheduled second round match following an acute knee injury suffered by Mattek-Sands in the second round of the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Ladies' Singles]] competition.

The following list is for those players who achieved a non-calendar Grand Slam by winning 4 or more consecutive titles, but who failed to win the Grand Slam during the same streak.

==Career Grand Slam==
The career achievement of all four major championships in one format is termed a ''Career Grand Slam'' in that format. Dozens of players have accomplished that (column two) and 17 have doubled it: won a second championship in each of the four majors in one format (column three). Two or more career championships in all four majors is sometimes called a "Multiple Slam Set". Three players have Multiple Slam Sets in two formats, one in three formats, so 22 players are counted in the table (column three). Their achievements are tabulated [[#Multiple Career Grand Slams|below]].

Eight men and ten women have won Career Grand Slams in singles play (rows one and two); among them two men and five women have at least two Career Grand Slams in singles (column three). Since the beginning of the [[Open Era|open era]], five men ([[Rod Laver]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Roger Federer]], [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Novak Djokovic]]) and six women ([[Margaret Court]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Maria Sharapova]]) have achieved this.

Several singles players have won three major championships without achieving the Career Grand Slam, grouped by the ''missing'' Grand Slam tournament:

*Australian Open: [[René Lacoste]], [[Henri Cochet]], [[Helen Wills]], [[Althea Gibson]], [[Tony Trabert]], [[Margaret Osborne duPont]], and [[Manuel Santana]]
*French Open: [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Ashley Cooper (tennis)|Ashley Cooper]], [[Louise Brough Clapp]], [[Virginia Wade]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Stefan Edberg]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], and [[Angelique Kerber]]
*Wimbledon: [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Hana Mandlíková]], [[Ivan Lendl]], [[Monica Seles]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Mats Wilander]], [[Justine Henin]], and [[Stan Wawrinka]]
*US Open: [[Jean Borotra]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis)|Jack Crawford]], [[Lew Hoad]], [[Angela Mortimer]], and [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]]

Several doubles players have won three major championships without achieving the Career Grand Slam:&lt;!-- this applies for men's doubles and women's doubles only --&gt;

*Australian Open: [[John Van Ryn]], [[Helen Wills]], [[Elizabeth Ryan]], [[Margaret Osborne duPont]], [[Darlene Hard]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Betty Stöve]], [[Robert Seguso]], [[Mahesh Bhupathi]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], [[Ekaterina Makarova]], [[Elena Vesnina]], [[Pierre-Hugues Herbert]] and [[Nicolas Mahut]].
*French Open: [[John Bromwich]], [[Nancy Richey]], [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]], [[Cara Black]], and [[Sania Mirza]]
*Wimbledon: [[Vic Seixas]], [[Ashley Cooper (tennis)|Ashley Cooper]], [[Virginia Wade]], [[Virginia Ruano Pascual]], [[Paola Suárez]], [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]], and [[Lucie Šafářová]]
*US Open: [[Jean Borotra]], [[Jacques Brugnon]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis)|Jack Crawford]], [[Althea Gibson]], and [[Rod Laver]]

Only six players have completed a Career Grand Slam in both singles and doubles: one male ([[Roy Emerson]]) and five female ([[Margaret Court]], [[Doris Hart]], [[Shirley Fry Irvin]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Serena Williams]]). Court, Hart and Navratilova are the only three players to have completed a "Career Boxed Set", winning all four titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles; this has never been done by a male player.

The remainder of this section is a complete list, by format, of all players who have won the Career Grand Slam. Players are ordered chronologically by their completion of the Career Grand Slam. The major tournament at which the Career Grand Slam was achieved is indicated in '''bold'''.

===Men's singles&lt;!-- data on completion of (first) Career GS at Men's Singles by 8 men, two of whom completed at least a double CGS --&gt;===

Eight men have won all four grand slam tournaments. Two of the eight men achieved a [[#Multiple Career Grand Slams|double career Slam]]. Originally, the grand slams were held on grass (Australian, Wimbledon, and US Open) and clay (French) and the first four players achieved their grand slams on two surfaces. The US Open changed its surface from grass to clay in 1975 and then to hard court in 1978. The Australian Open changed from grass to hard court in 1988. The last four players (Agassi, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic) achieved their career grand slam on three different surfaces: hard court, clay, and grass.

===Most Grand Slam singles titles without a loss===
[[Helen Wills Moody]] won all 16 of the Grand Slam singles tournaments she played beginning with the 1924 U.S. Championships and extending to the 1933 Wimbledon Championships (not counting her defaults in the 1926 French and Wimbledon Championships). During this period, she won 6 Wimbledons, 4 French Championships, and 6 U.S. Championships. She also won the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] during this period. Moody never entered the Australian Championships.

===Most Grand Slam mixed doubles titles without a loss===
[[Doris Hart]] won all 13 of the Grand Slam mixed doubles tournaments she played beginning with the 1951 French Championships and extending to the 1955 U.S. Championships. During this period, she won 5 Wimbledons, 3 French Championships, and 5 U.S. Championships.

==Golden Slam==
Tennis was an [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]] from the inaugural [[Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Summer Olympics]] through the [[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Games]], then was dropped for the next 64 years (except as a [[demonstration sport]] in [[Tennis at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Tennis at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]) before returning in [[Tennis at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]. As there were only three major championships designated by the International Lawn Tennis Federation before 1925, none of the tennis players who participated in the Olympics between 1896 and 1924 had a chance to complete a Golden Grand Slam. However, there was a possibility to complete a Career Golden Grand Slam by winning the [[Tennis at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] or [[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] plus each of the four grand slams, all of which were present from 1925 onwards. The term ''Golden Slam'' (initially "Golden Grand Slam") was coined in 1988.&lt;ref name="tennis.com"&gt;{{cite web

===Non-calendar year Golden Slam===
Winning four consecutive Grand Slam tournaments and [[Tennis at the Olympic Games|Olympic event]] in the period of twelve months, although not in the same year, is called a "Non-calendar year Golden Slam".&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;{{cite web

*Note: Although Serena Williams held all four majors (winning consecutively all four majors from the 2014 US Open to the 2015 Wimbledon) and the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|2012 Olympic Gold]] at the same time, it isn't considered a non-calendar year Golden Slam because she won her gold medal three years prior to the 12-month period where she held all four majors.

===Career Golden Slam===
A player who wins all four Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympic gold medal during his or her career is said to have achieved a ''Career Golden Slam''. The event at which the Career Golden Slam was achieved is indicated in '''bold'''.

==Super Slam==
Soon after the [[Open Era]] began in 1968, the new professional tours each held a year-end championship (YEC), which are elite tournaments involving only the top performers of the given season. The subsequent return of tennis to the Olympics in 1988 gave rise to the notion of a Super Slam as a combination of Golden Slam and YEC title.&lt;ref name="Super"&gt;{{cite web |title=#7: Andre Agassi |series=Photo Gallery: Top 10 Men's Tennis Players of All Time |page=4 |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1009/top.ten.tennis/content.4.html |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Dimitri (22 November 2010). {{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/524039-rafael-nadal-will-bid-to-emulate-andre-agassi-at-the-world-tour-finals | title=Rafael Nadal Will Bid To Emulate Andre Agassi at the World Tour Finals | accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |editor=Nelson, Murry R. |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=2013 |isbn=9780313397523 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligible YECs are currently called the [[ATP Finals]] for men, [[WTA Finals]] for women, and the [[Wheelchair Tennis Masters]].

No player has ever completed the Super Slam in a single season.

===Non-calendar year Super Slam===
Only one player has completed the Super Slam in a period of twelve months:
:{{flagicon|GER}} [[Steffi Graf]] ([[1987 Virginia Slims Championships – Singles|1987 Virginia Slims Championships]], [[1988 Australian Open – Women's Singles|1988 Australian Open]], [[1988 French Open – Women's Singles|1988 French Open]], [[1988 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|1988 Wimbledon Championships]], [[1988 US Open – Women's Singles|1988 US Open]] and [[Tennis at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|1988 Olympic gold medal]])
&lt;!-- unnecessary to show this
:*'''Note:''' Although Serena Williams held all four majors (winning consecutively all four majors from the 2014 US Open to the 2015 Wimbledon), the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|2012 Olympic Gold]] and the 2014 year-end at the same time, it is not considered a non-calendar year Super Slam because it was not accomplished in a 12-month period.

==Triple Crown==
Winning singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles at one Grand Slam event is called a Triple Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2012-08-17/201208171345228394852.html?promo=relatedcontent |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140618071526/http://2012.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2012-08-17/201208171345228394852.html?promo=relatedcontent |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 June 2014 |title=US Open – The Unbelievable, Unbreakable Records |accessdate=17 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/407053/Martina-Navratilova | work=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Martina Navratilova | accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usta.usopen.org/US-Open/40_important_womens_moments_1987_martina_navratilova/ | title=40 Important Women's Moments: 1987, Martina's Triple Crown | accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a rare accomplishment in tennis. This is partly because the final match in all three disciplines often takes place concurrently in the same day if not in consecutive days. Doris Hart for example attained her first Triple Crown after playing three Wimbledon final matches held in one single day.

Notes:
*This list excludes the 1909 triple crown of [[Jeanne Matthey]] and the 1920, 1921, 1922 and 1923 triple crown wins of [[Suzanne Lenglen]]. The French Championship tennis tournament at the time was a domestic competition not recognized as an international major. At the time the major clay court event (actual precursor of the French Open in its current international format) was the [[World Hard Court Championships]], where Suzanne Lenglen also attained triple championship in 1921 and 1922.
*Also the 1941 triple championship of [[Alice Weiwers]] is not listed due to its disputed official status: French championships held in [[Vichy France]] from 1941 to 1945 are currently not recognized by [[Fédération Française de Tennis]].

==Boxed Set==
Another Grand Slam-related accomplishment is winning a "boxed set" of Grand Slam titles – which is at least one of every possible type of major championship available to a player: the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at all four Grand Slam events of the year. This has never been accomplished within a year or consecutively across two calendar years.

===Career Boxed Set===
The Career Boxed Set refers to winning one of every possible grand slam title (singles, doubles, mixed) over the course of an entire career. No male player has completed this, although Frank Sedgman only missed out on the French Open singles title. Men who participate in top/elite level singles have played comparatively few doubles, and very few mixed doubles. So far, only three women have completed the boxed set during their careers:

Court is not only unique in having two boxed sets, but is also unique in the timing of her accomplishments. Her first boxed set was completed before the start of the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]], and she has a boxed set achieved solely within the open era:

[[Martina Hingis]] was the most recent player to be one title away from joining this elite group. She only needed the French Open singles, having reached the final in 1997 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/news/articles/2016-06-03/hingis_and_paes_complete_career_mixed_slam.html|title=Hingis and Paes complete career mixed slam|work=rolandgarros.com|publisher=[[Fédération Française de Tennis]] (FFT)|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Hingis, it was [[Billie Jean King]] who came close at completing a career boxed set. She only needed the Australian Open women's doubles title, having reached the final in 1965 and 1969.

==Multiple Career Grand Slams==
Of the many players who have managed to win a full set of four majors, there is a small number who have gone on to win all four majors a second or more times. The completion of "Multiple Career Grand Slams" or sometimes called "multiple slam sets" (MSS) has been achieved by only 22 unique players up to the end of the 2015 Wimbledon. MSS players can be found in each of the five tennis disciplines: men's or women's singles, men's or women's doubles, mixed doubles. It can also be found in women's wheelchair doubles. Of these, five players have completed MSS in more than one discipline: [[Roy Emerson]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Frank Sedgman]] and [[Serena Williams]] have MSS in two disciplines, [[Margaret Court]] has MSS in three disciplines.

This table shows each multiple occurrence of a complete MSS for each of the players who have accomplished multiple slams in a particular tennis discipline. The year shown for each of the four majors is the year that particular major win was repeated as part of that player's achievement of their second (all 22 players) and third (8 players) and fourth (4 players) and fifth through seventh (Martina Navratilova, in women's doubles) complete slam set of major wins.{{clarify|date=May 2012}}

For example, the fourth row shows that Margaret Court completed her third career slam set in Women's Singles—winning each of the four majors three times—during the 1970 Wimbledon Championships (bold). More specific, she won: Australian open 11 times, the third in 1962; French Open five times, the third in 1969; Wimbledon three times (determines the maximum of sets), the third in 1970 and finally US Open five times, the third in 1969. Grey background shades lesser achievements by the same player in the same discipline (e.g., Court in the eighth row); yellow highlights the greatest achievement in the discipline (e.g., Graf in the third row).

==Pro Slam==

Before the [[Tennis open era|Open Era]] began in 1968, only amateur players were allowed to compete in the four majors. Many male top players "went pro" in order to win prize money legally, competing on a professional world tour comprising completely different events.&lt;ref name="eot1974"&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Tennis | author=Robertson, Max | year=1974 | pages=60–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1927 through 1967, the three oldest pro events were considered "majors" of the pro tour: the [[U.S. Pro Tennis Championships]], [[French Pro Championship]] and [[Wembley Championships]].&lt;ref name="RGeist"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ken Rosewall: Der Grosse Meister | author=Geist, Robert | year=1999 | location=Austria | page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RLee"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Greatest Player of All Time: A Statistical Analysis | author=Lee, Raymond | journal=Tennis Week Magazine |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A player who won all three in a calendar year was considered to achieve a "Professional Grand Slam", or "Pro Slam".&lt;ref name="RGeist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RLee" /&gt; The feat was accomplished twice:

Three other players won those three major trophies during their pro careers: [[Ellsworth Vines]], [[Hans Nüsslein]] and [[Don Budge]]. The pro slams did not have a women's draw.{{citation needed|reason=|date=November 2015}}

==History==

===Beginnings in the 19th century===
[[File:ThierryHermès.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thierry Hermès, founder of Hermès.]]

[[Thierry Hermès]] was born in [[Krefeld]], [[Germany]], to a [[France|French]] father and a German mother. The family moved to France in 1828.&lt;ref name="fashion"&gt;
  {{cite web
  |url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/thierry-hermes/
  |title=View the Profilepage of Designer: Hermes
  |publisher=Fashion Model Directory
  |accessdate=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, Hermès first established a harness [[workshop]] in the Grands Boulevards quarter of Paris, dedicated to serving European [[Aristocracy (class)|noblemen]].&lt;ref name="world tempus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hermès Watches|url=http://en.worldtempus.com/watch-brand/hermes-54|website=Worldtempus.com|publisher=WorldTempus|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Hermegrave;s-International-SA-Company-History.html|title=Hermès|accessdate=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created high-quality wrought harnesses and bridles for the carriage trade,&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt; winning several awards including the first prize in its class in 1855 and again in 1867 at the Expositions Universelles in Paris.&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fashionhist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionintime.org/hermes/ |title=History of Hermès|publisher=History of Fashion|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermès's son, Charles-Émile,&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt; took over management from his father in 1880 and moved the shop to ''24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré'', where it remains. With the help of his sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice, Charles-Émile introduced [[saddle]]ry and started selling his products retail.&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt; The company catered to the élite of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia, and the Americas. In 1900, the firm offered the ''Haut à Courroies'' bag, specially designed for riders to carry their saddles with them.

===Hermès Frères era===
After Charles-Émile Hermès's retirement, sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice took leadership and renamed the company Hermès Frères. Shortly after, Émile-Maurice began furnishing the [[czar]] of Russia with saddles.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt; By 1914, up to 80 saddle craftsmen were employed. Subsequently, Émile-Maurice was granted the exclusive rights to use the [[zipper]] for leather goods and clothing, becoming the first to introduce the device in France.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; In 1918, Hermès introduced the first leather golf jacket with a zipper, made for [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name="fashionhist"/&gt; Because of its exclusive rights arrangement the zipper became known in France as the ''fermeture Hermès'' (Hermès fastener).&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;

Throughout the 1920s when he was the sole head of the firm, Émile-Maurice added accessories and clothing collections.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.styl.sh/articles/186-the-story-behind-hermes | title = The Story Behind Hermès | publisher = Styl.sh | accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also groomed his three sons-in-law (Robert Dumas, Jean-René Guerrand, and Francis Puech) as business partners. In 1922, the first leather handbags were introduced after Émile-Maurice's wife complained of not being able to find one to her liking. Émile-Maurice created the handbag collection himself.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt;

[[File:Hermès-1923.jpg|thumb|220px|Hermès Frères advertisement, 1923]]
In 1924, Hermès established a presence in the United States and opened two shops outside of Paris. In 1929, the first women's [[haute couture|couture]] apparel collection was previewed in Paris.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt; During the 1930s, Hermès introduced some of its most recognized original goods&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; such as the leather "Sac à dépêches" in 1935 (later renamed the "[[Kelly bag]]" after [[Grace Kelly]]) and the Hermès ''carrés'' (square scarves) in 1937.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt;

The scarves became integrated into [[Culture of France|French culture]].&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; In 1938, the "Chaîne d'ancre" bracelet and the riding jacket and outfit joined the classic collection. By this point, the company's designers began to draw inspirations from paintings, books, and ''objets d'art''.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; The 1930s also witnessed Hermès's entry into the [[United States]] market by offering products in a Neiman Marcus department store in New York; however, it later withdrew.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; In 1949, the same year as the launch of the Hermès silk tie, the first perfume, "Eau d'Hermès", was produced.

From the mid-1930s, Hermès employed [[Swiss made#A Swiss watch|Swiss watchmaker]] [[Universal Genève]] as the brand's first and exclusive designer of timepieces, producing a line of men's wrist [[chronograph]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://catalog.antiquorum.com/catalog.html?action=load&amp;lotid=384&amp;auctionid=206 | title = Pour Hermès Universal, Genève, case No. 605738.

Émile-Maurice summarized the Hermès philosophy during his leadership as "leather, sport, and a tradition of refined elegance."&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"&gt;{{cite book

===Post-Émile-Maurice Hermès===
Robert Dumas-Hermès (1898–1978), who succeeded Émile-Maurice after his death in 1951, closely collaborated with brother-in-law Jean-René Guerrand.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; Dumas became the first man not directly descended from ''Hermès père'' to lead the company because his connection to the family was only through marriage. Thus, he incorporated the Hermès name into his own, Dumas-Hermès.

The company also acquired its Duc-carriage-with-horse logo and signature orange paper boxes in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; Dumas introduced original handbags, jewelry, and accessories and was particularly interested in design possibilities with the silk scarves.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; Ironically, during the mid-20th century, scarf production diminished.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; World Tempus, a [[Web portal]] dedicated to watchmaking, states: "Brought to life by the magic wand of Annie Beaumel, the windows of the store on the [rue du] Faubourg Saint-Honoré became a theatre of enchantment and [established the store as] a Parisian meeting-place for international celebrities."&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; In 1956, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photograph of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of [[Monaco]], carrying the "Sac à dépêches" bag. Purportedly, she held it in front of herself to disguise her pregnancy. Thus, when the public began calling it the "Kelly" bag, a name subsequently adopted by Hermès, it became hugely popular.

The perfume business became a subsidiary in 1961, concurrently with the introduction of the "Calèche" scent, named after a hooded four-wheeled horse carriage, known since the 18th century, and is also the company's logo since the 1950s. (In 2004, [[Jean-Claude Ellena]] became the in-house perfumer or "nose" and has created several successful scents, including the Hermessence line of fragrances.)&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt;

===Decline and revamp===
[[File:Hermès Store, Avenue George V, Paris 8e 003.JPG|thumbnail|Hermes Store at [[Avenue George V]] in [[8th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 8th arrondissement]], France.]]
Despite the company's apparent success in the 1970s, exemplified by multiple shops' being established worldwide, Hermès began to decline, compared to competitors. Some industry observers have assigned the cause to Hermès's insistence on the exclusive use of natural materials for its products, unlike other companies that were calling on new man-made materials.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; During a two-week lapse in orders, the Hermès workrooms were silent.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; The renewed success of Hermès's fragrances in the marketplace was probably due to the public's increasingly paradigmatic shift of back to natural materials as opposed to artificial. This point undoubtedly contributed to reestablishing Hermès's scents as a major player in the fragrances marketplace.

[[Jean-Louis Dumas]], the son of Robert Dumas-Hermès, became chairman in 1978 and had the firm concentrate on silk and leather goods and ready-to-wear, adding new product groups to those made with its traditional techniques. Unlike his father, Jean-Louis was maternally related to the Hermès family. Travelling extensively&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt; and marrying Rena Greforiadès, he entered the buyer-training program at [[Bloomingdale's]], the New York department store. Having joined the family firm in 1964, he was instrumental in turning around its decline.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt;

Dumas brought in designers Eric Bergère and Bernard Sanz to revamp the apparel collection and, in collaboration, added unusual entries. They included the [[Pythonidae|python]] motorcycle jackets and ostrich-skin jeans, which were dubbed as "a snazzier version of what Hermès has been all along." (Annual sales in 1978, when Jean-Louis became head of the firm, were reported at US $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; By 1990, annual sales were reported at US $460 million, mainly due to Dumas's strategy.) In 1979, he launched an advertising campaign featuring a young, denim-clad woman wearing an Hermès scarf. The purpose was to introduce the Hermès brand to a new set of consumers. As one fashion-sector observer noted: "Much of what bears the still-discreet Hermès label changed from the object of an old person's [[nostalgia]] to the subject of young peoples' dreams."&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; However, Dumas's change-of-image created outrage both within and outside of the firm.

Also in the 1970s, the watch subsidiary, La Montre Hermès, was established in [[Bienne, Switzerland]]. Then, throughout the 1980s, Dumas strengthened the company's hold on its suppliers,&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; resulting in Hermès's gaining great stakes in prominent French [[glassware]], [[silver (household)|silver]]ware acquiring venerable [[tableware]] manufacturers such as Puiforcat, St. Louis, and Périgord.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt;

===Growth===
[[File:HK Causeway Bay Lee Garden Hermes Shop.JPG|thumb|300px|Hermes boutique at The [[Lee Garden]], [[Hong Kong]]]]
From the 1980s, tableware became a strong segment of the firm.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; And, overall, the collection of Hermès goods expanded in 1990 to include over 30,000 pieces. New materials used in the collection included porcelain and crystal.&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;

Hermès relocated its workshops and design studios to Pantin, just outside Paris.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt; By June 1993 Hermès had gone public on the [[Paris Bourse]] (stock exchange). At the time, the equity sale generated great excitement. The 425,000 shares floated at FFr 300 (US $55 at the time) were oversubscribed by 34 times.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; Dumas told ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' that the equity sale would help lessen family tensions by allowing some members to liquidate their holdings without "squabbling over share valuations among themselves."&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt;

To this time, the Hermès family was still retaining a strong hold of about 80% in stocks, placing Jean-Louis Dumas and the entire family on the ''[[Forbes]]'' [[list of billionaires]].&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; Mimi Tompkins of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' called the company "one of Paris' best guarded jewels."

In the following years, Dumas decreased Hermès franchises from 250 to 200 and increased company-owned stores from 60 to 100 to better control sales of its products.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; The plan was to cost about FFr 200&amp;nbsp;million in the short term but to increase profits in the long term. Having around FFr 500&amp;nbsp;million to invest, Hermès pressed ahead, targeting China for company-operated boutiques, finally opening a store in [[Beijing]] in 1996.

In 1997, Jean-Louis hired iconoclastic Belgian designer [[Martin Margiela]] to supervise women's ready-to-wear.

By the late 1990s, Hermès continued extensively to diminish the number of [[Franchising|franchise]]d stores, buying them up and opening more company-operated boutiques. The fashion industry was caught off guard in September 1999, when Jean-Louis decided to pay FFr 150&amp;nbsp;million for a 35% stake in the [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] fashion house.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; In the latter part of the 1900s, the company encouraged its clientele to ''faites nous rêver'' (make us dream), producing throughout the period artistically atypical orders.

===The 2000s to today===
[[File:Hermès, Madrid, Spain España.jpg|thumb|right|277px|Hermès, [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] (2016)]]
In 2003, Margiela left Hermès, and highly controversial [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], as the head designer, debuted his first ready-to-wear collection for fall/winter 2004–05.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/jean_paul_gaultier/index.html |title=Jean Paul Gaultier News|work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Wilson | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 28 years as head of the firm, Jean-Louis Dumas retired in January 2006. Known for his charm and one of Europe's greatest authorities on luxury, he died in 2010 after a long illness.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt; Patrick Thomas, who had joined the company in 1989 and who had worked with Jean-Louis as the co-CEO from 2005, replaced him. Thomas became the first non-Hermès family member to head the company.

In February 2015, Hermès has announced an increase of its turnover of 9.7%, which represents more than €4 billion in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/record-profit-and-exceptional-dividend-offset-lower-target-for-herme-s/2015032715991|first=Angela|last=Gonzalez-Rodriguez|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015|work=[[FashionUnited]]|title=Record profit and exceptional dividend offset lower target for Hermès}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase is internationally visible. In Asia, excluding Japan, where the turnover grew 7%, in America, with 10% rise, in Europe where it grew 7% growth and generated a good performance in the group’s stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/hermes-h1-revenues-accelerate-21-percent/2015072117113|first=Prachi|last=Singh|date=July 21, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[FashionUnited]]|title=Hermes H1 revenues accelerate 21 percent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2018, Malaysian police seized 284 luxury bags, believed to be some Hermès handbags from the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Najib Razak's-linked apartments.

==Designers==
The designers throughout the company's history have included [[Lola Prusac]], Jacques Delahaye, Catherine de Karolyi, Monsieur Levaillant, Nicole de Vesian, Eric Bergère, Claude Brouet, Tan Giudicelli, Marc Audibet, Mariot Chane, Bernard Sanz, [[Martin Margiela]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], Christophe Lemaire, Véronique Nichanian (the men's-wear designer since 1988), and Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski (since 2014 succeeding Lemaire).&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt;

==Goods and products==
[[File:Hermes soap.jpg|270px|thumb|right|An Hermès soap bar bearing the logo.]]
Known for [[luxury goods]], by 2008, Hermès had 14 product divisions that encompassed leather, scarves, ties, men's and women's wear, perfume, watches, stationery, footwear, gloves, enamelware, decorative arts, tableware, and jewellery.&lt;ref name="world tempus"/&gt;

Hermès sales compose about 30% leather goods, 15% clothes, 12% scarves, and 43% other wares.&lt;ref name="fashion"/&gt; The company licenses no products and keeps tight control over the design and manufacture of its vast inventory.&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;

The firm is very attach to its traditional business model and rejects mass production, assembly lines, and mechanization. Hermès's goods are almost entirely made in France by hand in middle-sized workshops known as Les Ateliers Hermès that emphase high-quality manufacturing. Indeed, Hermès claims most items are fabricated from beginning to end by only one person, which is supposed to guarantee the quality and uniqueness of its products.

In 2012, Hermès retail outlets changed their policy regarding returns and exchanges of products. Consumers may only exchange items within ten days of purchase and only for another color variant of the original purchase. No other post-purchase exchanges are permitted, and refunds are never offered, regardless of the consumer's having a receipt.

===Scarves===

The scarf or ''carré'' (square) was introduced in 1937.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; The first example was a 70&amp;nbsp;cm x 70&amp;nbsp;cm print of white-wigged females playing a popular period game, a custom-made accessory named "Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches."&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; Hermès oversaw the production of its scarves throughout the entire process, purchasing raw Chinese silk, spinning it into [[yarn]], and weaving it into fabric twice as strong and heavy as most scarves available at the time.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt;

The company's scarf designers spend years creating new print patterns that are individually screen-printed.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; Designers can choose from over 70,000 different colors.&lt;ref name="coleno"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hermès Scarf: History &amp; Mystique | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | author=Colino, Nadine | year=2010 | isbn=0-500-51518-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When production first began, a dedicated factory was established in [[Lyon]], France, the same year that Hermès celebrated its 100th anniversary.

Contemporary Hermès ''carrés'' measure 90&amp;nbsp;cm × 90&amp;nbsp;cm, weigh 65&amp;nbsp;grams and are woven from the silk of 250 [[Bombyx mori|mulberry moth]] [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoon]]s.&lt;ref name="coleno"/&gt; All hems are hand-stitched. Motifs are wide-ranging, Two silk-scarf collections per year are released, along with some reprints of older designs and limited editions. And two collections per year are introduced in a [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]]/silk blend. Since 1937, Hermès has produced over 2,000 unique designs; the horse motif is particularly famous and popular.&lt;ref name="coleno"/&gt; The ubiquitous "Brides de Gala" version, introduced in 1957, has been produced more than 70,000 times. An Hermès scarf is sold somewhere in the world every 25 seconds; by the late 1970s, more than 1.1 million scarves had been sold worldwide.&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt;

The scarves&lt;ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/&gt; have been worn by an array of celebrities, partially such as:
* [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in a large number of [[paparazzi]] photographs also with daughter Princess Margaret, in the middle of one of three portraits on a 1986 British postage stamp, and by Helen Mirren playing the monarch in the film ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'', 2006.
* Princess [[Grace Kelly]] in a photograph on the cover of a 1956 issue of ''Life'' magazine and, in the same year, tied by her as a sling for a broken arm.
* Jackie Kennedy Onassis over her head and tied around her neck.
* actress Audrey Hepburn in a photograph on the cover of a 1956 issue of ''Life" magazine and in the film ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', 1963.
* actress [[Sharon Stone]] in a [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] scene in the film ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', 1992.
* actress [[Cameron Diaz]] in the film ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]'', 1997.
* actress [[Anne Hathaway]] in the film ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', 2001.
* deputy artistic director of Hermès women's wear, Bali Barret, as a cape, 2011.
* entertainer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] wearing "Ls Vie au Cheval" design as a halter top, 2002.

===Neckties===
[[File:Hermes ties.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Hermès silk [[Neckties|ties]].]]
In 1946, the brand introduced a range of men's silk neckties in an array of motifs and widths. Neckties account for 10% of the company's annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/history-hermes-alessio-farnetani/|title=THE HISTORY OF HERMES|date=2015-09-15|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership with the Tuareg===
For years, Hermès has partnered with [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribesmen for silver jewelry. The [[Sahara]]n [[nomad]]s' traditional motifs are often mirrored in various Hermès products, including scarves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/tuareg-chic-164951187/|title=Tuareg Chic|accessdate=December 8, 2014|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leather Goods==
[[File:Kelly Bag.jpg|160px|left|thumb|The [[Kelly bag]]]]
[[File:Hermes Ostrich Birkin Bag.jpg|160px|thumb|Exotic leathers of the bags make them highly valuable and noticeable, ''e.g.'', ostrich leather]]
[[File:Hermes Birkin.JPG|160px|thumb|A Hermès [[Birkin bag]]]]

Hermès is known for its handmade luggage and handbags. One of them might require 18 to 24 hours to produce. The construction of each [[Kelly bag]], for example, requires 18 hours to fully realize.&lt;ref name="finding"/&gt; Hermès's leathers come from all over the world. Customers may currently wait from six months to one year for delivery of one of the house's signature bags. Incidentally, should Hermès's leather goods require repair, owners can bring an item to any Hermès store, where it will be shipped to Les Ateliers Hermès in [[Pantin]] for repair or reconditioning.

Another famous Hermès handbag, the "[[Birkin bag|Birkin]]", was named after English actress [[Jane Birkin]]. After a chance encounter with Jean-Louis Dumas, she complained that her "Kelly" bag was not practical for everyday use. Consequently, he invited her to France where they co-designed the bag in 1984. Birkin has since stopped carrying her namesake bag due to her [[tendonitis]], as the bag became too large and heavy for her to carry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/the-birkin-rules&lt;/ref&gt;  Asked by her that her name be removed and with much back-and-forth comments about various issues such as having her name removed. According to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'': "Jane Birkin 'is satisfied by the measures taken by Hermès', according to the brand, following an investigation by the fashion house [that refuted] claims made by PETA [the animal-rights organization] that its famous Birkin bags were being 'constructed from the skins of factory-farmed and cruelly slaughtered crocodiles.' "&lt;ref&gt;Scarlet Conlon, "Birkin 'Satisfied" by Hermès Investigation," [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfumery==
Since 1951, the company has created a number of scents for both men and women, as well as unisex lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.hermes.com/is/content/hermesedito/RSE/PDF/PDF_RSE_DocumentDeReference_2016_EN.pdf Hermès International, 2016 Registration Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belonging to the group is the crystal glass manufacturer [[Saint-Louis (glass manufacturer)|Saint-Louis]], the oldest [[lead glass|crystal]] company in the world. Since its founding in 1586, Saint-Louis has drawn design inspiration from the decorative periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, from the Restoration to Modern styles, through Napoléon III, [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Déco]]. Saint-Louis became one of the Hermès Group Métiers in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saint-louis.com/en/history/saint-louis-key-dates |title=The Saint-Louis key dates |website=Saint-louis.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041012/http://www.saint-louis.com/en/history/saint-louis-key-dates |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apple Watch Hermès==
In 2015, Hermès partnered with [[Apple Inc.]] to produce the [[Apple Watch Hermès]], combining Apple's [[smartwatch]] with Hermès's specially crafted single tour, double tour, and cuff watch bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.smartwatchcrunch.com/where-to-get-apple-watch-hermes-store-locations-and-product-hands-on/ |title=Apple Watch Hermès Store Locations and product hands on |website=Smartwatchcrunch.com |date=2015-09-13 |accessdate=2016-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123161205/http://www.smartwatchcrunch.com/where-to-get-apple-watch-hermes-store-locations-and-product-hands-on/ |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hermès Foundation==
The Hermès Foundation was launched in 2008. It is chaired by Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermés, and directed by Catherine Tsekenis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/fashion/herms-artistic-director-announces-alliance-with-aperture-foundation.html?_r=0|title=Hermès Artisitc Director Announces Alliance With Aperture Foundation|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan |first=Norman |url=http://www.billionaire.com/fondation-dentreprise-hermes/1263/the-hermes-foundation-sincerity-over-seduction |title=Catherine Tsékénis, director of the Fondation d’entreprise Hermès |publisher=Billionaire |date=2014-12-10 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it launched the biannual Emile Hermès Prize that rewards an innovative project in the field of design.

==Shareholder structure==
By 31 December 2016, the Hermès family, as partners of Émile Hermès SARL and their family members, collectively owned 65.1% of the share capital of Hermès International S.A. through a number of asset holding companies and direct ownerships, which entitled the family to 74.8% of the voting rights on allocation of net income and 77.2% on all other matters.&lt;ref name="Hermès Annual Report 2016"/&gt; Luxury-goods conglomerate [[LVMH]] held 20.21% of shares (amassed in the latter half of 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidalon|first=Dominique|title=LVMH raises Hermès stake above 20 percent|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/12/21/uk-lvmh-idUKTRE6BK5C920101221|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=21 December 2010|author2=Wendlandt, Astrid|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 13.08% of votes at the same date, with 0.39% of shares held as treasury stock and the remaining 16.61% as [[free float]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inetbdif.amf-france.org/DocDoif/txtint/RAPOSTPdf/2011/2011-033000.pdf |title=Annual Report 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2011 |publisher=Hermès |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429044841/http://inetbdif.amf-france.org/DocDoif/txtint/RAPOSTPdf/2011/2011-033000.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation that LVMH would launch a takeover bid for Hermès has been repeatedly denied&lt;ref name="graun"&gt;{{cite news |title=LVMH's Bernard Arnault persists in his pursuit of Hermès|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | first=Tom | last=Bawden |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/08/mergers-and-acquisitions-retail |date= 8 March 2011| accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hermes Shares Decline in Paris After LVMH Denies Bid Plans|agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | first=Roberts | last=Andrew |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-10/hermes-shares-decline-in-paris-after-lvmh-denies-bid-plans-1-.html |date= 10 June 2011| accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by its chairman [[Bernard Arnault]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">'''Hierarchy of death''' is a phrase used by journalists, social scientists, and academics to describe disproportionate amounts of media attention paid to various incidents of death around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keating |first=Joshua |date=2013-04-22 |title=Is it wrong to care more about 4 deaths in Boston than 80 in Syria? |publisher=Ideas.foreignpolicy.com |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/22/is-it-wrong-to-care-more-about-4-deaths-in-boston-than-80-in-syria/ |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Definitions of the hierarchy of death vary, but several themes remain consistent in terms of media coverage: domestic deaths trump foreign deaths, deaths in the [[developed world]] trump deaths in the [[developing world]], deaths of whites trump deaths of darker skinned people, and deaths in ongoing conflicts garner relatively little media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenslade |first=Roy |date=2007-04-19 |title=A hierarchy of death |publisher=Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/thirtytwodieinamericanuniv |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karpf |first=Anne |date=2001-11-28 |title=Anne Karpf: The hierarchy of death |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/28/september11.usa |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Jeffrey |date=July 23, 2014 |title=Obsessing About Gaza, Ignoring Syria (And Most Everything Else) |publisher=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/obsessing-about-gaza-ignoring-syria-and-most-everything-else/374898/ |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=R.

==Commentary==
British media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] has been credited with coining the term while writing on the newsworthiness of those who died during [[The Troubles]]. Greenslade continues to critique the phenomenon, including media reactions to the [[Boston Marathon bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 30, 2011 |title=Sian murder says a lot about media's values |publisher=London Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/sian-murder-says-a-lot-about-medias-values-6386595.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bostonbombings&gt;{{cite web |date=April 24, 2013 |title=The hierarchy of death: Boston's bombings shock us more than the silent drone war in Pakistan.

[[NPR]] discussed the disparity in media coverage between the [[2015 Beirut bombings]] and the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], which happened with a day of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/paris-beirut-media-coverage/416457/|title=Paris, Beirut, and the Language Used to Describe Terrorism|last=Ajaka|first=Nadine|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/456317759/is-there-a-hierarchy-of-the-importance-of-death-in-the-news-business|title=Is There A Hierarchy Of The Importance Of Death In The News Business?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">'''International Himalayan Festival''' is a festival that is held every year in the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[India]] to honour [[Dalai Lama]], a recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1985. This cultural festival is known for the performances by various groups from around Himachal Pradesh and sometimes other Himalayan regions as well &lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/dharamsala/mcleod-ganj/events/international-himalayan-festival/a/poi-fes/1151521/356298|title=International Himalayan Festival|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The festival is particularly significant as it symbolizes the peace initiative. [[Indo-Tibetan Friendship Society]] alongside the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] Tourism supports the this Festival. In 2018, it was held in [[Kangra district]] of Himachal Pradesh in the month of December. &lt;ref name=aab&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellotravel.com/events/international-himalayan-festival|title=About International Himalayan Festival|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celebrations ===
The festival is aimed at reinforcing the ties and harmony between the locals of Himachal Pradesh and the Tibetans living there. The main features of the International Himalayan Festival includes cultural shows and exhibitions, mainly by the artists of the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts, local craftsmen, social groups and school children. One of the real attractions amid the International Himalayan Festival is the widespread stalls in the streets. Each stall speaks to the way of life, traditions of the state and display the local herbs and handicrafts of the inhabitants. Along the streets, there are various food stalls that offer delightful authentic delicacies. One can spend the whole day tasting these dishes. Different stalls in the festival feature the lifestyle, meticulous work, customary herbs, and cooking styles of the Himalayan area. Different cultural programs and shows are conducted as part of this grand festival. The showcase of its rich culture is certain to keep the sightseers stuck during this festival. &lt;ref name=aac&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yatrablog.com/the-international-himalayan-festival-in-mcleodganj|title=The International Himalayan Festival In McLeodganj|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=aad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/himachal-pradesh/festivals/international-himalayan-festival.html|title=International Himalayan Festiva|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This festival is held at that time when snowflakes begin hitting the place. Since Himachal Pradesh is located in the lower region of Himalayas, the climate gets really chilly during the month of December. What's more, amid this celebration, toursits can invest energy getting a charge out of the conventional shows performed by the local residents. During these three days, the whole state of Himachal Pradesh observes an amicable mix of cultural programmes performed by different communities of the state. Tourists during this time get the chance to experience the rich culture that this place is blessed with.

'''''Leblouh''''' ({{lang-ar|البلوح|lə-blūḥ}}) is the practice of [[force-feeding]] girls from as young as five to nineteen, in [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], and southern [[Morocco]], where [[Fat admirer|obesity was traditionally regarded as desirable]].&lt;ref&gt;Popenoe, Rebecca. 2004. Feeding Desire: Fatness, Beauty, and Sexuality among a Saharan People. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415280969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savagemind.org/tag/body/ De mujeres abundantemente hermosas (''Abundantly beautiful women'')]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaFRANIERE, SHARON. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/world/africa/04mauritania.html In Mauritania, Seeking to End an Overfed Ideal], ''The New York Times'', published on July 4, 2007. Accessed on June 30, 2011.
*"Girls as young as 5 and as old as 19 had to drink up to five gallons of fat-rich camel’s or cow’s milk daily, aiming for silvery stretch marks on their upper arms. If a girl refused or vomited, the village weight-gain specialist might squeeze her foot between sticks, pull her ear, pinch her inner thigh, bend her finger backward or force her to drink her own vomit. In extreme cases, girls die, due to a burst stomach. The practice was known as gavage, a French term for force-feeding geese to obtain foie gras."&lt;/ref&gt; Especially prevalent in rural areas and having its roots in [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedieberbere.revues.org/1856 Encyclopedie Berbere: Gavage]&lt;/ref&gt; tradition, ''leblouh'' is practiced to increase chances of marriage in a society where high body volume used to be a sign of wealth. The synonym '''gavage''' comes from the French term for the force-feeding of geese to produce ''[[foie gras]]''.

The practice goes back to the 11th century, and has been reported to have made a significant comeback in Mauritania after a [[2008 Mauritanian coup d'état|military junta took over the country in 2008]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Alex Duval. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/01/mauritania-force-feeding-marriage Girls being force-fed for marriage as junta revives fattening farms], ''The Observer'', March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Older women called "fatteners" force the young girls to consume enormous quantities of food and liquid,&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; inflicting pain on them if they do not eat and drink. One way of inflicting pain is to pinch a limb between two sticks. A six-year-old might typically be forced to drink {{convert|20|litre}} of [[camel's milk]], and eat two kilos of pounded [[millet]] mixed with two cups of butter, every day. Although the practice is abusive, mothers claim there is no other way to secure a good future for their children.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=alarabiya&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/02/24/67174.html Young Mauritanians reject forced fattening], ''Al Arabiya'', February 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger generations of males in Mauritania now see fattening negatively.&lt;ref name=alarabiya/&gt;. 

{{Quote box
 |quote  = Fattening is something from the 1950s. These days girls watch fashion shows on television. Their role models are American actresses or Lebanese singers in sexy dresses. Girls do sport. Yes, Mauritanian men like slightly round women. But there is no way we want them obese.
 |author = Mohamed el-Mounir
 |source = ''Girls being force-fed for marriage as fattening farms revived'', The Guardian, 1st March 2009
}}

A similar practice is referred to in a folktale entitled "The Tortoise with a Pretty Daughter", collected in ''[[Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria]]'' (1910). The folklorist who wrote down the story explained the treatment of the "pretty daughter": "The fatting house is a room where a girl is kept for some weeks before her marriage. She is given plenty of food, and made as fat as possible, as fatness is looked upon as a great beauty by the [[Efik people]]."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1, note 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media and democracy''' is a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] approach to [[media studies]] that advocates for reforming the [[mass media]], strengthening [[public service broadcasting]], developing and participating in [[alternative media]] and [[citizen journalism]], in order to create a mass media system that informs and empowers all members of society, and enhances democratic values. Media is also defined as "medium" a way of communicating with others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medium|title=Definition of MEDIUM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definition==
Media democracy focuses on empower individual citizens and promote democratic ideals through the spread of information.&lt;ref name="Exoo 2010 1–4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Exoo|first=Calvin F.|title=The Pen and the Sword: Press, War, and Terror in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=California|isbn=978-1-4129-5360-3|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the media system itself should be democratic in its own construction &lt;ref name="Exoo 2010 4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Exoo|first=Calvin F.|title=The Pen and the Sword: Press, War, and Terror in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=California|isbn=978-1-4129-5360-3|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; shying away from private ownership or intense regulation. Media democracy entails that media should be used to promote democracy&lt;ref name="Exoo 2010 1–4"/&gt; as well as the conviction that media should be democratic itself;&lt;ref name="Exoo 2010 4"/&gt; media ownership concentration is not democratic and cannot serve to promote democracy and therefore must be examined critically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=We the Media: A Citizen's Guide to Fighting for Media Democracy|editor=Hazen, Don and Julie Winokur|year=1997|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-380-0|title=We the Media - A Citizen's Guide to Fighting for Media Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, and a social movement promoting it, have grown as a response to the increased corporate domination of mass media and the perceived shrinking of the [[marketplace of ideas]].

The term refers to a modern social movement evident in countries all over the world which attempts to make mainstream media more accountable to the publics they serve and to create more democratic alternatives.

The concept of a media democracy follows in response to the deregulation of broadcast markets and the concentration of mass media ownership. In the book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', authors [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] outline the [[propaganda model]] of media, which states that the private interests in control of media outlets will shape news and information before it is disseminated to the public through the use of five information filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|year=2002|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=978-0375714498}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Media democracy allows people the right to participate in media, it extends the media’s relationship to the [[public sphere]], where the information that is gathered and can be viewed and shared by the people.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=bbe2544c-0ab4-418f-9faf-f44ef1b747b9%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4105&lt;/ref&gt; The public sphere is described as a network of communicating information and points of view from people, which is reproduced through communicative action through the media to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://biblioteca.clacso.edu.ar/ar/libros/edicion/media/16Chapter10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of media democracy and the public sphere extends to various types of media, such as social media and mainstream media, in order for people to communicate with one another through digital media and share the information they want to publish to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalmediajournal.com/open-access/the-public-sphere-and-network-democracy-social-movements-and-political-change.php?aid=64445&lt;/ref&gt;

The public sphere can be seen as a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through a medium of talk and a realm of social life which public opinion can be formed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-sociology-textbook/government-15/democracy-115/public-sphere-and-civil-society-643-8268/&lt;/ref&gt; The public sphere is also a democratic system that is open to any free citizen who would like to participate in media if they have any information they would like to share to society.  The public sphere has changed because of the development of mass communication, giving people opportunities to participate in media and the right to share information through all channels of communications.&lt;ref&gt;https://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTGOVACC/Resources/PubSphereweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The democracy of the public sphere is in the participation of citizens who provide information to the media and share it to society.

Media democracy advocates that corporate ownership and commercial pressures influence media content, sharply limiting the range of news, opinions, and entertainment citizens receive.  Consequently, they call for a more equal distribution of economic, social, cultural, and information capital, which would lead to a more informed citizenry, as well as a more enlightened, representative political discourse.

A media democracy advocates:
* Replacing the current corporate media model with one that operates democratically, rather than for profit
* Strengthening public service broadcasting
* Incorporating the use of alternative media into the larger discourse
* Increasing the role of citizen journalism
* Turning a passive audience into active participants
* Using the mass media to promote democratic ideals

The competitive structure of the mass media landscape stands in opposition to democratic ideals since the competition of the marketplace effects how stories are framed and transmitted to the public. This can "hamper the ability of the democratic system to solve internal social problems as well as international conflicts in an optimal way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fog|first=Agner|title=The supposed and the real role of mass media in modern democracy|url=http://www.agner.org/cultsel/mediacrisis.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media democracy is grounded in creating a mass media system that favours a diversity of voices and opinions over ownership or consolidation, in an effort to eliminate bias in coverage. This, in turn, leads to the informed public debate necessary for a democratic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheets On Media Democracy|url=http://www.fepproject.org/factsheets/mediademocracy.html|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ability to comprehend and scrutinize the connection between press and democracy is important because media has the power to tell a society’s stories and thereby influence thinking, beliefs and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Exoo|first=Calvin F.|title=The Pen and the Sword: Press, War, and Terror in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=California|isbn=978-1-4129-5360-3|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media ownership concentration==

Cultural studies have investigated changes in the increasing tendency of modern mass media in the field of politics to blur and confuse the boundaries between journalism, entertainment, public relations and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Thomas|last2=Hinchman|first2=Lew|title=Media Democracy: How the Media Colonize Politics|year=2002|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-7456-2844-3|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A diverse range of information providers is necessary so that viewers, readers and listeners receive a broad spectrum of information from varying sources that is not tightly controlled, biased and filtered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=The People’s Right to Know: Media, Democracy, and the Information Highway|editor=Williams, Frederick and John V. Pavlik|title=The People's Right to Know: Media, Democracy, and the Information Highway|year=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-1491-4|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to different sources of information prevents deliberate attempts at misinformation and allows the public to make their own judgments and form their own opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Exoo|first=Calvin F.|title=The Pen and the Sword: Press, War, and Terror in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=California|isbn=978-1-4129-5360-3|pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is critical as individuals must be in a position to decide and act autonomously for there to be a functioning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Thomas|last2=Hinchman|first2=Lew|title=Media Democracy: How the Media Colonize Politics|year=2002|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-7456-2844-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last several decades have seen an increased concentration of media ownership by large private entities. In the United States, these organizations are known as the Big Six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ownership Chart: The Big Six|url=http://www.freepress.net/ownership/chart/main|publisher=Free Press|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They include: [[General Electric]], [[Walt Disney Co.]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner]], [[Viacom]], and [[CBS Corporation]]. A similar approach has been taken in Canada, where most media outlets are [[Media ownership in Canada|owned by national conglomerates]]. This has led to a reduction in the number of voices and opinions communicated to the public; to an increase in the commercialization of news and information; a reduction in investigative reporting; and an emphasis on infotainment and profitability over informative public discourse.

The concentration of media outlets has been encouraged by government deregulation and neoliberal trade policies. In the United States, the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] removed most of the media ownership rules that were previously put in place. This led to a massive consolidation of the telecommunications industry. Over 4,000 radio stations were bought out, and minority ownership in TV stations dropped to its lowest point since 1990, when the federal government began tracking the data.

==Internet media democracy==

The [[World Wide Web]], and in particular [[Web 2.0]], is seen as a powerful medium for facilitating the growth of a media democracy as it offers participants, "a potential voice, a platform, and access to the means of production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kidd|first=Jenny|title=Are New Media Democratic?|url=http://culturalpolicyjournal.org/past-issues/issue-no-5/are-new-media-democratic/|publisher=Cultural Policy Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102121813/http://culturalpolicyjournal.org/past-issues/issue-no-5/are-new-media-democratic/|archivedate=2012-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of digital social networking technologies to promote political dissent and reform lends credibility to the media democracy model. This is apparent in the widespread protests in the Middle East and North Africa known as the [[Arab Spring]] where social media sites like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] allowed citizens to quickly connect with one another, exchange information, and organize protests against their governments. While social media cannot solely be credited with the success of these protests, the technologies played an important role in instilling change in Tunisia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Tunisia Leader Flees and Prime Minister Claims Power|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/world/africa/15tunis.html?_r=1|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=Spotlight Again Falls on Web Tools and Change|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/weekinreview/30shane.html?hp|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahim|first=Kareem|title=Violent Clashes Mark Protests Against Mubarak’s Rule|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/world/middleeast/26egypt.html?hp|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 25, 2011|author2=Mona El-Naggar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schillinger|first=Raymond|title=Social Media and the Arab Spring: What Have We Learned?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-schillinger/arab-spring-social-media_b_970165.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Libya. These acts show a population can be informed through alternative media channels, and can adjust its behaviour accordingly.

Crowdfunded websites have also been linked to a heightened spread of media democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/adam-ramsay/how-can-we-build-democratic-media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Feminism==
Though the model aims to democratize the opinions expressed within the mass media as well as the ownership of media entities themselves, feminist media theory argues that the media cannot be considered truly inclusive or democratic insofar as they rely on the masculine concepts of impartiality and objectivity.&lt;ref name=thornham1&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornham|first=Sue|title=Women, Feminism and Media|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-2071-5|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating a more inclusive and democratic media would require reconceptualizing how we define the news and its principles.&lt;ref name=thornham1/&gt; According to some feminist media theorists, news is like fictional genres that impose order and interpretation on its materials by means of narrative.&lt;ref name=thornham2/&gt; Consequently, the news narrative put forward presents only one angle of a much wider picture.&lt;ref name=thornham2&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornham|first=Sue|title=Women, Feminism and Media|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-2071-5|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that the distinction between public and private information that underpins how we define valuable or appropriate news content is also a gendered concept.&lt;ref name=thornham2/&gt; The feminist argument follows that the systematic subversion of private or subjective information excludes women's voices from the popular discourse.&lt;ref name=thornham2/&gt; Further to this point, feminist media theorists argue there is an assumed sense of equality or equalness implicit in the definition of the public that ignores important differences between genders in terms of their perspectives. So while media democracy in practice as alternative or citizen journalism may allow for greater diversity, these theorists argue that women's voices are framed within a masculine structure of objectivity and rationalist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornham|first=Sue|title=Women, Feminism and Media|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-2071-5|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this criticism there is an acceptance among some theorists that the blurring of public and private information with the introduction of some new alternative forms of media production (as well as the increase in opportunities for interaction and user-generated content) may signal a positive shift towards a more democratic and inclusive media democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornham|first=Sue|title=Women, Feminism and Media|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-2071-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some forms of media democracy in practice (as citizen or alternative journalism) are challenging journalism's central tenets (objectivity and impartiality) by rejecting the idea that it is possible to tell a narrative without bias and, more to the point, that it is socially or morally preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornham|first=Sue|title=Women, Feminism and Media|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-2071-5|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics{{who|date=November 2016}} of media democracy note that in order for the system to function properly, it assumes each member of society to be an educated and active participant in the creation of media and exchange of information. In countries with a high illiteracy rate, for example, it would be next to impossible for average citizens to take part and fully engage with media, and adjust their behaviour accordingly in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role of Media In Democracy|url=http://www.slideshare.net/shainks023/role-of-media-in-democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of promoting democratic ideals, this would in turn fracture society into an upper-class that actively participates in creating the media, and a lower-class that only consumes it, leaving individuals open to the manipulation of information or media bias. This is not far from [[Nancy Fraser]]’s critique of the Habermasian [[public sphere]], with regards to the bracketing of personal inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Nancy|title=Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic500286.files/Fraser%20%20Rethinking%20the%20Public%20Sphere.pdf|journal=Social Text|year=1990|publisher=Duke University Press|jstor=466240|doi=10.2307/466240|issue=25/26|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restriction in Media ==
Restrictions in media may exist either directly or indirectly. Before internet usage of media as well as social media became prominent, ordinary citizens rarely had much control over media. Even as the usage of social media has increased, major corporations still maintain the primary control over media as they are acquiring more and more platforms that would be considered in public use today&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Media Studies: An Introduction Second Edition|last=Mack, Ott|first=Robert L., Brian L.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-55397-8|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Media has been compared in the sense that it is the usage of media that determines how the content is considered, rather than the actual messages of the content. According to the Alec Charles edited ''Media/Democracy'', “It is not the press or television or the internet or even democracy itself that is good or bad. It is what we do with them that makes them so”&lt;ref&gt;Charles, A. (2013). Media/Democracy : A Comparative Study. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://corvette.salemstate.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,cpid&amp;custid=ssc&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=632062&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The role government plays in media restrictions in media has been viewed with skepticism as well. The government involvement in media is possibly due to distrust between the government and media, as the government has criticized media before. Partial blame for distrust between the government and the public on both sides often goes to media as the public may feel as though there is false information though media and the government may feel as though media is giving the public false information&lt;ref&gt;Cammaerts, B., &amp; Carpentier, N. (2007). ''Reclaiming the Media : Communication Rights and Democratic Media Roles''. Bristol, UK: Intellect. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://corvette.salemstate.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,cpid&amp;custid=ssc&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=179161&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;. 

These functions of media in the way that it exists is described in a review of Victor Pickard’s book, ''America’s Battle for Media Democracy: The Triumph of Corporate Libertarianism and the Future of Media Reform,'' where Josh Shepperd wrote, “If one approaches the historical question of media ownership from a public service model, the private emphasis of the system requires praise for its innovations and self-sustainability, but deserves deep interrogation for its largely uncontested claim that the system, as is, provides the best opportunity for social recognition”&lt;ref&gt;Shepperd, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61442">'''Medical tourism''' refers to people traveling to a country other than their own to obtain medical treatment. In the past this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medical Tourism: Globalization of the Healthcare Marketplace|first1=Michael D. |last1=Horowitz |first2=Jeffrey A. |last2=Rosensweig |first3=Christopher A. |last3=Jones|year=2007 |pmc=2234298 |pmid=18311383 |volume=9 |journal=MedGenMed |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical tourism--health care in the global economy|url=http://web.nchu.edu.tw/pweb/users/hychuo/lesson/5877.pdf|publisher=Physician Exec|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or illegal in the home country.

Medical tourism most often is for [[surgery|surgeries]] (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for [[dental tourism]] or [[fertility tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/fertilitytourism.asp |title=fertility tourism |publisher=Word Spy |date=2006-05-17 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including [[psychiatry]], alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.

'''Health tourism''' is a wider term for travel that focus on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented, tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. [[Wellness tourism]] is a related field.

==History==
The first recorded instance of people travelling for medical treatment dates back thousands of years to when [[Greeks|Greek]] pilgrims traveled from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to a small area in the [[Saronic Gulf]] called [[Epidauria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Medical Tourism|url=http://www.discovermedicaltourism.com/history/|website=Discovermedicaltourism.com|publisher=Discovermedicaltourism.com|accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This territory was the sanctuary of the healing god [[Asklepios]].

[[Spa town]]s and [[sanatorium|sanitaria]] were early forms of medical tourism. In 18th-century Europe patients visited spas because they were places with supposedly health-giving [[mineral water]]s, treating diseases from [[gout]] to [[liver]] disorders and [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref name="Gahlinger2008"&gt;Gahlinger, PM. The Medical Tourism Travel Guide: Your Complete Reference to Top-Quality, Low-Cost Dental, Cosmetic, Medical Care &amp; Surgery Overseas. Sunrise River Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Factors that have led to the increasing popularity of medical travel include the high cost of health care, long wait times for certain procedures, the ease and affordability of international travel, and improvements in both technology and standards of care in many countries.&lt;ref name="Goering March 28, 2008"&gt;Laurie Goering, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-medical-tourism_goeringmar28,0,4555735.story  "For big surgery, Delhi is dealing,"] The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', March 28, 2008  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401041824/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-medical-tourism_goeringmar28%2C0%2C4555735.story |date=April 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tompkins|first1=Olga|title=Medical Tourism|journal=AAOHN Journal|date=2010|volume=58|issue=1|page=40|doi=10.3928/08910162-20091223-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The avoidance of waiting times is the leading factor for medical tourism from the UK, whereas in the US, the main reason is cheaper prices abroad.

Many surgery procedures performed in medical tourism destinations cost a fraction of the price they do in other countries. For example, in the United States, a liver transplant that may cost $300,000 USD, would generally cost about $91,000 USD in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2004023,00.html | work=Time | first=Sarah | last=Tung | title=Is Taiwan Asia's Next One-Stop Plastic-Surgery Shop? | date=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large draw to medical travel is convenience and speed. Countries that operate public health-care systems often have long wait times for certain operations, for example, an estimated 782,936 Canadian patients spent an average waiting time of 9.4 weeks on medical waiting lists in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.Web/product_files/PrivateCostofPublicQueues2005.pdf The Private Cost of Public Queues in 2005], [[Fraser Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has also set waiting time benchmarks for non urgent medical procedures, including a 26-week waiting period for a hip replacement and a 16-week wait for cataract surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/Wait+times+shorter+some+medical+procedures+report/1528971/story.html Wait times shorter for some medical procedures: report.], [[Canwest News Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In First World countries such as the United States, medical tourism has large growth prospects and potentially destabilizing implications.  A forecast by [[Deloitte Consulting]] published in August 2008 projected that medical tourism originating in the US could jump by a factor of ten over the next decade.  An estimated 750,000 Americans went abroad for health care in 2007, and the report estimated that 1.5 million would seek health care outside the US in 2008.  The growth in medical tourism has the potential to cost US health care providers billions of dollars in lost revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Linda A. Johnson, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/03/BUGA121GPF.DTL&amp;type=health "Americans look abroad to save on health care: Medical tourism could jump tenfold in next decade,"] The [[San Francisco Chronicle]], August 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An authority at the [[Harvard Business School]] stated that "medical tourism is promoted much more heavily in the United Kingdom than in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Lagace, Martha [http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5814.html "The Rise of Medical Tourism"], Harvard Business School Working Knowledge, December 17, 2007. Retrieved July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some patients in some First World countries are finding that insurance either does not cover orthopedic surgery (such as knee or hip replacement) or limits the choice of the facility, surgeon, or prosthetics to be used.

Popular medical travel worldwide destinations include: [[Canada]], [[Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patientsbeyondborders.com/medical-tourism-statistics-facts "Patient Beyond Borders, Medical Tourism Facts&amp;Statistics"] Retrieved July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular destinations for cosmetic surgery include: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Turkey]], [[Thailand]] and [[Ukraine]]. According to the "Sociedad Boliviana de Cirugia Plastica y Reconstructiva", more than 70% of middle and upper class women in the country have had some form of plastic surgery. Other destination countries include [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/medicaltourism.html "Medical tourism: Need surgery, will travel"] ''CBC News Online'', June 18, 2004. Retrieved September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people travel for [[assisted reproductive technology|assisted pregnancy]], such as [[in-vitro fertilization]], or [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogacy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones CA, Keith LG | year = 2006 | title = Medical tourism and reproductive outsourcing: the dawning of a new paradigm for healthcare | url = | journal = Int J Fertil Womens Med | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 251–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or freezing embryos for retro-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones C | year = 2007 | title = Ethical and legal conundrums of post-modern procreation | url = | journal = Int J Gynaecol Obstet | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, perceptions of medical tourism are not always positive. In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky. In some parts of the world, wider political issues can influence where medical tourists will choose to seek out health care.

[[Health tourism provider]]s have developed as intermediaries which unite potential medical tourists with provider hospitals and other organizations. Companies that focus on medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They may also help provide resources for follow-up care upon the patient's return.

Circumvention tourism is also an area of medical tourism that has grown. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical services that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country. This can include travel for fertility treatments that aren’t yet approved in the home country, abortion, and doctor-assisted suicide.&lt;ref name="Circumvention Tourism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Glenn|title=Circumvention Tourism|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=2012|volume=97|issue=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion tourism can be found most commonly in Europe, where travel between countries is relatively simple. Ireland and Poland, two European countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, have the highest rates of circumvention tourism. In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Matthew|title=Polish women encouraged to come to UK for 'free abortions' on NHS|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/7441990/Polish-women-encouraged-to-come-to-UK-for-free-abortions-on-NHS.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent draconian laws in order to access medical services. With Women on Waves, the organization uses a mobile clinic aboard a ship to provide medical abortions in international waters, where the law of the country whose flag is flown applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ship campaigns|url=http://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/2582/ship-campaigns|website=Women on Waves|publisher=Women on Waves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International healthcare accreditation==
{{Main article|International healthcare accreditation}}

International healthcare accreditation is the process of certifying a level of quality for healthcare providers and programs across multiple countries.  [[List of international healthcare accreditation organizations|International healthcare accreditation organizations]] certify a wide range of healthcare programs such as hospitals, primary care centers, medical transport, and ambulatory care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Joint Commission International Accreditation &amp; Certificationweb |url=http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/Accreditation-and-Certification-Process/ |publisher=Joint Commission International |accessdate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722144022/http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/Accreditation-and-Certification-Process/ |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of accreditation schemes available based in a number of different countries around the world.

The oldest international accrediting body is Accreditation Canada, formerly known as the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accreditation.ca/about-us/history/ |title=Accreditation Canada History |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accredited the Bermuda Hospital Board as soon as 1968.  Since then, it has accredited hospitals and health service organizations in ten other countries.

In the United States, the accreditation group [[Joint Commission International]] (JCI) was formed in 1994 to provide international clients education and consulting services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncamss.org/AnnualMtg2009/Dengler%20-%20Joint%20Commission%20History.pdf |title=A Journal Through the History of The Joint Commission| publisher=The Joint Commission|accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international hospitals today see obtaining international accreditation as a way to attract American patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicaltravelauthority.com/Medical-Tourism-Magazine-Issue-2.pdf "Medical Tourism Magazine"], Medical Tourism Association, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint Commission International is a relative of the Joint Commission in the United States. Both are US-style independent private sector not-for-profit organizations that develop nationally and internationally recognized procedures and standards to help improve patient care and safety. They work with hospitals to help them meet Joint Commission standards for patient care and then accredit those hospitals meeting the standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/AboutUs/Fact_Sheets/jci_facts.htm |title=Facts about Joint Commission International |publisher=Joint Commission |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A British scheme, QHA Trent Accreditation, is an active independent holistic accreditation scheme, as well as GCR.org which monitors the success metrics and standards of almost 500,000 medical clinics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-jECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA378&amp;lpg=PA378&amp;dq=qha+trent+accreditation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8ricfj9kTX&amp;sig=XkwHdDICTtAqvErlElztuanisfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9gomhwtXMAhUCKMAKHeLeDQc4ChDoAQhBMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=qha%20trent%20accreditation&amp;f=false|title=Handbook on Medical Tourism and Patient Mobility|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different international healthcare accreditation schemes vary in quality, size, cost, intent and the skill and intensity of their marketing. They also vary in terms of cost to hospitals and healthcare institutions making use of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126134030/http://www.imtjonline.com/news/india-accreditation-a-must "INDIA: Accreditation a must"], International Medical Travel Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, some hospitals are looking towards dual international accreditation, perhaps having both JCI to cover potential US clientele, and Accreditation Canada or QHA Trent. As a result of competition between clinics for American medical tourists, there have been initiatives to rank hospitals based on patient-reported metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhospitalmonitor.com |title=Home |publisher=World Hospital Monitor |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Medical tourism carries some risks that locally provided medical care either does not carry or carries to a much lesser degree.

Some countries, such as South Africa, or Thailand have very different infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. [[hepatitis A]], [[amoebic dysentery]], [[paratyphoid]]) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-transmitted diseases]], [[influenza]], and [[tuberculosis]]. However, because in poor tropical nations diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including [[HIV]], TB, and [[typhoid]], while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be "rare" in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lungil.org/il/copd/TBMisdiagnosed.asp|title=TB Often Misdiagnosed|publisher=American Lung Association of Illinois|accessdate=2007-03-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070301064539/http://www.lungil.org/il/copd/TBMisdiagnosed.asp |archivedate = March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. Also, traveling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights and decreased mobility associated with window seats can predispose one towards developing [[deep vein thrombosis]] and potentially a [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chestnet.org/accp/article/new-dvt-guidelines-no-evidence-support-economy-class-syndrome |title=New DVT Guidelines: No Evidence to Support "Economy Class Syndrome"; Oral Contraceptives, Sitting in a Window Seat, Advanced Age, and Pregnancy Increase DVT Risk in Long-distance Travelers |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=American College of Chest Physicians |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vacation activities can be problematic as well &amp;mdash; for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they are sunburned while healing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/prevention-wellness/staying-healthy/first-aid/caring-for-your-incision-after-surgery.html "Caring for Your Incision After Surgery"], FamilyDoctor.org, ''American Academy of Family Physicians'', December, 2010. Retrieved July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, health facilities treating medical tourists may lack an adequate complaints policy to deal appropriately and fairly with complaints made by dissatisfied patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pat.nhs.uk/downloads/ComplaintsleafletDec2011.pdf |title=Compliments, Comments, Concerns or Complaints |publisher=The Pennine Acute Hospitals |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognised by the [[World Health Organization]], and in 2004 it launched the [[World Alliance for Patient Safety]]. This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/en/ |title=World Alliance for Patient Safety |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are complications, the patient may need to stay in the foreign country for longer than planned or if they have returned home, will not have easy access for follow up care.&lt;ref name="Ginger Rough"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/06/07/20090607rxtourism0607.html?nclick_check=1#reply17699291|title=Globe-trotting to cut down on medical costs|last=Ginger Rough|date=June 7, 2009|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients sometimes travel to another country to obtain medical procedures that doctors in their home country refuse to perform because they believed that the risks of the procedure outweigh the benefits. Such patients may have difficulty getting insurance (whether public or private) to cover follow up medical costs should the feared complications indeed arise.

===Legal issues===
Receiving medical care abroad may subject medical tourists to unfamiliar legal issues.&lt;ref name="AHC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcpub.com/hot_topics/?htid=1&amp;httid=1874 |title=Medical Tourism: Ethical Pitfalls of Seeking Health Care Overseas |publisher=Ahcpub.com |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited nature of [[litigation]] in various countries is a reason for accessbility of care overseas. While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for [[medical malpractice]], these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. Should problems arise, patients might not be covered by adequate personal insurance or might be unable to seek compensation via [[malpractice]] lawsuits. Hospitals and/or doctors in some countries may be unable to pay the financial damages awarded by a court to a patient who has sued them, owing to the hospital and/or the doctor not possessing appropriate insurance cover and/or medical indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalprotection.org/uk |title=Medical Protection Society &amp;#124; MPS UK |publisher=Medicalprotection.org |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues can also arise for patients who seek out services that are illegal in their home country. In this case, some countries have the jurisdiction to prosecute their citizen once they have returned home, or in extreme cases extraterritorially arrest and prosecute.&lt;ref name="Circumvention Tourism"/&gt; In Ireland, especially, in the 1980s-90s there were cases of young rape victims who were banned from traveling to Europe to get legal abortions. Ultimately, Ireland’s Supreme Court overturned the ban; they and many other countries have since created "right to travel" amendments.&lt;ref name="Circumvention Tourism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spreng|first1=Jennifer|title=Abortion and Divorce Law in Ireland|date=2004|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0786416750|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical issues===
There can be major ethical issues around medical tourism.&lt;ref name="AHC"/&gt; For example, the illegal purchase of organs and tissues for transplantation had been methodically documented and studied in countries such as India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://future.iftf.org/2006/04/the_dark_side_o.html |title=IFTF's Future Now: The dark side of medical tourism |publisher=Future.iftf.org |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/09/MN23UPQ0K.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Organ-transplant black market thrives in India | first=Anuj | last=Chopra | date=February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-5-23/55627.html |title= Transplants and Ethics in San Francisco |publisher=The Epoch Times |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orgharv&gt;[[David Kilgour]], [[David Matas]] (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007)  [http://organharvestinvestigation.net An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China] (free in 22 languages)  organharvestinvestigation.net&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lee Mendoza Roger | year = 2010 | title = Colombia's organ trade: Evidence from Bogotá and Medellín | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10389-010-0320-3 | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1007/s10389-010-0320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roger Lee Mendoza|date=2010|title=Price deflation and the underground organ economy in the Philippines|journal=Oxford Journal of Public Health|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=101–107|url=http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1/101.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Declaration of Istanbul]] distinguishes between ethically problematic "transplant tourism" and "travel for transplantation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Participants in the International Summit on Transplant Tourism and Organ Trafficking convened by The Transplantation Society and International Society of Nephrology in Istanbul, Turkey, 30 April to 2 May 2008 | year = | title = The Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism | doi = 10.1038/ki.2008.388 | journal = Kidney International | volume = 74 | issue = 7| pages = 854–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical tourism may raise broader ethical issues for the countries in which it is promoted. For example, in India, some argue that a "policy of 'medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses' will lead to a deepening of the inequities" already embedded in the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/132ed042.html|title=Indian Journal of Medical Ethics|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, in 2008 it was stated that, "Doctors in Thailand have become so busy with foreigners that Thai patients are having trouble getting care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16735157 |title=Medical Tourism Creates Thai Doctor Shortage |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical tourism centered on new technologies, such as [[stem cell treatments]], is often criticized on grounds of fraud, blatant lack of scientific rationale and patient safety. However, when pioneering advanced technologies, such as providing 'unproven' therapies to patients outside of regular clinical trials, it is often challenging to differentiate between acceptable medical innovation and unacceptable patient exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Medical innovation versus stem cell tourism|date=2011-10-03 |pmid=19556497 | doi=10.1126/science.1171749 |volume=324 |journal=Science |pages=1664–5 |vauthors=Lindvall O, Hyun I }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isscr.org/clinical_trans/index.cfm ISSCR Guidelines for the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells. 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603085208/http://www.isscr.org/clinical_trans/index.cfm |date=June 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employer-sponsored health care in the US ==
Some US employers have begun exploring medical travel programs as a way to cut employee [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]].  Such proposals have raised stormy debates between employers and [[trade union]]s representing workers, with one union stating that it deplored the "shocking new approach" of offering employees overseas treatment in return for a share of the company's savings.  The unions also raise the issues of [[legal liability]] should something go wrong, and potential job losses in the US health care industry if treatment is [[outsourcing|outsourced]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/business/worldbusiness/11health.html Union Disrupts Plan to Send Ailing Workers to India for Cheaper Medical Care], [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers may offer incentives such as paying for air travel and waiving out-of-pocket expenses for care outside of the US. For example, in January 2008, Hannaford Bros., a supermarket chain based in Maine, began paying the entire medical bill for employees to travel to Singapore for hip and knee replacements, including travel for the patient and companion.&lt;ref&gt;McGinley, Laurie,

In 2000, Blue Shield of California began the United States' first cross-border health plan.

====Israel====
{{See also|Medical tourism in Israel}}
[[Healthcare in Israel|Israel]] is a popular destination for medical tourism.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/health-ministry-to-probe-israel-medical-tourism-industry-following-haaretz-expose-1.325424 Health Ministry to probe Israel medical tourism industry following Haaretz exposé], [[Haaretz]], Nov. 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many medical tourists to Israel come from Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union, as well as the United States, Australia, Cyprus, and South Africa. Medical tourists come to Israel for a variety of surgical procedures and therapies, including bone marrow transplants, heart surgery and catheterization, oncological and neurological treatments, orthopedic procedures, car accident rehabilitation, and [[in-vitro fertilization]]. Israel's popularity as a destination for medical tourism stems from its status as a developed country with a high-quality level of medical care, while at the same time having lower medical costs than many other developed countries. Israel is particularly popular as a destination for bone marrow transplants among Cypriots, as the procedure is not available in Cyprus, and for orthopedic procedures among Americans, as the cost of orthopedic procedures in Israel is about half that of in the United States. Israel is a particularly popular destination for people seeking IFV treatments. Medical tourists in Israel use both public and private hospitals, and all major Israeli hospitals offer medical tourism packages which typically cost far less than comparable procedures than in facilities elsewhere with a similarly high standard of care. In 2014, it was estimated that roughly 50,000 medical tourists came to Israel annually.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imtj.com/articles/update-medical-tourism-development-israel/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-ranks-as-a-top-medical-tourism-destination/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/health/1.631674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zendette.com/2015/04/14/medical-tourism-why-israel/&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports that these medical tourists obtain preferential treatment, to the detriment of local patients.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; In addition, some people come to Israel to visit health resorts at the [[Dead Sea]],&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; and on [[Lake Kinneret]].

United Arab Emirates, especially Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah is a popular destination for medical tourism. The Dubai Health authority has been spearheading medical tourism into UAE, especially Dubai. However, hospitals providing medical tourism are spread all over the seven emirates. UAE has the distinction of having the maximum number of JCI accredited hospitals (under various heads).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/about-jci/jci-accredited-organizations/?c=United%20Arab%20Emirates&lt;/ref&gt; UAE has inbound medical tourism as well as people going out for medical treatment. The inbound tourism usually is from African countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, etc. The outbound can be categorised into two segments - the local population (citizens of UAE) and the expats. The locals prefer to go to European destinations like the U.K., Germany etc. The expats prefer to go back to their home countries for treatment.

Medical tourism is a large and growing sector within Thailand's extensive tourism and healthcare industries. The country is attractive to potential medical tourists and international patients for a number of important reasons: Thailand was the first Asian country to achieve [[Joint Commission International]] (JCI) accreditation in 2002. As of April 2014, 35 hospitals were JCI-accredited.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare System and Quality in Thailand|url=http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/thailand/article/40/healthcare-system-quality-in-thailand#.Uihbr9JATHR|website=MyMEDHoliday.com|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; experienced, often Western-trained, medical professionals; the latest medical technology; and significantly lower costs of treatment when compared to corresponding procedures in the West. Taken together, all these factors—plus the country’s reputation as a popular tourist destination—have made Thailand one of the world's most popular medical tourism destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries that are Considered Top Medical Tourism Destinations in the World|url=http://www.mymedholiday.com/article-info/50/149/countries-that-are-considered-top-medical-tourism-destinations-in-the-world#.UihbfdJATHR|website=MyMedHoliday.com|publisher=MyMEDHoliday.com|accessdate=27 September 2013|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of Chinese tourism in Thailand, growing 31 percent per year since 2012, has lifted medical tourism in Thailand and throughout [[ASEAN]]. Of the 8.7 Chinese tourists who visited Thailand in 2016, some 27,000 came for medical treatment. Numbers are expected to grow by 8 to 10 percent by 2023. Also popular among Chinese patients are Malaysia and Singapore, largely owing to the large numbers of Chinese speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Luythong |first1=Chettayakhom |title=Healthy Outlook |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1500214/healthy-outlook |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

In 2006, it was ruled that under the conditions of the E112 European health scheme, UK health authorities had to pay the bill if one of their patients could establish urgent medical reasons for seeking quicker treatment in another European union country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thompsons.law.co.uk/clinical-negligence/nhs-waiting-lists-targets.htm |title=NHS Waiting lists: targets and England&amp;Wales comparison |publisher=Thompsons.law.co.uk |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European directive on the application of patients’ rights to cross-border healthcare was agreed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====

This service will be available sometime early year 2014. Volunteer doctors of Global Clinic have tried to help these people, for whom only acute care has been available. This means that the [[Healthcare in Finland|Finnish health care system]] is open for all people coming outside of the European Union. The service covers special child health care, maternity clinics and specialist medical care etc. practically for free. It is still unclear if this will increase so called health care tourism, because all you have to do is come to Helsinki as a tourist and let the visa expire.

The Global Clinic in Turku offers health care for all undocumented immigrants for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/turku_clinic_offers_health_care_for_undocumented_immigrants/6592725 |title=Turku clinic offers health care for undocumented immigrants |accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
The cost of medical treatments in [[Health care in Turkey|Turkey]] is quite affordable compared to Western European countries. Therefore, thousands of people each year travel Turkey for their medical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishhealthcaretravelcouncil.org/|title=THTC - Turkish Healthcare Travel Council|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey is especially becoming a hub for hair transplant surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-05-10/turkeys-thriving-business-in-hair-beard-and-mustache-implants|title=Turkey's Thriving Business in Hair, Beard, and Mustache Implants|author=Sarah A.

====United Kingdom====

The [[National Health Service]] is publicly owned. It attracts medical tourism principally to specialist centres in London. Some private hospitals and clinics in the United Kingdom are medical tourism destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imtj.com/articles/2009/the-forgotten-medical-tourism-destination-30026/?locale=en|title=The forgotten medical tourism destination|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imtj.com/news/?EntryId82=285641 |title=UK: New London agency could promote medical tourism |date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few UK private hospitals have gone through independent international accreditation (they have the mandatory registration with the UK's watchdog, the [[Care Quality Commission]]), so they have not as yet measured themselves against the best clinics and hospitals elsewhere in the world.

It is alleged that health tourists in the UK often target the NHS for its free-at-the-point-of-care treatment, allegedly costing the NHS up to £200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://fullfact.org/health/costs_health_tourism-37227|title= Health tourists: How much do they cost and who pays? - Full Fact|date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in 2013 concluded that the UK was a net exporter of medical tourists, with 63,000 UK residents travelling abroad for treatment and about 52,000 patients getting treatment in UK.  Medical tourists treated as private patients by NHS trusts are more profitable than UK private patients, yielding close to a quarter of the revenue from only 7% of volume of cases.  UK dental patients largely go to Hungary and Poland. Fertility tourists mostly travel to Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannefeld|first1=Johanna|last2=Horsfall|first2=Daniel|last3=Lunt|first3=Neil|last4=Smith|first4=Richard|title=Medical Tourism: A Cost or Benefit to the NHS?|journal=PLOS One|date=24 October 2013|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070406|accessdate=29 March 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070406|volume=8|pages=e70406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2015 immigration officers from the [[Border Force]] were stationed in [[St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]] to train staff to identify "potentially chargeable patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immigration officers at London trust for patient charging pilot|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/news/health/social-care/immigration-officers-at-london-trust-for-patient-charging-pilot/5087970.article|accessdate=24 September 2015|publisher=Local Government Chronicle|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2016 the trust announced that it planned to require photo identity papers or proof of their right to remain in the UK such as asylum status or a visa for pregnant women. Those not able to provide satisfactory documents would be sent to the trust's overseas patient team "for specialist document screening, in liaison with the [[UK Border Agency]] and the Home Office.”  It was estimated that £4.6 million a year was spent on care for ineligible patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pregnant women could need photo ID to get maternity care as St George's Hospital in Tooting cracks down on NHS tourism|url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/14794980.Pregnant_women_could_need_photo_ID_to_get_maternity_care_at_hospital/|accessdate=29 October 2016|publisher=Richmond and Twickenham Times|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot scheme to check whether patients were entitled to free NHS care in 18 [[NHS trusts]],  11 in London, for two months in 2017 asked 8,894 people for two forms of ID prior to non-emergency care. Only 50 were not eligible for free NHS treatment. Campaigners claimed this was “part of the Government’s hostile environment policy”, and that in [[Newham University Hospital|Newham hospital]] "you will see huge signs saying you may not be eligible for free NHS treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=8,900 checks on NHS ‘health tourists’ find just 50 liable to pay|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/8900-checks-on-nhs-health-tourists-find-just-50-liable-to-pay-a3850121.html|accessdate=30 May 2018|publisher=Evening Standard|date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sequel, God asks the help of 11-year-old Tracy Richards (Louanne Sirota) to help promote Himself.

God is the only one that can straighten out the situation. One of the memorable scenes showed God riding a motorcycle, with Tracy riding in the sidecar, where there were scenes that showed nobody on the motorcycle, which baffled the two policemen.

Pinglak is a lion in the story.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3ulD4Izy6QIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=pinglak+in+panchatantra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iyt3ZhfWjB&amp;sig=pUGtBmCV9VcpvXSentVWX7Hb3-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pinglak%20in%20panchatantra&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanjeewak]] was a bull who, because of his incapability’s and illness was discarded by his master and was left alone in a jungle, where he sat on the bank of Yamuna river and grew stronger. Once, the king of the jungle, the lion named Pinglak came near the bank of river to quench his thirst, but when he listened to the threatening sound of Sanjeewak, he hidden himself under a tree. The lion had two cunning jackal ministers named [[Karkat, Panchtantra|Karkat]] and [[Damnak]]. When they saw lion threatened, Damnak went to Sanjeewak and somehow managed to bring friendship between Pinglak and Sanjeewak. The lion indulged so deeply in the friendship that he left his entire kingship. When all the animals in the jungle felt unsecured due to this, then the jackals again managed to create differences between Pinglak and Sanjeewak. And finally in a fight between the lion and the bull, the bull gets killed. These characters are in story of * ''[[Mitra-bheda]]'': The Separation of Friends (The Lion and the Bull) is one of the five books. Its original Indian version is as under;-
; ''Mitra-bheda'', The Separation of Friends, In the first story, a friendship arises between the lion Piṅgalaka, the king of the forest, and Sañjīvaka, a bull. Karataka ('Horribly Howling') and Damanaka ('Victor') are two jackals that are retainers to the lion king.  Against Karataka's advice, Damanaka breaks up the friendship between the lion and the bull out of jealousy. This book contains around thirty stories, mostly told by the two jackals.  It is the longest of the five books, making up roughly 45% of the work's length.&lt;ref name=Olivelle23&gt;{{Harvnb|Olivelle|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prize for Military History''' (''Förderpreis für Militärgeschichte und Militärtechnikgeschichte'') is an award recognising achievements in the fields of military history and history of military technology. The prize is bestowed by the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German Ministry of Defence]] every two years.

==History==
From 1992 to 2012, the prize was awarded under the name '''Werner Hahlweg Prize'''. From 1969 until his retirement in 1978, the German historian {{illm|Werner Hahlweg|de|Werner Hahlweg}} (1912–1989) held a professorship in Military History and Military Sciences at the [[University of Münster]]. In his will, he bequeathed funds to go towards a science award for military history. The prize was administered by the Federal Office of Defense Technology and Procurement in Koblenz (now [[Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support]], part of the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German Ministry of Defence]]). After it had become known in 2012 that the prize's namesake, Hahlweg, had joined the [[SS]] in June 1933 and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1936, the Ministry of Defence decided to suspend the prize. It was reinstituted in 2017 under a new name and continues to be awarded every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal-militaergeschichte.de/neitzel_foerderpreis Interview mit Prof. Dr. Sönke Neitzel zur Umbenennung des Werner-Hahlweg-Preises in „Förderpreis für Militärgeschichte und Militärtechnikgeschichte“], [[Military History Working Group]], May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory board==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">The '''[[Robert Byrd|Robert C. Byrd]] Honors Scholarship Program''' was a federally funded and state-administered [[Merit-based financial aid|merit-based]] scholarship program in the United States.

== Program History ==
It was designed to recognize exceptionally able high school seniors who showed promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education. The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Office of Postsecondary Education]] awarded funds to state education agencies, which awarded [[scholarships]] (also known as '''Byrd Honors Scholarships''') to eligible applicants. Students received scholarship funds which were to go towards [[college]] expenses.

=== Funding ===
The Byrd Honors Scholarships were established in 1985, providing $1,500 nonrenewable scholarships to eligible students. In 1993, the program was expanded to allow students who successfully completed their first year of college to reapply for stipends for the following three years. This brought the scholarship to its final value of $6,000 over four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html Byrd.senate.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031004216/http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html |date=2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To pay for the over 27,000 scholars supported by the program, appropriations for the program were nearly $40,000,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/gtepiduesbyrd.pdf Ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the scholarship was eliminated for the 2011-2012 school year. As a result, new awards are not being given for that year, and payments for returning students will not be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hesc.com/content.nsf/SFC/Robert_C_Byrd_Honors_Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application Requirements ==
Each state set the criteria for awarding the Byrd Honors Scholarships in addition to federal requirements. In any case, all applicants were to be high school graduates who:
* had been accepted for enrollment at institutions of higher education(IHEs) in the United States;
* had demonstrated outstanding academic achievement;
* and who showed promise of continued academic excellence.

'''''Skull Fang''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Skull Fang: Kuuga Gaiden'''''|スカルファング ～空牙外伝～}} is a [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] vertical-scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Data East]]. ''Skull Fang'' is the third and final entry in a loose trilogy of games beginning with the 1989 ''[[Vapor Trail: Hyper Offence Formation|Vapor Trail]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Skull Fang'' is similar to the series' first ''Vapor Trail''. Players choose one of four jets set among the flying aircraft carrier Skull Fang, as well as a pilot to fly the jet and attack enemy squadrons and battalions worldwide.

===Jets===
*'''F/AV-1B Silph II, US Navy''' - A jet with average speed and strength. Its special attack consists of an impenetrable shield that can allow the jet to [[Kamikaze]] into other vehicles.
*'''AV-02A Mega-Valkyrie, US Army''' - A jet-plane with slow speed and maneuverability, but good strength. It carries a large bomb that can clear the screen of most enemies.
*'''FV-03C Seylen-Ex''' - The fastest jet in the line-up, though the weakest. It has guns mounted near its tail allowing it to fire in two directions.
*'''BV-04 SIF, Sub-Space Development''' - A recently developed space-jet with the best handling over the others.

===Pilots===
*'''Hawk''' - A hot-headed and moody male fighter pilot.
*'''Raven''' - A caucasian, smooth-talking and unusually calm male bomber pilot.
*'''Sparrow''' - An easy-going and somewhat cheerful, English speaking female fighter pilot.
*'''Crane''' - A diligent and patriotic Japanese female [[Ganguro]] bomber pilot.

===Weapons===
The weapon pick-ups include the following.

*'''Vulcan''' - Standard-automatic firing machine gun that fires straight forward in a hail of bullets, but can also fire backwards (depending on the jet selected). Covers a wide range of fire, but is significantly weak.
*'''Cluster shot''' - A weapon consisting of green circulating shots that proffer a 'shot-gun effect' type of fire in that it spreads the further it travels.
*'''Missiles''' - Multiple homing missiles that fire from six different directions on the jet.
*'''Laser gun''' - A dual, straight firing laser weapon that increases in strength with upgrades, but does not cover a wide range of fire.

Players also can pick up a weapon attachment that increases weapon strength and ability depending on the jet known as the S-Unit. The S-Unit can charge its strength and ultimately change its attack pattern when the players use the manual five-speed option whereupon reaching the jet's highest gear, the weapon will temporarily change to a homing weapon known as H-Unit mode. However, the S-Unit attachment can be removed and thus detonated once players hit the Bomb button.

==Plot==
Seven years have passed since the events of ''[[Rohga: Armor Force]]'' in 2001, where the militant/terrorist organization Ragnarok was quelled. Though [[Oceania]] and the United States were successful in their efforts, a significant number of mechs had secretly escaped destruction and after the seven years of silence finally reappear. The strongest of the mechs appears and begins decimating American cities at random, signifying the Ragnarok's latest assault on society.

During those seven years however, an air force unit based on the success of Operation Vapor Trail had been assembled; known as the Skull Fang squadron, the unit was founded in case the organization ever re-appeared. Consisting of four talented pilots whose personal backgrounds and information are withheld from each other, the team is sent to deal with the latest threat and to protect the terrorist's suspected target, the headquarters that house their unit leaders.

==Ports and related releases==
''Skull Fang'' was later ported by both Data East and Aisystem Tokyo to the [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997. This port adds several new features, such as a trial mode, a boss rush mode, a tutorial video and an additional speed mode which has two settings rather than five. Occasionally, the sprites suffer from flickering. Some arranged versions of songs from ''Vapor Trail'' are also included in the game disc as [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|redbook audio]].

On February 26, 1996, [[Pony Canyon]] and [[Scitron Label]] added the arcade version's [[background music]] of ''Skull Fang'' with the background music of another Data East MLC System title, ''[[Avengers in Galactic Storm]]'', both into an album titled ''Skull Fang / Avengers in Galactic Storm'', which was released exclusively in Japan. This version also includes two exclusive arranged versions of the songs "Skull Fang" (Stage 1 theme) and "Over Boost" (Stage 2 Boss theme). On July 21, 2010, [[TEAM Entertainment]] added the background music of the arcade version with the background music of the first two ''Kuuga'' games, plus three other Data East shooting games (''[[Darwin 4078]]'', ''[[SRD: Super Real Darwin]]'', and ''[[Act-Fancer: Cybernetick Hyper Weapon]]''), into one album titled ''Data East Retro Game Music Collection'', which was distributed exclusively in Japan by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music Distribution]].

==Reception==
A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewer, while acknowledging that the chase mode and back and side thrusts are variations in the shooter formula, concluded ''Skull Fang'' to be "a shooter in the most generic sense." He scored the arcade version two out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Skull Fang|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on the Saturn port, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' called ''Skull Fang'' "a classic example of over hyped nonsense", and explained that "With two players on screen at once, multiple power-ups and even an original arcade mode (requiring you to turn your TV on its side, [[Raiden (series)|Raiden]]-style), ''Skull Fang'' begins to sound fairly impressive. However ... appaling slowdown, unimpressive power-ups and nagging pauses during gameplay are all good reasons for Saturn owners to steer well clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Introducing... Skull Fang |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=22|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=August 1997|page=98 |url= https://archive.org/stream/Official_Sega_Saturn_Magazine_022/Official_Sega_Saturn_Magazine_022_-_august_1997_UK#page/n98/mode/2up |accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stephen Hawking 050506.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stephen Hawking]], late astrophysicist and prominent SGD user]]
'''Speech-generating devices''' ('''SGDs'''), also known as '''voice output communication aids''', are electronic [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) systems used to supplement or replace speech or writing for individuals with severe [[speech impairment]]s, enabling them to verbally communicate.&lt;ref name=aetna&gt;[[#aetna|Aetna Inc. (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt; SGDs are important for people who have limited means of interacting verbally, as they allow individuals to become active participants in communication interactions. They are particularly helpful for patients suffering from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS)  but recently have been used for children with predicted speech deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#blischak|Blischak et al (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several input and display methods for users of varying abilities to make use of SGDs. Some SGDs have multiple pages of symbols to accommodate a large number of utterances, and thus only a portion of the symbols available are visible at any one time, with the communicator navigating the various pages. Speech-generating devices can produce electronic voice output by using [[Digital data|digitized recordings]] of natural speech or through [[speech synthesis]]—which may carry less emotional information but can permit the user to speak novel messages.&lt;ref name=glennen&gt;[[#glennen|Glennen &amp; Decoste]] pp. 88–90&lt;/ref&gt;

The content, organization, and updating of the vocabulary on an SGD is influenced by a number of factors, such at the user's needs and the contexts that the device will be used in.&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"/&gt; The development of techniques to improve the available vocabulary and rate of speech production is an active research area. Vocabulary items should be of high interest to the user, be frequently applicable, have a range of meanings, and be pragmatic in functionality.&lt;ref name="MusselwhiteLouis1988" /&gt;

There are multiple methods of accessing messages on devices: directly or indirectly, or using specialized access devices—although the specific access method will depend on the skills and abilities of the user.&lt;ref name=aetna/&gt; SGD output is typically much slower than speech, although [[Augmentative and alternative communication#Rate enhancement strategies|rate enhancement strategies]] can increase the user's rate of output, resulting in enhanced efficiency of communication.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"/&gt;

The first known SGD was prototyped in the mid-1970s, and rapid progress in [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] development has meant that SGD capabilities can now be integrated into devices like [[smartphones]]. Notable users of SGDs include [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Roger Ebert]], [[Tony Proudfoot]], and [[Pete Frates]] (founder of the ALS ice bucket challenge).

Speech-generating systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated devices such as computers running additional software to allow them to function as AAC devices.&lt;ref name="GlennenDeCoste62"&gt;[[#Glennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jansclark1998&gt;[[#JansClark|Jans &amp; Clark (1998)]], pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Patient Operated Selector Mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|The patient-operated selector mechanism (POSM or POSSUM), was developed in the early 1960s]]
SGDs have their roots in early electronic communication aids. The first such aid was a [[sip-and-puff]] typewriter controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960.&lt;ref name = "vanD"&gt;[[#Vanderheide|Vanderheide (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zangari"&gt;[[#Zangari|Zangari (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; POSSUM [[Switch access scanning|scanned]] through a set of symbols on an illuminated display.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt; Researchers at [[Delft University]] in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of light at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.&lt;ref name="StassenSheridan1997"&gt;[[#Stassen|Stassen et al.]], p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Barry Romich, a freshman engineering student at Case Western Reserve University, and Ed Prentke, an engineer at Highland View Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio formed a partnership, creating the Prentke Romich Company.&lt;ref name="PRC"&gt;[https://www.prentrom.com/about-us/our-history PRC History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the company produced its first communication device, a typing system based on a discarded Teletype machine.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, several other companies began to emerge that have since become prominent manufacturers of SGDs. [[Toby Churchill]] founded Toby Churchill Ltd in 1973, after losing his speech following encephalitis.&lt;ref name=toby&gt;[[#toby|Toby Churchill (About Us)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[Dynavox]] (then known as Sentient Systems Technology) grew out of a student project at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], created in 1982 to help a young woman with [[cerebral palsy]] to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dynavox|Dynavox (Company History)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size and price. Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented to the user sequentially, became available on communication devices.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hourcade2004"&gt;[[#Hourcade2004|Hourcade (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

Rapid progress in [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] development continued, including projects funded by the [[European Community]].  The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of [[Augmentative and alternative communication#Low-tech|communication boards]].&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; High-tech devices have continued to become smaller and lighter,&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; while increasing accessibility and capability; communication devices can be accessed using [[Eye tracking|eye-tracking systems]], perform as a computer for [[word-processing]] and Internet use, and as an [[environmental control device]] for independent access to other equipment such as TV, radio and telephones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robitaille|Robitaille]], pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable individuals who have used AAC devices include [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref name="ChicagoSunTimes"&gt;[[#ebert|Chicago Sun-Times, (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Proudfoot]], and Pete Frates. Hawking was unable to speak due to a combination of severe disabilities caused by [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], and an emergency [[tracheotomy]]. He has come to be associated with the unique voice of his particular synthesis equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#hawking|Stephen Hawking and ALS]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 20 or so years SGD have gained popularity amongst young children with speech deficiencies, such as autism, Down syndrome, and predicted brain damage due to surgery.

Starting in the early 2000s, specialist saw the benefit of using SGDs not only for adults but for children, as well. Neuro-linguists found that SGDs were just as effective in helping children who were at risk for temporary language deficits after undergoing brain surgery as it is for patients with ALS. In particular, digitized SGDs have been used as communication aids for pediatric patients during the recovery process.

==Access methods==
{{See also|Switch access scanning}}
There are many methods of accessing messages on devices: directly, indirectly, and with specialized access devices. Direct access methods involve physical contact with the system, by using a keyboard or a touch screen. Users accessing SGDs indirectly and through specialized devices must manipulate an object in order to access the system, such as maneuvering a [[joystick]], head mouse, optical head pointer, light pointer, infrared pointer, or [[switch access scanning|switch access scanner]].&lt;ref name=aetna/&gt;

The specific access method will depend on the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[joystick#Assistive technology|joystick]], or eye tracking could be used,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mathy2000|Mathy (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[switch access scanning]] is often used for indirect selection.&lt;ref name=jansclark1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#glennen|Glennen &amp; Decoste]] pp 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice.&lt;ref name =bm97 /&gt; Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.&lt;ref name =bm97&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 97–101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Message construction==
[[File:Dasher.png|thumb|right| A screenshot of the [[Dasher (software)|Dasher]] rate enhancement program]]
Augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech,&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"&gt;[[#washington|University of Washington (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; with users generally producing 8–10 words per minute.&lt;ref name ="hig"&gt;[[#HigginbothamEtal|Higginbotham et al (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output to around 12–15 words per minute,&lt;ref name="hig" /&gt; and as a result enhance the efficiency of communication.

In any given SGD there may be a large number of vocal expressions that facilitate efficient and effective communication, including greetings, expressing desires, and asking questions.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some SGDs have multiple pages of [[Picture communication symbols|symbols]] to accommodate a large number of vocal expressions, and thus only a portion of the symbols available are visible at any one time, with the communicator navigating the various pages.&lt;ref name="hoch1"&gt;[[#Hochstein2004|Hochstein et al (2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Speech-generating devices generally display a set of selections either using a dynamically changing screen, or a fixed display.&lt;ref name=beu84 /&gt;

There are two main options for increasing the rate of communication for an SGD: encoding and prediction.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"/&gt;

Encoding permits a user to produce a word, sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their SGD.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement" /&gt; Iconic encoding strategies such as [[Semantic compaction]] combine sequences of icons (picture symbols) to produce words or phrases.&lt;ref name=venkatagiri&gt;[[#venkatagiri|Venkatagiri (1995)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In numeric, alpha-numeric, and letter encoding (also known as Abbreviation-Expansion), words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing "HH" or "G1" (for Greeting 1) may retrieve "Hello, how are you?".&lt;ref name="venkatagiri" /&gt;

Prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the SGD attempts to reduce the number of keystrokes used by predicting the word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the entire word. [[Word prediction]] software may determine the choices to be offered based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venkatagiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="types of aac devices"&gt;[[#types|Augmentative Communication, Incorporated]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, users have been shown to produce more words per minute (using a scanning interface) with a static keyboard layout than with a predictive grid layout, suggesting that the cognitive overhead of reviewing a new arrangement cancels out the benefits of the predictive layout when using a scanning interface.&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;[[#Johansen2003|Johansen et al (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems, such as Auditory Sciences' Interact-Voice device, combine Encoding and Prediction into the same system. For example, typing "HMF" can be an encoded shortcut for "Can you help me find ____" and then the prediction capabilities help the user complete the sentence, such as "Can you help me find my glasses?" or "Can you help me find my car keys?".

Another approach to rate-enhancement is [[Dasher (software)|Dasher]],&lt;ref name="dasher"&gt;[[#ward|Ward et al (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses language models and [[arithmetic coding]] to present alternative letter targets on the screen with size relative to their likelihood given the history.&lt;ref name="roark"&gt;[[#roark|Roark et al (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacKay2003|MacKey (2003)]], p 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of words produced can depend greatly on the conceptual level of the system: the TALK system, which allows users to choose between large numbers of sentence-level utterances, demonstrated output rates in excess of 60 wpm.&lt;ref name=tod&gt;[[#tod|Todman (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed and dynamic display devices==

===Fixed display devices===
[[File:gotalk.jpg|left|thumb|150px| A speech-generation device with a fixed display]]
Fixed display devices refer to those in which the symbols and items are "fixed" in a particular format; some sources refer to these as "static" displays.&lt;ref name="hoch"&gt;[[#hoch2|Hochstein et al (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such display devices have a simpler learning curve than some other devices.

Fixed display devices replicate the typical arrangement of low-tech AAC devices (low-tech is defined as those devices that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics), like [[Augmentative and alternative communication#Low-tech|communication boards]].  They share some of disadvantages; for example they are typically restricted to a limited number of symbols and hence messages.&lt;ref name=beu84&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]] p. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that with technological advances made in the twenty-first century, fixed-display SGDs are not commonly used anymore.

===Dynamic display devices===
Dynamic displays devices are usually also [[touchscreen]] devices. They typically generate electronically produced visual symbols that, when pressed, change the set of selections that is displayed. The user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages. 
[[File:minimo.jpg|right|thumb| A speech-generating device with dynamic display, capable of outputting both synthesized and digitized speech]]
The "home" page of a dynamic display device may show symbols related to many different contexts or conversational topics.  Pressing any one of these symbols may open a different screen with messages related to that topic.&lt;ref name=beu84 /&gt; For example, when watching a volleyball game, a user may press the "sport" symbol to open a page with messages relating to sport, then press the symbol showing a scoreboard to utter the phrase "What's the score?".

Advantages of dynamic display devices include the availability of a much larger vocabulary, and the ability to see the sentence under construction&lt;ref name=bm /&gt;  A further advantage of dynamic display devices is that the underlying operating system is capable of providing options for multiple communication channels, including [[Mobile phone|cell phone]], [[Short message service|text messaging]] and e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dynavoxurl|Dynavox at www.speechbubble.org.uk]]&lt;/ref&gt; Work by [[Linköping University]] has shown that such email writing practices allowed children who were SGD users to develop new social skills and increase their social participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sundqvist|Sundqvist &amp; Rönnberg (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talking Keyboards===
[[File:TextSpeak-AAC-Speech-Talking-Keyboard.png|thumb|Keyboard used to create speech over a telephone using a Text to Speech converter.]]Low cost systems can also include a keyboard and audio speaker combination without a dynamic display or visual screen.  This type of keyboard sends typed text direct to an audio speaker. It can permit any phrase to be spoken without the need for a visual screen that is not always required. One simple benefit is that a talking keyboard, when used with a standard telephone or speakerphone can enable a voice impaired individual have 2 way conversation over a telephone.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Output==
The output of a SGD may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded words or phrases while [[speech synthesis|synthesized speech]] uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits the user to speak novel messages by typing new words.&lt;ref name="schlosserblischakkoul"&gt;[[#SchlosserBlischakKoul|Schlosser, Blischak &amp; Koul (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beu /&gt; Today, individuals use a combination of recorded messages and text-to-speech techniques on their SGDs.&lt;ref name=beu&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]] p. 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; However, some devices are limited to only one type of output.

===Digitized speech===
[[File:cheaptalk and switch.jpg|right|thumb| Simple switch-operated speech-generating device]]

Words, phrases or entire messages can be digitised and stored onto the device for playback to be activated by the user.&lt;ref name=aetna/&gt; This process is formally known as Voice Banking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advantages of recorded speech include that it (a) provides natural [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and speech naturalness for the listener&lt;ref name=glennen/&gt; (e.g., person of the same age and gender as the AAC user can be selected to record the messages),&lt;ref name=glennen/&gt; and (b) it provides for additional sounds that may be important for the user such as laughing or whistling. Moreover, Digitized SGDs is that they provide a degree of normalcy both for the patient and for their families when they lose their ability to speak on their own.

A major disadvantage of using only recorded speech is that users are unable to produce novel messages; they are limited to the messages pre-recorded into the device.&lt;ref name=glennen/&gt;&lt;ref name= radom/&gt;  Depending on the device, there may be a limit to the length of the recordings.&lt;ref name=glennen/&gt;&lt;ref name= radom&gt;[[#radom|Radomski et al (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesized speech===
SGDs that use synthesized speech apply the [[phonetic]] rules of the language to translate the user’s message into voice output ([[speech synthesis]]).&lt;ref name=aetna/&gt;&lt;ref name=beu/&gt; Users have the freedom to create novel words and messages and are not limited to those that have been pre-recorded on their device by others.&lt;ref name=beu/&gt;

Smartphones and computers have increased the use of synthesized speech devices through the creation of apps that allow the user to select from a list of phrases or messages to be spoken in the voice and language that the user has chosen. Apps such as SpeakIt! or Assistive Express for iPhone provide a cheap way to use a speech-generating device without having to visit a doctor's office or learn to use specialized machinery.

Synthesized SGDs may allow multiple methods of message creation that can be used individually or in combination: messages can be created from letters, words, phrases, sentences, pictures, or symbols.&lt;ref name=aetna/&gt;&lt;ref name= radom/&gt; With synthesized speech there is virtually unlimited storage capacity for messages with few demands on memory space.&lt;ref name=glennen/&gt;

Synthesized speech engines are available in many languages,&lt;ref name=beu/&gt;&lt;ref name= radom/&gt; and the engine's parameters, such as speech rate, pitch range, gender, stress patterns, pauses, and pronunciation exceptions can be manipulated by the user.&lt;ref name= radom/&gt;

== Programming ==
[[File:dynawrite.jpg|left|thumb|Keyboard text-to-speech generating device]]

==Selection set and vocabulary==
The selection set of a SGD is the set of all messages, symbols and codes that are available to a person using that device.&lt;ref name=beu83&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda83|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]] p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The content, organisation, and updating of this selection set are areas of active research and are influenced by a number of factors, including the user's ability, interests and age.&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; The selection set for an AAC system may include words that the user does not know yet – they are included for the user to "grow into".&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2" /&gt; The content installed on any given SGD may include a large number of preset pages provided by the manufacturer, with a number of additional pages produced by the user or the user's care team depending on the user's needs and the contexts that the device will be used in.&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"/&gt;

===Initial content selection===
Researchers Beukelman and Mirenda list a number of possible sources (such as family members, friends, teachers, and care staff) for the selection of initial content for a SGD.  A range of sources is required because, in general, one individual would not have the knowledge and experience to generate all the vocal expressions needed in any given environment.&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"/&gt; For example, parents and therapists might not think to add slang terms, such as "[[wikt:innit|innit]]".&lt;ref name="Articlewickendenwhose"&gt;@article{wickenden2011whose,
  title={Whose Voice is That?: Issues of Identity, Voice and Representation Arising in an Ethnographic Study of the Lives of Disabled Teenagers who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)},
  author={Wickenden, M.},
  journal={Disability Studies Quarterly},
  volume={31},
  number={4},
  year={2011}
}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous work has analyzed both vocabulary use of typically developing speakers and word use of AAC users to generate content for new AAC devices.  Such processes work well for generating a core set of utterances or vocal expressions but are less effective in situations where a particular vocabulary is needed (for example, terms related directly to a user's interest in horse riding).  The term "fringe vocabulary" refers to vocabulary that is specific or unique to the individual's personal interests or needs.  A typical technique to develop fringe vocabulary for a device is to conduct interviews with multiple "informants": siblings, parents, teachers, co-workers and other involved persons.&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"/&gt;

Other researchers, such as Musselwhite and St. Louis suggest that initial vocabulary items should be of high interest to the user, be frequently applicable, have a range of meanings and be pragmatic in functionality.&lt;ref name="MusselwhiteLouis1988"&gt;[[#MusselwhiteLouis1988|Musselwhite &amp; Louis]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These criteria have been widely used in the AAC field as an ecological check of SGD content.&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"/&gt;

===Automatic content maintenance===
[[File:CustomAAC.jpg|right|thumb|AAC user with custom-built device]]
Beukelman and Mirenda emphasize that vocabulary selection also involves ongoing vocabulary maintenance;&lt;ref name="Beukelman2005Chap2"/&gt; however, a difficulty in AAC is that users or their carers must program in any new utterances manually (e.g. names of new friends or personal stories) and there are no existing commercial solutions for automatically adding content.&lt;ref name="hig" /&gt; A number of research approaches have attempted to overcome this difficulty,&lt;ref name="red" /&gt; these range from "inferred input", such as generating content based on a log of conversation with a user's friends and family,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ashraf|Ashraf et al. (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; to data mined from the Internet to find language materials, such as the Webcrawler Project.&lt;ref name="webcrawler"&gt;[[#Luowebcrawler|Luo et al (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by making use of [[Lifelog]]ging based approaches, a device's content can be changed based on events that occur to a user during their day.&lt;ref name="red"&gt;[[#red|Reddington &amp; Tintarev (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black"&gt;[[#black|Black et al (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt; By accessing more of a user's data, more high-quality messages can be generated at a risk of exposing sensitive user data.&lt;ref name="red"/&gt; For example, by making use of [[global positioning systems]], a device's content can be changed based on geographical location.&lt;ref name="gps"&gt;[[#Dominowskagps|Dominowska et al]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#patel|Patel &amp; Radhakrishnan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical concerns===
Many recently developed SGDs include [[Computer data logging|performance measurement and analysis tools]] to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about [[privacy]], and some argue that the device user should be involved in the decision to monitor use in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blackstone|Blackstone et al. (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation,&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs.&lt;ref name="Articlewickendenwhose" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rack|Rackensperger et al. (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of [[Personal information management|personal data management]] problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Redding|Reddington &amp; Coles-Kemp (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices is usually done by augmentative communication specialists. Specialists are required to cater to the needs of the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ phrases they want. For example, patients use different phrases based on their age, disability, interests, etc. Therefore, content organization is extremely time consuming. Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children’s Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations to keep these program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">[[File:Swansons-law.svg|thumb|Swanson's law, the [[learning curve]] of [[photovoltaics]]]]

'''Swanson's law''' is the observation that the price of solar [[photovoltaic module]]s tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume.

'''Terror''', is from the [[French (language)|French]] ''terreur'', from [[Latin]] ''terror'' meaning "great fear", a noun derived from the [[Latin verbs|Latin verb]] [[wiktionary:terrere|''terrere'']] meaning "to frighten",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|terror}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a policy of [[political repression]] and [[political violence|violence]] intended to subdue political opposition.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern instances of terror include [[Red Terror (disambiguation)|red terror]] or [[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]].

Before the late twentieth century, the term ''"terrorism"'' in the English language was often used interchangeably with "''terror''." Some contemporary writers use terrorism to refer to acts by groups with a limited political base or parties on the weaker side in [[asymmetric warfare]] and terror to acts by governments and [[law enforcement]] officials, usually within the legal framework of the state. Others consider state terror to be a specific type of terrorism.

==Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary terror==
{{Main|Revolutionary terror}}
[[Revolutionary terror]], also known as ''"[[Red terror]]"'', was often used by revolutionary governments to suppress [[counterrevolutionaries]]. The first example was the [[Reign of Terror]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy", by Barrington Moore, Edward Friedman, James C. Scott (1993) {{ISBN|0-8070-5073-3}}, p.101: "Social Consequences of  Revolutionary Terror"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April08/Lafayette.cov.cn.html French revolutionary terror was a gross exaggeration, say Lafayette experts. By Chandni Navalkha.] April 28, 2008. accessed 5-20-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include the ''[[Red Terror]]'' in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1918–1922, as well as simultaneous campaigns [[Red Terror (Hungary)|in the Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and [[Red Terror (Finland)|in Finland]]. In China [[Red Terror (China)|Red Terror]] in 1966 and 1967 started the [[Cultural revolution]]. 

Counterrevolutionary terror is usually referred to as ''"[[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]]"''. Notable examples are the terror campaigns [[First White Terror|in France]] (1794–1795), [[White Terror (Russia)|in Russia]] (1917–20), [[White Terror (Hungary)|in Hungary]] (1919–1921), and [[White Terror (Spain)|in Spain]]. Modern examples of counter-revolutionary terror include [[Operation Condor]] in South America.

==Terror and terrorism==
{{Terrorism}}
David Forte states that the primary difference between terror and [[terrorism]] is that while terror can be neutrally evil (i.e., random violence committed by [[robbers]], [[rapists]], and even [[military personnel]]), terrorism has the additional political or moral dimension, being the systematized use of randomly focused violence by organized groups against [[non-combatants]] to effect a political objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forte |first1=David F.|last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Terror and Terrorism: There Is a Difference |journal=Ohio Northern University Law Review |volume=13 |issue= |pages=39–52 |publisher=Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law |doi= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/onulr13&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Charles Tilly defines "terror" as a political strategy defined as "asymmetrical deployment of threats and violence against enemies using means that fall outside the forms of political struggle routinely operating within some current regime," and therefore ranges from:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. Terror, Terrorism, Terrorists. ''Sociological Theory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, Theories of Terrorism: A Symposium (Mar., 2004), pp. 5-13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#intermittent actions by members of groups that are engaged in wider political struggles to
#one segment in the modus operandi of durably organized specialists in coercion, including government-employed and government-backed specialists in coercion to
#the dominant rationale for distinct, committed groups and networks of activists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tilly, the term "terror" spans across a wide range of human cruelties, from Stalin's use of executions to clandestine attacks by groups like the Basque separatists and the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and even ethnic cleansing and genocide&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
It was filmed in the Regional District of [[Okanagan-Similkameen]], a precursor to the many Hollywood productions that would film in Canada soon after (see [[Hollywood North]] and [[Cinema of Canada]]). The score was composed by [[Alan Silvestri]]. The movie is one of [[Bart the Bear]]'s earliest roles. The [[muskox]] hunt was filmed just outside [[Hughenden, Alberta]].

==Box office and reception==
Because the film cost [[United States dollar|US $]]15 million to produce and brought in only US $1.9 million domestically, it is considered a [[box office bomb|box office flop]]. The film was nominated for an Oscar in 1987 for Best Makeup ([[Michael Westmore]] and Michèle Burke).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1980-1989/59nominees.html Nominees &amp; Winners for the 59th Academy Awards (1987)]&lt;/ref&gt; The film currently holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clan_of_the_cave_bear/&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' claims: "It is hard to see why ''TCOTCB'' has drawn such critical contempt, unless for its tacit [[Feminism]]: although the narration is overexpository and the equation of mental versatility with leggy blonde [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnons]], as opposed to shabby [[Neanderthal]]s, is a cliché, the movie is beautifully shot, well scripted and finely acted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sf-encyclopedia.uk/fe.php?nm=clan_of_the_cave_bear_the The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997): Clan of the Cave Bear, The]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Great God Pan''''' is a [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] [[novella]] by Welsh writer [[Arthur Machen]]. Machen was inspired to write ''The Great God Pan'' by his experiences at the ruins of a pagan temple in Wales. What would become the first chapter of the novella was published in the magazine ''The Whirlwind'' in 1890. Machen later extended ''The Great God Pan'' and it was published as a book alongside another story, "The Inmost Light", in 1894. The novella begins with an experiment to allow a woman named Mary to see the supernatural world. This is followed by an account of a series of mysterious happenings and deaths over many years surrounding a woman named Helen Vaughan. At the end, the heroes confront Helen and force her to kill herself. She undergoes a series of supernatural transformations before dying and she is revealed to be the child of Mary and the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]].

On publication, it was widely denounced by the press as degenerate and horrific because of its implied sexual content, and the novella hurt Machen's reputation as an author. Beginning in the 1920s, Machen's work was critically re-evaluated and ''The Great God Pan'' has since garnered a reputation as a classic of horror. [[Literary criticism|Literary critics]] have noted the influence of other nineteenth-century authors on ''The Great God Pan'' and offered differing opinions on whether or not it can be considered an example of [[Gothic fiction]] or [[science fiction]]. The novella has influenced the work of horror writers such as [[Bram Stoker]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[Stephen King]], and has been adapted for the stage twice.

==Synopsis==
Clarke agrees, somewhat unwillingly, to bear witness to a strange experiment performed by his friend, Dr. Raymond. The ultimate goal of the doctor is to open the mind of someone so that he may experience the spiritual world, an experience he notes the ancients called "seeing the great god [[Pan (god)|Pan]]". He performs the experiment, which involves minor brain surgery, on a young woman named Mary. She awakens from the operation awed and terrified but quickly becomes "a hopeless idiot".

Years later, Clarke learns of a beautiful but sinister girl named Helen Vaughan, who is reported to have caused a series of mysterious happenings in her town. She spends much of her time in the woods near her house, and takes other children on prolonged twilight rambles in the countryside that disturb the parents of the town. One day, a young boy stumbles across her "playing on the grass with a 'strange naked man,{{'-}}"; the boy becomes hysterical and later, after seeing a Roman statue of a [[satyr]]'s head, becomes permanently feeble-minded. Helen also forms an unusually close friendship with a neighbour girl, Rachel, whom she leads several times into the woods. On one occasion Rachel returns home distraught, half-naked and rambling. Shortly after explaining to her mother what happened to her (never revealed in the story), Rachel returns to the woods and disappears forever. Clarke relates these events in a book he is writing entitled ''Memoirs to Prove the Existence of the [[Devil]]''.

Years later, Villiers happens across his old friend Herbert, who has become a vagrant since they last met. When asked how he has fallen so low, Herbert replies that he has been "corrupted body and soul" by his wife. After some investigation with Clarke and another character, Austin, it is revealed that Helen was Herbert's wife, and that a well-to-do man killed himself after seeing something that terrified him in Herbert and Helen's home. Herbert is later found dead.

Helen disappears for some time; according to rumor, she spent the time taking part in disturbing [[Orgy|orgies]] somewhere in the Americas. She eventually returns to London under the pseudonym Mrs. Beaumont. Soon after, a group of stable, happy men in London commit suicide; the last person known to have been in the presence of each of them was Mrs. Beaumont, whom they are implied to have slept with. Villiers and Clarke, each learning of Mrs. Beaumont's true identity, band together and confront Helen in her house with a noose. They tell her that she must kill herself, or they will expose her. Helen has a very abnormal death, transforming between human and beast, male and female, and dividing and reuniting, before turning into a jelly-like substance and finally dying.

This is followed by a fragment of a document about the remains of a pillar honoring the Roman god [[Nodens]]. The inscription on the column reads "To the great god Nodens (the god of the Great Deep or Abyss), Flavius Senilis has erected this pillar on account of the marriage which he saw beneath the shade." The document says that historians are puzzled as to what the inscription refers to. The novella ends with a fragment of a letter from Dr. Raymond to Clarke, which reveals that Helen was the child of Mary, who died shortly after her daughter's birth. In the letter, Raymond informs Clarke that Mary became pregnant after his experiment caused her to see the god Pan, implying that Pan [[Demigod|fathered Helen]].

==Background==
[[File:Caerwent Roman Temple - geograph.org.uk - 486475.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Arthur Machen credited his childhood visits to the ruined Roman temple at [[Caerwent]] (''pictured''), which he believed was dedicated to the god [[Nodens]], as his inspiration for ''The Great God Pan''.{{sfn|Machen|1922|pages=19–20}}]]

Machen's lifelong fascination with [[occult]]ism began after he read an article on [[alchemy]] in an edition of [[Charles Dickens]]'s periodical ''[[Household Words]]'' belonging to his father, a clergyman.&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt;&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; In his 1922 autobiography, ''Far Off Things'', Machen wrote that ''The Great God Pan'' was inspired by the times he visited the [[Usk]], a Welsh river, and the Welsh towns of [[Caerleon on the Usk]] and [[Caerwent]] as a boy; all of these places had been settled by the Romans.{{sfn|Machen|1922|page=19}} He wrote that "strange relics" were frequently found at Caerwent from the ruined temple of "[[Nodens]], god of the depths".{{sfn|Machen|1922|page=19}} Machen visited the temple, which he described as a "lonely house between the dark forest and the silver river".{{sfn|Machen|1922|page=19}} 

In writing the novella, he tried to "pass on the vague, indefinable sense of awe and mystery and terror that [he] had received" while visiting those ruins.{{sfn|Machen|1922|pages=19–20}} Machen felt that he had "transliterated [the feeling] clumsily" in ''The Great God Pan'', elaborating: "I translated awe, at worst awfulness, into evil; again, I say, one dreams with fire and works in clay."{{sfn|Machen|1922|page=123}} Dennis Denisoff said that Machen's decision to make Helen Vaughan the child of a Welsh woman and a pagan figure "parallels Machen's own authorial self-identity as one arising from not only his Welsh ancestry but also pagan myth."{{sfn|Denisoff|1922|page=6}}

What is now the first chapter of the novella was published in 1890 in a magazine called ''The Whirlwind'', while what is now the third chapter of the book was published in the same magazine the following year as a standalone short story called "The City of Resurrections". Machen only viewed the two works as connected after they were finished. Once he decided the two stories were connected, Machen wrote the rest of ''The Great God Pan'' in a single evening save for its final chapter. Machen did not think of an ending for the tale for months, and in that time believed that the novella would remain unfinished forever. The last chapter was completed in June 1891. Machen sent the novella to the publisher [[Blackwood (publishing house)|Blackwood]], who rejected it, deeming it a clever story that "shrink[s]...from the central idea." It was accepted by [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and published in 1894.{{sfn|Machen|2006|pages=5–6}} When published as a book, ''The Great God Pan'' was accompanied by another Machen tale called "The Inmost Light"&lt;ref name="bs"/&gt; which also features a [[mad scientist]] and elements of [[science fiction]].{{sfn|Machen|2018|page=xiii}} The book's cover was illustrated by [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Sarcophagus Triumph of Bacchus-IMG 9721.JPG|left|thumb|Third-century relief carving from a [[Ancient Roman sarcophagi|Roman sarcophagus]] showing [[Pan (god)|Pan]] dancing with a ''[[maenad]]'' ("mad woman") playing a [[tambourine]]]]

[[Pan (god)|Pan]] was an ancient Greek god primarily worshipped in [[Arcadia]] who was associated with shepherds and their flocks, and with nature.{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} He was believed to lurk in caves, mountains, and other lonely, isolated locations.{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} In some stories, he inflicted his enemies with sudden terror (i.e. ''[[panic]]'').{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} The phrase, "the great God Pan" comes from an ancient Greek folktale recorded in [[Plutarch]]'s ''De defectu oraculorum'' (''On the Decline of Oracles''),{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} which claims that a Greek sailor near the island of [[Paxi]] during the reign of [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]] (ruled 14–37 AD) heard a voice cry out, "When you are arrived at Palodes, take care to make it known that the great God Pan is dead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Moralia]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0252%3Asection%3D17 ''De defectu oraculorum'' 17]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} Early Christian commentaries suggested that this event occurred at the same time as the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Christ]] and that the "death" of Pan represented the transition from a pagan to a Christian world.{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}}

This story had particular resonance with [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] literary audiences.{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} In 1844, [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] wrote her poem "The Dead Pan", an adaption of Plutarch's story which insisted that proper [[Christian literature]] should abandon [[Greek mythology]], with each stanza ending in the words "Pan, Pan is dead."{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} As a member of the Decadent movement, Machen sought to subvert traditional themes and transgress literary boundaries,{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} an agenda which made Pan a particularly appealing figure.{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=278}} The title of ''The Great God Pan'' appears to have been specifically derived from the Browning's later poem "A Musical Instrument" (1862), in which the first line of every stanza ends with the words "the great god Pan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/eugeoneirevi.36.2.0212?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents| last=Claveria| first=Alesha| title=The Great God Pan/Brown: Shared Origins and Theme of a Victorian Horror Classic and Eugene O'Neill's Masked Play| publisher=''The Eugene O'Neill Review''| date=2015| accessdate=July 30, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731034227/https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/eugeoneirevi.36.2.0212?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents| archive-date=July 31, 2018| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machen's use of Pan in the novella may have also been influenced by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s essay "[[wikisource:Virginibus Puerisque and Other Papers/Pan's Pipes|Pan's Pipes]]" (1878) and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s poem "[[wikisource:A Nympholept|A Nympholept]]" (1894),{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|pages=278–279}} in which Pan is portrayed as the "emblem of the delicious combination of ecstasy and terror."{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}}

In a review of the novella for ''[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]]'', Matthew David Surridge hypothesized that Machen took inspiration from [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818) in his portrayal of Dr. Raymond as a mad scientist akin to [[Victor Frankenstein]].&lt;ref name=fantasy&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.blackgate.com/2012/10/30/arthur-machen-and-the-great-god-pan/| last=Surridge| first=Matthew David| title=Arthur Machen and 'The Great God Pan{{'-}}| publisher=''[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]]''| date=October 30, 2012| accessdate=July 28, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729081558/https://www.blackgate.com/2012/10/30/arthur-machen-and-the-great-god-pan/| archive-date=July 29, 2018| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of Robert Louis Stevenson, especially his 1886 novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', were among Machen's most significant influences when writing ''The Great God Pan''.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/st-davids-day-world-book-day-arthur-machen-welsh-horror-writer-supernatural-science-fiction-novels-a8234176.html| last=Sommerlad| first=Joe| title=St. David's Day: Celebrating Arthur Machen, the forgotten Welsh horror writer admired by Stephen King| publisher=''[[The Independent]]''| date=March 2, 2018| accessdate=July 29, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729174127/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/st-davids-day-world-book-day-arthur-machen-welsh-horror-writer-supernatural-science-fiction-novels-a8234176.html| archive-date=July 29, 2018| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}} Critic John Gawsworth also sees Machen's novella as reminiscent of the horror stories of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Sheridan Le Fanu]].{{sfn|Machen|2018|page=ix}} Aaron Worth noted similitude between the death of Helen Vaughan and the theories of alchemist [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]], who is the character's namesake{{sfn|Machen|2018|page=xiv}} and Helen's disintegration recalls the alchemical concept of the [[prima materia]].{{sfn|Machin|2018|page=148}} [[John C. Tibbetts]] observes similarities between Helen Vaughan and Ayesha, the sexually liberated demonic priestess from [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s ''[[She: A History of Adventure]]'' (1886).{{sfn|Tibbetts|2016|page=214}} Machen wrote that several critics felt that [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s novels ''[[À rebours]]'' (1884) and ''[[Là-bas (novel)|Là-bas]]'' (1891) had inspired ''The Great God Pan'', though he did not read either book until after ''Pan'' was published. Upon reading the two novels, Machen concluded that "my critics had not read them either."{{sfn|Denisoff|2018|page=2}}

===Religious themes===
[[File:Deedsoftheantichrist2580-detail.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Vaughan and Pan have respectively been compared to the [[Antichrist]] (''left'') and [[Lucifer]] (''right'').{{sfn|Goho|2014|page=62}}&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt;]]
The novella is characteristic of a late nineteenth-century interest in paganism in general and Pan in particular that is found in the works of [[Florence Farr]] and [[Kenneth Grahame]].{{sfn|Machen|2018|page=xvii}} According to the British scholar of modern literature [[Roger Luckhurst]], Raymond expresses a typical [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] view of reality in which the true object of study is the revelation of a "higher, hidden spiritual world".{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}} He is therefore "an occultist rather than a [[Materialism|materialist]] scientist."{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}} Neoplatonism is also commonly regarded as the last school of pagan philosophy{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}} and Raymond's views therefore relate back to the recurring theme of the death of Pan.{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}}

Author [[Theodora Goss]] sees ''The Great God Pan'' as equating paganism with irrationality and what [[Carl Jung]] would call the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref name=goss&gt;{{cite web| url=https://locusmag.com/2018/06/96362/| last=Myman| first=Francesca| title=Theodora Goss: Monstrous Voices| publisher=''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]''| date=June 18, 2018| accessdate=August 10, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810235539/https://locusmag.com/2018/06/96362/| archive-date=August 10, 2018| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Gates''{{'s}} Matthew David Surridge believes that the story associates paganism with sex and [[femininity]], while portraying Helen as a female [[Antichrist]],&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; a view shared by James Goho in ''Journeys into Darkness: Critical Essays on Gothic Horror'' (2014).{{sfn|Goho|2014|page=62}}  Surridge adds "from another perspective: [Helen] is the undoing of progress. Rather than proceeding from paganism to [[Christianity]], as orthodox Victorian belief imagined the progress of history, she is a reversal of time, the revenge of the atavistic." In keeping with this idea, Surridge sees Mary's name as a reference to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] and Helen's name as a reference to the pagan figure [[Helen of Troy]].&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; Goho interprets the story as Machen's warning against the abandonment of "true religion" and the embrace of paganism.{{sfn|Goho|2014|page=61}}

At one point in the novella, a Latin creed is recited: "''Et Diabolus Incarnatus Est. Et Homo Factus Est.''" ("And the Devil was made incarnate. And was made man."){{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}} Luckhurst identifies this as a blasphemous rewriting of the [[Nicene Creed]], a early Christian creed which includes the line: "By the power of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] he [Jesus] became [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] from the Virgin Mary, and was made man."{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=279}} Goho writes that the portrayal of Pan in the novella draws on the mythology of [[Lucifer]] and depictions of Pan as "the fetish for evil and suffering and the danger and dread of the wilderness," rather than depictions of Pan as a playful and harmless god.{{sfn|Goho|2014|page=62}} Surridge sees the book's references to [[Satan]] and Nodens as implying that Satan, Nodens and Pan are the same being,&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; while Goho connects the novella to the fact that [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] associated Pan with the devil.{{sfn|Goho|2014|page=63}}

==Critical reception==
[[File:Oscar Wilde.jpeg|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]] praised the novella.]]
''The Great God Pan''{{'s}} implied sexuality caused a scandal upon its original release and hurt Machen's reputation as an author.&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; Reviewing the novella for the magazine ''Literary News'', [[Richard Henry Stoddard]] criticised the story as "too morbid to be the production of a healthy mind".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Henry Stoddard, "Review of "The Great God Pan"", in: [[Jason Colavito|Colavito, Jason]], ed. ''A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008. p. 228-230) {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3968-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art critic [[Harry Quilter]]'s review of the book, titled "The Gospel of Intensity", and published in ''[[The Contemporary Review]]'' in June 1895, was even more harsh.{{sfn|Machin|2018|pages=140–141}} Quilter declared: "{{-'}}The Great God Pan' is, I have no hesitation in saying, a perfectly abominable story, in which the author has spared no endeavor to suggest loathsomeness and horror which he describes as beyond the reach of words."&lt;ref name="hg"&gt;Harry Quilter, "The Gospel of Intensity", in Colavito, ed.

Machen's literary reputation was re-evaluated in the 1920s&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; and ''The Great God Pan'' has since attained the reputation of a horror masterpiece.&lt;ref name="bs"/&gt; In "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]" (1926; revised 1933), [[H. P. Lovecraft]] praised the story, saying: "No one could begin to describe the cumulative suspense and ultimate horror with which every paragraph abounds"; he added that "the sensitive reader" reaches the end with "an appreciative shudder". Lovecraft also noted, however, that "melodrama is undeniably present, and coincidence is stretched to a length which appears absurd upon analysis". [[Bennett Cerf]] described the story as a "masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;"Arthur Machen, celebrated English author of such masterpieces as "The Great God Pan" and "The Hill of Dreams"..." Bennett Cerf, "Trade Winds", ''The Saturday Review of Literature'', March 20, 1943, (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Stableford]] stated that ''The Great God Pan'' is "the archetypal Decadent horror story" and described the story as "highly original".&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;Stableford, Brian, (1998). "Machen, Arthur (Llewellyn)". ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'', ed. [[David Pringle]]. London: St. James Press. {{ISBN|1558622063}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen King]] referred to it as "one of the best horror stories ever written. Maybe the best in the English language." King also praised ''Pan'' for being "more reader-friendly" than Lovecraft's fiction.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, Stephen, "[http://www.stephenking.com/stephens_messages.html Self-Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201002239/http://stephenking.com/stephens_messages.html |date=2009-02-01 }}", 10:50 am, September 4, 2008.

It's not simple, and yet it's effective, more so than can easily be explained."&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt;

Some commentary on ''The Great God Pan'' has focused on its portrayal of women. Surridge sees the novella as expressing a [[gynophobia|fear of women]] even though the ultimate source of horror in the story is a male deity.&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' says that Helen's "metamorphosis...remains one of the most dramatically horrible and misogynistic in fiction".&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; Helen never speaks in the book; according to Victoria Margree and Bryony Randall in ''Victorian Gothic: An Edinburgh Companion'', "The silence of the central female character is part of the text's misogyny, but also part of its narrative effect." Margree and Randall also view Helen's fate as a punishment for her sexual impropriety.{{sfn|Smith|2012|page=225}} Dennis Denisoff connects Machen's tendency to make his empowered female characters "sexually monstrous" to his criticisms of authors who discussed the subject of [[women's rights]].{{sfn|Denisoff|2018|page=6}} James Machin defends Machen and ''The Great God Pan'' from charges from misogyny on the grounds that the male protagonist of Machen's story "[[The Three Impostors|The Novel of the White Powder]]" (1895) disintegrates in a manner reminiscent of Helen Vaughan{{sfn|Machin|2018|page=148}} and on the grounds that Machen married Amy Hogg, a woman who defied the sexual boundaries of her time.{{sfn|Machin|page=150}}

==Adaptations==
A pair of parodies of ''Pan'' were published in 1895 – Arthur Rickett's "A Yellow Creeper" and Arthur Sykes's "The Great Pan-Demon". Both suggest that Machen is an author of "limited imagination," with the latter depicting him as a mad scientist unleashing degenerate literature on an unsuspecting public.{{sfn|Denisoff|2018|page=7}} ''The Great God Pan'' was brought to the stage in 2008 by the WildClaw Theatre Company in [[Chicago]].

[[File:Weird Tales April 1929.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''The Great God Pan'' influenced later works of horror fiction, including "[[The Dunwich Horror]]" (1929) by [[H. P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref name="Price1996"/&gt;]]

''Black Gate''{{'s}} Matthew David Surridge said that ''The Great God Pan'' influenced [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) as both works feature "an introductory sequence featuring a horrified Englishman in a non-English setting; then a variety of seemingly-unconnected events in London, the metropole at the heart of Empire; then the discovery that all those events are in fact inspired by one malign and supernatural intelligence, that the rational contemporary capital is threatened by the irrational and archaic; then an equivocal conclusion. The fear of sex, women, foreignness."&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; John C. Tibbetts notes that both Helen Vaughan in ''The Great God Pan'' and [[Lucy Westenra]] in ''Dracula'' are "demon women of voracious and malignant sexuality".{{sfn|Tibbetts|2016|page=214}} Theodora Goss also notes similarities between the death of Helen Vaughan in Machen's novella and Lucy's death in ''Dracula''.&lt;ref name=goss/&gt; Tibbetts also notes that Machen's portrayal of Helen Vaughan as demonic and hyper-sexual may have influenced a similar character, The Woman of Songs, in [[Richard Marsh (author)|Richard Marsh]]'s ''[[The Beetle (novel)|The Beetle]]'' (1897).{{sfn|Tibbetts|2016|page=214}}

''The Great God Pan'' was highly influential on the circle of writers around H. P. Lovecraft.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt; The structure of Machen's story influenced the structure of Lovecraft's "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" (1928).{{sfn|Cardin|2016|page=401}} ''Pan''{{'}}s depiction of a monstrous half-human hybrid inspired the plot of Lovecraft’s "[[The Dunwich Horror]]" (1929), which refers to Machen’s novella by name. According to Lovecraft scholar [[Robert M. Price]], "{{-'}}The Dunwich Horror' is in every sense an homage to Machen and even a [[pastiche]]. There is little in Lovecraft's wonderful story that does not come directly out of Machen's fiction."&lt;ref name="Price1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Price, Robert M. |date=1996|title=The Dunwich Cycle: Where the Old Gods Wait|location= Hayward, CA|publisher= Chaosium|pages= ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pan'' also inspired Lovecraft to create his character [[Nodens (Cthulhu Mythos)|Nodens]]&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; who appears most prominently in ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]'' (1943).{{sfn|Tyson|2016|page=129}}

[[Clark Ashton Smith]] was inspired by ''The Great God Pan'' to write his story "The Nameless Offspring" (1931), which also features a monstrous child born of a human and a supernatural entity.&lt;ref&gt;"{{-'}}Pan' ... has suggested to me an idea so hellish that I am almost afraid to work it out in story form ...[a woman] gives birth to a child and dies.

According to film historians Keith McDonald and Roger Clark, Mexican film director [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s portrayal of the faun in his 2006 [[dark fantasy]] film ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' was inspired by the "ambivalent and possibly dangerous" portrayals of Pan in late Victorian and early Edwardian novels, including Machen's ''The Great God Pan'' and ''Pan's Garden'' (1912) by [[Algernon Blackwood]].{{sfn|McDonald|Clark|2014|page=45}} Del Toro deliberately chose to imitate the darker, more sinister fauns of Machen and Blackwood rather than the "sweetly domesticated figure" of [[Mr. Tumnus]] from [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' (1950).{{sfn|McDonald|Clark|2014|pages=44–45}} The original title of the film in Spanish is ''El Laberinto del Fauno'' (''The Labyrinth of the Faun''),{{sfn|McDonald|Clark|2014|page=44}} but the English title ''Pan's Labyrinth'' emphasizes the connection between del Toro's film and the body of late nineteenth-century writings about Pan, including ''The Great God Pan''.{{sfn|McDonald|Clark|2014|pages=44–45}}

Stephen King wrote that his novella ''[[N. (novella)|N.]]'' from his story collection ''[[Just After Sunset]]'' (2008) is "a riff on Arthur Machen's ''The Great God Pan''....  Mine isn't anywhere near [as] good [as the original], but I loved the chance to put neurotic behavior—obsessive/compulsive disorder—together with the idea of a monster-filled macroverse."&lt;ref name=king/&gt; King has also cited Machen's novella as an influence on his novel ''[[Revival (novel)|Revival]]'' (2014).&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; Similar to ''Pan'', ''Revival'' features an experiment on a young woman's brain which allows her to see into another world.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-revival-by-stephen-king/2014/11/10/bf86b506-668e-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.15933ce89ff3l| last=Hand| first=Elizabeth| title=Book review: 'Revival,' by Stephen King| publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''| date=November 10, 2014| accessdate=July 28, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729081601/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-revival-by-stephen-king/2014/11/10/bf86b506-668e-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.15933ce89ff3l| archive-date=July 29, 2018| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Poseidon Adventure''''' is a 1972 American [[disaster film]] directed by [[Ronald Neame]], produced by [[Irwin Allen]], and based on [[Paul Gallico]]'s [[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|eponymous 1969 novel]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]], including five [[Academy Award]] winners: [[Gene Hackman]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Jack Albertson]], [[Shelley Winters]], and [[Red Buttons]]. Parts of the movie were filmed aboard the {{RMS|Queen Mary}}. The plot centers on the fictional [[Poseidon (fictional ship)|SS ''Poseidon'']], an aged luxury liner on her final voyage from [[New York City]] to [[Athens]] before being sent to the scrapyard. On [[New Year's Eve]], she is [[Capsizing|overturned]] by a [[tsunami]]. Passengers and crew are trapped inside, and a rebellious preacher attempts to lead a small group of survivors to safety.

It is in the vein of other all-star [[disaster film]]s of the early-mid 1970s such as ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). By the end of 1974, it was regarded as a widely successful film. The film won two [[Academy Award]]s,&lt;ref name="Oscars1973"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1973 |title=The 45th Academy Awards (1973) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-28|website=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]], and a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/38807/The-Poseidon-Adventure/awards |title=NY Times: The Poseidon Adventure |accessdate=2008-12-28|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1979 sequel, ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'', was also based on a novel by Gallico but was a commercial and critical failure.

==Plot==
The S.S. ''Poseidon'', an ocean liner slated for retirement, is on her way to [[Athens]]. Despite protests from the captain, who fears for the ship's safety, the new owner's representative insists he go full speed to save money, preventing him from taking on [[Ballast tank|ballast]].

Reverend Scott, a minister believing that "[[God helps those who help themselves]]", is travelling to a new parish in Africa as a punishment for his unorthodox views. Detective Lt. Rogo and wife Linda, a former [[prostitute]], deal with her seasickness. Susan and younger brother Robin are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired [[Jewish]] store owner Manny Rosen and wife Belle are going to [[Israel]] to meet their young grandson for the first time. [[Haberdasher]] James Martin is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry, rehearses for the [[New Year's Day]] celebration.

Passengers gather in the dining room to celebrate. The captain is called to the bridge in response to a report of an undersea [[earthquake]]. He receives word from the lookout that a huge [[tsunami]] is approaching from the direction of [[Crete]] at 60&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. He issues a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday distress signal]] and commands a "hard left" turn into the wave. The ship is unable to turn in time and is hit broadside, causing it to capsize.

In the dining room, survivors take stock of their predicament. Acres, an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above. Scott surmises that the escape route will be found "upwards", at the outer hull, now above water. Robin tells him the hull near the propeller shaft is only one inch (25.4&amp;nbsp;mm) thick. The Rosens, the Rogos, Susan, Robin, Acres, Nonnie, and Martin agree to go with Scott, using a Christmas tree as a ladder. Scott unsuccessfully tries convincing more passengers to join them. After the group climbs to the galley, there is a series of explosions. As seawater floods the dining room, those remaining attempt to climb the tree, but their weight causes it to fall. The water fills up the room and the ''Poseidon'' begins sinking.

Scott leads his group upward through the ship's hull, toward the engine room. While climbing a ladder inside a ventilation shaft, the ship rocks from more explosions. Acres falls and perishes despite Rogo's attempt to save him. Leaving the shaft, the group meets a large band of survivors led by the ship's medic, heading toward the bow. Scott believes they are heading for their doom, but Rogo wants to follow them and gives Scott 15 minutes to find the engine room. Although he takes longer than allowed, Scott succeeds.

The group discovers the engine room is on the other side of a flooded corridor. Belle reveals she is a former competitive swimmer and volunteers to go through, but Scott refuses her and dives in. Halfway through, a panel collapses on him. The survivors notice something is wrong, and Belle dives in. She frees Scott and they make it to the other side, but Belle suffers a [[heart attack]]. Before dying, she tells Scott to give her [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]] pendant to her husband, who in turn will give it to their grandson. Rogo swims over to make sure Belle and Scott are all right, then leads the rest over. When Rosen finds Belle's dead body, he is unwilling to go on, but Scott gives him her pendant, reminding him that he has a reason to live.

Scott leads the survivors to the propeller shaft room's watertight door, but another series of explosions causes Linda to fall to her death. A heartbroken Rogo blames her death on Scott. A ruptured pipe releases steam, blocking their escape. Scott rants at God for the survivors' deaths. He leaps and grabs onto the burning-hot valve wheel to shut off the steam, then tells Rogo to lead the group before letting go of it, falling to his death in the flaming water below.

Rogo leads the remaining survivors—Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan, and Robin—through the watertight doors and into the propeller shaft tunnel. They hear a noise from outside and bang on the hull to attract attention. The rescuers cut a hole through the hull, assist the sole group of six survivors from the ship, and fly them to safety.

==Sequel and remakes==
A 1979 sequel, ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'', which was also based on a novel by Gallico,  was released later with an equally star-studded cast, but was a commercial and critical failure. In 1998, several episodes of the daytime soap ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]'' entitled "Shockwave" revolved around an earthquake and tsunami in California and major parts of the episodes take place on a cruise ship, the S.S. ''Neptune'' that is capsized by the giant wave. The episode borrowed heavily from the plot line of ''The Poseidon Adventure'' and garnered huge audiences and spurring NBC to repeat it several weeks later in prime time. ''The Poseidon Adventure'' was remade twice, first as a [[The Poseidon Adventure (2005 film)|television special in 2005]] with the same name, and as a theatrical release titled ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]'' in 2006.

'''''The Seven-Per-Cent Solution: Being a Reprint from the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D.''''' is a 1974 novel by American writer [[Nicholas Meyer]]. It is written as a [[pastiche]] of a [[Sherlock Holmes]] adventure, and was made into a [[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|film of the same name]] in 1976.

Published as a "lost manuscript" of the late [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John H. Watson]], the book recounts Holmes' recovery from [[cocaine]] addiction (with the help of [[Sigmund Freud]]) and his subsequent prevention of a European war through the unravelling of a sinister kidnapping plot. It was followed by two other Holmes pastiches by Meyer, ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Canary Trainer]]'' (1993), neither of which has been adapted to film.

''The Seven-Per-Cent Solution'' was ranked ninth in the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' [[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1970s#1974|list of bestselling novels from 1974]] and made ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Best Seller list|Best Seller list]] for forty weeks between September 15, 1974 and June 22, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/1974/1974.htm Adult New York Times Best Seller Lists for 1974]. Retrieved 23 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/1975/1975.htm Adult New York Times Best Seller Lists for 1975]. Retrieved 23 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An introduction states that two [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|canonical]] Holmes adventures were fabrications. These are "[[The Adventure of the Final Problem|The Final Problem]]", in which Holmes apparently died along with [[Professor Moriarty|Prof. James Moriarty]], and "[[The Adventure of the Empty House|The Empty House]]", wherein Holmes reappeared after a three-year absence and revealed that he had not been killed after all. ''The Seven-Per-Cent Solution'''s Watson explains that they were published to conceal the truth concerning Holmes' "[[Sherlock Holmes#The Great Hiatus|Great Hiatus]]".

The novel begins in 1891, when Holmes first informs Watson of his belief that Professor James Moriarty is a "Napoleon of Crime". The novel presents this view as nothing more than the fevered imagining of Holmes' cocaine-sodden mind and further asserts that Moriarty was the childhood mathematics tutor of Sherlock and his brother [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]].  Watson meets Moriarty, who denies that he is a criminal and reluctantly threatens to pursue legal action unless the latter's accusations cease. Moriarty also refers to a "great tragedy" in Holmes' childhood, but refuses to explain further when pressed by Watson.

The heart of the novel consists of an account of Holmes' recovery from his addiction. Knowing that Sherlock would never willingly see a doctor about his addiction and mental problems, Watson and Holmes' brother Mycroft induce Holmes to travel to [[Vienna]], where Watson introduces him to [[Sigmund Freud|Dr. Freud]]. Using a treatment consisting largely of [[hypnosis]], Freud helps Holmes shake off his addiction and his delusions about Moriarty, but neither he nor Watson can revive Holmes' dejected spirit.

What finally does the job is a whiff of mystery: one of the doctor's patients is kidnapped and Holmes' curiosity is sufficiently aroused. The case takes the three men on a breakneck train ride across Austria in pursuit of a foe who is about to launch a war involving all of Europe. Holmes remarks during the denouement that they have succeeded only in postponing such a conflict, not preventing it; Holmes would later [[His Last Bow (story)|become involved]] in a "[[World War I#Other names|European War]]" in 1914.

One final hypnosis session reveals a key traumatic event in Holmes' childhood: his father murdered his mother for adultery and committed suicide afterwards. It was Moriarty who informed Holmes and his brother of their deaths, and his tutor then became a dark and malignant figure in his [[subconscious]]. Freud and Watson conclude that Holmes, consciously unable to face the emotional ramifications of this event, has pushed them deep into his unconscious while finding outlets in fighting evil, pursuing justice, and many of his famous [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricities]], including his cocaine habit.  However, they decide not to discuss these subjects with Holmes, believing that he would not accept them, and that it would needlessly complicate his recovery.

Watson returns to London, but Holmes decides to travel alone for a while, advising Watson to claim that he had been killed, and thus the famed "Great Hiatus" is more or less preserved. It is during these travels that the events of Meyer's sequel ''[[The Canary Trainer]]'' occur.

==References to other works==
Holmes's addiction to cocaine is developed out of the opening scene of Conan Doyle's ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]''.  In that scene, Holmes describes the cocaine with which he is injecting himself as "a seven-per-cent solution."

In his Introduction, Meyer's Watson declares that "[[The Adventure of the Lion's Mane|The Lion's Mane]]", "[[The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone|The Mazarin Stone]]", "[[The Adventure of the Creeping Man|The Creeping Man]]" and "[[The Adventure of the Three Gables|The Three Gables]]" (all Arthur Conan Doyle-written adventures from 1927's ''[[The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes]]'') are forged "drivel". "The Creeping Man" has been accused of resembling a science-fiction tale more than a Holmes adventure, "The Mazarin Stone" is often viewed as an awkward adaptation of a theatrical script by Doyle and some have objected to a perceived racist characterization in "The Three Gables". "The Lion's Mane", while perhaps less controversial than the other tales, is notable for being one of the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|canon]]'s two stories narrated by Holmes. Meyer's Watson also states that other forgeries exist, though whether canonical works are concerned is not specified.

On the train to Vienna, Holmes and Watson briefly meet Rudolf Rassendyll, the fictional protagonist of the 1894 novel ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', returning from his adventures in [[Ruritania]].

==Film adaptation==

{{Main article|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)}}

The story was adapted for the screen in 1976 in a [[Universal Studios]] production, directed by [[Herbert Ross]], scripted by Meyer and designed by [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] veteran [[Ken Adam]]. The all-star cast featured [[Nicol Williamson]] as Holmes, [[Robert Duvall]] as Watson, [[Alan Arkin]] as Dr. [[Sigmund Freud]], with [[Laurence Olivier]] as Moriarty, [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as Mycroft Holmes (the role he reprised in the [[Jeremy Brett]] TV series), [[Samantha Eggar]] as Mary Watson, [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Lola Devereaux, [[Joel Grey]] as Lowenstein, and [[Jeremy Kemp]] as Baron von Leinsdorf and Williamson's then wife [[Jill Townsend]] playing his character's mother (Mrs. Holmes). The film was made at [[Pinewood Studios]] with location shooting in the UK and [[Austria]] (including the famous [[Austrian National Library]]); the  tennis match/duel between Freud and von Leinsdorf  was filmed on one of the historic [[real tennis]] courts at the [[Queen's Club]] in [[West Kensington, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075194/locations|title=Filming locations for The Seven-Per-Cent Solution|work=IMDb|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chase on the trains was shot with set-dressed British steam locomotives and freight cars dressed up as coaches.

Meyer adapted his novel to screenplay form, but the film differs significantly from the novel, mainly by supplementing the book's Austrian baron-villain (played by [[Jeremy Kemp]]) with an older Turkish foe. Also, the film departs from traditional Holmes canon in portraying the detective as light-haired instead of the traditional black-haired, and as a somewhat flirtatious Holmes at that (Doyle's hero never let women see any signs of interest). Furthermore, the traumatic revelation that affected Holmes in his childhood is heightened – the final hypnosis therapy reveals that Sherlock witnessed his mother's murder by his father, and that Moriarty himself was his mother's lover.  Finally, the lady whom Holmes saves in the story's climatic chase, Lola Devereaux, appears on his ship as he departs for his sabbatical with the purpose of joining him and Holmes eagerly accepts the offer.  Meyer's three Holmes novels are much more faithful to the original stories in these regards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4169">'''The organization's face''' concept first time introduced in 2011 by Professor [[Mohammad Ali Sarlak]] in a multi-volume book entitled: The new faces of organizations in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=sarlak2011&gt;Sarlak, Mohammad. A. (2011). ''The New Faces of Organizations in the 21st Century (Volumes:1,2,3)''. Canada: NAISIT Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sarlak2012&gt;Sarlak, Mohammad. A. (2012).

==Definition of face==
In Merriam Webster dictionary, face defines as a means of identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/face&lt;/ref&gt; The [[face]]  considered as people identification’s factor and a distinction means between individuals.

==Definition of organization's face==
The concept of organization’s face represents something that identifies and distinguishes the organization from other similar organizations.

==The origins of organization's face==
The concept of organization’s face is based on two underlying metaphors:
#	The organization as a natural system.&lt;ref name=scott1998&gt;Scott, W. Richard. (1998). ''Organizations: Rational, Natural, and Open Systems, 4th edn ''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
#	The organization as an organism&lt;ref name=morgan2006&gt;Morgan, Gareth. (2006). ''Images of Organization''. Newbury Park. CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Organizations as living entity such as humans can be distinguished by face factor from each other.

==What factors determine the organization's face? ==
[[File:Organizations_Pillars.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1. the organization’s pillars]]
The question is what are the factors that determine an organization’s face? To answer this question, Professor Sarlak uses the organization’s pillars model that is derived from the Lewitt model.&lt;ref name="scott1998"/&gt;
The pillars of an organization are shown in Figure 1.

Based on the organization's pillars model, the organization has at least five following pillars:
#	People
#	Goals  
#	Structure 
#	Technology  
#	Environment

==Types of organization's face==
[[File:Organization’s_Faces.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 2.Types of organization's face]]
As shown in Figure 2, with an emphasis on each of the organizational pillars, a specific type of organization’s face is formed.

Based on Figure 2, organizations can demonstrate five general face, simultaneously or separately:
#	Humanistic face
#	Goal oriented face
#	Structure oriented face
#	Technology based face
#	Environment based face
Each of these faces is divided into more specific faces:

'''Humanistic face'''

[[File:Higasa hikone.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a [[Oil-paper umbrella|traditional Japanese parasol]]]]
An '''umbrella''' or '''parasol''' is a folding [[canopy (building)|canopy]] supported by wooden or metal ribs, which is usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole. It is designed to protect a person against [[precipitation (meteorology)|rain]] or [[sunburn|sunlight]]. The word "umbrella" typically refers to a device used for protection from rain. The word ''parasol'' usually refers to an item designed to protect from the sun. Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof. Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic. There are also combinations of parasol and umbrella that are called '''en-tout-cas''' (french for ''in any case'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En-tout-cas|periodical=merriam-webster.com|publisher=|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/en-tout-cas|format=|accessdate=2018-07-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use.  The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas can be divided into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag; and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed. Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas which spring open at the press of a button.

Hand-held umbrellas have some type of handle, either a wooden or plastic cylinder or a bent "crook" handle (like the handle of a cane). Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality models sold at [[discount store]]s to expensive, finely made, [[Designer label|designer-labeled]] models. Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with [[patio table]]s or other [[Garden furniture|outdoor furniture]], or as points of shade on a sunny beach. The collapsible/folding umbrella, the direct predecessor to the modern umbrella, originated in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ong | first=Siew Chey | title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture | year=2005 | publisher=Times Editions Marshall Cavendish | location=Singapore | isbn=978-981-261-067-6 | page=170 | edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Weiss | first=Julian | title=Tigers' roar: Asia's recovery and its impact | year=2001 | publisher=Sharpe | location=Armonk, New York | isbn=978-0-7656-0784-3 | page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Chinese umbrellas were internally supported with bendable, retractable, and extendable joints as well as sliding levers similar to those in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ronan| first=Colin A.| title=The shorter Science and civilisation in China: 4 | year=1994 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-32995-8 | page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasols are sometimes called '''sunshades.''' An umbrella may also be called a '''brolly''' (''UK slang''), '''parapluie''' (''nineteenth century, French origin''), '''rainshade''', '''gamp''' (''British, informal, dated''), or '''bumbershoot''' (''American slang'').

==Etymology==
[[File:Man sitting under beach umbrella.JPG|thumb|Man sitting under a beach umbrella]]
The word "parasol" (Spanish or French) is a combination of ''para'', meaning to stop or to shield, and ''sol'', meaning sun. "Parapluie" (French) similarly consists of ''para'' combined with ''pluie'', which means rain (which in turn derives from ''pluvia'', the Latin word for rain). Hence, a ''parasol'' shields from sunlight while a ''parapluie'' shields from rain. (''[[Parachute]]'' means "shield from fall".)

The word "umbrella" evolved from the Latin ''umbella'' (an [[umbel]] is a flat-topped rounded flower) or ''umbra'', meaning shaded or shadow.

In Britain, umbrellas were sometimes referred to as "gamps" after the character Mrs. Gamp in the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'', although this usage is now obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gamp?view=uk |title=oxforddictionaries.com |publisher=oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs. Gamp's character was well known for carrying an umbrella.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd ed 1989,  Oxford University Press; [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50092255 OED Online] (requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brolly'' is a [[slang]] word for umbrella, used often in Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Kenya.

''Bumbershoot'' is a fanciful [[American English|Americanism]] from the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bum2.htm |title='&amp;#39;WorldWideWords'&amp;#39; – Origin of the word "Bumbershoot" |publisher=Worldwidewords.org |date=13 October 2002 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416174802/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bum2.htm |archivedate=16 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient China===
[[File:TERRACOTTA ARMY @ Gdynia 2006 - 01 ubt.jpeg|thumb|left|A [[Terracotta Army]] carriage with an umbrella securely fixed to the side, from [[Qin Shihuang]]'s tomb, c. 210 BC]]
[[File:Parasol wuhan.jpg|thumb|left|Parasols in [[Wuhan]], China]]

In all written records, the oldest reference to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when [[Wang Mang]] (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 70"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century commentator [[Fu Qian]] added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 70 71"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at [[Lelang Commandery]] in the [[Korean Peninsula]], illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 71"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. [[Zhou Dynasty]] bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which could have been used for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of [[Luoyang]], dated to the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 71"/&gt;

An even older source on the umbrella is perhaps the ancient book of Chinese ceremonies, called ''Zhou Li'' (''The [[Rites of Zhou]]''), dating 2,400 years ago, which directs that the dais should be placed upon the imperial cars. The figure of this dais contained in ''Zhou-Li'', and the description of it given in the explanatory commentary of Lin-hi-ye, both identify it with an umbrella. The latter describes the dais to be composed of 28 arcs, which are equivalent to the ribs of the modern instrument, and the staff supporting the covering to consist of two parts, the upper being a rod 3/18 of a Chinese foot in circumference, and the lower a tube 6/10 in circumference, into which the upper half is capable of sliding and closing.

The Chinese character for umbrella is [[wikt:傘|傘]] (''sǎn'') and is a pictograph resembling the modern umbrella in design. Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough-like ribs (the branching out parts of an umbrella). Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the [[tent]], which remains in an unaltered form to the present day. However, the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air, hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high-ranking (though not necessarily royalty) in China. On at least one occasion, twenty-four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting. The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun. The Chinese design was later brought to Japan via Korea and also introduced to [[Persia]] and the [[Western world]] via the [[Silk Road]]. The Chinese and Japanese traditional parasol, often used near temples, remains similar to the original ancient Chinese design.

A late [[Song dynasty]] Chinese divination book that was printed in about 1270 AD features a picture of a collapsible umbrella that is exactly like the modern umbrella of today's China.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 71"/&gt;

===Middle East===
In the sculptures at [[Nineveh]], the parasol appears frequently.&lt;ref name="sangster"&gt;Sangster, William, 1808–1888. ''Umbrellas and Their History''. London: Cassell, Petter, and Galpin [1871]. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6674 Available online as Gutenberg etext 6674, retrieved March 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austen Henry Layard]] gives a picture of a [[bas-relief]] representing a king in his chariot, with an attendant holding a parasol over his head.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; It has a curtain hanging down behind, but is otherwise exactly like those in use today.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; It is reserved exclusively for the monarch (who was bald), and is never carried over any other person.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt;

In [[Persian Empire|Persia]], the parasol is repeatedly found in the carved work of [[Persepolis]], and Sir [[John Malcolm]] has an article on the subject in his 1815 "History of Persia."&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; In some sculptures, the figure of a king appears attended by a servant, who carries over his head an umbrella, with stretchers and runner complete.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; In other sculptures on the rock at Taghe-Bostan, supposed to be not less than twelve centuries old, a deer-hunt is represented, at which a king looks on, seated on a horse, and having an umbrella borne over his head by an attendant.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
In [[ancient Egypt]], the parasol is found in various shapes. In some instances it is depicted as a [[whip|flagellum]], a fan of [[Palm tree|palm]]-leaves or coloured feathers fixed on a long handle, resembling those now carried behind the [[Pope]] in processions.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; [[Gardiner Wilkinson]], in his work on Egypt, has an engraving of an Ethiopian princess travelling through Upper Egypt in a chariot; a kind of umbrella fastened to a stout pole rises in the centre, bearing a close affinity to what are now termed chaise umbrellas.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; According to Wilkinson's account, the umbrella was generally used throughout Egypt, partly as a mark of distinction, but more on account of its useful than its ornamental qualities.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt; In some paintings on a temple wall, a parasol is held over the figure of a god carried in procession.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
In Greece, the parasol (''skiadeion''), was an indispensable adjunct to a lady of fashion in the late 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Miller, "The Parasol: An Oriental Status-Symbol in Late Archaic and Classical Athens", ''JHS'' 112 (1992), p. 91 [91–105].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristophanes]] mentions it among the common articles of female use;&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' 823.&lt;/ref&gt; they could apparently open and close.&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''Knights'', 1347–1348 and scholia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] describes a tomb near Triteia in [[Achaea|Achaia]] decorated with a 4th-century BC painting ascribed to Nikias; it depicted the figure of a woman, "and by her stood a female slave, bearing a parasol".&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 7.22.6.&lt;/ref&gt; For a man to carry one was considered a mark of effeminacy.&lt;ref&gt;Pherecrates fr.70 PCG apud [[Athenaeus]], 13.612a and 15.687a.&lt;/ref&gt; In Aristophanes' ''Birds'', [[Prometheus]] uses one as a comical disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''Birds'', 1549–1551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural changes among the [[Aristoi]] of Greece eventually led to a brief period – between 505 and 470BC – where men used parasols.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ploug Jørgensen, ''The taming of the  aristoi – an ancient Greek civilizing process?'' [[History of the Human Sciences]]: July 2014 vol. 27 no. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Vase iconography bears witness to a transition from men carrying swords, then spears, then staffs, then parasols, to eventually nothing. The parasol, at that time of its fashion, displayed the luxury of the user's lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;van Wees,1998:61–2&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of their usage, Greek style was inspired by the Persian and Lydian nobility's way of dressing: loose robes, long decorated hair, gold, jewellery, and perfume.&lt;ref&gt;Kurke, 1992: 96; cf. Neer, 2002: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

It also had religious significance. In the [[Scirophoria]], the feast of Athene Sciras, a white parasol was borne by the [[priest]]esses of the goddess from the [[Acropolis]] to the Phalerus. In the feasts of [[Dionysos]], the umbrella was used, and in an old bas-relief, the same god is represented as descending ''ad inferos'' with a small umbrella in his hand. In the Panathenæa, the daughters of the [[Metics]], or foreign residents, carried parasols over the heads of Athenian women as a mark of inferiority.

===Ancient Rome===
From Greece it is probable that the use of the parasol passed to Rome, where it seems to have been usually used by women, while it was the custom even for effeminate men to defend themselves from the heat by means of the ''Umbraculum'', formed of skin or leather, and capable of being lowered at will. There are frequent references to the umbrella in the Roman Classics, and it appears that it was, not unlikely, a post of honour among maid-servants to bear it over their mistresses. Allusions to it are tolerably frequent in the poets. ([[Ovid]] Fast. lib. ii., 1. 31 I.; [[Martial]], lib. xi., ch. 73.; lib. xiv, ch. 28, 130; [[Juvenal]], ix., 50.; Ovid Ars. Am., ii., 209). From such mentions the umbrella does not appear to have been used as a defence from rain; this is curious enough, for it is known that the theatres were protected by the ''[[velarium]]'' or awning, which was drawn across the arena whenever a sudden shower came on. Possibly the expense bestowed in the decoration of the ''umbraculum'' was a reason for its not being applied to such use.

According to Gorius, the umbrella came to Rome from the [[Etruscans]] who came to Rome for protection, and certainly it appears not infrequently on Etruscan vases and pottery, as also on later gems and rubies. One gem, figured by Pacudius, shows an umbrella with a bent handle, sloping backwards. [[Strabo]] describes a sort of screen or umbrella worn by Spanish women, but this is not like a modern umbrella.

===Ancient India===

The [[Sanskrit]] epic [[Mahabharata]] (about 4th century BC) relates the following legend: [[Jamadagni]] was a skilled bow shooter, and his devoted wife [[Renuka]] would always recover each of his arrows immediately. One time however, it took her a whole day to fetch the arrow, and she later blamed the heat of the sun for the delay. The angry Jamadagni shot an arrow at the sun. The sun begged for mercy and offered Renuka an umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Jean Baptiste Tavernier]], in his 17th century book "Voyage to the East", says that on each side of the [[Mughal Empire|Mogul]]'s throne were two umbrellas, and also describes the hall of the King of [[Inwa|Ava]] was decorated with an umbrella. The chháta of the Indian and [[Bamar|Burmese]] princes is large and heavy, and requires a special attendant, who has a regular position in the royal household. In Ava it seems to have been part of the king's title, that he was "King of the white elephant, and Lord of the twenty-four umbrellas." In 1855 the [[Mindon Min|King of Burma]] directed a letter to the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquis of Dalhousie]] in which he styles himself "His great, glorious, and most excellent Majesty, who reigns over the kingdoms of Thunaparanta, Tampadipa, and all the great umbrella-wearing chiefs of the Eastern countries".

===Siam===
Simon de la Loubère, who was Envoy Extraordinary from the French King to the King of [[Siam]] in 1687 and 1688, wrote an account entitled a "New Historical Relation of the Kingdom of Siam", which was translated in 1693 into English. According to his account, the use of the umbrella was granted to only some of the subjects by the king. An umbrella with several circles, as if two or three umbrellas were fastened on the same stick, was permitted to the king alone; the nobles carried a single umbrella with painted cloths hanging from it.
The Talapoins (who seem to have been a sort of Siamese monks) had umbrellas made of a palm-leaf cut and folded, so that the stem formed a handle.

The [[Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella]] is one of the royal regalia of Thailand.

===Aztec Empire===

The [[At, Tenochtitlan|At]] district of [[Tenochtitlan]] was reported to have used an umbrella made from feathers and gold as its ''pantli'', an identifying marker that is the equivalent of a modern flag. The ''pantli'' was carried by the army general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mx_pre-h.html "Mexico - Pre-Hispanic Flags"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113231308/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mx_pre-h.html |date=13 January 2010 }} Mexico&amp;nbsp;— Pre-Hispanic Flags&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The extreme paucity of allusions to umbrellas throughout the [[Middle Ages]] shows that they were not in common use. In an old romance, "The Blonde of Oxford", a [[jester]] makes fun of a nobleman for being out in the rain without his [[cloak]]. "Were I a rich man", says he, "I would bear my house about with me".  It appears that people depended on cloaks, not umbrellas, for protection against storms.{{synthesis inline|date=January 2013}}

[[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]], in his ''Domestic Manners of the English'', gives a drawing from the Harleian MS., No. 604, which represents an Anglo-Saxon gentleman walking out attended by his servant, the servant carrying an umbrella with a handle that slopes backwards, so as to bring the umbrella over the head of the person in front.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt; It probably could not be closed, but otherwise it looks like an ordinary umbrella, and the ribs are represented distinctly.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;

The use of the parasol and umbrella in France and England was adopted, probably from China, about the middle of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=sangster1&gt;{{cite book | last=Sangster | first=William | title=Umbrellas and their history | origyear=Published in 1871 | year=2005 | publisher=Elibron Classics | isbn=978-1-4021-6168-1 | pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that period, pictorial representations of it are frequently found, some of which exhibit the peculiar broad and deep canopy belonging to the large parasol of the Chinese Government officials, borne by native attendants.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;

[[John Evelyn]], in his ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]]'' for 22 June 1664, mentions a collection of rarities shown to him by "Thompson", a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]], sent by the [[Jesuit]]s of Japan and China to France.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt; Among the curiosities were "fans like those our ladies use, but much larger, and with long handles, strangely carved and filled with Chinese characters", which is evidently a description of the parasol.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;

In [[Thomas Coryat]]'s ''[[Coryat's Crudities|Crudities]]'', published in 1611, about a century and a half prior to the general introduction of the umbrella into England,&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt; is a reference to a custom of riders in Italy using umbrellas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And many of them doe carry other fine things of a far greater price, that will cost at the least a duckat, which they commonly call in the Italian tongue umbrellas, that is, things which minister shadowve to them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne. These are made of leather, something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy, &amp; hooped in the inside with divers little wooden hoopes that extend the umbrella in a pretty large compasse. They are used especially by horsemen, who carry them in their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the handle upon one of their thighs, and they impart so large a shadow unto them, that it keepeth the heate of the sunne from the upper parts of their bodies.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[John Florio]]'s "A WORLD of Words" (1598), the Italian word Ombrella is translated

&lt;blockquote&gt;a fan, a canopie. also a testern or cloth of state for a prince. also a kind of round fan or shadowing that they vse to ride with in sommer in Italy, a little shade. Also a bonegrace for a woman. Also the husk or cod of any seede or corne. also a broad spreding bunch, as of fenell, nill, or elder bloomes.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''Dictionary of the French and English Tongues'' (1614), the French Ombrelle is translated

&lt;blockquote&gt;An umbrello; a (fashion of) round and broad fanne, wherewith the Indians (and from them our great ones) preserve themselves from the heat of a scorching sunne; and hence any little shadow, fanne, or thing, wherewith women hide their faces from the sunne.&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Fynes Moryson]]'s ''Itinerary'' (1617) is a similar allusion to the habit of carrying umbrellas in hot countries "to auoide the beames of the Sunne". Their employment, says the author, is dangerous, "because they gather the heate into a pyramidall point, and thence cast it down perpendicularly upon the head, except they know how to carry them for auoyding that danger".&lt;ref name=sangster1/&gt;

During [[Streynsham Master]]'s 1676 visit to the [[East India Company]]'s factory in [[Masulipatnam]] he noted that only the governor of the town and the next three officials in seniority were allowed to have "a roundell [i.e. umbrella] carried over them."&lt;ref name=Bowrey&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bowrey|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Bowrey|editor-last=Temple|editor-first=Richard Carnac|editor-link=Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baronet|title=A Geographical Account of Countries Round the Bay of Bengal, 1669 to 1679 |url=https://archive.org/details/ageographicalac00bowrgoog|year=1895|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the umbrella (''parapluie'') began to appear in the 1660s,  when the fabric of parasols carried for protection against the sun was coated with wax.  The inventory of the French royal court in 1763 mentioned "eleven parasols of taffeta in different colours" as well as "three parasols of waxed ''toile'', decorated around the edges with lace of gold and silver."  They were rare, and the word ''parapluie''  ("against the rain") did not enter the dictionary of the Académie française until 1718.  {{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1047}}

[[File:Passer-payez-Boilly-ca1803.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Parisians in the rain with umbrellas, by [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]] (1803)]]

Kersey's Dictionary (1708) describes an umbrella as a "screen commonly used by women to keep off rain".

The first lightweight folding umbrella in Europe was introduced in 1710 by a Paris merchant named Jean Marius, whose shop was located near the barrier of Saint-Honoré.  It could be opened and closed in the same way as modern umbrellas, and  weighed less than one kilogram.  Marius received from the King the exclusive right to produce folding umbrellas for five years. A model was purchased by the Princess Palatine in 1712, and she enthused about it to her aristocratic friends, making it an essential fashion item for Parisiennes.  In 1759,  a French scientist named Navarre presented a new design to the French Academy of Sciences for an umbrella combined with a cane.  Pressing a small button on the side of the cane opened the umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'', (1996), Robert Laffont, {{ISBN|2-221-07862-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their use became widespread in Paris.  In 1768, a Paris magazine reported:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"The common usage for quite some time now is not to go out without an umbrella, and to have the inconvenience of carrying it under your arm for six months in order to use it perhaps six times. Those who do not want to be mistaken for vulgar people much prefer to take the risk of being soaked, rather than to be regarded as someone who goes on foot; an umbrella is a sure sign of someone who doesn't have his own carriage." {{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1047}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Gustave Caillebotte - Jour de pluie à Paris.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Paris Street; Rainy Weather'', by [[Gustave Caillebotte]] (1877)]]
In 1769, the Maison Antoine, a store at the Magasin d'Italie on rue Saint-Denis, was the first to offer umbrellas for rent to those caught in downpours, and it became a common practice. The Lieutenant General of Police of Paris issued regulations for the rental umbrellas; they were made of oiled green silk, and carried a number so they could be found and reclaimed if someone walked off with one. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1047}}

By 1808 there were seven shops making and selling umbrellas in Paris;  one shop, [[Sagnier]] on rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, received the first patent given for an invention in France for a new model of umbrella. By 1813 there were 42 shops; by 1848 there were three hundred seventy-seven small shops making umbrellas in Paris, employing 1400 workers. One of the well-known makers was [[Boutique Bétaille]], which was located at rue Royale 20 from 1880–1939. Another was [[Revel (brand)|Revel]], based in Lyon. By the end of the century, however, cheaper manufacturers in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] replaced Paris as the centre of umbrella manufacturing, and the town of [[Aurillac]] became the umbrella capital of France. The town still produces about half the umbrellas made in France; the umbrella factories there employ about one hundred workers. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1047}}

In [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', Crusoe constructs his own umbrella in imitation of those that he had seen used in Brazil.  "I covered it with skins", he says, "the hair outwards, so that it cast off the rain like a [[pent-house]], and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest." From this description the original heavy umbrella came to be called "Robinson" which they retained for many years in England.

Captain [[James Cook]], in one of his voyages in the late 18th century, reported seeing some of the natives of the South Pacific Islands with umbrellas made of palm leaves.

The use of the umbrella or parasol (though not unknown) was uncommon in England during the earlier half of the eighteenth century, as is evident from the comment made by General (then Lieut.-Colonel) [[James Wolfe]], when writing from Paris in 1752; he speaks of the use of umbrellas for protection from the sun and rain, and wonders why a similar practice did not occur in England. About the same time, umbrellas came into general use as people found their value, and got over the shyness natural to its introduction. [[Jonas Hanway]], the founder of the Magdalen Hospital, has the credit of being the first man who ventured to dare public reproach and ridicule by carrying one habitually in London. As he died in 1786, and he is said to have carried an umbrella for thirty years, the date of its first use by him may be set down at about 1750. [[John Macdonald (footman)|John Macdonald]] relates that in 1770, he used to be addressed as, "Frenchman, Frenchman! why don't you call a coach?" whenever he went out with his umbrella.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt;  By 1788 however they seem to have been accepted: a London newspaper advertises the sale of 'improved and pocket Umbrellas, on steel frames, with every other kind of common Umbrella.'&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=13 February 1788|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But full acceptance is not complete even today with some considering umbrellas effete.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Since then, the umbrella has come into general use, in consequence of numerous improvements. In China people learned how to waterproof their paper umbrellas with wax and lacquer. The transition to the present portable form is due, partly, to the substitution of silk and gingham for the heavy and troublesome oiled silk, which admitted of the ribs and frames being made much lighter, and also to many ingenious mechanical improvements in the framework. [[Victorian era]] umbrellas had frames of wood or baleen, but these devices were expensive and hard to fold when wet. [[Samuel Fox (industrialist)|Samuel Fox]] invented the [[steel]]-ribbed umbrella in 1852; however, the ''[[Encyclopédie Méthodique]]'' mentions metal ribs at the end of the eighteenth century, and they were also on sale in London during the 1780s.&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; Modern designs usually employ a [[Telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping]] steel trunk; new materials such as [[cotton]], plastic film and [[nylon]] often replace the original silk.

Umbrellas are now a consumer product with a large global market. As of 2008, most umbrellas worldwide are made in China, mostly in the [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and [[Zhejiang]] provinces. The city of [[Shangyu]] alone had more than a thousand umbrella factories.  In the US alone, about 33 million umbrellas, worth $348 million, are sold each year.&lt;ref name="Orlean" /&gt;

Umbrellas continue to be actively developed. In the US, so many umbrella-related patents are being filed that the [[U.S. Patent Office]] employs four full-time examiners to assess them. As of 2008, the office registered 3000 active patents on umbrella-related inventions.  Nonetheless, Totes, the largest American umbrella producer, has stopped accepting unsolicited proposals. Its director of umbrella development was reported as saying that while umbrellas are so ordinary that everyone thinks about them, "it's difficult to come up with an umbrella idea that hasn’t already been done."&lt;ref name="Orlean"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/02/11/080211fa_fact_orlean?printable=true|title=Thinking in the Rain: An artist takes on the umbrella|last=Orlean|first=Susan|date=11 February 2008|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=24 April 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429015301/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/02/11/080211fa_fact_orlean?printable=true|archivedate=29 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The umbrella is used in weather forecasting as an icon for rain. Two variations, a plain umbrella (☂, U+2602) and an umbrella with raindrops overhead (☔, U+2614), are encoded in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block of [[Unicode]].

===In religious ceremony===

[[File:Conopeum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Umbraculum]] from the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]], [[Maastricht]]]]

As a canopy of state, umbrellas were generally used in southern and eastern Europe, and then passed from the imperial court into church ceremony. They are found in the ceremonies of the [[Byzantine Rite]], were borne over the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]] in [[procession]], and form part of the [[pontificalia|Pontifical]] [[regalia]].

====Catholic Church====
The ''ombrellino'' or [[umbraculum]] is a historic piece of the [[papal regalia]]. Although the popes no longer use it personally, it is displayed on the [[coat of arms]] of a [[sede vacante]] (the papal arms used between the death of a pope and the election of his successor). This umbraculum is normally made of alternating red and gold fabric, and is usually displayed in a partially unfolded manner. The popes have traditionally bestowed the use of the umbraculum as a mark of honor upon specific persons and places. The use of an umbraculum is one of the honorary symbols of a [[basilica]] and may be used in the basilica's [[coat of arms]], and carried in processions by the basilica's [[canon (priest)|canons]].

A large umbrella is displayed in each of the [[List of basilicas|Basilicas of Rome]], and a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal bishop]] who receives his [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|title]] from one of those churches has the privilege of having an umbrella carried over his head in solemn [[procession]]s. It is possible that the [[galero]] (wide-brimmed cardinal's hat) may be derived from this umbrella.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Beatiano, an Italian [[herald]], says that "a vermilion umbrella in a field argent symbolises dominion."
[[File:StMichaelEOTC03a.jpg|thumb|[[Ethiopian Orthodox]] clergymen lead a procession in celebration of [[Saint Michael]]. The [[priest]]s carry ornately covered [[Tabot]]a around the church's exterior, assisted by [[deacon]]s holding liturgical umbrellas.]]

An umbrella, also known as the ''umbraculum'' or ''ombrellino'', is used in Roman Catholic liturgy as well. It is held over the [[Holy Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]] and its carrier by a server in short processions taking place indoors, or until the priest is met at the sanctuary entrance by the bearers of the processional canopy or ''baldacchino''. It is regularly white or golden (the colours reserved for the Holy Sacrament) and made of silk.

====Oriental Orthodox Churches====
In several [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], such as the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], umbrellas are used liturgically to show honor to a person (such as a [[bishop]]) or a holy object. In the ceremonies of [[Timkat]] (Epiphany), priests will carry a model of the [[Tablets of Stone]], called a [[Tabot]], on their heads in procession to a body of water, which will then be blessed. Brightly colored embroidered and fringed liturgical parasols are carried above the Tabota during this procession. Such processions also take place on other major [[feast day]]s.

===In photography===
{{main|Reflector (photography)}}
Umbrellas with a reflective inside are used by photographers as a diffusion device when employing artificial lighting, and as a glare shield and shade, most often in portrait situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graphic-design.com/photographic/studio/diffusion.html "Diffusers &amp; Reflectors - soft lighting usually the best lighting"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527111339/http://www.graphic-design.com/photographic/studio/diffusion.html |date=27 May 2007 }} DT&amp;G Photographic&lt;/ref&gt; Some umbrellas are shoot-through umbrellas, meaning the light goes through the umbrella and is diffused, rather than reflecting off the inside of the umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/03/rethinking-umbrella.html "Rethinking the Umbrella"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019083048/http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/03/rethinking-umbrella.html |date=19 October 2010 }} Strobist examines the use of shoot-through umbrellas&lt;/ref&gt;

===For protection against attackers===
In 1838, the Baron [[Charles Random de Berenger]] instructed readers of his book ''How to Protect Life and Property'' in several methods of using an umbrella as an improvised weapon against highwaymen.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1897, journalist J. F. Sullivan proposed the umbrella as a misunderstood weapon in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] article for the ''Ludgate Monthly''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Between 1899 and 1902, both umbrellas and [[walking sticks]] as [[self defence]] weapons were incorporated into the repertoire of [[Bartitsu]].

In January 1902, an article in ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' instructed women on how they could defend themselves from ruffians with an umbrella or parasol.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In March 2011, media outlets revealed that French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] had started using a £10,000 armor-plated umbrella to protect him from attackers. "Para Pactum" is a [[Kevlar]]-coated device made by The Real Cherbourg. It will be carried by a member of Sarkozy's security team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1371921/Sarkozys-bodyguards-10k-black-umbrella-changes-defensive-shield.html|title=''En garde'': French presidential bodyguards reveal latest weapon... a black umbrella that changes into a defensive shield|work=The Daily Mail|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=30 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728163445/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1371921/Sarkozys-bodyguards-10k-black-umbrella-changes-defensive-shield.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s [[Frei Otto]] transformed the universally used individual umbrella into an item of lightweight architecture. He developed a new umbrella form, based on the minimum surface principle. The tension loaded membrane of the funnel-shaped umbrella is now stretched under the compression-loaded bars. This construction type made it technically and structurally possible to build very large convertible umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archplus.net/download/artikel/3176/''Schirmkonstruktionen von Frei Otto - Arch+''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203031840/http://www.archplus.net/download/artikel/3176/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first umbrellas of this kind (Federal Garden Exhibition, Kassel, 1955) were fixed, Frei Otto constructed the first convertible large umbrellas for the Federal Garden Exhibition in Cologne 1971.&lt;ref name="Frei Otto Gesamtwerk"&gt;Nerdinger, Winfried: ''Frei Otto.

The great beauty of these lightweight structures inspired many subsequent projects built all over the world. The largest convertible umbrellas built until now were designed by [[Mahmoud Bodo Rasch]] and his team at SL-Rasch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl-rasch.de/|title=SL-RASCH – Special and Lightweight Structures|publisher=Institute for Scientific Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide shelter from sun and rain for the great mosques in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleid=598 ''The Stuttgart School of Building Design''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234241/http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleid=598 |date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of the 1880s [[Order of the Golden Dawn]] a '''watchtower''' or '''guardian''' in [[ceremonial magic|ceremonial]] and derived [[neopagan]] magical tradition is a [[tutelary spirit]] of one of the four [[cardinal point]]s or "quarters" ([[north]], [[east]], [[south]], and [[west]]). They are also variously associated in many traditions with each the four [[classical element]]s ([[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) and [[Royal stars|stars]] ([[Fomalhaut]], [[Aldebaran]], [[Regulus]], and [[Antares]]). The Watchtowers are [[invocation|invoked]] during the ritual of casting a [[magic circle]].

Alternately, "Watchtowers" may refer specifically to the ''abodes of the Guardians'', with the guardians themselves referred to as "Watchers" or simply "Guardians".

In Christian influenced magic traditions, they are understood to be the [[Archangel]]s [[Uriel]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], and [[Gabriel]].

==Types==
In archaic Roman religion, small towers were built at the crossroads, and an altar was set before them upon which offerings were given to nature spirits.  Guardian spirits known as [[Lares]] were associated with these towers and with demarcation in general, as well as seasonal themes related to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Dumezil, Georges, ''Archaic Roman Religion'', volume 1, p. 343 344&lt;/ref&gt;  Here we may find a connection between the Lares and the [[Grigori]] of Italian Witchcraft.  These towers may be the foundation of the "Watchtowers" appearing in the ritual circles of Wiccans and other modern witches.

==In Enochian tradition==
In the Enochian system of magic, brought to public attention by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly in the 16th century, we find the inclusion of Watchtowers as complex evocational designs.  Some people believe that the Watchtowers have their origin in the [[Enochian magic]] system revealed to the Elizabethan magician [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[scrying|scryer]] [[Edward Kelley]], which was later developed into a working system of magic by [[S.L. MacGregor Mathers]]. According to Dee’s diaries, the two men summoned an angel, which Kelley saw in an obsidian mirror; Dee recorded the revelations which Kelley narrated to him. Among the surviving records of the Angelic Operations is ''A Book of Supplications and Invocations'' which "deals with the Invocation of the Angels who preside over the Four Quarters of the Terrestrial sphere."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turner, ''Elizabethan Magic'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the core of the instructions was the Angelic Table: a grid of 25x27 squares, each square containing a letter. The Angelic Table is subdivided into four lesser grids for the four elements and the four directions, bound together by the cross-shaped Tablet of Union. They are used to call upon the aid of angels ruling over the four directions. The names of God and the angels to be used in the invocations are extracted from the tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Elizabethan Magic'', pp. 59-79 (gives the invocations together with the divine and angelic names for each quarter); Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 630-42 (instructions for deriving the names from the Tablets).&lt;/ref&gt; The four tablets are often called the Enochian Tablets because the letters may be written in the [[Enochian]] alphabet also revealed to Dee and Kelley by the angel.

===Western Hermeticism===
Dee’s work was revived and expounded upon by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], primarily through the work of S.L. MacGregor Mathers. In the Golden Dawn magical system, the four Angelic/Enochian Tablets became the four Watchtowers.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', Book 9, describes Enochian magic in the Golden Dawn, including detailed information on the Watchtowers.&lt;/ref&gt; Each Watchtower was attributed to a direction and an element, by the Golden Dawn.

*The Great Eastern Quadrangle of [[Air (classical element)|Air]]
*The Great Western Quadrangle of [[Water (classical element)|Water]]
*The Great Northern Quadrangle of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]
*The Great Southern Quadrangle of [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]

The Tablet of Union was rearranged to form a rectangle attributed to Spirit or [[aether (classical element)|Ether]]. The tablets were brightly colored; squares attributed to the elements were painted in the color of that element, with lettering in complementary colors.

*Air - yellow with violet letters
*Water - blue with orange letters
*Earth - black with green letters
*Fire - red with green letters

The use of complementary colors, called flashing colors in the Golden Dawn, means that the Watchtowers belong to the class of talismans called flashing tablets. The flashing colors were supposed to draw energy from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; The painted tablets were placed on the walls of the temple during some rituals to symbolize the four quarters. A favorite ritual in the Golden Dawn was the '''Opening by Watchtower'''. This is actually a preliminary ritual to purify space and call upon the guardians of the four quarters, similar to casting the magic circle in Wicca. As part of the Opening by Watchtower, the practitioner uses the [[magical weapon|elemental weapons]] to summon the angels of the quarters. In the south, for instance, the practitioner uses the Fire [[Wand]] to trace an invoking Fire [[Pentagram]], then summons the angels using the three names of God found in the Fire Tablet:

:''OIP TEAA PEDOCE''
:''In the names and letters of the Great Southern Quadrangle, I invoke ye, ye Angels of the Watch-tower of the South''.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence in Dee's original writings that either he, Kelly or the angels attributed these quadrangles of the Great Table, to the elements as the Golden Dawn did. There is therefore, no evidence that the name Oip Teaa Pedoce is in fact, a holy name for the God relevant to the element fire. There is no doubt though, that it is certainly a holy name relevant to spirits whose names are found in the Southern Quadrangle of the Great Table or Tablet.

The Watchtowers were among the Golden Dawn concepts introduced into Wicca (modern witchcraft) by its founder [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]. The complicated tablets and Enochian names were largely abandoned, but Wicca retained the Watchtowers as "the four cardinal points, regarded as guardians of the Magic Circle".&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, ''The Witches' Way'', p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually mentioned during the casting of the circle. In a conservative tradition such as [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] or [[Alexandrian Wicca]] the invocation of the Watchtowers begins in the east; the practitioner traces an invoking Earth Pentagram while saying;

:''Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the East, ye Lords of Air; I do summon, stir and call you up, to witness our rites and to guard the Circle''.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar and Farrar, ''Witches’ Way'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern adaptations ==
Many Wiccan circle-castings no longer mention the Watchtowers by name. Another important development is experimentation with the attribution of elements to the directions, instead of adhering to the attributions used by the Golden Dawn and Gardnerian Wicca (north/earth, east/air, south/fire, west/water). Many Wiccans perceive themselves as participants in an [[earth-based religion]]; they believe their practices should reflect their living experience of the local environment. Both the Golden Dawn and early Wicca were active in [[Great Britain]];&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Phillip (2000) ''Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History'', p. 74. "Also in the 1880s, the tradition of ritual magic was revived in London by a group of Masonic adepts, who formed the Order of the Golden Dawn, which would prove an incalculable influence on the whole subsequent history of occultism." USA: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smoley, Richard (1999) ''Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions'', pp. 102–103. "Founded in 1888, the Golden Dawn lasted a mere twelve years before it was shattered by personal conflicts. At its height it probably had no more than a hundred members. Yet its influence on magic and esoteric thought in the English-speaking world would be hard to overestimate." USA: Quest Books.&lt;/ref&gt; traditional attributions derived from the British climate may not appeal to or work for practitioners in other climates. A special instance of this problem is the circumstance of Wiccans living in the southern hemisphere, who tend to perceive the north, not the south, as the direction most characterized by fire and heat. Some Neopagans choose to follow the practices of a historical pagan group with whom they identify, or conform to local traditions; either choice may dictate a change of attributions.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar and Farrar, ''Witches’ Way'', chapter 25, In Tune with the Land, addresses both environmental and cultural issues in a sympathetic manner.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yawarlukru''' or '''Yawar Lukru''' ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] ''yawar'' blood, ''lukru'' soup,&lt;ref&gt;Vocabulario comparativo quechua ecuatoriano - quechua ancashino -- castellano - English (pdf), collected by Robert Beér, Armando Muyolema and Hernán S. Aguilar, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "blood soup", hispanicized spellings ''Yahuarlocro, Yahuar Locro'') is a traditional dish of the [[ecuadorian cuisine]]. Is a light stew prepared with meat and entrails of lamb including intestines, liver, lung, [[tongue]], [[rumen]], etc. It's usually served with fried lamb blood, [[avocado]] and pickled [[red onion]] rings.

It can be consumed as a snack or as a main dish depending on the size of the plate. It's consumed in the ecuadorian [[Andes]] range and is considered a representative dish of the Ecuadorian cuisine.

==Recipe==
Boil the meat parts with onions (red or [[Spanish onion]]), two garlic heads and some spring onions, until the meat is soft, separate and keep the stock in a bowl.

Chop the intestines and other meats in cubes; fry garlic and onions with a dash of oregano in oil or lard, add [[achiote]] (annato paste) and when these garnitures are fully fried add the intestines, rumen cubes and potatoes; and water; boil until potatoes are ready. Add some more potatoes, milk, salt, pepper and finely chopped [[coriander]].

In a separate frying pan over fry in oil the onion rings, spring onions, garlic and oregano; when ready add the clogged lamb or chicken blood.

Serve hot after mixing both the fried parts and the stock in a single pot. As a side dish some more fried blood, pickled onion rings, fine chopped coriander, ripe (soft) avocado and tomato slices can be served.
