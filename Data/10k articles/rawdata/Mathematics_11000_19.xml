{{for |non-archimedean analytic spaces |Berkovich space}}
An '''analytic space''' is a generalization of an [[analytic manifold]] that allows [[singularity (mathematics)|singularities]].  An analytic space is a space that is [[local property|locally]] the same as an [[analytic variety]].  They are prominent in the study of [[several complex variables]], but they also appear in other contexts.

== Definition ==
Fix a field ''k'' with a valuation.  Assume that the field is complete and not discrete with respect to this valuation.  For example, this includes '''R''' and '''C''' with respect to their usual absolute values, as well as fields of [[Puiseux series]] with respect to their natural valuations.

Let ''U'' be an open subset of ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be a collection of [[analytic function]]s on ''U''.  Denote by ''Z'' the common vanishing locus of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, let ''Z'' = { ''x'' | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ... = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = 0 }.  ''Z'' is an analytic variety.

Suppose that the structure [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of ''U'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_U&lt;/math&gt;.  Then ''Z'' has a structure sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_Z = \mathcal{O}_U / \mathcal{I}_Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_Z&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal generated by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In other words, the structure sheaf of ''Z'' consists of all functions on ''U'' modulo the possible ways they can differ outside of ''Z''.

An '''analytic space''' is a locally ringed space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt; such that around every point ''x'' of ''X'', there exists an open neighborhood ''U'' such that &lt;math&gt;(U, \mathcal{O}_U)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic (as locally ringed spaces) to an analytic variety with its structure sheaf.  Such an isomorphism is called a '''local model''' for ''X'' at ''x''.

An '''analytic mapping''' or '''morphism''' of analytic spaces is a morphism of locally ringed spaces.

This definition is similar to the definition of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  The only difference is that for a scheme, the local models are [[spectrum of a ring|spectra of rings]], whereas for an analytic space, the local models are analytic varieties.  Because of this, the basic theories of analytic spaces and of schemes are very similar.  Furthermore, analytic varieties have much simpler behavior than arbitrary commutative rings (for example, analytic varieties are defined over fields and are always finite-dimensional), so analytic spaces behave very similarly to finite-type schemes over a field.

== Basic results ==
Every point in an analytic space has a local dimension.  The dimension at ''x'' is found by choosing a local model at ''x'' and determining the local dimension of the analytic variety at the point corresponding to ''x''.

Every point in an analytic space has a [[tangent space]].  If ''x'' is a point of ''X'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ideal sheaf of all functions vanishing at ''x'', then the cotangent space at ''x'' is {{nowrap|''m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The tangent space is {{nowrap|(''m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the dual vector space to the cotangent space.  Analytic mappings induce pushforward maps on tangent spaces and pullback maps on cotangent spaces.

The dimension of the tangent space at ''x'' is called the '''[[embedding dimension]]''' at ''x''.  By looking at a local model it is easy to see that the dimension is always less than or equal to the embedding dimension.

== Smoothness ==
An analytic space is called '''smooth''' at ''x'' if it has a local model at ''x'' which is an open subset of ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''n''.  The analytic space is called smooth if it is smooth at every point, and in this case it is an [[analytic manifold]].  The subset of points at which an analytic space is not smooth is a closed analytic subset.

An analytic space is '''reduced''' if every local model for the space is defined by a radical sheaf of ideals.  An analytic space ''X'' which isn't reduced has a '''reduction''' ''X''&lt;sub&gt;red&lt;/sub&gt;, a reduced analytic space with the same underlying topological space.  There is a canonical morphism {{nowrap|''r'' : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;red&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''X''}}.  Every morphism from ''X'' to a reduced analytic space factors through ''r''.

An analytic space is '''normal''' if every stalk of the structure sheaf is a normal ring (meaning an integrally closed integral domain).  In a normal analytic space, the singular locus has codimension at least two.  When ''X'' is a local complete intersection at ''x'', then ''X'' is normal at ''x''.

Non-normal analytic spaces can be smoothed out into normal spaces in a canonical way.  This construction is called the '''normalization'''.  The normalization ''N''(''X'') of an analytic space ''X'' comes with a canonical map {{nowrap|&amp;nu; : ''N''(''X'') &amp;rarr; ''X''}}.  Every dominant morphism from a normal analytic space to ''X'' factors through &amp;nu;.

== Coherent sheaves ==
An analytic space is '''coherent''' if its structure sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[coherent sheaf]].  A coherent sheaf of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;-modules is called a '''coherent analytic sheaf'''.  For example, on a coherent space, locally free sheaves and sheaves of ideals are coherent analytic sheaves.

Analytic spaces over algebraically closed fields are coherent.  In the complex case, this is known as the [[Oka coherence theorem]].  This is not true over non-algebraically closed fields; there are examples of real analytic spaces that are not coherent.

== Generalizations ==
In some situations, the concept of an analytic space is too restrictive.  This is often because the ground field has additional structure that is not captured by analytic sets.  In these situations, there are generalizations of analytic spaces which allow more flexibility in the local model spaces.

For example, over the real numbers, consider the circle {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}.  The circle is an analytic subset of the analytic space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  But its projection onto the ''x''-axis is the closed interval {{nowrap|[&amp;minus;1, 1]}}, which is not an analytic set.  Therefore the image of an analytic set under an analytic map is not necessarily an analytic set.  This can be avoided by working with [[subanalytic set]]s, which are much less rigid than analytic sets but which are not defined over arbitrary fields.  The corresponding generalization of an analytic space is a subanalytic space.  (However, under mild [[point-set topology]] hypotheses, it turns out that subanalytic spaces are essentially equivalent to subanalytic sets.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7049">:''Not to be confused with [[Bootstrapping (corporate finance)]].''

In [[finance]], '''bootstrapping''' is a method for constructing a ([[Zero-coupon bond|zero-coupon]]) fixed-income [[yield curve]] from the prices of a set of coupon-bearing products, e.g. [[bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrapping.asp] A ''bootstrapped curve'', correspondingly, is one where the prices of the instruments used as an ''input'' to the curve, will be an exact ''output'', when these same instruments are [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|valued using this curve]].  Here, the term structure of spot returns is recovered from the bond yields by solving for them recursively, by [[forward substitution]]: this iterative process is called the ''bootstrap method''.  The usefulness of bootstrapping is that using only a few carefully selected zero-coupon products, it becomes possible to derive par [[swap (finance)|swap]] rates (forward and spot) for ''all'' maturities given the solved curve.

==General methodology==
{| class="wikitable floatright" | width="300"
|colspan="1" | ''Analytic Example:''
Given: 0.5 year spot rate, Z1 = 4%, 1 year spot rate, Z2 = 4.3% (we can get these rates from T-Bills which are zero-coupon, and serve as discount factors). We then use these rates to calculate the 1.5 year spot rate. Then, say, e.g. 1.5 year bond selling at Par, coupon = 4.5%, semi-annual. We solve the 1.5 year spot rate, Z3, by the formula below:
:&lt;math&gt;100 = {2.25 \over (1 + 4\% / 2)^1} + {2.25 \over (1 + 4.3\% / 2)^2} + {102.25 \over (1 + Z_3 / 2)^3} &lt;/math&gt;
We solve for &lt;math&gt;Z_3&lt;/math&gt; which is the 1.5 year spot rate.

As stated above, the selection of the input securities is important, given that there is a general lack of data points in a [[yield curve]] (there are only a fixed number of products in the market). More importantly, because the input securities have varying coupon frequencies, the selection of the input securities is critical. It makes sense to construct a curve of zero-coupon instruments from which one can price any yield, whether forward or spot, without the need of more external information.[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/wp00-17.pdf] Note that certain assumptions (e.g. [[linear interpolation]]) will always be required.

The general methodology is as follows: (1) Define the set of yielding products - these will generally be coupon-bearing bonds;  (2) Derive discount factors for the corresponding terms - these are the internal rates of return of the bonds; (3) 'Bootstrap' the zero-coupon curve, successively [[calibration|calibrating]] this curve such that it returns the prices of the inputs.  A generically stated [[algorithm]] for the third step is as follows; for more detail see [[Yield curve#Construction of the full yield curve from market data]].  For each input instrument:
*[[Closed-form expression#Analytic expression|solve analytically]] for all zero-rates where this possible (see side-bar example)
*[[root finding algorithm|iteratively solve]] for other rates (initially using an approximation) such that the price of the instrument in question is exactly made output when calculated using the curve
*once solved, save these rates, and proceed to the next instrument.

When solved as described here, the curve will be [[Arbitrage#Arbitrage-free pricing approach for bonds|arbitrage free]] in the sense that it is exactly consistent with the selected prices; see [[Rational pricing#Fixed income securities]] and [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach]]. Note that some analysts will instead construct the curve such that it results in a [[best-fit]] "through" the input prices, as opposed to an exact match, using a method such as [[Nelson-Siegel]].

Regardless of approach, however, there is a requirement that the curve be arbitrage-free in a second sense: that all [[forward rates]] are positive. More sophisticated methods for the curve construction — whether targeting an exact- or a best-fit — will additionally target [[Smoothness#Smoothness of piecewise defined curves and surfaces|curve "smoothness"]] as an output,[http://www.kamakuraco.com/Portals/0/doclibrary/KCP15.pdf][http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/HaganWest.pdf] and the choice of [[interpolation|interpolation method]] here, for rates not directly specified, will be important.

==Forward substitution==
A more detailed description of the forward substitution is as follows. For each stage of the iterative process, we are interested in deriving the n-year [[zero-coupon bond]] yield, also known as the [[internal rate of return]] of the zero-coupon bond. As there are no intermediate payments on this bond, (all the interest and principal is realized at the end of n years) it is sometimes called the n-year spot rate. To derive this rate we observe that the theoretical price of a bond can be calculated as the present value of the cash flows to be received in the future. In the case of swap rates, we want the par bond rate (Swaps are priced at par when created) and therefore we require that the present value of the future cash flows and principal be equal to 100%.

:&lt;math&gt;1 = C_{n} \cdot \Delta_1 \cdot df_{1} + C_{n} \cdot  \Delta_2 \cdot df_{2} + C_{n} \cdot  \Delta_3 \cdot df_{3} + \cdots + (1+ C_{n} \cdot \Delta_n  )   \cdot df_n &lt;/math&gt;
therefore
:&lt;math&gt;df_{n} = {(1 -  \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} C_{n} \cdot \Delta_i \cdot df_{i}) \over (1 +  C_{n} \cdot \Delta_n )}&lt;/math&gt;
(this formula is precisely [[forward substitution]])

:where
:* &lt;math&gt;C_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the coupon rate of the n-year bond 
:* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the length, or [[day count fraction]], of the period &lt;math&gt;[i - 1; i]&lt;/math&gt;, in years
:* &lt;math&gt;df_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the discount factor for that time period
:* &lt;math&gt;df_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the discount factor for the entire period, from which we derive the zero-rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13094">In [[mathematics]], a  [[group (mathematics)|group]] is called '''boundedly generated'''  if it can be expressed as a finite product of [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]]s. The property of bounded generation is also closely related with the [[congruence subgroup#Congruence subgroups and topological groups|congruence subgroup problem]] (see {{harvnb|Lubotzky|Segal|2003}}).

== Definitions ==

A group ''G'' is called ''boundedly generated'' if there exists a finite subset ''S'' of ''G'' and a positive integer ''m'' such that every element ''g'' of ''G'' can be represented as a product of at most ''m'' powers of the elements of ''S'':
 
: &lt;math&gt;g = s_1^{k_1} \cdots s_m^{k_m},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s_i \in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; are integers.

The finite set ''S'' generates ''G'', so  a boundedly generated group is [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]].

An equivalent definition can be given in terms of cyclic subgroups. A group ''G'' is called ''boundedly generated'' if there is a finite family ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; of not necessarily distinct [[cyclic group|cyclic]] subgroups such that ''G'' = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''C''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; as a set.

== Properties ==

* Bounded generation is unaffected by passing to a subgroup of [[index of a subgroup|finite index]]: if ''H'' is a finite index subgroup of ''G'' then ''G'' is boundedly generated if and only if ''H'' is boundedly generated.
* Any [[quotient group]] of a boundedly generated group is also boundedly generated.
* A [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] [[torsion group]] must be ''finite'' if it is boundedly generated; equivalently, an ''infinite'' finitely generated torsion group is not boundedly generated.

A ''pseudocharacter'' on a discrete group ''G'' is defined to be a real-valued function ''f'' on a ''G'' such that 
: ''f''(''gh'') &amp;minus; ''f''(''g'') &amp;minus; ''f''(''h'') is uniformly bounded and ''f''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''n''·''f''(''g'').

* The vector space of pseudocharacters of a boundedly generated group ''G'' is finite-dimensional.

== Examples ==
* If ''n'' ≥ 3, the group ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') is boundedly generated by its ''elementary subgroups,'' formed by matrices differing from the identity matrix only in one off-diagonal entry. In 1984, Carter and Keller gave an elementary proof of this result, motivated by a question in [[algebraic K-theory]].
* A [[free group]] on at least two generators is not boundedly generated (see below).
* The group ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') is not boundedly generated, since it contains a free subgroup with two generators of index 12.
* A [[Gromov-hyperbolic group]] is boundedly generated if and only if it is ''virtually cyclic'' (or ''elementary''), i.e. contains a cyclic subgroup of finite index.

== Free groups are not boundedly generated ==
Several authors have stated in the mathematical literature that it is obvious that finitely generated free groups are not boundedly generated. This section contains various obvious and less obvious ways of proving this. Some of the methods, which touch on bounded cohomology, are important because they are geometric rather than algebraic, so can be applied to a wider class of groups, for example Gromov-hyperbolic groups.

Since for any ''n'' ≥ 2, the [[free group]] on 2 generators ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  contains the free group on ''n'' generators ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as a subgroup of finite index (in fact ''n'' – 1), once one non-cyclic free group on finitely many generators is known to be not boundedly generated, this will be true for all of them. Similarly, since ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') contains  ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  as a subgroup of index 12, it is enough to consider ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z'''). In other words, to show that no ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''n'' ≥ 2 has bounded generation, it is sufficient to prove this for one of them or even just for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') .

===Burnside couterexamples===
Since bounded generation is preserved under taking homomorphic images, if a single finitely generated group with at least two generators is known to be not boundedly generated, this will be true for the free group on the same number of generators, and hence for all free groups. To show that no (non-cyclic) free group has bounded generation, it is therefore enough to produce one example of a finitely generated group which is not boundedly generated, and any finitely generated infinite [[torsion group]] will work. The existence of such groups constitutes [[Golod–Shafarevich theorem|Golod and Shafarevich]]'s negative solution of the [[Burnside problem|generalized Burnside problem]] in 1964; later, other explicit examples of infinite finitely generated torsion groups were constructed by Aleshin, Olshanskii, and Grigorchuk, using [[automata theory|automata]]. Consequently, free groups of rank at least two are not boundedly generated.

===Symmetric groups===
The [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be generated by two elements, a 2-cycle and an ''n''-cycle, so that it is a quotient group of  ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, it is easy to show that the maximal order ''M''(''n'') of an element in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies

: log ''M''(''n'') ≤ n/e

([[Edmund Landau]] proved the more precise asymptotic estimate log ''M''(''n'') ~ (''n'' log ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;).  In fact if the cycles in a [[cycle decomposition (group theory)|cycle decomposition]] of a [[permutation]] have length ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ··· + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'', then the order of the permutation divides the product ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ···''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn is bounded by (''n''/''k'')&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, using the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]]. On the other hand, (''n''/''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is maximized when ''x''=''e''. If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be written as a product of ''m'' cyclic subgroups, then necessarily ''n''! would have to be less than or equal to ''M''(''n'')&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''n'', contradicting [[Stirling's approximation|Stirling's asymptotic formula]].

===Hyperbolic geometry===
There is also a simple geometric proof that ''G'' = ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') is not boundedly generated. It acts by [[Möbius transformation]]s on the [[upper half-plane]] '''H''', with the [[Poincaré metric]]. Any [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[1-form]] α on a [[fundamental domain]] of ''G'' extends uniquely to a ''G''-invariant 1-form on '''H'''. If ''z'' is in '''H''' and γ is the [[geodesic]] from ''z'' to ''g''(''z''), the function defined by
 
:&lt;math&gt;  F(g)\equiv F_{\alpha,z}(g)=\int_{\gamma}\, \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies the first condition for a pseudocharacter since by the [[Stokes theorem]]
 
:&lt;math&gt;  F(gh) - F(g)-F(h) = \int_{\Delta}\, d\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ is the geodesic triangle with vertices ''z'', ''g''(''z'') and ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''z''), and geodesics triangles have area bounded by π. The homogenized function

:&lt;math&gt;f_\alpha(g) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} F_{\alpha,z}(g^n)/n&lt;/math&gt;

defines a pseudocharacter, depending only on α. As is well known from the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, any orbit (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''z'')) of a [[Möbius transformation#Hyperbolic transforms|hyperbolic element]] ''g'' has limit set consisting of two fixed points on the extended real axis; it follows that the geodesic segment from ''z'' to ''g''(''z'') cuts through only finitely many translates of the fundamental domain. It is therefore easy to choose α so that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; equals one on a given hyperbolic element and vanishes on a finite set of other hyperbolic elements with distinct fixed points. Since ''G'' therefore has an infinite-dimensional space of pseudocharacters, it cannot be boundedly generated.

Dynamical properties of hyperbolic elements can similarly be used to prove that any non-elementary Gromov-hyperbolic group is not boundedly generated.

===Brooks pseudocharacters===
Robert Brooks gave a combinatorial scheme to produce pseudocharacters of any free group ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; this scheme was later shown to yield
an infinite-dimensional family of pseudocharacters (see {{harvnb|Grigorchuk|1994}}). [[David B. A. Epstein|Epstein]] and Fujiwara later extended these results to all non-elementary Gromov-hyperbolic groups.

===Gromov boundary===
This simple [[folklore]] proof uses dynamical properties of the action of hyperbolic elements on the [[Gromov boundary]] of a [[Gromov-hyperbolic group]]. For the special case of the free group ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the boundary (or space of ends) can be identified with the space ''X'' of [[semi-infinite]] [[word (group theory)#Reduced words|reduced words]]

:''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ···

in the generators and their inverses. It gives a natural compactification of the [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], given by the [[Cayley graph]] with respect to the generators. A sequence of semi-infinite words converges to another such word provided that the initial segments agree after a certain stage, so that ''X'' is compact (and [[metrizable]]). The free group acts by left multiplication on the semi-infinite words. Moreover, any element ''g'' in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has exactly two fixed points ''g''&lt;sup&gt;±∞&lt;/sup&gt;, namely the reduced infinite words given by the limits of ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as ''n'' tends to ±∞. Furthermore, ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;·''w'' tends to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;±∞&lt;/sup&gt; as ''n'' tends to ±∞ for any semi-infinite word ''w''; and more generally if ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''w''≠ ''g''&lt;sup&gt; ±∞&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;·''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;+∞&lt;/sup&gt; as ''n'' tends to ∞.

If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; were boundedly generated, it could be written as a product of cyclic groups ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
generated by elements ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the countable subset given by the finitely many ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-orbits
of the fixed points ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; ±∞&lt;/sup&gt;, the fixed points of the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and all their conjugates. Since ''X'' is uncountable, there
is an element of ''g'' with fixed points outside ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a point ''w'' outside ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; different from these fixed points. Then for
some subsequence (''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of (''g''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)

:''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''(''m'',1)&lt;/sup&gt; ··· ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''(''m'',''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;, with each ''n''(''m'',''i'') constant or strictly monotone.

On the one hand, by successive use of the rules for computing limits of the form ''h''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;·''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the limit of the right hand side applied to ''x'' is necessarily a fixed point of one of the conjugates of the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s. On the other hand, this limit also must be ''g''&lt;sup&gt;+∞&lt;/sup&gt;, which is not one of these points, a contradiction.

The '''British Social Attitudes Survey''' ('''BSA''') is an annual [[statistical survey]] conducted in Great Britain by [[National Centre for Social Research]] since 1983.&lt;ref name=UKDA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=200006|title=British Social Attitudes Survey catalogue page]|publisher=UK Data Service|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSA involves in-depth interviews with over 3,300 respondents, selected using [[Survey sampling|random probability sampling]],&lt;ref name="NatCen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natcen.ac.uk/series/british-social-attitudes|title=British Social Attitudes|date=September 2011|publisher=National Centre for Social Research|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on topics including [[newspaper]] readership, [[political parties]] and trust, [[public expenditure]], [[welfare benefits]], [[health care]], [[childcare]], [[poverty]], the [[labour market]] and the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[education]], [[charity (practice)|charitable giving]], the [[countryside]], [[transport]] and the [[Environmental policy|environment]], the [[European Union]], [[economy|economic prospects]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[religion]], [[civil liberties]], [[immigration]], [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] and [[prison]]s, [[fear of crime]] and the portrayal of [[sex]] and [[violence]] in the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsa-30.natcen.ac.uk/ 30th British Social Attitudes report], NatCen Social Research, retrieved 8 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The survey is funded by the [[Gatsby Charitable Foundation]], [[government department]]s, [[QUANGO|quasi-governmental bodies]] and other grant-giving organisations. The BSA was not conducted in 1988 and 1992, when funding was devoted instead to studies of voting behaviour and political attitudes in the British Election Study.&lt;ref name=UKDA/&gt;

Champernowne constants can also be constructed in other bases, similarly, for example:
:{{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11011100101110111… &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
:{{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.12101112202122… &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The Champernowne constants can be expressed exactly as [[infinite series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{m}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac n{10_b^{~\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\left\lceil\log_{10_b}(k+1)\right\rceil\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lceil{x}\rceil =&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[ceil|ceiling(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;)]], &lt;math&gt;10_b^{~x}=b^x&lt;/math&gt;
in base 10, &lt;math&gt;\log_{10_b}(x)=\log_{b_{10}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the base of the constant.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Sikora: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0261 Analysis of the High Water Mark Convergents of Champernowne's Constant in Various Bases], in: arXiv:1408.0261, 1 Aug 2014, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0261 PDF], see Definition 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

A slightly different expression is given by Eric W. Weisstein ([[MathWorld]]):

:&lt;math&gt;C_{m}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac n{m^{\left(n+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\left\lfloor\log_m(k+1)\right\rfloor\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor{x}\rfloor =&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[floor function|floor(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;)]].

The [[Champernowne word]] or [[Barbier word]] is the sequence of digits of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last1 = Allouche | first1 = Jean-Paul | last2 = Shallit | first2 = Jeffrey | author2-link = Jeffrey Shallit | isbn = 978-0-521-82332-6 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | title = Automatic Sequences: Theory, Applications, Generalizations | year = 2003 | zbl=1086.11015 | page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Normality ==
A [[real number]] ''x'' is said to be [[normal number|normal]] if its digits in every base follow a uniform distribution: all digits being equally likely, all pairs of digits equally likely, all triplets of digits equally likely, etc. ''x'' is said to be normal in [[base (exponentiation)|base]] ''b'' if its digits in base b follow a uniform distribution.

If we denote a digit string as [''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...], then, in base ten, we would expect strings [0],[1],[2],...,[9] to occur 1/10 of the time, strings [0,0],[0,1],...,[9,8],[9,9] to occur 1/100 of the time, and so on, in a normal number.

Champernowne proved that &lt;math&gt;C_{10}&lt;/math&gt; is normal in base ten,&lt;ref name=Cha33&gt;{{harvnb|Champernowne|1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Nakai and Shiokawa proved a more general theorem, a corollary of which is that &lt;math&gt;C_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is normal for any base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nak92&gt;{{harvnb|Nakai|Shiokawa|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an open problem whether &lt;math&gt;C_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is normal in bases &lt;math&gt;b \neq k&lt;/math&gt;.

== Continued fraction expansion ==
[[Image:Champernowne constant.svg|right|300px|thumb|The first 161 quotients of the continued fraction of the Champernowne constant. The 4th, 18th, 40th, and 101st are (much) bigger than 270, so they don't appear in the graph.]]
[[Image:Champernowne constant logscale.svg|right|300px|thumb|The first 161 quotients of the continued fraction of the Champernowne constant represented using the [[logarithmic scale]].]]
The [[continued fraction|simple continued fraction]] expansion of Champernowne's constant has been studied as well. [[Kurt Mahler]] showed that the constant is [[transcendental number|transcendental]];&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;K.&amp;nbsp;Mahler, ''Arithmetische Eigenschaften einer Klasse von Dezimalbrüchen'', Proc. Konin. Neder. Akad. Wet. Ser. A. 40 (1937), p.&amp;nbsp;421–428.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore its continued fraction does not [[continued fraction#Finite continued fractions|terminate]] (because it is not [[rational number|rational]]) and is [[continued fraction#Periodic continued fractions|aperiodic]] (because it is not an irreducible quadratic).

The terms in the continued fraction expansion exhibit very erratic behaviour, with huge terms appearing between many small ones. For example, in base 10,
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = [0; 8, 9, 1, 149083, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 15,
:::4 57540 11139 10310 76483 64662 82429 56118 59960 39397 10457 55500 06620 04393 09026 26592 56314 93795 32077 47128 65631 38641 20937 55035 52094 60718 30899 84575 80146 98631 48833 59214 17830 10987,
:::6, 1, 1, 21, 1, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 7, 2, 1, 83, 1, 156, 4, 58, 8, 54, ...]. {{OEIS|id=A030167}}

The large number at position&amp;nbsp;19 has 166 digits, and the next very large term at position&amp;nbsp;41 of the continued fraction has 2504 digits. The fact that there are such large numbers as terms of the continued fraction expansion is equivalent to saying that the convergents obtained by stopping before these large numbers provide an exceptionally good [[diophantine approximation|approximation]] of the Champernowne constant. 

It can be understood from infinite series expression of &lt;math&gt;C_{10}&lt;/math&gt;: for a specified &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we can always approximate the sum over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  by setting the upper limit to  &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;10^n-1&lt;/math&gt;. Then we ignore the terms for higher &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. 

For example, if we keep lowest order of n, it is equivalent to truncating before the 4th partial quotient, we obtain the partial sum 

:&lt;math&gt;10/81 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n/10^n = 0.\overline{123456790}&lt;/math&gt;

which approximates Champernowne's constant with an error of about {{math|1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;}}. While truncating just before the 18th partial quotient, we get the approximation to second order:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{60499999499}{490050000000} &amp;= 0.123456789+10^{-9}\sum_{k=10}^\infty k/10^{2(k-9)}=0.123456789+10^{-9}\frac{991}{9801}\\
 &amp;= 0.123456789\overline{101112\ldots96979900010203040506070809},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which approximates Champernowne's constant with error approximately {{math|9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−190&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Irrationality measure==
The [[irrationality measure]] of &lt;math&gt;C_{10}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mu(C_{10})=10&lt;/math&gt;, and more generally &lt;math&gt;\mu(C_b)=b&lt;/math&gt; for any base &lt;math&gt;b\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Masaaki Amou]], ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X05800393 Approximation to certain transcendental decimal fractions by algebraic numbers]'', [[Journal of Number Theory]], Volume 37, Issue 2, February 1991, Pages 231–241&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5000">In [[mathematics]], two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s have a '''contact''' of order ''k'' if, at a point ''P'', they have the same value and ''k'' equal [[derivative]]s.  This is an [[equivalence relation]], whose equivalence classes are generally called [[Jet (mathematics)|jet]]s. The point of osculation is also called the [[double cusp]]. Contact is a geometric notion; it can be defined algebraically as a [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]].

One speaks also of [[curve]]s and geometric objects having ''k''-th order contact at a point: this is also called ''osculation'' (i.e. kissing), generalising the property of being [[tangent]].  (Here the derivatives are considered with respect to arc length.)  An [[osculating curve]] from a given family of curves is a curve that has the highest possible order of contact with a given curve at a given point; for instance a [[tangent line]] is an osculating curve from the family of lines, and has first-order contact with the given curve; an [[osculating circle]] is an osculating curve from the family of [[circle]]s, and has second-order contact (same tangent angle and curvature), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Geometry of Curves|first=J. W.|last=Rutter|publisher=CRC Press|year=2000|isbn=9781584881667|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlLpO8Sv8RMC&amp;pg=PA174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Contact form]]s are particular [[differential form]]s of degree 1 on odd-dimensional manifolds; see [[contact geometry]]. [[Contact transformation]]s are related changes of coordinates, of importance in [[classical mechanics]]. See also [[Legendre transformation]].

Contact between manifolds is often studied in [[singularity theory]], where the type of contact are classified, these include the ''A'' series (''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: crossing, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: tangent, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: osculating, ...) and the [[umbilic]] or ''D''-series where there is a high degree of contact with the sphere.

==Contact between curves==
Two curves in the plane intersecting at a point ''p'' are said to have:
*0th-order contact if the curves have a simple crossing (not tangent).
*1st-order contact if the two curves are [[tangent]].
*2nd-order contact if the [[curvature]]s of the curves are equal. Such curves are said to be osculating.
*3rd-order contact if the derivatives of the curvature are equal.
*4th-order contact if the second derivatives of the curvature are equal.

===Contact between a curve and a circle===
[[Image:TangentCircle.png|thumb|right|150px|A circle with 1st-order contact (tangent)]]
[[Image:OsculatingCircle2.png|thumb|right|150px|A circle with 2nd-order contact (osculating)]]
[[Image:VertexOfACurve.png|thumb|right|150px|A circle with 3rd-order contact at a vertex of a curve]]

For each point ''S''(''t'') on a [[smooth function|smooth]] plane curve ''S'', there is exactly one [[osculating circle]], whose radius is the reciprocal of κ(''t''), the curvature of ''S'' at ''t''.  Where curvature is zero (at an [[inflection point]] on the curve), the osculating circle is a straight line. The [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the centers of all the osculating circles (also called "centers of curvature") is the [[evolute]] of the curve.

If the derivative of curvature κ'(''t'') is zero, then the osculating circle will have 3rd-order contact and the curve is said to have a [[Vertex (curve)|vertex]]. The evolute will have a cusp at the center of the circle. The sign of the second derivative of curvature determines whether the curve has a local minimum or maximum of curvature. All closed curves will have at least four vertices, two minima and two maxima (the [[four-vertex theorem]]).

In general a curve will not have 4th-order contact with any circle. However, 4th-order contact can occur [[Generic point|generically]] in a 1-parameter family of curves, at a curve in the family where (as the parameter varies) two vertices (one maximum and one minimum) come together and annihilate. At such points the second derivative of curvature will be zero.

===Bi-tangents in econometrics===
In [[econometrics]] it is also possible to consider circles which have two point contact with two points ''S''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''S''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on the curve. Such circles are ''bi-tangent'' circles. The centers of all bi-tangent circles form the [[symmetry set]]. The [[medial axis]] is a subset of the symmetry set. These sets have been used as a method of characterising the shapes of biological objects by Mario Henrique Simonsen, Brazilian and English econometrist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">In mathematics, a '''contraharmonic mean''' is a function complementary to the [[harmonic mean]].  The contraharmonic [[mean]] is a [[special case]] of the [[Lehmer mean]], &lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt;, where p = 2.

== Definition ==

The contraharmonic mean of a set of positive numbers is defined as the [[arithmetic mean]] of the squares of the numbers divided by the arithmetic mean of the numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \operatorname{C}\left(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\right) &amp;= {{1 \over n} \left(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2\right) \over {1 \over n}\left(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n\right)}, \\[3pt]
                                     &amp;= {{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2} \over {x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==

It is easy to show that this satisfies the characteristic properties of a [[mean]]:
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{C}\left(x_1, x_2,\, \dots,\, x_n\right) \in \left[\min\left(x_1, x_2,\, \dots,\, x_n\right),\, \max\left(x_1, x_2,\, \dots,\, x_n\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{C}\left(t \cdot x_1, t \cdot x_2,\, \dots,\, t \cdot x_n\right) = t \cdot C\left(x_1, x_2,\, \dots,\, x_n\right)\text{ for }t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first property implies the ''fixed point property'', that for all ''k'' &gt; 0,
: '''C'''(''k'', ''k'', …, ''k'') = ''k''

The contraharmonic mean is higher in value than the [[arithmetic mean]] and also higher than the [[root mean square]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\min(\mathbf{x}) \leq \operatorname{H}(\mathbf{x}) \leq \operatorname{G}(\mathbf{x}) \leq \operatorname{L}(\mathbf{x}) \leq \operatorname{A}(\mathbf{x}) \leq \operatorname{R}(\mathbf{x}) \leq \operatorname{C}(\mathbf{x}) \leq \max(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''x''' is a list of values, '''H''' is the harmonic mean, '''G''' is [[geometric mean]], '''L''' is the [[logarithmic mean]], '''A''' is the [[arithmetic mean]], '''R''' is the [[root mean square]] and '''C''' is the contraharmonic mean.  Unless all values of '''x''' are the same, the ≤ signs above can be replaced by &lt;.

The name ''contraharmonic'' may be due to the fact that when taking the mean of only two variables, the contraharmonic mean is as high above the [[arithmetic mean]] as the arithmetic mean is above the harmonic mean (i.e., the arithmetic mean of the two variables is equal to the arithmetic mean of their harmonic and contraharmonic means).

==Two-variable formulae==

From the formulas for the arithmetic mean and harmonic mean of two variables we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \operatorname{A}(a, b) &amp;= {{a + b} \over 2} \\
  \operatorname{H}(a, b) &amp;= {1 \over {{1 \over 2} \cdot {\left({1 \over a} + {1 \over b}\right)}}} = {{2ab} \over {a + b}} \\
  \operatorname{C}(a, b) &amp;= 2 \cdot A(a ,b) - H(a, b) \\
                         &amp;= a + b - {{2ab} \over {a + b}} = {{(a + b)^2 - 2ab} \over {a + b}} \\
                         &amp;= {{a^2 + b^2} \over {a + b}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that for two variables the average of the harmonic and contraharmonic means is exactly equal to the arithmetic mean:

: '''A'''('''H'''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''), '''C'''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')) = '''A'''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')

As ''a'' gets closer to 0 then '''H'''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') also gets closer to&amp;nbsp;0.  The harmonic mean is very sensitive to low values.  On the other hand,  the contraharmonic mean is sensitive to larger values, so as ''a'' approaches 0 then '''C'''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') approaches ''b'' (so their average remains&amp;nbsp;'''A'''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')).

There are two other notable relationships between 2-variable means.  First, the geometric mean of the arithmetic and harmonic means is equal to the geometric mean of the two values:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \operatorname{G}(\operatorname{A}(a, b), \operatorname{H}(a, b)) = \operatorname{G}\left({{a + b} \over 2}, {{2ab} \over {a + b}}\right) =
  \sqrt{{{a + b}\over 2} \cdot {{2ab} \over {a + b}}} = \sqrt{ab} = \operatorname{G}(a, b)
&lt;/math&gt;

The second relationship is that the geometric mean of the arithmetic and contraharmonic means is the root mean square:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\operatorname{G}\left(\operatorname{A}(a, b), \operatorname{C}(a, b)\right)
  ={}  \operatorname{G}\left({{a + b} \over 2}, {{a^2 + b^2} \over {a + b}}\right) \\
  ={} &amp;\sqrt{{{a + b} \over 2} \cdot {{a^2 + b^2} \over {a + b}}}
  ={}  \sqrt{{{a^2 + b^2} \over 2}} \\[2pt]
  ={} &amp;\operatorname{R}(a, b)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The contraharmonic mean of two variables can be constructed geometrically using a trapezoid (see [http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2000/Umberger/EMAT6690smu/Essay3smu/Conharm.html]).

===Additional constructions===

The contraharmonic mean can be constructed on a circle similar to the way the [[Pythagorean means]] of two variables are constructed.  The contraharmonic is the remainder of the diameter on which the harmonic mean lies.

==Uses in statistics==

The contraharmonic mean of a random variable is equal to the sum of the arithmetic mean and the [[variance]] divided by the arithmetic mean.&lt;ref name=Kingley1989&gt;Kingley MSC (1989) The distribution of hauled out ringed seals an interpretation of Taylor's law. Oecologia 79: 106-110&lt;/ref&gt; Since the variance is always ≥0 the contraharmonic mean is always greater than or equal to the arithmetic mean.

The problem of a size biased sample was discussed by Cox in 1969 on a problem of sampling fibres. The [[expected value|expectation]] of size biased sample is equal to its contraharmonic mean.&lt;ref name=Zelen1972&gt;Zelen M (1972) Length-biased sampling and biomedical problems. In Biometric Society Meeting, Dallas, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability of a fibre being sampled is proportional to its length. Because of this the usual sample mean (arithmetic mean) is a biased estimator of the true mean. To see this consider

: &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{x f(x)}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''(''x'') is the true population distribution, ''g''(''x'') is the length weighted distribution and ''m'' is the sample mean. Taking the usual expectation of the mean here gives the contraharmonic mean rather than the usual (arithmetic) mean of the sample. This problem can be overcome by taking instead the expectation of the harmonic mean (1/''x''). The expectation and variance of 1/''x'' are

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left[ \frac{1}{x} \right] = \frac{1}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

and has variance

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{m E\left[\frac{1}{x} - 1\right]}{nm^2}&lt;/math&gt;  

where E[] is the expectation operator. Asymptotically E[1/''x''] is distributed normally.

The asymptotic efficiency of length biased sampling depends compared to random sampling on the underlying distribution. if ''f''(''x'') is [[log normal]] the efficiency is 1 while if the population is [[gamma distribution|gamma distributed]] with index ''b'', the efficiency is {{nowrap|''b''/(''b'' − 1)}}.

This distribution has been used in several areas.&lt;ref name=Keillor2001&gt;Keillor BD, D'Amico M &amp; Horton V (2001) Global Consumer Tendencies. Psychology &amp; Marketing 18(1) 1-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sudman1980&gt;Sudman (1980) Quota sampling techniques and  weighting procedures to correct for frequency bias&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The contraharmonic mean was discovered by the Greek mathematician [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxos]] in the 4th century BCE.

In [[group theory]], a sub-field of [[abstract algebra]], a group '''cycle graph''' illustrates the various [[cyclic group|cycle]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small [[finite group]]s. 

A cycle is the set of  powers of a given group element ''a'', where ''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', the ''n''-th power of an element ''a'' is defined as the product of ''a'' multiplied by itself ''n'' times. The element ''a'' is said to ''generate'' the cycle.  In a finite group, some non-zero power of ''a'' must be the  [[identity element|group identity]], ''e''; the lowest such power is the '''order''' of the cycle, the number of distinct elements in it. In a cycle graph, the cycle is represented as a polygon, with the vertices representing the group elements, and the connecting lines indicating that all elements in that polygon are members of the same cycle.

==Cycles==
Cycles can overlap, or they can have no element in common but the identity. The cycle graph displays each interesting cycle as a polygon.

If ''a'' generates a cycle of order 6 (or, more shortly, ''has'' order 6), then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''. Then the set of  powers of ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, {''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ''e''} is a cycle, but this is really no new information. Similarly, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; generates the same cycle as ''a'' itself.

So, only the ''primitive'' cycles need be considered, namely those that are not subsets of another cycle. Each of these is generated by some ''primitive element'', ''a''.  Take one [[vertex (graph theory)|point]] for each element of the original group. For each primitive element, connect ''e'' to ''a'', ''a'' to ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, etc., until ''e'' is reached. The result is the cycle graph.

When ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''a'' has order 2 (is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]), and is connected to ''e'' by two edges. Except when the intent is to emphasize the two edges of the cycle, it is typically drawn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ems/faculty/hart/publications/AffineWP.pdf |author=Sarah Perkins |year=2000 |title=Commuting Involution Graphs for A˜n, Section 2.2, p.3, first figure |publisher=School of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics |location=Birkbeck College, Malet Street, London, WC1E 7HX |accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a single line between the two elements.

As an example of a group cycle graph, consider the [[dihedral group]] Dih&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The multiplication table for this group is shown on the left, and the cycle graph is shown on the right with ''e'' specifying the identity element.

Notice the cycle ''e'', ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be seen from the multiplication table that successive powers of ''a''&amp;nbsp;behave this way. The reverse is also true. In other words: ({{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{nowrap|1=(''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}}, and {{nowrap|1=(''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}}. This behavior is true for any cycle in any group – a cycle may be traversed in either direction.

[[File:GroupDiagramQ8.svg|280px|thumb|Cycle graph of the quaternion group Q&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Cycles that contain a non-prime number of elements implicitly have cycles that are not shown in the graph. For the group  Dih&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; above, we might want to draw a line between ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''e'' since {{nowrap|1=(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}}, but since ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is part of a larger cycle, this is not done.

There can be ambiguity when two cycles share an element that is not the identity element. Consider for example, the simple [[quaternion group]], whose cycle graph is shown on the right. Each of the elements in the middle row when multiplied by itself gives −1 (where 1 is the identity element). In this case we may use different colors to keep track of the cycles, although symmetry considerations will work as well.

As noted earlier, the two edges of a 2-element cycle are typically represented as a single line.

The inverse of an element can be identified in the cycle graph in this fashion: It is the element whose distance from the identity is the same if going through the cycle in the opposite direction.

== History ==
Cycle graphs were investigated by the number theorist [[Daniel Shanks]] in the early 1950s as a tool to study [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative groups of residue classes]].{{sfn|Shanks|1978|p=246}} Shanks first published the idea in the 1962 first edition of his book ''Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory''.{{sfn|Shanks|1978|p=xii}} In the book, Shanks investigates which groups have isomorphic cycle graphs and when a cycle graph is [[planar graph|planar]].{{sfn|Shanks|1978|pp=83–98, 206–208}} In the 1978 second edition, Shanks reflects on his research on [[class group]]s and the development of the [[baby-step giant-step]] method:{{sfn|Shanks|1978|p=225}} {{quotation|The cycle graphs have proved to be useful when working with finite Abelian groups; and I have used them frequently in finding my way around an intricate structure [77, p. 852], in obtaining a wanted multiplicative relation [78, p. 426], or in isolating some wanted subgroup [79].}}

Cycle graphs are used as a pedagogical tool in Nathan Carter's 2009 introductory textbook ''Visual Group Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Nathan |last=Carter |year=2009 |title=Visual Group Theory |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |series=Classroom Resource Materials |isbn=978-0-88385-757-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Graph characteristics of particular group families ==

Certain group types give typical graphs:

[[Cyclic group]]s Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, order ''n'', is a single cycle graphed simply as an ''n''-sided polygon with the elements at the vertices:

[[Symmetric group]]s – The symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; contains, for any group of order ''n'', a subgroup isomorphic to that group. Thus the cycle graph of every group of order ''n'' will be found in the cycle graph of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

The [[Octahedral symmetry|full octahedral group]] is the cross product of the symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the cyclic group Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Its order is 48, and it has subgroups of every order that divides 48.

In the examples below nodes that are related to each other are placed next to each other,&lt;br&gt;
so these are not the simplest possible cycle graphs for these groups (like those on the right).

Like all graphs a cycle graph can be represented in different ways to emphasize different properties. The two representations of the cycle graph of S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are an example of that.

In [[mathematics]], a [[Diophantine equation]] is an equation of the form ''P''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)=0 (usually abbreviated ''P''(''{{overline|x}}'',''{{overline|y}}'')=0 ) where ''P''(''{{overline|x}}'',''{{overline|y}}'') is a polynomial  with integer [[coefficient]]s.  A '''Diophantine set''' is a [[set (mathematics)|subset]] ''S'' of '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/DiophantineSet.html Planet Math Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; so that for some [[Diophantine equation]] ''P''(''{{overline|x}}'',''{{overline|y}}'')=0,

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{n} \in S \iff (\exists \bar{m} \in \mathbb{N}^{k})(P(\bar{n},\bar{m})=0) .&lt;/math&gt;

That is, a parameter value is in the Diophantine set S [[if and only if]] the associated Diophantine equation is [[Satisfiability|satisfiable]] under that parameter value. Note that the use of natural numbers both in ''S'' and the existential quantification merely reflects the usual applications in computability and model theory.  We can equally well speak of Diophantine sets of integers and freely replace quantification over natural numbers with quantification over the integers.&lt;ref&gt;The two definitions are equivalent. This can be proved using [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; Also it is sufficient to assume ''P'' is a polynomial over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and multiply ''P'' by the appropriate denominators to yield integer coefficients.  However, whether quantification over rationals can also be substituted for quantification over the integers is a notoriously hard open problem.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Hilbert's tenth problem|The MRDP theorem]] states that a set of integers is Diophantine if and only if it is [[recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable]].&lt;ref&gt;The theorem was established in 1970 by Matiyasevich and is thus also known as Matiyasevich's theorem. However, the proof given by Matiyasevich relied extensively on previous work on the problem and the mathematical community has moved to calling the equivalence result the MRDP theorem or the Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem, a name which credits all the mathematicians that made significant contributions to this theorem.&lt;/ref&gt; A set of integers ''S'' is recursively enumerable if and only if there is an algorithm that, when given an integer, halts if that integer is a member of ''S'' and runs forever otherwise. This means that the concept of general Diophantine set, apparently belonging to [[number theory]], can be taken rather in logical or recursion-theoretic terms. This is far from obvious, however, and represented the culmination of some decades of work.

Matiyasevich's completion of the MRDP theorem settled [[Hilbert's tenth problem]]. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] tenth problem&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hilbert]] posed the problem in his celebrated list, from his 1900 address to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].&lt;/ref&gt; was to find a general [[algorithm]] which can decide whether a given Diophantine equation has a solution among the integers.  While Hilbert's tenth problem is not a formal mathematical statement as such, the nearly universal acceptance of the (philosophical) identification of a decision [[algorithm]] with a [[recursive set|total computable predicate]] allows us to use the MRDP theorem to conclude that the tenth problem is unsolvable.

==Examples==
The [[Pell equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2-d(y+1)^2= 1&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of a Diophantine equation with a parameter. The equation has a solution in the unknowns &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; precisely when the parameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is 0 or not a [[square number|perfect square]]. Namely, this equation provides a '''Diophantine definition''' of the set

:{0,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,...}

consisting of 0 and the natural numbers that are not perfect squares. 

Other examples of Diophantine definitions are as follows:
* The equation &lt;math&gt;a =(2x+3)y&lt;/math&gt; only has solutions in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; when ''a'' is not a power of 2.
* The equation &lt;math&gt;a=(x+2)(y+2)&lt;/math&gt; only has solutions in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; when ''a'' is greater than 1 and is not a [[prime number]].
* The equation &lt;math&gt;a+x=b&lt;/math&gt; defines the set of pairs &lt;math&gt;(a\,,\,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\le b.&lt;/math&gt;

==Matiyasevich's theorem==

Matiyasevich's theorem, also called the [[Yuri Matiyasevich|Matiyasevich]]–[[Julia Robinson|Robinson]]–[[Martin Davis|Davis]]–[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] or MRDP theorem, says:

:Every [[recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable set]] is Diophantine.

A set ''S'' of integers is '''[[recursively enumerable|computably enumerable]]''' if there is an algorithm such that: For each integer input ''n'', if ''n'' is a member of ''S'', then the algorithm eventually halts; otherwise it runs forever.  That is equivalent to saying there is an algorithm that runs forever and lists the members of ''S''.  A set ''S'' is '''Diophantine''' precisely if there is some [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients ''f''(''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)
such that an integer ''n'' is in ''S'' if and only if there exist some integers
''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
such that ''f''(''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.

Conversely, every Diophantine set is [[recursively enumerable|computably enumerable]]:
consider a Diophantine equation ''f''(''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.
Now we make an algorithm which simply tries all possible values for
''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (in, say, some simple order consistent with the increasing order of the sum of their absolute values),
and prints ''n'' every time ''f''(''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.
This algorithm will obviously run forever and will list exactly the ''n''
for which ''f''(''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 has a solution
in ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Proof technique===

[[Yuri Matiyasevich]] utilized a method involving [[Fibonacci number]]s, which [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]], in order to show that solutions to Diophantine equations may [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]]. Earlier work by [[Julia Robinson]], [[Martin Davis]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] – hence, MRDP – had shown that this suffices to show that every [[recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable set]] is Diophantine.

==Application to Hilbert's tenth problem==
[[Hilbert's tenth problem]] asks for a general algorithm deciding the solvability of Diophantine equations. The conjunction of Matiyasevich's result with earlier results, collectively now termed the MRDP theorem, implies that a solution to Hilbert's tenth problem is impossible.

===Refinements===

Later work has shown that the question of solvability of a Diophantine equation is undecidable even if the equation only has 9 natural number variables (Matiyasevich, 1977) or 11 integer variables ([[Zhi Wei Sun]], 1992).

==Further applications==

Matiyasevich's theorem has since been used to prove that many problems from [[calculus]] and [[differential equation]]s are unsolvable.

One can also derive the following stronger form of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]] from Matiyasevich's result:

:''Corresponding to any given consistent axiomatization of number theory,&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, given a [[arithmetical hierarchy#The arithmetical hierarchy of formulas|&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;-formula]] representing the set of [[Gödel number]]s of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] which recursively axiomatize a [[consistency|consistent]] [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] extending [[Robinson arithmetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; one can explicitly construct a Diophantine equation which has no solutions, but such that this fact cannot be proved within the given axiomatization.''

According to the [[incompleteness theorem]]s, a powerful-enough consistent axiomatic theory is incomplete, meaning the truth of some of its propositions cannot be established within its formalism. The statement above says that this incompleteness must include the solvability of a diophantine equation, assuming that the theory in question is a number theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5293">In [[mathematics]] the '''division polynomials''' provide a way to calculate multiples of points on [[elliptic curves]] and to study the fields generated by torsion points. They play a central role in the study of [[counting points on elliptic curves]] in [[Schoof's algorithm]].

== Definition ==
The set of division polynomials is a sequence of [[polynomials]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[x,y,A,B]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x, y, A, B&lt;/math&gt; free variables that is recursively defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{0} = 0  &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{2} = 2y&lt;/math&gt;
 
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{3} = 3x^{4} + 6Ax^{2} + 12Bx - A^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
  
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{4} = 4y(x^{6} + 5Ax^{4} + 20Bx^{3} - 5A^{2}x^{2} - 4ABx - 8B^{2} - A^{3}) &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;
 
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{2m+1} =  \psi_{m+2} \psi_{m}^{ 3}  -  \psi_{m-1} \psi ^{ 3}_{ m+1} \text{ for } m \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;
 
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{ 2m} =  \left ( \frac { \psi_{m}}{2y} \right ) \cdot ( \psi_{m+2}\psi^{ 2}_{m-1} -  \psi_{m-2} \psi ^{ 2}_{m+1})   \text{ for } m \geq 3&lt;/math&gt;

The polynomial &lt;math&gt;\psi_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; division polynomial.

== Properties ==
*In practice, one sets &lt;math&gt;y^2=x^3+Ax+B&lt;/math&gt;, and then &lt;math&gt;\psi_{2m+1}\in\mathbb{Z}[x,A,B]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_{2m}\in 2y\mathbb{Z}[x,A,B]&lt;/math&gt;.
* The division polynomials form a generic [[elliptic divisibility sequence]] over the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[x,y,A,B]/(y^2-x^3-Ax-B)&lt;/math&gt;.
*If an [[elliptic curve]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is given in the [[Weierstrass form]] &lt;math&gt;y^2=x^3+Ax+B&lt;/math&gt; over some field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A, B\in K&lt;/math&gt;, one can use these values of &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; and consider the division polynomials in the [[Imaginary hyperelliptic curve#Coordinate ring|coordinate ring]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. The roots of &lt;math&gt;\psi_{2n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates of the points of &lt;math&gt;E[2n+1]\setminus \{O\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E[2n+1]&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(2n+1)^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; [[torsion subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the roots of &lt;math&gt;\psi_{2n}/y&lt;/math&gt; are the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates of the points of &lt;math&gt;E[2n]\setminus E[2]&lt;/math&gt;.
*Given a point &lt;math&gt;P=(x_P,y_P)&lt;/math&gt; on the elliptic curve &lt;math&gt;E:y^2=x^3+Ax+B&lt;/math&gt; over some field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, we can express the coordinates of the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; multiple of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in terms of division polynomials:
::&lt;math&gt;nP=  \left ( \frac{\phi_{n}(x)}{\psi_{n}^{2}(x)}, \frac{\omega_{n}(x,y)}{\psi^{3}_{n}(x,y)} \right) =  \left( x - \frac {\psi_{n-1} \psi_{n+1}}{\psi^{2}_{n}(x)}, \frac{\psi_{2 n}(x,y)}{2\psi^{4}_{n}(x)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;\phi_{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\phi_{n}=x\psi_{n}^{2} - \psi_{n+1}\psi_{n-1},&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_{n}=\frac{\psi_{n+2}\psi_{n-1}^{2}-\psi_{n-2}\psi_{n+1}^{2}}{4y}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relation between &lt;math&gt;\psi_{2m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi _{2m + 1}&lt;/math&gt;, along with the equation of the curve, the functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_{n}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\frac{\psi_{2n}}{y}, \psi_{2n + 1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are all in &lt;math&gt;K[x]&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;p&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; be prime and let &lt;math&gt;E:y^2=x^3+Ax+B&lt;/math&gt; be an [[elliptic curve]] over the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;A,B \in \mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-torsion group of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \mathbb{F}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic (mathematics)|isomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/\ell \times \mathbb{Z}/\ell&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\ell\neq p&lt;/math&gt;, and to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/\ell &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\ell=p&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the degree of &lt;math&gt;\psi_\ell&lt;/math&gt; is equal to either &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(l^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(l-1)&lt;/math&gt;, or 0.

[[René Schoof]] observed that working modulo the &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;''th'' division polynomial allows one to work with all &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-torsion points simultaneously. This is heavily used in [[Schoof's algorithm]] for counting points on elliptic curves.

'''Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker''', [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], [[Royal Society|FRS]] (14 June 1868&amp;nbsp;– 4 November 1958) was an English [[physicist]] and [[statistician]] of the 20th century. Walker studied mathematics and applied it to a variety of fields including aerodynamics, electromagnetism and the analysis of time-series data before taking up a teaching position at Cambridge University. Although he had no experience in meteorology, he was recruited for a post in the Indian Meteorological Department where he worked on statistical approaches to predict the monsoons. He developed the methods in the analysis of time-series data that are now called the Yule-Walker equations. He is known for his groundbreaking description of the [[El Niño|Southern Oscillation]], a major phenomenon of global [[climate]], and for discovering what is named after him as the [[Walker circulation]], and for greatly advancing the [[climatology|study of climate]] in general. He was also instrumental in aiding the early career of the Indian mathematical prodigy, [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]] on 14 June 1868, the fourth child and eldest son of Thomas Walker and Elizabeth Charlotte Haslehurst. Thomas was Borough Engineer of Croydon and had pioneered the use of concrete for town reservoirs. He attended [[Whitgift School]] where he showed an interest in mathematics and got a scholarship to study at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]]. He obtained a degree in Metallurgy from [[Imperial College London]] and attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he was [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1889. His hard studies led to ill-health and he spent several winters recuperating in Switzerland where he learnt skating and became quite expert. He became a lecturer at Trinity College from 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLKR885GT|name=Walker, Gilbert Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;&lt;ref name=frs /&gt;

==Career==
Walker was an established applied mathematician at the [[University of Cambridge]] when he took up a position as assistant to the meteorological reporter in 1903. He was elevated to the position of director general of observatories in India in 1904.&lt;ref name="IndianBio"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian Biographical Dictionary|editor=C. Hayavadana Rao|publisher=Pillai &amp; Co.|location=Madras|date=1915|page=456|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Indian_Biographical_Dictionary_%281915%29/Walker,_Gilbert_Thomas|accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker had never worked on meteorology but the previous director of the Indian Meteorological Department, John Eliot. Another predecessor in the [[Indian Meteorological Department]], [[Henry Francis Blanford]], had noticed the pattern that the summer monsoon in India and Burma was correlated with the spring snow cover in the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Connexion of the Himalaya Snowfall with Dry Winds and Seasons of Drought in India |author=Blanford, H.F.|year=1884| pages=3–22| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=37| url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/37/232-234/3.full.pdf| doi=10.1098/rspl.1884.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the failure of the [[Indian Ocean]] [[monsoon]] had brought severe [[famine]] to the country in 1899 and meteorology had great economic value. Walker developed Blanford's idea with quantitative rigour and came up with correlation measures (with a lag) and regression equations (or in time-series terminology, autoregression). He set up a group of Indian clerks to calculate correlations between weather parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Walker, G.T.|year=1923| title= Correlation in seasonal variability of weather, VIII. A preliminary study of world weather.| journal=Memoirs of the India Meteorological Department| volume=24| pages=75–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods he introduced for time-series regression are now partly named after him (the other contributor was [[Udny Yule]] who studied sun-spot cycles) as the Yule-Walker equations.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Statistical Science| year=2002| volume=17| issue=1| pages=97–112| title= Sir Gilbert Walker and a Connection between El Niño and Statistics| author=Katz, Richard W.| url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1023799000| doi=10.1214/ss/1023799000| citeseerx=10.1.1.506.8097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyzing vast amounts of weather data from India and lands beyond, over the next fifteen years he published the first descriptions of the great seesaw oscillation of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[pressure]] between the Indian and [[Pacific Ocean]], and its correlation to [[temperature]] and [[rain]]fall patterns across much of the Earth's tropical regions, including India. This is now called the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Khandekar, M.L.| year=1991| title= Eurasian snow cover, Indian monsoon and El Niño/Southern Oscillation – a synthesis| journal= Atmosphere-Ocean| volume= 29| issue=4| pages= 636–647| doi=10.1080/07055900.1991.9649422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society| title=World Weather| author=Walker, Gilbert| volume=54| issue=226| year=1928|pages=79–87| doi=10.1002/qj.49705422601}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Star of India]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="IndianBio" /&gt;

Walker also took an interest in several other fields. He made mathematical studies on bird flight and boomerangs. His interest in boomerangs came early in undergraduate years and he had earned the nickname of "Boomerang Walker". In Simla, he used to throw a boomerang on the grounds of Annadale attracting the attention even of the Viceroy of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walker, G.|year=1897| title=On boomerangs.| journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A | volume=190|pages=23–42|jstor=90722}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found faults in the ideas on bird flight by [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], fellow Cambridge scientist at Simla, and pointed out that ascending thermals had enough energy to support the soaring of birds and also pointed out the role of turbulent eddies in providing lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walker, G|year=1923| title=Meteorology and the non-flapping flight of tropical birds. |journal=Proc.

He was also an expert on the history and evolution of the flute. He made some design changes to flutes and these went into manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Sheppard, P.A. |year= 1959| title= Obituary of Sir Gilbert Walker, CSI, FRS. | journal= Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society| volume=85| issue=364| page=186 | doi = 10.1002/qj.49708536423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a watercolour artist and while at Simla, held an exhibition of his works.&lt;ref name=pen /&gt;

==Retirement to England==
Walker continued his studies of yearly weather and climate change even after his retirement from India (in 1924 when he was knighted) and acceptance of a professorship in meteorology at [[Imperial College London]]. He had only mixed success in his original goal, the prediction of monsoonal failures; however, his theories and broad body of supporting research represented an invaluable step forward, allowing his successors in climate study to move beyond local observation and forecasting toward comprehensive models of climate worldwide. He served as president of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] from 1926 to 1927.

Walker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1904, long before his work on meteorology on the strength of his work in applied mathematics and applications to electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=katz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/aberrationandso00walkgoog#page/n6/mode/2up|title=Aberration and some other problems connected with the electromagnetic field|author=Walker, Gilbert T.|year=1900| publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, with his talent for mathematics, was among the first to recognize the abilities of the Indian mathematical prodigy [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and wrote a letter to the University of Madras to support a scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Bull. London Math. Soc. |year=1984| volume= 16 |issue=5|pages= 449–489|doi=10.1112/blms/16.5.449|author=Berndt, Bruce C.| title=Ramanujan's Quarterly Reports }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker's interest in a wide range of subjects made him note the growing insularity of specialists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walker, G.T.| year=1927| title=Review of "Climate through the Ages. A  Study  of  Climatic  Factors  and  Climatic  Variations"  by C. E. P. Brooks| journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=53|pages=321–323| doi=10.1002/qj.49705322311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is, to-day, always a risk that specialists in two subjects, using languages full of words that are unintelligible without study, will grow up not only, without knowledge  of  each  other's  work,  but  also  will ignore the problems which require mutual assistance.}}

Walker married Mary Constance Carter in 1908 and they had a son, Michael Ashley, and a daughter, Verity Micheline. He died at [[Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]] on 4 November 1958. He was 90 years old.&lt;ref name=pen /&gt; The Walker Institute in the United Kingdom, established to study climate, is named in his honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6020">In [[number theory]], the '''home prime''' '''HP'''(''n'') of an [[integer]] ''n'' greater than 1 is the [[prime number|prime]] obtained by repeatedly [[Integer factorization|factoring]] the increasing [[Concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] of [[prime factor]]s including repetitions.  The ''m''th intermediate stage in the process of determining HP(''n'') is designated '''HPn'''(''m'').  For instance, HP(10)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;773, as 10 factors as 2&amp;times;5 yielding HP10(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;25, 25 factors as 5&amp;times;5 yielding HP10(2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP25(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;55, 55&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5&amp;times;11 implies HP10(3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP25(2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP55(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;511, and 511&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7&amp;times;73 gives HP10(4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP25(3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP55(2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP511(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;773, a prime number.  Some sources use the alternative notation '''HPn''' for the homeprime, leaving out parentheses.  Investigations into home primes make up a minor side issue in number theory.  Its questions have served as test fields for the implementation of efficient [[algorithm]]s for factoring [[composite number]]s, but the subject is really one in [[recreational mathematics]].

The outstanding computational problem {{as of|2016|lc=on}} is whether HP(49)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;HP(77) can be calculated in practice.  As each iteration is greater than the previous up until a prime is reached, factorizations generally grow more difficult so long as an end is not reached. {{As of|2016|August}} the pursuit of HP(49) concerns the factorization of a 251-digit [[composite number|composite]] factor of HP49(119) after a break was achieved on 3 December 2014 with the calculation of HP49(117).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WraithX|title=HP49(100)...|url=http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=389048#post389048|work=mersenneforum.org|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed the factorization of HP49(110) on September 8 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WraithX|title=HP49(100)...|url=http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=310715#post310715|work=mersenneforum.org|date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of HP49(104) on 11 January 2011, and prior calculations extending for the larger part of a decade that made extensive use of computational resources.  Details of the history of this search, as well as the sequences leading to home primes for all other numbers through 100, are maintained at [[Patrick De Geest]]'s [[worldofnumbers]] website.  A [[wiki]] primarily associated with the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] maintains the complete known data through 1000 in [[base 10]] and also has lists for the bases 2 through&amp;nbsp;9.

The primes in HP(n) are
:1, 2, 3, 211, 5, 23, 7, 3331113965338635107, 311, 773, 11, 223, 13, 13367, 1129, 31636373, 17, 233, 19, 3318308475676071413, 37, 211, 23, 331319, 773, 3251, 13367, 227, 29, 547, ... {{OEIS|id=A037274}}

Aside from the computational problems that have had so much time devoted to them, it appears absolute proof of [[existence]] of a home prime for any specific number might entail its effective computation.  In purely [[heuristic]] terms, the existence has probability 1 for all numbers, but such heuristics make assumptions about numbers drawn from a wide variety of processes that, though they likely are correct, fall short of the standard of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] usually required of mathematical claims.

== Early history and additional terminology ==
While it is unlikely that the idea was not conceived of numerous times in the past, the first reference in print appears to be an article written in 1990 in a small and now-defunct publication called ''Recreational and Educational Computation''.  The same person who authored that article, Jeffrey Heleen, revisited the subject in the 1996–7 volume of the [[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]] in an article entitled ''Family Numbers:  Constructing Primes By Prime Factor Splicing'', which included all of the results HP(''n'') for ''n'' through 100 other than the ones still unresolved.  It also included a now-obsolete list of 3-digit unresolved numbers (The 58 listed have been cut precisely in half as of August 2012).  It appears that this article is largely responsible for provoking attempts by others to resolve the case involving 49 and&amp;nbsp;77.  The article uses the terms ''daughter'' and ''parent'' to describe composites and the primes that they lead to, with numbers leading to the same home prime called ''siblings'' (even if one is an iterate of another), and calls the number of iterations required to reach a parent, the [[persistence of a number]] under the map to obtain a home prime, the number of ''lives''.  The brief article does little other than state the origins of the subject, define terms, give a couple of examples, mention machinery and methods used at the time, and then provide tables.  It appears that Mr. De Geest is responsible for the notation now in use.  The [[OEIS]] also uses ''homeliness'' as the term for the number of numbers, including the prime itself, that have a certain prime as its home prime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59020">This article examines the implementation of mathematical concepts in [[set theory]]. The implementation of a number of basic mathematical concepts is carried out in parallel in [[ZFC]] (the dominant set theory) and in [[New Foundations|NFU]], the version of Quine's [[New Foundations]] shown to be consistent by [[R. B. Jensen]] in 1969 (here understood to include at least axioms of Infinity and Choice).

What is said here applies also to two families of set theories: on the one hand, a range of theories including [[Zermelo set theory]] near the lower end of the scale and going up to ZFC extended with [[large cardinal property|large cardinal]] hypotheses such as "there is a [[measurable cardinal]]"; and on the other hand a hierarchy of extensions of NFU which is surveyed in the [[New Foundations]] article. These correspond to different general views of what the set-theoretical universe is like, and it is the approaches to implementation of mathematical concepts under these two general views that are being compared and contrasted.

It is not the primary aim of this article to say anything about the relative merits of these theories as foundations for mathematics. The reason for the use of two different set theories is to illustrate that multiple approaches to the implementation of mathematics are feasible. Precisely because of this approach, this article is not a source of "official" definitions for any mathematical concept.

==Preliminaries==

The following sections carry out certain constructions in the two theories [[ZFC]] and [[New Foundations|NFU]] and compare the resulting implementations of certain mathematical structures (such as the natural numbers).

Mathematical theories prove theorems (and nothing else). So saying that a theory allows the construction of a certain object means that it is a theorem of that theory that that object exists. This is a statement about a definition of the form "the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; exists", where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of our language: the theory proves the existence of "the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;" just in case it is a theorem that "there is one and only one x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;". (See [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[theory of descriptions]].) Loosely, the theory "defines" or "constructs" this object in this case. If the statement is not a theorem, the theory cannot show that the object exists; if the statement is provably false in the theory, it proves that the object cannot exist; loosely, the object cannot be constructed.

ZFC and NFU share the language of set theory, so the same formal definitions "the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;" can be contemplated in the two theories. A specific form of definition in the language of set theory is set-builder notation: &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; means "the set A such that for all x, &lt;math&gt;x \in A \leftrightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt;" (A cannot be free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). This notation admits certain conventional extensions: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in B \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; is synonymous with &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \in B \wedge \phi\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\{z \mid \exists x_1,\ldots,x_n\,(z=f(x_1,\dots,x_n) \wedge \phi)\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an expression already defined.

Expressions definable in set-builder notation make sense in both ZFC and NFU: it may be that both theories prove that a given definition succeeds, or that neither do (the expression &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x\not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; fails to refer to anything in ''any'' set theory with classical logic; in class theories like [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] this notation does refer to a class, but it is defined differently), or that one does and the other doesn't. Further, an object defined in the same way in ZFC and NFU may turn out to have different properties in the two theories (or there may be a difference in what can be proved where there is no provable difference between their properties).

Further, set theory imports concepts from other branches of mathematics (in intention, ''all'' branches of mathematics). In some cases, there are different ways to import the concepts into ZFC and NFU. For example, the usual definition of the first infinite ordinal &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in ZFC is not suitable for NFU because the object (defined in purely set theoretical language as the set of all finite von Neumann ordinals) cannot be shown to exist in NFU. The usual definition of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in NFU is (in purely set theoretical language) the set of all infinite well-orderings all of whose proper initial segments are finite, an object which can be shown not to exist in ZFC. In the case of such imported objects, there may be different definitions, one for use in ZFC and related theories, and one for use in NFU and related theories. For such "implementations" of imported mathematical concepts to make sense, it is necessary to be able to show that the two parallel interpretations have the expected properties: for example, the implementations of the natural numbers in ZFC and NFU are different, but both are implementations of the same mathematical structure, because both include definitions for all the primitives of Peano arithmetic and satisfy (the translations of) the Peano axioms. It is then possible to compare what happens in the two theories as when only set theoretical language is in use, as long as the definitions appropriate to ZFC are understood to be used in the [[ZFC]] context and the definitions appropriate to NFU are understood to be used in the NFU context.

Whatever is proven to exist in a theory clearly provably exists in any extension of that theory; moreover, analysis of the proof that an object exists in a given theory may show that it exists in weaker versions of that theory (one may consider [[Zermelo set theory]] instead of [[ZFC]] for much of what is done in this article, for example).

== Empty set, singleton, unordered pairs and tuples ==
These constructions appear first because they are the simplest constructions in set theory, not because they are the first constructions that come to mind in mathematics (though the notion of finite set is certainly fundamental!)  
Even though NFU also allows the construction of set [[Urelement|ur-elements]] yet to become members of a set, the [[empty set]] is the unique ''set'' with no members:  
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\varnothing\right. \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \left\{x : x \neq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
For each object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there is a set &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as its only element:  
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{x\right\} \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \left\{y : y = x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
For objects &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, there is a set &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as its only elements:  
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{x,y\right\} \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \left\{z : z=x \vee z = y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
The union of two sets is defined in the usual way:  
:&lt;math&gt;\left.x \cup y\right. \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \left\{z : z \in x \vee z \in y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
This is a recursive definition of unordered &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples for any concrete &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (finite sets given as lists of their elements:)  
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{x_1, \ldots, x_n, x_{n+1}\right\} \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \left\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\right\} \cup \left\{x_{n+1}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
In [[New Foundations|NFU]], all the set definitions given work by stratified comprehension; in [[ZFC]], the existence of the unordered pair is given by the axiom of Pairing, the existence of the empty set follows by Separation from the existence of any set, and the boolean union of two sets exists by the axioms of Pairing and Union (&lt;math&gt;x \cup y = \bigcup\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt;).

== Ordered pair ==
{{main article|Ordered pair}}
First, consider the '''ordered pair'''. The reason that this comes first is technical: ordered pairs are needed to implement [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] which are needed to implementat other concepts which may seem to be prior.
The first definition of the ordered pair was the definition &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \overset{\mathrm{def}}{=} \{\{\{x\},\emptyset\},\{\{y\}\}\}&lt;/math&gt; proposed by [[Norbert Wiener]] in 1914 in the context of the type theory of [[Principia Mathematica]]. Wiener observed that this allowed the elimination of types of n-ary relations for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; from the system of that work.
It is more usual now to use the definition &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, due to [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]].
Either of these definitions works in either [[ZFC]] or [[New Foundations|NFU]]. In NFU, these two definitions have a technical disadvantage: the Kuratowski ordered pair is two types higher than its projections, while the Wiener ordered pair is three types higher. It is common to postulate the existence of a type-level ordered pair (a pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; which is the same type as its [[Projection (mathematics)|projections]]) in NFU. It is convenient to use the Kuratowski pair in both systems until the use of type-level pairs can be formally justified.
The internal details of these definitions have nothing to do with their actual mathematical function. For any notion &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; of ordered pair, the things that matter are that it satisfy the defining condition:
* &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(z,w) \equiv x=z \wedge y=w&lt;/math&gt;
…and that it be reasonably easy to collect ordered pairs into sets.

== Relations ==
[[Relation (mathematics)|Relations]] are sets whose members are all [[ordered pair]]s. Where possible, a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (understood as a [[binary predicate]]) is implemented as &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \mid x R y\}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be written as &lt;math&gt;\{z \mid \pi_1(z) R \pi_2(z)\}&lt;/math&gt;). Where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ordered pairs, read &lt;math&gt;xRy&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\left(x, y\right) \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[ZFC]], some relations (such as the general equality relation or subset relation on sets) are 'too large'
to be sets (but may be harmlessly reified as [[proper class]]es). In [[New Foundations|NFU]], some relations (such as the membership relation) are not sets because their definitions are not stratified: in &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \mid x \in y\}&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would
need to have the same type (because they appear as projections of the same pair), but also
successive types (because &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is considered as an element of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Related definitions ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be given [[binary relation]]s. Then the following concepts are useful:

The '''[[converse relation|converse]]''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the relation &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(y, x\right) : xRy\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''domain''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{x : \exists y \left(xRy\right)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''range''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the domain of the converse of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''field''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the domain and range of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''[[preimage]]''' of a member &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{y : yRx\right\}&lt;/math&gt; (used in the definition of 'well-founded' below.)

The '''downward closure''' of a member &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and containing each &lt;math&gt;zRy&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;y \in D&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., including the preimage of each of its elements with respect to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as a subset.)

The '''[[relation composition|relative product]]''' &lt;math&gt;R|S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the relation &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(x, z\right) : \exists y\,\left(xRy \wedge ySz\right)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[ZFC]], one proves that these notions all generate or apply to sets via the [[ZFC]] axioms of ''[[axiom of union|union]]'', ''[[axiom of separation|separation]]'', and ''[[axiom of power set|power set]]''. In [[New Foundations|NFU]], it is easy to check that these definitions give rise to stratified formulas.

Notice that the range and codomain of a relation are not distinguished: this could be done by representing a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with codomain &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\left(R, B\right)&lt;/math&gt;, but our development will not require this.

In [[ZFC]], any relation whose domain is a subset of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and whose range is a subset of a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; will be a set, since the [[cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;A \times B = \left\{\left(a, b\right) : a \in A \wedge b \in B\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set (being a subclass of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\!\left(A \cup B\right)&lt;/math&gt;), and ''Separation'' provides for the existence of &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(x, y\right) \in A \times B : xRy\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. In [[New Foundations|NFU]], some relations with global scope (such as equality and subset) can be implemented as sets. In NFU, bear in mind that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are three types lower than &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;xRy&lt;/math&gt; (one type lower if a type-level ordered pair is used).

=== Properties and kinds of relations ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be some [[binary relation]]. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is:
*'''[[Reflexive relation|Reflexive]]''' if &lt;math&gt;xRx&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Symmetric relation|Symmetric]]''' if &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \,(xRy \to yRx)&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Transitive relation|Transitive]]''' if &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \,(xRy \wedge yRz \rightarrow xRz)&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Antisymmetric relation|Antisymmetric]]''' if &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \,(xRy \wedge yRx \rightarrow x=y)&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Well-founded relation|Well-founded]]''' if for every set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which meets the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ \exists x \in S&lt;/math&gt; whose preimage under &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; does not meet &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Extensional''' if for every &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have the same preimage under &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Relations having certain combinations of the above properties have standard names. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is:

* An '''[[equivalence relation]]''' if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
* A '''[[partial order]]''' if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
* A '''[[linear order]]''' if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a partial order and for every &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;xRy&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;yRx&lt;/math&gt;.
* A '''[[well-ordering]]''' if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a linear order and well-founded.
* A '''set picture''' if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is well-founded and extensional, and the field of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; either equals the downward closure of one of its members (called its ''top element''), or is empty.

== Functions ==
A [[function (set theory)|functional relation]] is a [[binary predicate]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z\,\left(xFy \wedge xFz \to y = z\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Such a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] ([[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]) is implemented as a relation (set) exactly as described in the previous section. So the predicate &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is implemented by the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(x, y\right) : xFy\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. A set of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a function if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z\,\left(\left(x, y\right) \in F \wedge \left(x, z\right) \in F \to y = z\right)&lt;/math&gt;. It is therefore possible to define this function &lt;math&gt;F\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; as the unique object &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;xFy&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp;–&amp;thinsp;i.e.:  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-related to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that the relation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; holds between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp;–&amp;thinsp;or as the unique object &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\left(x, y\right) \in F&lt;/math&gt;. The presence in both theories of functional predicates which are not sets makes it useful to allow the notation &lt;math&gt;F\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; both for sets &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and for important functional predicates. As long as one does not quantify over functions in the latter sense, all such uses are in principle eliminable.

In [[New Foundations|NFU]], &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has the same type as &lt;math&gt;F\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is three types higher than &lt;math&gt;F\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; (one type higher, if a type-level ordered pair is used). To solve this problem, one could define &lt;math&gt;F\left[A\right]&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\left\{y : \exists x\,\left(x \in A \wedge y = F\!\left(x\right)\right)\right\}&lt;/math&gt; for any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, but this is more conveniently written as &lt;math&gt;\left\{F\!\left(x\right) : x \in A\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is any functional relation, the '[[axiom of replacement]]' assures that &lt;math&gt;F\left[A\right]&lt;/math&gt; is a set in [[ZFC]]. In NFU, &lt;math&gt;F\left[A\right]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; now have the same type, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is two types higher than &lt;math&gt;F\left[A\right]&lt;/math&gt; (the same type, if a type-level ordered pair is used).

The function &lt;math&gt;I\!\left(x\right) = x&lt;/math&gt; is not a set in [[ZFC]] because it is 'too large.'  &lt;math&gt;I\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; is, however, a set in NFU. The function (predicate) &lt;math&gt;S\!\left(x\right) = \left\{x\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is neither a function nor a set in either theory; in ZFC, this is true because such a set would be too large, and, in NFU, this is true because its definition would not be [[Stratified formula#In set theory|stratified]]. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;S\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be proved not to exist in NFU (see the resolution of Cantor's paradox in [[New Foundations]].)

=== Operations on functions ===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary functions. The '''[[function composition|composition]]''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the relative product &lt;math&gt;f \mid g&lt;/math&gt;, but only if this results in a function such that &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is also a function, with &lt;math&gt;\left(g \circ f\right)\!\left(x\right) = g\!\left(f\!\left(x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, if the range of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the domain of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. The '''[[inverse function|inverse]]''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^\left(-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the [[inverse relation|converse]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if this is a function. Given any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the identity function &lt;math&gt;i_A&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(x, x\right) \mid x \in A\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, and this is a set in both [[ZFC]] and [[New Foundations|NF]] for different reasons.

=== Special kinds of function ===
A function is an '''[[Injective function|injection]]''' and '''[[bijection|one-to-one]]''' if it has an inverse function.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are sets, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a '''function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;''' if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function whose domain is &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and whose range is included in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a:
* '''[[Injective function|Injection]]''' from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if the [[image (mathematics)|image]]s under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of distinct members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are distinct members of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Surjection]]''' from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if the range of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Bijection]]''' from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is both an injection and a surjection.

This terminology adjusts for the fact that a function, as defined above, does not determine its codomain.

== Size of sets ==

In both [[ZFC]] and [[New Foundations|NFU]], two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are the same size (or are '''equinumerous''') if and only if there is a [[Bijective function|bijection]] ''f'' from ''A'' to ''B''. This can be written as &lt;math&gt;|A|=|B|&lt;/math&gt;, but note that (for the moment) this expresses a relation between ''A'' and ''B'' rather than a relation between yet-undefined objects &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|B|&lt;/math&gt;. Denote this relation by &lt;math&gt;A \sim B&lt;/math&gt; in contexts such as the actual definition of the cardinals where even the appearance of presupposing abstract cardinals should be avoided.

Similarly, define &lt;math&gt;|A| \leq |B|&lt;/math&gt; as holding if and only if there is an [[Injective function|injection]] from ''A'' to ''B''.

It is straightforward to show that the relation of equinumerousness is an equivalence relation: equinumerousness of ''A'' with ''A'' is witnessed by &lt;math&gt;i_A&lt;/math&gt;; if ''f'' witnesses &lt;math&gt;|A|=|B|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; witnesses &lt;math&gt;|B|=|A|&lt;/math&gt;; if ''f'' witnesses &lt;math&gt;|A|=|B|&lt;/math&gt; and ''g'' witnesses &lt;math&gt;|B|=|C|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; witnesses &lt;math&gt;|A|=|C|&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;|A| \leq |B|&lt;/math&gt; is a linear order on abstract cardinals, but not on sets. Reflexivity is obvious and transitivity is proven just as for equinumerousness. The [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem|Schröder–Bernstein theorem]], provable in [[ZFC]] and [[New Foundations|NFU]] in an entirely standard way, establishes that
*&lt;math&gt;|A| \leq |B| \wedge |B| \leq |A| \rightarrow |A| = |B|&lt;/math&gt;
(this establishes antisymmetry on cardinals), and
*&lt;math&gt;|A| \leq |B| \vee |B| \leq |A|&lt;/math&gt;
follows in a standard way in either theory from the [[axiom of choice]].

== Finite sets and natural numbers ==

Natural numbers can be considered either as finite ordinals or finite cardinals. Here consider them as finite cardinal numbers. This is the first place where a major difference between the implementations in [[ZFC]] and [[New Foundations|NFU]] becomes evident.

The Axiom of Infinity of ZFC tells us that there is a set ''A'' which contains &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and contains &lt;math&gt;y \cup \{y\}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;y \in A&lt;/math&gt;. This set ''A'' is not uniquely determined (it can be made larger while preserving this closure property): the set ''N'' of natural numbers is
*&lt;math&gt;\{x \in A \mid \forall B\,(\emptyset \in B \wedge \forall y\,(y \in B \rightarrow y \cup \{y\} \in B) \rightarrow x \in B)\}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the intersection of all sets which contain the empty set and are closed under the "successor" operation &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto y \cup \{y\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In ZFC, a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is finite if and only if there is &lt;math&gt;n \in N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|n|=|A|&lt;/math&gt;: further, define &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; as this ''n'' for finite ''A''. (It can be proved that no two distinct natural numbers are the same size).

The usual operations of arithmetic can be defined recursively and in a style very similar to that in which the set of natural numbers itself is defined. For example, + (the addition operation on natural numbers) can be defined as the smallest set which contains &lt;math&gt;((x,\emptyset),x)&lt;/math&gt; for each natural number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and contains &lt;math&gt;((x,y \cup \{y\}),z \cup \{z\})&lt;/math&gt; whenever it contains &lt;math&gt;((x,y),z)&lt;/math&gt;.

In NFU, it is not obvious that this approach can be used, since the successor operation &lt;math&gt;y \cup \{y\}&lt;/math&gt; is unstratified and so the set ''N'' as defined above cannot be shown to exist in NFU (it is consistent for the set of finite von Neumann ordinals to exist in NFU, but this strengthens the theory, as the existence of this set implies the Axiom of Counting (for which see below or the [[New Foundations]] article)).

The standard definition of the natural numbers, which is actually the oldest [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]], is as equivalence classes of finite sets under equinumerousness. Essentially the same definition is appropriate to [[New Foundations|NFU]] (this is not the usual definition, but the results are the same): define ''Fin'', the set of finite sets, as
:&lt;math&gt;\{A \mid \forall F\,(\emptyset \in F \wedge \forall x,y\,(x \in F \rightarrow x \cup \{y\} \in F) \rightarrow A \in F)\}&lt;/math&gt;
For any set &lt;math&gt;A \in Fin&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\{B \mid A \sim B\}&lt;/math&gt;. Define ''N'' as the set &lt;math&gt;\{|A| \mid A \in Fin\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Axiom of Infinity of NFU can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;V \not\in Fin&lt;/math&gt;: this is enough to establish that each natural number has a nonempty successor (the successor of &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;|A \cup \{x\}|&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A&lt;/math&gt;) which is the hard part of showing that the Peano axioms of arithmetic are satisfied.

The operations of arithmetic can be defined in a style similar to the style given above (using the definition of successor just given). They can also be defined in a natural set theoretical way: if A and B are disjoint finite sets, define |A|+|B| as &lt;math&gt;|A \cup B|&lt;/math&gt;. More formally, define ''m+n'' for ''m'' and ''n'' in ''N'' as
:&lt;math&gt;\{A \mid \exists B,C\,(B \in m \wedge C \in n \wedge B \cap C = \emptyset \wedge A = B \cup C)\}&lt;/math&gt;
(But note that this style of definition is feasible for the ZFC numerals as well, but more circuitous: the form of the [[New Foundations|NFU]] definition facilitates set manipulations while the form of the ZFC definition facilitates recursive definitions, but either theory supports either style of definition).

The two implementations are quite different. In ZFC, choose a representative of each finite cardinality (the equivalence classes themselves are too large to be sets); in NFU the equivalence classes themselves are sets, and are thus an obvious choice for objects to stand in for the cardinalities. However, the arithmetic of the two theories is identical: the same abstraction is implemented by these two superficially different approaches.

== Equivalence relations and partitions ==

A general technique for implementing abstractions in set theory is the use of equivalence classes. If an equivalence relation ''R'' tells us that elements of its field ''A'' are alike in some particular respect, then for any set ''x'', regard the set &lt;math&gt;[x]_R=\{y \in A \mid x R y\}&lt;/math&gt; as representing an abstraction from the set ''x'' respecting just those features (identify elements of ''A'' [[up to]] ''R'').

For any set ''A'', a set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a '''partition''' of ''A'' if all elements of ''P'' are nonempty, any two distinct elements of ''P'' are disjoint, and &lt;math&gt;A=\bigcup P&lt;/math&gt;.

For every equivalence relation ''R'' with field ''A'', &lt;math&gt;\{[x]_R \mid x \in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of ''A''. Moreover, each partition ''P'' of ''A'' determines an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \mid \exists A \in P\,(x \in A \wedge y \in A)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

This technique has limitations in both [[ZFC]] and [[New Foundations|NFU]]. In ZFC, since the universe is not a set, it seems possible to abstract features only from elements of small domains. This can be circumvented using a trick due to [[Dana Scott]]: if ''R'' is an equivalence relation on the universe, define &lt;math&gt;[x]_R&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt; and the [[rank (set theory)|rank]] of ''y'' is less than or equal to the rank of any &lt;math&gt;z R x&lt;/math&gt;. This works because the ranks are sets. Of course, there still may be a proper class of &lt;math&gt;[x]_R&lt;/math&gt;'s. In NFU, the main difficulty is that &lt;math&gt;[x]_R&lt;/math&gt; is one type higher than x, so for example the "map" &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto [x]_R&lt;/math&gt; is not in general a (set) function (though &lt;math&gt;\{x\} \mapsto [x]_R&lt;/math&gt; is a set). This can be circumvented by the use of the Axiom of Choice to select a representative from each equivalence class to replace &lt;math&gt;[x]_R&lt;/math&gt;, which will be at the same type as ''x'', or by choosing a canonical representative if there is a way to do this without invoking Choice (the use of representatives is hardly unknown in ZFC, either). In NFU, the use of equivalence class constructions to abstract properties of general sets is more common, as for example in the definitions of cardinal and ordinal number below.

== Ordinal numbers ==

Two well-orderings &lt;math&gt;W_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_2&lt;/math&gt; are '''similar''' and write &lt;math&gt;W_1 \sim W_2&lt;/math&gt; just in case there is a bijection ''f'' from the field of &lt;math&gt;W_1&lt;/math&gt; to the field of &lt;math&gt;W_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x W_1 y \leftrightarrow f(x)W_2f(y)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y''.

Similarity is shown to be an equivalence relation in much the same way that equinumerousness was shown to be an equivalence relation above.

In [[New Foundations]] (NFU), the '''order type''' of a well-ordering ''W'' is the set of all well-orderings which are similar to ''W''. The set of '''ordinal numbers''' is the set of all order types of well-orderings.

This does not work in [[ZFC]], because the equivalence classes are too large. It would be formally possible to use [[Scott's trick]] to define the ordinals in essentially the same way, but a device of [[von Neumann]] is more commonly used.

For any partial order &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding '''strict partial order''' &amp;lt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \mid x \leq y \wedge x \neq y\}&lt;/math&gt;. Strict linear orders and strict well-orderings are defined similarly.

A set ''A'' is said to be '''transitive''' if &lt;math&gt;\bigcup A \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;: each element of an element of ''A'' is also an element of ''A''. A '''(von Neumann) ordinal''' is a transitive set on which membership is a strict well-ordering.

In ZFC, the order type of a well-ordering ''W'' is then defined as the unique von Neumann ordinal which is equinumerous with the field of ''W'' and membership on which is isomorphic to the strict well-ordering associated with ''W''. (the equinumerousness condition distinguishes between well-orderings with fields of size 0 and 1, whose associated strict well-orderings are indistinguishable).

In ZFC there cannot be a set of all ordinals. In fact, the von Neumann ordinals are an inconsistent totality in any set theory: it can be shown with modest set theoretical assumptions that every element of a von Neumann ordinal is a von Neumann ordinal and the von Neumann ordinals are strictly well-ordered by membership. It follows that the class of von Neumann ordinals would be a von Neumann ordinal if it were a set: but it would then be an element of itself, which contradicts the fact that membership is a strict well-ordering of the von Neumann ordinals.

The existence of order types for all well-orderings is not a theorem of [[Zermelo set theory]]: it requires the [[Axiom of replacement]]. Even Scott's trick cannot be used in Zermelo set theory without an additional assumption (such as the assumption that every set belongs to a [[rank (set theory)|rank]] which is a set, which does not essentially
strengthen Zermelo set theory but is not a theorem of that theory).

In NFU, the collection of all ordinals is a set by stratified comprehension. The Burali-Forti paradox is evaded in an unexpected way. There is a natural order on the ordinals defined by &lt;math&gt;\alpha\leq \beta&lt;/math&gt; if and only if some (and so any) &lt;math&gt;W_1 \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is similar to an initial segment of some (and so any) &lt;math&gt;W_2\in \beta&lt;/math&gt;. Further, it can be shown that this natural order is a well-ordering of the ordinals and so must have an order type &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. It would seem that the order type of the ordinals less than
&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with the natural order would be &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the fact that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the entire natural order on the ordinals (and so not of any of its proper initial segments). But this relies on one's intuition (correct in ZFC) that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for any ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. This assertion is unstratified, because the type of the second &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is four higher than the type of the first (two higher if a type level pair is used). The assertion which is true and provable in NFU is that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^4(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; for any ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of &lt;math&gt;W^{\iota}=\{(\{x\},\{y\})\mid xWy\}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;W \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt; (it is easy to show that this does not depend on the choice of W; note that T raises type by one). Thus the order type of the ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with the natural order is &lt;math&gt;T^4(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T^4(\Omega)&lt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. All uses of &lt;math&gt;T^4&lt;/math&gt; here can be replaced with &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; if a type-level pair is used.

This shows that the T operation is nontrivial, which has a number of consequences. It follows immediately that the singleton map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not a set, as otherwise restrictions of this map would establish the similarity of ''W'' and &lt;math&gt;W^{\iota}&lt;/math&gt; for any well-ordering ''W''. T is (externally) bijective and order-preserving. Because of this, the fact &lt;math&gt;T^4(\Omega)&lt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; establishes that &lt;math&gt;\Omega &gt; T(\Omega) &gt; T^2(\Omega) \ldots&lt;/math&gt; is a "descending sequence" in the ordinals which cannot be a set.

Ordinals fixed by T are called '''Cantorian''' ordinals, and ordinals which dominate only cantorian ordinals (which are easily shown to be cantorian themselves) are said to be '''strongly cantorian'''. There can be no set of cantorian ordinals or set of strongly cantorian ordinals.

=== Digression: von Neumann ordinals in NFU ===

It is possible to reason about von Neumann ordinals in [[New Foundations|NFU]]. Recall that a von Neumann ordinal is a transitive set ''A'' such that the restriction of membership to ''A'' is a strict well-ordering. This is quite a strong condition in the NFU context, since the membership relation involves a difference of type. A von Neumann ordinal ''A'' is not an ordinal in the sense of NFU, but &lt;math&gt;\in\lceil A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to an ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which may be termed the order type of (membership on) ''A''. It is easy to show that the order type of a von Neumann ordinal ''A'' is cantorian: for any well-ordering ''W'' of order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the induced well-ordering of initial segments of ''W'' by inclusion has order type &lt;math&gt;T(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; (it is one type higher, thus the application of T): but the order types of the well-ordering of a von Neumann ordinal ''A'' by membership and the well-ordering of its initial segments by inclusion are clearly the same because the two well-orderings are actually the same relation, so the order type of ''A'' is fixed under T. Moreover, the same argument applies to any smaller ordinal (which will be the order type of an initial segment of ''A'', also a von Neumann ordinal) so the order type of any von Neumann ordinal is strongly cantorian.

The only von Neumann ordinals which can be shown to exist in NFU without additional assumptions are the concrete finite ones. However, the application of a permutation method can convert any model of NFU to a model in which every strongly cantorian ordinal is the order type of a von Neumann ordinal. This suggests that the concept "strongly cantorian ordinal of NFU" might be a better analogue to "ordinal of ZFC" than is the apparent analogue "ordinal of NFU".

== Cardinal numbers ==

Cardinal numbers are defined in [[New Foundations|NFU]] in a way which generalizes the definition of natural
number: for any set ''A'', &lt;math&gt;|A| =_{\mathrm{def}} \{B \mid B \sim A\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[ZFC]], these equivalence classes are too large as usual. Scott's trick could be used (and indeed is used in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]), &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; is usually defined as the smallest order type (here a von Neumann ordinal) of a well-ordering of ''A'' (that every set can be well-ordered follows from
the Axiom of Choice in the usual way in both theories).

The natural order on cardinal numbers is seen to be a well-ordering: that it is reflexive, antisymmetric (on abstract cardinals, which are now available) and transitive has been shown above. That it is a linear order follows from the Axiom of Choice: well-order two sets and an 
initial segment of one well-ordering will be isomorphic to the other, so one set will have cardinality smaller than that of the other. That it is a well-ordering follows from the Axiom of Choice in a similar way.

With each infinite cardinal, many order types are associated for the usual reasons (in either set theory).

Cantor's theorem shows (in both theories) that there are nontrivial distinctions between infinite cardinal numbers. In [[ZFC]], one proves &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;|P(A)|.&lt;/math&gt; In [[New Foundations|NFU]], the usual form of Cantor's theorem is false (consider the case A=V), but Cantor's theorem is an ill-typed statement. The correct form of the theorem in [[New Foundations|NFU]] is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(A)|&lt;|P(A)|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of one-element subsets of A. &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)|&lt;|P(V)|&lt;/math&gt; shows that there are "fewer" singletons than sets (the obvious bijection &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P_1(V)&lt;/math&gt; to ''V'' has already been seen not to be a set). It is actually provable in NFU + Choice that &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)|&lt;|P(V)|\ll|V|&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\ll&lt;/math&gt; signals the existence of many intervening cardinals; there are many, many urelements!). Define a type-raising T operation on cardinals analogous to the T operation on ordinals: &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt;; this is an external endomorphism of the cardinals just as the T operation on ordinals is an external endomorphism of the ordinals.

A set ''A'' is said to be '''cantorian''' just in case &lt;math&gt;|A| = |P_1(A)| = T(|A|)&lt;/math&gt;; the cardinal &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; is also said to be a cantorian cardinal. A set ''A'' is said to be '''strongly cantorian''' (and its cardinal to be strongly cantorian as well) just in case the restriction of the singleton map to ''A'' (&lt;math&gt;(x \mapsto \{x\})\lceil A&lt;/math&gt;) is a set. Well-orderings of strongly cantorian sets are always strongly cantorian ordinals; this is not always true of well-orderings of cantorian sets (though the shortest well-ordering of a cantorian set will be cantorian). A cantorian set is a set which satisfies the usual form of Cantor's theorem.

The operations of cardinal arithmetic are defined in a set-theoretically motivated way in both theories. &lt;math&gt;|A| + |B| = \{C \cup D \mid C \sim A \wedge D \sim B \wedge C \cap D = \emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;. One would like to define &lt;math&gt;|A|\cdot|B|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;|A \times B|&lt;/math&gt;, and one does this in [[ZFC]], but there is an obstruction in [[New Foundations|NFU]] when using the Kuratowski pair: one defines &lt;math&gt;|A|\cdot|B|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;T^{-2}(|A \times B|)&lt;/math&gt; because of the type displacement of 2 between the pair and its projections, which implies a type displacement of two between a cartesian product and its factors. It is straightforward to prove that the product always exists (but requires attention because the inverse of T is not total).

Defining the exponential operation on cardinals requires T in an essential way: if &lt;math&gt;B^A&lt;/math&gt; was defined as the collection of functions from ''A'' to ''B'', this is three types higher than ''A'' or ''B'', so it is reasonable to define &lt;math&gt;|B|^{|A|}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;T^{-3}(|B^A|)&lt;/math&gt; so that it is the same type as ''A'' or ''B'' (&lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; replaces &lt;math&gt;T^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; with type-level pairs). An effect of this is that the exponential operation is partial: for example, &lt;math&gt;2^{|V|}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined. In [[ZFC]] one defines &lt;math&gt;|B|^{|A|}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;|B^A|&lt;/math&gt; without difficulty.

The exponential operation is total and behaves exactly as expected on cantorian cardinals, since T fixes such cardinals and it is easy to show that a function space between cantorian sets is cantorian (as are power sets, cartesian products, and other usual type constructors). This offers further encouragement to the view that the "standard" cardinalities in [[New Foundations|NFU]] are the cantorian (indeed, the strongly cantorian) cardinalities, just as the "standard" ordinals seem to be the strongly cantorian ordinals.

Now the usual theorems of cardinal arithmetic with the axiom of choice can be proved, including &lt;math&gt;\kappa \cdot \kappa = \kappa&lt;/math&gt;. From the case &lt;math&gt;|V|\cdot |V| = |V|&lt;/math&gt; the existence of a type level ordered pair can be derived: &lt;math&gt;|V| \cdot |V| = T^{-2}(|V \times V|)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;|V|&lt;/math&gt; just in case &lt;math&gt;|V \times V| = T^2(|V|) = |P_1^2(V)|&lt;/math&gt;, which would be witnessed by a one-to-one correspondence between Kuratowski pairs &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and double singletons &lt;math&gt;\{\{c\}\}&lt;/math&gt;: redefine &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; as the ''c'' such that &lt;math&gt;\{\{c\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is associated with the Kuratowski &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;: this is a type-level notion of ordered pair.

== The Axiom of Counting and subversion of stratification ==

So there are two different implementations of the natural numbers in [[New Foundations|NFU]] (though they are the same in [[ZFC]]): finite ordinals and finite cardinals. Each of these supports a T operation in [[New Foundations|NFU]] (basically the same operation). It is easy to prove that &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number if n is a natural number in [[New Foundations|NFU]] + Infinity + Choice (and so &lt;math&gt;|N|&lt;/math&gt; and the first
infinite ordinal &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; are cantorian) but it is not possible to prove in this theory that &lt;math&gt;T(n)=n&lt;/math&gt;. However, common sense indicates that this should be true, and so it can be adopted as an axiom:
*'''Rosser's Axiom of Counting''': For each natural number ''n'', &lt;math&gt;T(n)=n&lt;/math&gt;.
One natural consequence of this axiom (and indeed its original formulation) is
*&lt;math&gt;|\{1,\ldots,n\}| = n&lt;/math&gt; for each natural number ''n''.
All that can be proved in [[New Foundations|NFU]] without Counting is &lt;math&gt;|\{1,\ldots,n\}| = T^2(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

A consequence of Counting is that ''N'' is a strongly cantorian set (again, this is an equivalent assertion).

===Properties of strongly cantorian sets===
The type of any variable restricted to a strongly cantorian set ''A'' can be raised or lowered as desired by replacing references to &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; with references to &lt;math&gt;\bigcup f(a)&lt;/math&gt; (type of ''a'' raised; this presupposes that it is known that ''a'' is a set; otherwise one must say "the element of &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt;" to get this effect) or &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{a\})&lt;/math&gt; (type of a lowered) where &lt;math&gt;f(a) = \{a\}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt;, so it is not necessary to assign types to such variables for purposes of stratification.

Any subset of a strongly cantorian set is strongly cantorian. The power set of a strongly cantorian set is strongly cantorian. The cartesian product of two strongly cantorian sets is strongly cantorian.

Introducing the Axiom of Counting means that types need not be assigned to variables restricted to ''N'' or to ''P''(''N''), ''R'' (the set of reals) or indeed any set ever considered in classical mathematics outside of set theory.

There are no analogous phenomena in [[ZFC]]. See the main [[New Foundations]] article for stronger axioms that can be adjoined to NFU to enforce "standard" behavior of familiar mathematical objects.

== Familiar number systems: positive rationals, magnitudes, and reals ==

Represent '''positive fractions''' as pairs of positive natural numbers (0 is excluded): &lt;math&gt;\frac pq&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q)&lt;/math&gt;. To make &lt;math&gt;\frac pq = \frac rs \leftrightarrow ps=qr&lt;/math&gt;, introduce the relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;(p,q)\sim (r,s) \leftrightarrow ps=qr&lt;/math&gt;. It is provable that this is an equivalence relation: define '''positive rational numbers''' as equivalence classes of pairs of positive natural numbers under this relation. Arithmetic operations on positive rational numbers and the order relation on positive rationals are defined just as in elementary school and proved (with some effort) to have the expected properties.

Represent '''magnitudes''' (positive reals) as nonempty proper initial segments of the positive rationals with no largest element. The operations of addition and multiplication on magnitudes are implemented by elementwise addition of the positive rational elements of the magnitudes. Order is implemented as set inclusion.

Represent '''real numbers''' as differences &lt;math&gt;m-n&lt;/math&gt; of magnitudes: formally speaking, a real number is an equivalence class of pairs &lt;math&gt;(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; of magnitudes under the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;(m,n) \sim (r,s) \leftrightarrow m+s = n+r&lt;/math&gt;. The operations of addition and multiplication on real numbers are defined just as one would expect from the algebraic rules for adding and multiplying differences. The treatment of order is also as in elementary algebra.

This is the briefest sketch of the constructions. Note that the constructions are exactly the same in [[ZFC]] and in [[New Foundations|NFU]], except for the difference in the constructions of the natural numbers: since all variables are restricted to strongly cantorian sets, there is no need to worry about stratification restrictions. Without the Axiom of Counting, it might be necessary to introduce some applications of T in a full discussion of these constructions.

== Operations on indexed families of sets ==

In this class of constructions it appears that [[ZFC]] has an advantage over [[New Foundations|NFU]]: though the constructions are clearly feasible in [[New Foundations|NFU]], they are more complicated than in ZFC for reasons having to do with stratification.

Throughout this section assume a type-level ordered pair. Define &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(x_1,(x_2,\ldots,x_n))&lt;/math&gt;. The definition of the general ''n''-tuple using the Kuratowski pair is trickier, as one needs to keep the types of all the projections the same, and the type displacement between the ''n''-tuple and its projections increases as ''n'' increases. Here, the ''n''-tuple has the same type as each of its projections.

General cartesian products are defined similarly: &lt;math&gt;A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n = A_1 \times (A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n)&lt;/math&gt;

The definitions are the same in ZFC but without any worries about stratification (the grouping given here is opposite to that more usually used, but this is easily corrected for).

Now consider the infinite cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i \in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt;. In ZFC, this is defined as the set of all functions ''f'' with domain ''I'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(i) \in A_i&lt;/math&gt; (where ''A'' is implicitly understood as a function taking each ''i'' to &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;).

In NFU, this is requires attention to type. Given a set ''I'' and set valued function ''A'' whose value at &lt;math&gt;\{i\}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P_1(I)&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;, Define &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i \in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all functions ''f'' with domain ''I'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(i) \in A_i&lt;/math&gt;: notice that &lt;math&gt;f(i) \in A_i = A(\{i\})&lt;/math&gt; is stratified because of our convention that ''A'' is a function with values at singletons of the indices. Note that the very largest families of sets (which cannot be indexed by sets of singletons) will not have cartesian products under this definition. Note further that the sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are at the same type as the index set ''I'' (since one type higher than its elements); the product, as a set of functions with domain ''I'' (so at the same type as ''I'') is one type higher (assuming a type-level ordered pair).

Now consider the product &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i \in I}|A_i|&lt;/math&gt; of the cardinals of these sets. The cardinality |&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i \in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt;| is one type higher than the cardinals &lt;math&gt;|A_i|&lt;/math&gt;, so the correct definition of the infinite product of cardinals is &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}(|\Pi_{i \in I}A_i|)&lt;/math&gt; (because the inverse of T is not total, it is possible that this may not exist).

Repeat this for disjoint unions of families of sets and sums of families of cardinals. Again, let ''A'' be a set-valued function with domain &lt;math&gt;P_1(I)&lt;/math&gt;: write &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;A(\{i\})&lt;/math&gt;. The disjoint union &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{i \in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{(i,a) \mid a \in A_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is at the same type as the sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The correct definition of the sum &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{i \in I}|A_i|&lt;/math&gt; is thus &lt;math&gt;|\Sigma_{i \in I}A_i|&lt;/math&gt;, since there is no type displacement.

It is possible to extend these definitions to handle index sets which are not sets of singletons, but this introduces an additional type level and is not needed for most purposes.

In ZFC, define the disjoint union &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{i \in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\{(i,a) \mid a \in A_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; abbreviates &lt;math&gt;A(i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Permutation methods can be used to show relative consistency with NFU of the assertion that for every strongly cantorian set A there is a set ''I'' of the same size whose elements are self-singletons: &lt;math&gt;i = \{i\}&lt;/math&gt; for each ''i'' in ''I''.

== The cumulative hierarchy ==

In [[ZFC]], define the ''cumulative hierarchy'' as the ordinal-indexed sequence of sets satisfying the following conditions: &lt;math&gt;V_0 = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1} = P(V_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;V_{\lambda} = \bigcup\{V_{\beta} \mid \beta&lt;\lambda\}&lt;/math&gt; for limit ordinals &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of a construction by [[transfinite recursion]]. The rank of a set ''A'' is said to be &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A \in V_{\alpha+1}-V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The existence of the ranks as sets depends on the axiom of replacement at each limit step (the hierarchy cannot be constructed in [[Zermelo set theory]]); by the axiom of foundation, every set belongs to some rank.

The cardinal &lt;math&gt;|P(V_{\omega + \alpha})|&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

This construction cannot be carried out in [[New Foundations|NFU]] because the power set operation is not a set function in [[New Foundations|NFU]] (&lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is one type higher than A for purposes of stratification).

The sequence of cardinals &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can be implemented in NFU. Recall that &lt;math&gt;2^{|A|}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}(|\{0,1\}^A|)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is a convenient set of size 2, and &lt;math&gt;|\{0,1\}^A|=|P(A)|&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\beth&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest set of cardinals which contains &lt;math&gt;|N|&lt;/math&gt; (the cardinality of the set of natural numbers), contains the cardinal &lt;math&gt;2^{|A|}&lt;/math&gt; whenever it contains &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt;, and which is closed under suprema of sets of cardinals.

A convention for ordinal indexing of any well-ordering &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the element ''x'' of the field of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; such that
the order type of the restriction of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{y \mid y W x\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; then define &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; as the element with index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the natural order on the elements of &lt;math&gt;\beth&lt;/math&gt;. The cardinal &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the element with index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the natural order on all infinite cardinals (which is a well-ordering, see above). Note that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 = |N|&lt;/math&gt; follows immediately from this definition. In all these constructions, notice that the type of the index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is two higher (with type-level ordered pair) than the type of &lt;math&gt;W_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

Each set ''A'' of ZFC has a transitive closure &lt;math&gt;TC(A)&lt;/math&gt; (the intersection of all transitive sets which contains ''A''). By the axiom of foundation, the restriction of the membership relation to the transitive closure of ''A'' is a [[well-founded relation]]. The relation &lt;math&gt;\in \lceil TC(A)&lt;/math&gt; is either empty or has ''A'' as its top element, so this relation is a ''set picture''. It can be proved in ZFC that every set picture is isomorphic to some &lt;math&gt;\in \lceil TC(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

This suggests that (an initial segment of) the cumulative hierarchy can be studied by considering the isomorphism classes of set pictures. These isomorphism classes are sets and make up a set in [[New Foundations|NFU]]. There is a natural set relation analogous to membership on isomorphism classes of set pictures: if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a set picture, write &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; for its isomorphism class and define &lt;math&gt;[x] E [y]&lt;/math&gt; as holding if &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; is the isomorphism class of the restriction of ''y'' to the downward closure of one of the elements of the preimage under ''y'' of the top element of ''y''. The relation E is a set relation, and it is straightforward to prove that it is well-founded and extensional. If the definition of E is confusing, it can be deduced from the observation that it is induced by precisely the relationship which holds between the set picture associated with ''A'' and the set picture associated with ''B'' when &lt;math&gt;A \in B&lt;/math&gt; in the usual set theory.

There is a T operation on isomorphism classes of set pictures analogous to the T operation on ordinals: if ''x'' is a set picture, so is &lt;math&gt;x^{\iota} = \{(\{a\},\{b\})\mid (a,b) \in x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;T([x])&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;[x^{\iota}]&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;[x]E[y] \leftrightarrow T([x])=T([y])&lt;/math&gt;.

An axiom of extensionality for this simulated set theory follows from E's extensionality. From its well-foundedness follows an axiom of foundation. There remains the question of what comprehension axiom E may have. Consider any collection of set pictures &lt;math&gt;\{x^{\iota}\mid x \in S\}&lt;/math&gt; (collection of set pictures whose fields are made up entirely of singletons). Since each &lt;math&gt;x^{\iota}&lt;/math&gt; is one type higher than x (using a type-level ordered pair), replacing each element &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; of the field of each &lt;math&gt;x^{\iota}&lt;/math&gt; in the collection with &lt;math&gt;(x,\{a\})&lt;/math&gt; results in a collection of set pictures isomorphic to the original collection but with their fields disjoint. The union of these set
pictures with a new top element yields a set picture whose isomorphism type will have as its preimages under E exactly the elements of the original collection. That is, for any collection of isomorphism types &lt;math&gt;[x^{\iota}] = T([x])&lt;/math&gt;, there is an isomorphism type &lt;math&gt;[y]&lt;/math&gt; whose preimage under E is exactly this collection.

In particular, there will be an isomorphism type ''[v]'' whose preimage under E is the collection of ''all'' ''T''[''x'']'s (including ''T''[''v'']). Since ''T''[''v''] ''E'' ''v'' and E is well-founded, &lt;math&gt;T[v] \neq v&lt;/math&gt;. This resembles the resolution of the Burali–Forti paradox discussed above and in the [[New Foundations]] article, and is in fact the local resolution of [[Mirimanoff's paradox]] of the set of all well-founded sets.

There are ranks of isomorphism classes of set pictures just as there are ranks of sets in the usual set theory. For any collection of set pictures ''A'', define ''S''(''A'') as the set of all isomorphism classes of set pictures whose preimage under E is a subset of A; call A a "complete" set if every subset of ''A'' is a preimage under E. The collection of "ranks" is the smallest collection containing the empty set and closed under the S operation (which is a kind of power set construction) and under unions of its subcollections. It is straightforward to prove (much as in the usual set theory) that the ranks are well-ordered by inclusion, and so the ranks have an index in this well-order: refer to the rank with index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. It is provable that &lt;math&gt;|R_{\alpha}|=\beth_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for complete ranks &lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The union of the complete ranks (which will be the first incomplete rank) with the relation E looks like an initial segment of the universe of Zermelo-style set theory (not necessarily like the full universe of [[ZFC]] because it may not be large enough). It is provable that if &lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the first incomplete rank, then &lt;math&gt;R_{T(\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; is a complete rank and thus &lt;math&gt;T(\alpha)&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. So there is a "rank of the cumulative hierarchy" with an "external automorphism" T moving the rank downward, exactly the condition on a nonstandard model of a rank in the cumulative hierarchy under which a model of NFU is constructed in the [[New Foundations]] article. There are technical details to verify, but there is an interpretation not only of a fragment of [[ZFC]] but of [[New Foundations|NFU]] itself in this structure, with &lt;math&gt;[x]\in_{NFU}[y]&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;T([x]) E [y] \wedge [y] \in R_{T(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt;: this "relation" &lt;math&gt;E_{NFU}&lt;/math&gt; is not a set relation but has the same type displacement between its arguments as the usual membership relation &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;.

So there is a natural construction inside NFU of the cumulative hierarchy of sets which internalizes the natural construction of a model of NFU in Zermelo-style set theory.

Under the Axiom of Cantorian Sets described in the [[New Foundations]] article, the strongly cantorian part of the set of isomorphism classes of set pictures with the E relation as membership becomes a (proper class) model of ZFC (in which there are ''n''-[[Mahlo cardinals]] for each&amp;nbsp;''n''; this extension of NFU is strictly stronger than ZFC). This is a proper class model because the strongly cantorian isomorphism classes do not make up a set.

Permutation methods can be used to create from any model of NFU a model in which every strongly cantorian isomorphism type of set pictures is actually realized as the restriction of the true membership relation to the transitive closure of a set.

'''Initiative for Open Authentication''' ('''OATH''') is an industry-wide collaboration to develop an open [[reference architecture]] using [[open standard]]s to promote the adoption of [[strong authentication]]. It has close to thirty coordinating and contributing members and is proposing standards for a variety of authentication technologies, with the aim of lowering costs and simplifying their use.

== Terminology ==
The name ''OATH'' is an acronym from the phrase "open authentication", and is pronounced as the English word "oath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/oauth/Wy34FxwKXwI/Y8mLJBV1Zl4J|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OATH is not related to [[OAuth]], an open standard for [[authorization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">In applied mathematics, the '''Johnson bound''' (named after [[Selmer Martin Johnson]]) is a limit on the size of [[error-correcting code]]s, as used in [[coding theory]] for [[data transmission]] or communications.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a ''q''-ary [[code]] of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; be the minimum distance of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;d = \min_{x,y \in C, x \neq y} d(x,y),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamming distance]] between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;C_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all ''q''-ary codes with length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;C_q(n,d,w)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of codes in &lt;math&gt;C_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; such that every element has exactly &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; nonzero entries.

Denote by &lt;math&gt;|C|&lt;/math&gt; the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we define &lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; to be the largest size of a code with length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d) = \max_{C \in C_q(n,d)} |C|.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we define &lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d,w)&lt;/math&gt; to be the largest size of a code in &lt;math&gt;C_q(n,d,w)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d,w) = \max_{C \in C_q(n,d,w)} |C|.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1 (Johnson bound for &lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt;):'''

If &lt;math&gt;d=2t+1&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d) \leq \frac{q^n}{\sum_{i=0}^t {n \choose i} (q-1)^i + \frac{{n \choose t+1} (q-1)^{t+1} - {d \choose t} A_q(n,d,d)}{A_q(n,d,t+1)} }. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;d=2t&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d) \leq \frac{q^n}{\sum_{i=0}^t {n \choose i} (q-1)^i + \frac{{n \choose t+1} (q-1)^{t+1} }{A_q(n,d,t+1)} }. &lt;/math&gt;

''' Theorem 2 (Johnson bound for &lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d,w)&lt;/math&gt;):'''

'''(i)''' If &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 2w,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d,w) = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

'''(ii)''' If &lt;math&gt;d \leq 2w&lt;/math&gt;, then define the variable &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; as follows. If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is even, then define &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; through the relation &lt;math&gt;d=2e&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is odd, define &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; through the relation &lt;math&gt;d = 2e - 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;q^* = q - 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d,w) \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n q^*}{w}  \left\lfloor \frac{(n-1)q^*}{w-1} \left\lfloor \cdots \left\lfloor \frac{(n-w+e)q^*}{e} \right\rfloor \cdots \right\rfloor \right\rfloor \right\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor ~~ \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]].

'''Remark:''' Plugging the bound of Theorem 2 into the bound of Theorem 1 produces a numerical upper bound on &lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">In [[mathematics]], '''Ladyzhenskaya's inequality''' is any of a number of related functional inequalities named after the [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[Russians|Russian]] [[mathematician]] [[Olga Aleksandrovna Ladyzhenskaya]].  The original such inequality, for functions of two real variables, was introduced by Ladyzhenskaya in 1958 to prove the existence and uniqueness of long-time solutions to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in two spatial dimensions (for smooth enough initial data).  There is an analogous inequality for functions of three real variables, but the exponents are slightly different;  much of the difficulty in establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions to the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations stems from these different exponents.  Ladyzhenskaya's inequality is one member of a broad class of inequalities known as [[interpolation inequality|interpolation inequalities]].

Let &amp;Omega; be a [[Lipschitz domain]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or 3, and let ''u'':&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a [[weak derivative|weakly differentiable]] function that vanishes on the boundary of &amp;Omega; in the sense of [[trace operator|trace]] (that is, ''u'' is a limit in the [[Sobolev space]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;Omega;) of a sequence of [[smooth function]]s that are [[compactly supported]] in &amp;Omega;).  Then there exists a constant ''C'' depending only on &amp;Omega; such that, in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,

:&lt;math&gt;
\| u \|_{L^{4}} \leq C \| u \|_{L^{2}}^{1/2} \| \nabla u \|_{L^{2}}^{1/2},
&lt;/math&gt;

and, in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3,

:&lt;math&gt;
\| u \|_{L^4} \leq C \| u \|_{L^2}^{1/4} \| \nabla u \|_{L^2}^{3/4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

* Both the two- and three-dimensional versions of Ladyzhenskaya's inequality are special cases of the [[Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality]]

::&lt;math&gt;
\| u \|_{L^p} \leq C \| u \|_{L^q}^\alpha \| u \|_{H_0^s}^{1-\alpha},
&lt;/math&gt;

:which holds whenever

::&lt;math&gt;
p &gt; q \geq 1, s &gt; n ( \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{p} ), \text{ and } \tfrac{1}{p} = \tfrac{\alpha}{q} + (1 - \alpha) ( \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{s}{n} ).
&lt;/math&gt;

:Ladyzhensakaya's inequalities are the special cases ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;frac12; when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;frac14; when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.

* A simple modification of the argument used by Ladyzhenskaya in her 1958 paper (see e.g. Constantin &amp;amp; Seregin 2010) yields the following inequality for ''u'':&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''', valid for all ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;2:

::&lt;math&gt;
\| u \|_{L^{2r}} \leq C r \| u \|_{L^r}^{1/2} \| \nabla u \|_{L^2}^{1/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

* The usual Ladyzhenskaya inequality on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or 3, can be generalized (see McCormick &amp;amp; al. 2013) to use the [[Lp space#Weak Lp|weak ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; “norm”]] of ''u'' in place of the usual ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm:

::&lt;math&gt;
\| u \|_{L^{4}} \leq 
\begin{cases}
C \| u \|_{L^{2,\infty}}^{1/2} \| \nabla u \|_{L^{2}}^{1/2}, &amp; n = 2, \\
C \| u \|_{L^{2,\infty}}^{1/4} \| \nabla u \|_{L^{2}}^{3/4}, &amp; n = 3.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, a '''Lebrun manifold''' is a [[connected sum]] of copies of the [[complex projective plane]], equipped with an explicit self-dual metric. Here, self-dual means that the [[Weyl tensor]]  is its own [[Hodge star]]. The metric
is determined by the choice of a finite collection of points in [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]]. These metrics were discovered  by {{harvs|txt|last=LeBrun|first=Claude|authorlink=Claude LeBrun|year=1991}}, and named after LeBrun by {{harvs|txt|last1=Atiyah|last2=Witten|year=2002}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3174">In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''limit point compact'''&lt;ref&gt;The terminology "limit point compact" appears in a topology textbook by [[James Munkres]], and is apparently due to him.  According to him, some call the property "[[Fréchet]] compactness", while others call it the "[[Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem|Bolzano-Weierstrass property]]". Munkres, p. 178&amp;ndash;179.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''weakly countably compact''' if every infinite subset of ''X'' has a [[limit point]] in ''X''. This property  generalizes a property of [[compact spaces]].  In a [[metric space]], limit point compactness, compactness, and [[sequential compactness]] are all equivalent.  For general topological spaces, however, these three notions of compactness are not equivalent.

==Properties and Examples==
* Limit point compactness is equivalent to [[countable compactness]] if ''X'' is a [[T1-space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-space]] and is equivalent to [[compact space|compactness]] if ''X'' is a [[metric space]].
* An example of a space ''X'' that is not weakly countably compact is any countable (or larger) set with the [[discrete topology]]. A more interesting example is the [[countable complement topology]].
* Even though a [[continuous function]] from a compact space ''X'', to an ordered set ''Y'' in the order topology, must be bounded, the same thing does not hold if ''X'' is ''limit point compact''. An example is given by the space &lt;math&gt;X\times\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (where ''X'' = {1, 2} carries the [[indiscrete topology]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integers carrying the [[discrete topology]]) and the function &lt;math&gt;f=\pi_{\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; given by projection onto the second coordinate. Clearly, ƒ is continuous and &lt;math&gt;X\times \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is limit point compact (in fact, ''every'' nonempty subset of &lt;math&gt;X\times \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has a limit point) but ƒ is not [[Bounded function|bounded]], and in fact &lt;math&gt;f(X\times \mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is not even limit point compact.
* Every [[countably compact]] space (and hence every compact space) is weakly countably compact, but the converse is not true.
* For metrizable spaces, compactness, limit point compactness, and [[Sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] are all equivalent.
* The set of all real numbers, '''R''', is not limit point compact; the integers are an infinite set but do not have a limit point in '''R'''.
*If (''X'', ''T'') and (''X'', ''T*'') are topological spaces with ''T*'' finer than ''T'' and (''X'', ''T*'') is limit point compact, then so is (''X'', ''T'').
*A finite space is [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] limit point compact.

[[Image:Logarithmic mean 3D plot from 0 to 100.png|thumb|300px|Three-dimensional plot showing the values of the logarithmic mean.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''logarithmic mean''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of two non-negative [[number]]s which is equal to their [[Difference (mathematics)|difference]] divided by the [[logarithm]] of their [[quotient]].  In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  M_\text{lm}(x, y)
    &amp;= \lim_{(\xi, \eta) \to (x, y)} \frac{\eta - \xi}{\ln(\eta) - \ln(\xi)} \\[6pt]
    &amp;= \begin{cases}
         0 &amp; \text{if }x = 0 \text{ or } y = 0, \\
         x &amp; \text{if }x = y ,\\
         \frac{y - x}{\ln(y) - \ln(x)} &amp; \text{otherwise,}
       \end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for the positive numbers &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt;.

This calculation is applicable in [[engineering]] problems involving [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[mass transfer]].

== Inequalities ==

The logarithmic mean of two numbers is smaller than the [[arithmetic mean]] but larger than the [[geometric mean]] (unless the numbers are the same, in which case all three means are equal to the numbers):

: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x y} \leq M_\text{lm}(x, y) \leq \frac{x + y}{2} \qquad \text{ for all } x \geq 0 \text{ and } y \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation of the mean ==

=== Mean value theorem of differential calculus ===

From the [[mean value theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt;\exists \xi \in (x, y): \ f'(\xi) = \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y}&lt;/math&gt;

the logarithmic mean is obtained as the value of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; by substituting &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\xi} = \frac{\ln(x) - \ln(y)}{x - y}&lt;/math&gt;

and solving for &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \frac{x - y}{\ln(x) - \ln(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Integration ===

The logarithmic mean can also be interpreted as the [[area]] under an [[exponential function|exponential curve]].
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  L(x, y) ={} &amp; \int_0^1 x^{1-t} y^t\ \mathrm{d}t
          ={}   \int_0^1 \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^t x\ \mathrm{d}t
          ={}   x \int_0^1 \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^t \mathrm{d}t \\[3pt]
          ={} &amp; \left.\frac{x}{\ln\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^t\right|_{t=0}^1
          ={}   \frac{x}{\ln\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)} \left(\frac{y}{x} - 1\right) 
          ={}   \frac{y - x}{\ln\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)} \\[3pt]
          ={} &amp; \frac{y - x}{\ln\left(y\right) - \ln\left(x\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The area interpretation allows the easy derivation of some basic properties of the logarithmic mean. Since the exponential function is [[monotonic function|monotonic]], the integral over an interval of length 1 is bounded by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The [[homogeneous function|homogeneity]] of the integral operator is transferred to the mean operator, that is &lt;math&gt;L(cx, cy) = cL(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Two other useful integral representations are&lt;math display="block"&gt;{1 \over L(x,y)} = \int_0^1 {\operatorname{d}\!t \over t x + (1-t)y}&lt;/math&gt;and&lt;math display="block"&gt;{1 \over L(x,y)} = \int_0^\infty {\operatorname{d}\!t \over (t+x)\,(t+y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalization ==

=== Mean value theorem of differential calculus ===

One can generalize the mean to &lt;math&gt;n + 1&lt;/math&gt; variables by considering the [[mean value theorem (divided differences)|mean value theorem for divided differences]] for the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[derivative]] of the logarithm.

We obtain
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{MV}(x_0,\, \dots,\, x_n) = \sqrt[-n]{(-1)^{(n+1)} n \ln\left(\left[x_0,\, \dots,\, x_n\right]\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ln\left(\left[x_0,\, \dots,\, x_n\right]\right)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[divided difference]] of the logarithm.

For &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; this leads to
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{MV}(x, y, z) = \sqrt{\frac{(x - y) \left(y - z\right)\left(z - x\right)}{2 \left(\left(y - z\right) \ln\left(x\right) + \left(z - x\right) \ln\left(y\right) + \left(x - y\right) \ln\left(z\right)\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Integral ===

The integral interpretation can also be generalized to more variables, but it leads to a different result. Given the [[simplex]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;S = \{\left(\alpha_0,\, \dots,\, \alpha_n\right) : \left(\alpha_0 + \dots + \alpha_n = 1\right) \land \left(\alpha_0 \ge 0\right) \land \dots \land \left(\alpha_n \ge 0\right)\}&lt;/math&gt; and an appropriate measure &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathrm{d}\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which assigns the simplex a volume of 1, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{I}\left(x_0,\, \dots,\, x_n\right) = \int_S x_0^{\alpha_0} \cdot \,\cdots\, \cdot  x_n^{\alpha_n}\ \mathrm{d}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified using divided differences of the exponential function to
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{I}\left(x_0,\, \dots,\, x_n\right) = n! \exp\left[\ln\left(x_0\right),\, \dots,\, \ln\left(x_n\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Example &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{I}(x, y, z) = -2 \frac{x \left(\ln\left(y\right) - \ln\left(z\right)\right) + y\left(\ln\left(z\right) - \ln\left(x\right)\right) + z\left(\ln\left(x\right) - \ln\left(y\right)\right)}{\left(\ln\left(x\right) - \ln\left(y\right)\right)\left(\ln\left(y\right) - \ln\left(z\right)\right)\left(\ln\left(z\right) - \ln\left(x\right)\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt;L_\text{I}(x, y, z) = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{x}{(\ln x - \ln y)\cdot(\ln x - \ln z)} + \frac{y}{(\ln y - \ln x) \cdot (\ln y - \ln z)} + \frac{z}{(\ln z - \ln x) \cdot (\ln z - \ln y)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''M6''' is a [[block cipher]] proposed by [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] in 1997 for use in the IEEE 1394 [[FireWire]] standard. The design allows some freedom in choosing a few of the cipher's operations, so M6 is considered a family of ciphers.

The algorithm operates on blocks of 64 bits using a 10-round [[Feistel cipher|Feistel network]]
structure. The [[key size]] is 40 bits by default, but can be up to 64 bits. The [[key schedule]] is very simple, producing two 32-bit subkeys: the high 32 bits of the [[key (cryptography)|key]], and the sum mod 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; of this and the low 32 bits.

Because its round function is based on rotation and addition, M6 was one of the first ciphers
attacked by [[mod n cryptanalysis]]. Mod 5, about 100 known plaintexts suffice to [[distinguishing attack|distinguish]] the output from a [[pseudorandom permutation]]. Mod 257, information about the secret key itself is revealed. One known plaintext reduces the complexity of a [[brute force attack]] to about 2&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; trial encryptions; "a few dozen" known plaintexts lowers this number to about 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to its simple key schedule, M6 is also vulnerable to a [[slide attack]], which requires more known plaintext but less computation.

'''Maekawa's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in the [[mathematics of paper folding]] named after [[Jun Maekawa]]. It relates to flat-foldable [[origami]] [[crease pattern]]s and states that at every [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]], the numbers of valley and mountain folds always differ by two in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kasahara|first1=K.|last2=Takahama|first2=T.|title=Origami for the Connoisseur|publisher=Japan Publications|location=New York|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Justin|first=J.|title=Mathematics of origami, part 9|journal=British Origami|date=June 1986|pages=28–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, even earlier, by S.

==Parity and coloring==
One consequence of Maekawa's theorem is that the total number of folds at each vertex must be an [[even number]]. This implies (via a form of [[Dual graph|planar graph duality]] between [[Eulerian graph]]s and [[bipartite graph]]s) that, for any flat-foldable crease pattern, it is always possible to [[graph coloring|color]] the regions between the creases with two colors, such that each crease separates regions of differing colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Related results==
Maekawa's theorem does not completely characterize the flat-foldable vertices, because it only takes into account the numbers of folds of each type, and not their angles.
[[Kawasaki's theorem]] gives a complementary condition on the angles between the folds at a vertex (regardless of which folds are mountain folds and which are valley folds) that is also necessary for a vertex to be flat-foldable.

'''Modulo-N code''' is a [[lossy compression]] algorithm used to compress [[correlated]] data sources using [[modulo arithmetic]].

==Compression==
When applied to two nodes in a [[computer networking|network]] whose data are in close range of each other Modulo-N code
requires one node (say odd) to send the coded data value as the raw data &lt;math&gt;M_o = D_o&lt;/math&gt;; the even node is required
to send the coded data as the &lt;math&gt; M_e = (D_e) mod (N) &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the name Modulo-N code.

Since it is known that for a number K, at least &lt;math&gt;log_2(K)&lt;/math&gt; bits are required to represent it
in binary. So the modulo coded data of the two nodes requires totally &lt;math&gt;log_2(M_o) + log_2(M_e)&lt;/math&gt;.
As we can generally expect &lt;math&gt;log_2(M_e) \le log_2(M_o)&lt;/math&gt; always, because &lt;math&gt;M_e \le N&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the how compression is achieved.

A compression ratio achieved is &lt;math&gt;C.R = \frac{log_2(M_o) + log_2(M_e)}{2log_2(M_o)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Decompression==
At the receiver by joint decoding we may complete the process of extracting the data and rebuilding the
original values. The code from the even node is reconstructed by the ''assumption'' that it must be 
close to the data from the odd node. Hence the decoding algorithm retrieves even node data as &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;CLOSEST(M_o,N.k+ M_e)&lt;/math&gt;.

The decoder essentially finds the closest match to &lt;math&gt;M_o \simeq N.k + M_e&lt;/math&gt; and the decoded
value is declared as &lt;math&gt;N.k + M_e&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
For a mod-8 code, we have 
''Encoder''
 D_o=43,D_e=47
 M_o=43,M_e=47 mod(8) = 7,
 
''Decoder''
  M_o=43,M_e=47 mod(8) = 7,
  D_o=43,D_e=CLOSEST(43,8⋅k + 7)
  &lt;math&gt; 43 \simeq 8 \cdot 5 + 7&lt;/math&gt;
  D_o=43,D_e=47

Modulo-N decoding is similar to [[phase unwrapping]] and has the same limitation: If the difference from one node to the next is more than N/2 (if the phase changes from one sample to the next more than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;), then decoding leads to an incorrect value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13873">In [[abstract algebra]], '''Morita equivalence''' is a relationship defined between [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] that preserves many ring-theoretic properties. It is named after Japanese mathematician [[Kiiti Morita]] who defined equivalence and a similar notion of duality in 1958.

== Motivation ==
[[ring (mathematics)|Rings]] are commonly studied in terms of their [[module (mathematics)|modules]], as modules can be viewed as [[representation theory|representations]] of rings. Every ring ''R'' has a natural ''R''-module structure on itself where the module action is defined as the multiplication in the ring, so the approach via modules is more general and gives useful information. Because of this, one often studies a ring by studying the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of modules over that ring. Morita equivalence takes this viewpoint to a natural conclusion by defining rings to be Morita equivalent if their module categories are [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]]. This notion is of interest only when dealing with [[noncommutative ring]]s, since it can be shown that two [[commutative ring]]s are Morita equivalent if and only if they are [[Glossary of ring theory#Homomorphisms and ideals|isomorphic]].

== Definition ==
Two rings ''R'' and ''S'' (associative, with 1) are said to be ('''Morita''') '''equivalent''' if there is an equivalence of the category of (left) modules over ''R'', ''R-Mod'', and the category of (left) modules over ''S'', ''S-Mod''. It can be shown that the left module categories ''R-Mod'' and ''S-Mod'' are equivalent if and only if the right module categories ''Mod-R'' and ''Mod-S'' are equivalent. Further it can be shown that any functor from ''R-Mod'' to ''S-Mod'' that yields an equivalence is automatically [[Additive functor|additive]].

== Examples ==
Any two isomorphic rings are Morita equivalent.

The ring of ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with elements in ''R'', denoted M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), is Morita-equivalent to ''R'' for any ''n &gt; 0''. Notice that this generalizes the classification of simple artinian rings given by [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem|Artin–Wedderburn theory]]. To see the equivalence, notice that if  ''X'' is a left ''R''-module then ''X&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is an M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module where the module structure is given by matrix multiplication on the left of column vectors from ''X''. This allows the definition of a functor from the category of left ''R''-modules to the category of left M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-modules. The inverse functor is defined by realizing that for any M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module there is a left ''R''-module ''X'' such that the M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-module is obtained from ''X'' as described above.

== Criteria for equivalence ==
Equivalences can be characterized as follows: if ''F'':''R-Mod'' &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; ''S-Mod'' and ''G'':''S-Mod''&lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; ''R-Mod'' are additive (covariant) [[functors]], then ''F'' and ''G'' are an equivalence if and only if there is a balanced (''S'',''R'')-[[bimodule]] ''P'' such that  &lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''P''  and  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;  are [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective module|projective]] [[generator (category theory)|generators]] and there are [[natural transformation|natural isomorphisms]] of the functors &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{F}(-) \cong P \otimes_R - &lt;/math&gt;, and of the functors &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{G}(-) \cong \operatorname{Hom}(_{S}P,-).&lt;/math&gt; Finitely generated projective generators are also sometimes called '''progenerators''' for their module category.&lt;ref name=Sep6&gt;DeMeyer &amp; Ingraham (1971) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

For every [[exact functor|right-exact]] functor ''F'' from the category of left-''R'' modules to the category of left-''S'' modules that commutes with [[direct sum]]s, a theorem of [[homological algebra]] shows that there is a ''(S,R)''-bimodule ''E'' such that the functor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{F}(-)&lt;/math&gt; is naturally isomorphic to the functor &lt;math&gt;E \otimes_R -&lt;/math&gt;. Since equivalences are by necessity exact and commute with direct sums, this implies that ''R'' and ''S'' are Morita equivalent if and only if there are bimodules ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that &lt;math&gt;M \otimes_{S} N \cong R&lt;/math&gt; as ''(R,R)'' bimodules and &lt;math&gt;N \otimes_{R} M \cong S&lt;/math&gt; as ''(S,S)'' bimodules.  Moreover, ''N'' and ''M'' are related via an ''(S,R)'' bimodule isomorphism: &lt;math&gt;N \cong \operatorname{Hom}(M_S,S_S)&lt;/math&gt;.

More concretely, two rings ''R'' and ''S'' are Morita equivalent if and only if &lt;math&gt;S\cong \operatorname{End}(P_R)&lt;/math&gt; for a [[progenerator]] module ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'',&lt;ref name=Sep16&gt;DeMeyer &amp; Ingraham (1971) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; which is the case if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt;S\cong e\mathbb{M}_{n}(R)e&lt;/math&gt; 
(isomorphism of rings) for some positive integer ''n'' and [[Idempotent (ring theory)#Types of ring idempotents|full idempotent]] ''e'' in the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

It is known that if ''R'' is Morita equivalent to ''S'', then the ring C(''R'') is isomorphic to the ring C(''S''), where C(-) denotes the [[center of a ring|center of the ring]], and furthermore ''R''/''J''(''R'') is Morita equivalent to ''S''/''J''(''S''), where ''J''(-) denotes the [[Jacobson radical]].

While isomorphic rings are Morita equivalent, Morita equivalent rings can be nonisomorphic.  An easy example is that a [[division ring]] ''D'' is Morita equivalent to all of its matrix rings ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D''), but cannot be isomorphic when ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.  In the special case of commutative rings, Morita equivalent rings are actually isomorphic.  This follows immediately from the comment above, for if ''R'' is Morita equivalent to ''S'', &lt;math&gt;R=\operatorname{C}(R)\cong \operatorname{C}(S)=S&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, if ''R'' and ''S'' are isomorphic commutative rings, every equivalence between ''R''-Mod and ''S''-Mod arises up to natural isomorphism from an isomorphism between ''R'' and ''S''.

== Properties preserved by equivalence ==
Many properties are preserved by the equivalence functor for the objects in the module category.  Generally speaking, any property of modules defined purely in terms of modules and their homomorphisms (and not to their underlying elements or ring) is a '''categorical property''' which will be preserved by the equivalence functor.  For example, if ''F''(-) is the equivalence functor from ''R-Mod'' to ''S-Mod'', then the ''R'' module ''M'' has any of the following properties if and only if the ''S'' module ''F''(''M'') does: [[injective module|injective]], [[projective module|projective]], [[flat module|flat]], [[faithful module|faithful]], [[simple module|simple]], [[semisimple module|semisimple]], [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]], [[Finitely-generated module#Finitely presented.2C finitely related.2C and coherent modules|finitely presented]], [[artinian module|Artinian]], and [[noetherian module|Noetherian]].  Examples of properties not necessarily preserved include being [[free module|free]], and being [[cyclic module|cyclic]].

Many ring theoretic properties are stated in terms of their modules, and so these properties are preserved between Morita equivalent rings.  Properties shared between equivalent rings are called '''Morita invariant''' properties.  For example, a ring ''R'' is [[Semisimple module#Semisimple rings|semisimple]] if and only if all of its modules are semisimple, and since semisimple modules are preserved under Morita equivalence, an equivalent ring ''S'' must also have all of its modules semisimple, and therefore be a semisimple ring itself.

Sometimes it is not immediately obvious why a property should be preserved.  For example, using one standard definition of [[von Neumann regular ring]] (for all ''a'' in ''R'', there exists ''x'' in ''R'' such that ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''axa'') it is not clear that an equivalent ring should also be von Neumann regular.  However another formulation is:  a ring is von Neumann regular if and only if all of its modules are flat.  Since flatness is preserved across Morita equivalence, it is now clear that von Neumann regularity is Morita invariant.

The following properties are Morita invariant:
*[[Simple ring|simple]], [[Semisimple ring|semisimple]]
*[[von Neumann regular ring|von Neumann regular]]
*right (or left) [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]], right (or left) [[Artinian ring|Artinian]]
*right (or left) [[Injective module#Self-injective rings|self-injective]]
*[[quasi-Frobenius ring|quasi-Frobenius]]
*[[prime ring|prime]], right (or left) [[Primitive ring|primitive]], [[semiprime ring|semiprime]], [[semiprimitive ring|semiprimitive]]
*right (or left) [[hereditary ring|(semi-)hereditary]]
*right (or left) [[nonsingular ring|nonsingular]]
*right (or left) [[coherent ring|coherent]]
*[[semiprimary ring|semiprimary]], right (or left) [[perfect ring|perfect]], [[semiperfect ring|semiperfect]] 
*[[semilocal ring|semilocal]]

Examples of properties which are ''not'' Morita invariant include [[commutative ring|commutative]], [[local ring|local]], [[reduced ring|reduced]], [[domain (ring theory)|domain]], right (or left) [[Goldie ring|Goldie]], [[Frobenius ring|Frobenius]], [[invariant basis number]], and [[Dedekind finite ring|Dedekind finite]].

There are at least two other tests for determining whether or not a ring property &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is Morita invariant.  An element ''e'' in a ring ''R'' is a '''[[Idempotent (ring theory)#Types of ring idempotents|full idempotent]]''' when ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'' and ''ReR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''.

*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is Morita invariant if and only if whenever a ring ''R'' satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;, then so does ''eRe'' for every full idempotent ''e'' and so does every matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') for every positive integer ''n'';
or
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is Morita invariant if and only if: for any ring ''R'' and full idempotent ''e'' in ''R'', ''R'' satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the ring ''eRe'' satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Further directions ==
Dual to the theory of equivalences is the theory of [[Opposite category|dualities]] between the module categories, where the functors used are [[Functor#Covariance and contravariance|contravariant]] rather than covariant. This theory, though similar in form, has significant differences because there is no duality between the categories of modules for any rings, although dualities may exist for subcategories. In other words, because infinite dimensional modules{{clarify|what's an infinite-dimensional module?|date=May 2015}} are not generally [[reflexive module|reflexive]], the theory of dualities applies more easily to finitely generated algebras over noetherian rings. Perhaps not surprisingly, the criterion above has an analogue for dualities, where the natural isomorphism is given in terms of the hom functor rather than the tensor functor.

Morita equivalence can also be defined in more structured situations, such as for symplectic groupoids and [[C*-algebra]]s. In the case of C*-algebras, a stronger type equivalence, called '''strong Morita equivalence''', is needed to obtain results useful in applications, because of the additional structure of C*-algebras (coming from the involutive *-operation) and also because C*-algebras do not necessarily have an identity element.

== Significance in K-theory ==
If two rings are Morita equivalent, there is an induced equivalence of the respective categories of projective modules since the Morita equivalences will preserve exact sequences (and hence projective modules). Since the [[algebraic K-theory]] of a ring is defined (in [[Q-construction|Quillen's approach]]) in terms of the [[homotopy group]]s of (roughly) the [[classifying space]] of the [[nerve (category theory)|nerve]] of the (small) category of finitely generated projective modules over the ring, Morita equivalent rings must have isomorphic K-groups.

In [[mathematics]], a '''negligible set''' is a set that is small enough that it can be ignored for some purpose.
As common examples, [[finite set]]s can be ignored when studying the [[limit of a sequence]], and [[null set]]s can be ignored when studying the [[integral (measure theory)|integral]] of a [[measurable function]].

Negligible sets define several useful concepts that can be applied in various situations, such as truth [[almost everywhere]].
In order for these to work, it is generally only necessary that the negligible sets form an [[ideal (set theory)|ideal]]; that is, that the [[empty set]] be negligible, the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two negligible sets be negligible, and any [[subset]] of a negligible set be negligible.
For some purposes, we also need this ideal to be a [[sigma-ideal]], so that [[countable]] unions of negligible sets are also negligible.
If ''I'' and ''J'' are both ideals of [[subset]]s of the same [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'', then one may speak of ''I-negligible'' and ''J-negligible'' subsets.

The opposite of a negligible set is a [[generic property]], which has various forms.

== Examples ==

Let ''X'' be the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s, and let a subset of '''N''' be negligible [[iff|if]] it is [[finite set|finite]].
Then the negligible sets form an ideal.
This idea can be applied to any [[infinite set]]; but if applied to a finite set, every subset will be negligible, which is not a very useful notion.

Or let ''X'' be an [[uncountable set]], and let a subset of ''X'' be negligible if it is [[countable set|countable]].
Then the negligible sets form a sigma-ideal.

Let ''X'' be a [[measurable space]] equipped with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''m,'' and let a subset of ''X'' be negligible if it is ''m''-[[null set|null]].
Then the negligible sets form a sigma-ideal.
Every sigma-ideal on ''X'' can be recovered in this way by placing a suitable measure on ''X'', although the measure may be rather pathological.

Let ''X'' be the set '''R''' of [[real number]]s, and let a subset ''A'' of '''R''' be negligible&lt;ref&gt;Billingsley, P. Probability and Measure. Wiley-Interscience, Third Edition, p.8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; if for each ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0, there exists a finite or countable collection ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … of (possibly overlapping) intervals satisfying:

: &lt;math&gt; A \subset \bigcup_{k} I_k &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k} |I_k| &lt; \epsilon .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of the preceding example, using [[Lebesgue measure]], but described in elementary terms.

Let ''X'' be a [[topological space]], and let a subset be negligible if it is of [[first category]], that is, if it is a countable union of [[nowhere-dense set]]s (where a set is nowhere-dense if it is not [[dense set|dense]] in any [[open set]]).
Then the negligible sets form a sigma-ideal.
''X'' is a ''[[Baire space]]'' if the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of every such negligible set is empty.

Let ''X'' be a [[directed set]], and let a subset of ''X'' be negligible if it has an [[upper bound]].
Then the negligible sets form an ideal.
The first example is a special case of this using the usual ordering of ''N''.

In a [[coarse structure]], the controlled sets are negligible.

==Derived concepts==
Let ''X'' be a [[set (mathematics)|set]], and let ''I'' be an ideal of negligible [[subset]]s of ''X''.
If ''p'' is a proposition about the elements of ''X'', then ''p'' is true ''[[almost everywhere]]'' if the set of points where ''p'' is true is the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of a negligible set.
That is, ''p'' may not always be true, but it's false so rarely that this can be ignored for the purposes at hand.

If ''f'' and ''g'' are functions from ''X'' to the same space ''Y'', then ''f'' and ''g'' are ''equivalent'' if they are equal almost everywhere.
To make the introductory paragraph precise, then, let ''X'' be '''N''', and let the negligible sets be the finite sets.
Then ''f'' and ''g'' are sequences.
If ''Y'' is a [[topological space]], then ''f'' and ''g'' have the same limit, or both have none.
(When you generalise this to a directed sets, you get the same result, but for [[net (mathematics)|net]]s.)
Or, let ''X'' be a measure space, and let negligible sets be the null sets.
If ''Y'' is the [[real line]] '''R''', then either ''f'' and ''g'' have the same integral, or neither integral is defined.

The '''patch test''' in the [[finite element method]] is a simple indicator of the quality of a finite element, developed by [[Bruce Irons (engineer)|Bruce Irons]].
The patch test uses a [[partial differential equation]] on a domain consisting from several elements set up so that the exact solution is known and can be reproduced, in principle, with zero error. Typically, in [[mechanics]], the prescribed exact solution consists of displacements that vary as piecewise linear functions in space (called a constant [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] solution). The elements pass the patch test if the finite element solution is the same as the exact solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zienkiewicz  |first=O. C.|authorlink=Olgierd Zienkiewicz|author2=R. L. Taylor |author3=J. Z. Zhu |title=The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|date=May 2005|edition=6|isbn=0-7506-6320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was long conjectured by engineers that passing the patch test is sufficient for the convergence of the finite element, that is, to ensure that the solutions from the finite element method converge to the exact solution of the [[partial differential equation]] as the finite element mesh is refined. However, this is not the case, and the patch test is neither sufficient nor necessary for convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bathe|first=Klaus-Jürgen|authorlink=Klaus-Jürgen Bathe|title=Finite Element Procedures|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|date=June 1995|edition=2|isbn=0-9790049-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition of  '''patch test''' (applicable to any numerical method, including and beyond finite elements) is any test problem having an exact solution that can, in principle, be exactly reproduced by the numerical approximation. Therefore, a finite-element simulation that uses linear shape functions has patch tests for which the exact solution must be piecewise linear, while higher-order finite elements have correspondingly higher-order patch tests.

In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[number theory]], ''N'' is a '''primary pseudoperfect number''' if it satisfies the [[Egyptian fraction]] equation
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p|N}\frac1p + \frac1N = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is over only the [[prime divisor]]s of ''N''.

== Properties ==
Equivalently, ''N'' is a primary pseudoperfect number if it satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p|N}\frac{N}p + 1 = N.&lt;/math&gt;
Except for the primary pseudoperfect number ''N'' = 2, this expression gives a representation for ''N'' as the sum of distinct divisors of ''N''. Therefore, each primary pseudoperfect number ''N'' (except ''N'' = 2) is also [[Semiperfect number|pseudoperfect]].

The eight known primary pseudoperfect numbers are
:[[2 (number)|2]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[42 (number)|42]], 1806, 47058, 2214502422, 52495396602, 8490421583559688410706771261086 {{OEIS|id=A054377}}.
The first four of these numbers are one less than the corresponding numbers in [[Sylvester's sequence]], but then the two sequences diverge.

It is unknown whether there are infinitely many primary pseudoperfect numbers, or whether there are any odd primary pseudoperfect numbers.

The prime factors of primary pseudoperfect numbers sometimes may provide solutions to [[Znám's problem]], in which all elements of the solution set are prime. For instance, the prime factors of the primary pseudoperfect number 47058 form the solution set {2,3,11,23,31} to Znám's problem. However, the smaller primary pseudoperfect numbers 2, 6, 42, and 1806 do not correspond to solutions to Znám's problem in this way, as their sets of prime factors violate the requirement that no number in the set can equal one plus the product of the other numbers. Anne (1998) observes that there is exactly one solution set of this type that has ''k'' primes in it, for each ''k'' ≤ 8, and conjectures that the same is true for larger ''k''.

If a primary pseudoperfect number ''N'' is one less than a prime number, then ''N''&amp;times;(''N''+1) is also primary pseudoperfect. For instance, 47058 is primary pseudoperfect, and 47059 is prime, so 47058 &amp;times; 47059 = 2214502422 is also primary pseudoperfect.

== History ==
Primary pseudoperfect numbers were first investigated and named by Butske, Jaje, and Mayernik (2000). Using computational search techniques, they proved the remarkable result that for each positive integer ''r'' up to 8, there exists exactly one primary pseudoperfect number with precisely ''r'' (distinct) prime factors, namely, the ''r''th known primary pseudoperfect number. Those with 2 ≤ ''r'' ≤ 8, when reduced [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 288, form the [[arithmetic progression]] 6, 42, 78, 114, 150, 186, 222, as was observed by Sondow and MacMillan (2017).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7575">In [[physics]], the '''no-deleting theorem''' of [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]] is a [[no-go theorem]] which states that, in general, given two copies of some arbitrary quantum state, it is impossible to delete one of the copies.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Pati and S. L. Braunstein, "Impossibility of Deleting an Unknown Quantum State", ''Nature'' '''404''' (2000), p164.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a time-reversed [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to the [[no-cloning theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;W.K. Wootters and W.H. Zurek, "A Single Quantum Cannot be Cloned", ''Nature'' '''299''' (1982), p802.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Dieks, "Communication by EPR devices", ''Physics Letters A'', vol. '''92'''(6) (1982), p271.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that arbitrary states cannot be copied.  This theorem seems remarkable, because, in many senses, quantum states are fragile; the theorem asserts that, in a particular case, they are also robust. Physicist [[Arun K. Pati]] along with  [[Samuel L. Braunstein]] proved this theorem.

The no-deleting theorem, together with the no-cloning theorem, underpin the interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of [[category theory]], and, in particular, as a [[dagger symmetric monoidal category]].&lt;ref&gt;John Baez, 
''[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone]'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Coecke, ''Quantum Picturalism'', (2009) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1787 ArXiv 0908.1787]&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation, known as [[categorical quantum mechanics]], in turn allows a connection to be made from quantum mechanics to [[linear logic]] as the logic of [[quantum information theory]] (in exact analogy to classical logic being founded on [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]]).

==Overview of quantum deletion==
Suppose that there are two copies of an unknown quantum state. A pertinent question in this context is to ask if it is possible, given two identical copies, to delete one of them using quantum mechanical operations? It turns out that one cannot. The no-deleting theorem is a consequence of linearity of [[quantum mechanics]]. Like the no-cloning theorem this has important implications in [[quantum computing]], [[quantum information]] theory and [[quantum mechanics]] in general.

The process of quantum deleting takes two copies of an arbitrary, unknown 
quantum state at the input port and outputs a blank state along with the original. Mathematically, 
this can be described by:
:&lt;math&gt;U |\psi\rangle_A |\psi\rangle_B |A\rangle_C = |\psi\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A'\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the deleting operation which is not necessarily unitary (but a linear operator), &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_A&lt;/math&gt; is the unknown quantum 
state, &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt; is the blank state, &lt;math&gt;|A\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt; is the initial state of 
the deleting machine and &lt;math&gt;|A'\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt; is the final state of the machine.

It may be noted that classical bits can be copied and deleted, as can [[qubits]] in orthogonal states. For example, if we have two identical [[qubits]] &lt;math&gt;|00 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|11 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; then we can transform to &lt;math&gt;|00 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|10 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. In this case we have deleted the second copy. However, it follows from linearity of quantum theory that there is no &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that can perform the deleting operation for any arbitrary state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

== Formal statement of the no-deleting theorem ==

Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; be an unknown [[quantum state]] in some [[Hilbert space]] (and let other states have their usual meaning). Then, 
there is no linear isometric transformation such that 
&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_A |\psi\rangle_B |A\rangle_C \rightarrow |\psi\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A'\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt;, with the final state of the ancilla being independent of
&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Proof ===

The theorem holds for quantum states in a Hilbert space of any dimension. For simplicity, 
let us consider the deleting transformation for two identical qubits. If two qubits are in orthogonal states, then deletion requires that 
:&lt;math&gt;|0 \rangle_A |0 \rangle_B |A\rangle_C \rightarrow |0\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A_0\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|1 \rangle_A |1 \rangle_B |A\rangle_C \rightarrow |1 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A_1\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; be the state of an unknown qubit.  If we have two copies of an unknown qubit, then by linearity of the deleting transformation we have 
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_A |\psi\rangle_B |A\rangle_C = [\alpha^2 |0 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B + \beta^2 
|1\rangle_A |1\rangle_B + \alpha \beta (|0\rangle_A |1\rangle_B + |1 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B ) ] 
|A \rangle_C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \rightarrow 
\alpha^2 |0 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A_0\rangle_C + \beta^2 
|1\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A_1\rangle_C+ {\sqrt 2} \alpha \beta |\Phi \rangle_{ABC}. &lt;/math&gt;
In the above expression, the following transformation has been used: 
:&lt;math&gt;1/{\sqrt 2}(|0\rangle_A |1\rangle_B + |1 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B ) |A \rangle_C \rightarrow |\Phi \rangle_{ABC} .&lt;/math&gt;

However, if we are able to delete a copy, then, at the output port of the deleting machine, the combined state should be 
:&lt;math&gt; |\psi\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A'\rangle_C = 
(\alpha |0 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B  + \beta |1\rangle_A |0\rangle_B) |A'\rangle_C&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, these states are not identical and hence we can say that the machine fails to delete a copy. If we require that the final output states are same, then we will see that there is only one option:
:&lt;math&gt; |\Phi\rangle = 1/{\sqrt 2}(|0 \rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A_1\rangle_C +  |1\rangle_A |0\rangle_B |A_0\rangle_C), &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; |A'\rangle_C = \alpha |A_0\rangle_C +  \beta |A_1\rangle_C .&lt;/math&gt;

Since final state &lt;math&gt;|\Phi \rangle&lt;/math&gt; of the ancilla is normalized for all values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; it must be true that &lt;math&gt; |A_0\rangle_C &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; |A_1\rangle_C &lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal. This means that the quantum information is simply in the final state of the ancilla. One can always obtain the unknown state from the final state of the ancilla using local operation on the ancilla Hilbert space. Thus, linearity of quantum theory does not allow an unknown quantum state to be deleted perfectly.

==Consequence==
* If it were possible to delete an unknown quantum state, then, using two pairs of [[EPR paradox|EPR]] states, we could send signals faster than light. Thus, violation of the no-deleting theorem is inconsistent with the [[no-communication theorem|no-signalling condition]].
* The no-cloning and the no-deleting theorems point to the conservation of quantum information.
* A stronger version of the no-cloning theorem and the no-deleting theorem provide permanence to quantum information.  To create a copy one must import the information from some part of the universe and to delete a state one needs to export it to another part of the universe where it will continue to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11679">'''Quantum technology''' is a new field of physics and engineering, which transitions some of the properties of [[quantum mechanics]], especially [[quantum entanglement]], [[quantum superposition]] and [[quantum tunnelling]], into practical applications such as [[quantum computing]],  [[quantum sensor]]s, [[quantum cryptography]], quantum simulation, [[quantum metrology]] and [[quantum imaging]].

==Applications==

===Sensing===
Quantum superposition states can be very sensitive to a number of external effects, such as electric, magnetic and gravitational fields; rotation, acceleration and time, and therefore can be used to make very accurate sensors. There are many experimental demonstrations of quantum sensing devices, such as the experiments carried out by the nobel laureate [[William D. Phillips]] on using cold atom interferometer systems to measure gravity and the [[atomic clock]] which is used by many national standards agencies around the world to define the second.

Recent efforts are being made to engineer quantum sensing devices, so that they are cheaper, easier to use, more portable, lighter and consume less power. It is believed that if these efforts are successful, it will lead to multiple commercial markets, such as for the monitoring of oil and gas deposits, or in construction.

===Secure communications===
Quantum secure communication are methods which are expected to be 'quantum safe' in the advent of a quantum computing systems that could break current [[cryptography]] systems. One significant component of a quantum secure communication systems is expected to be [[Quantum key distribution]], or 'QKD': a method of transmitting information using entangled light in a way that makes any interception of the transmission obvious to the user.

===Computing===
Quantum computers are the ultimate quantum network, combining 'quantum bits' or '[[qubit]]' which are devices that can store and process quantum data (as opposed to [[binary data]])  with links that can transfer quantum information between qubits. In doing this, quantum computers are predicted to calculate certain algorithms significantly faster than even the largest classical computer available today.

Quantum computers are expected to have a number of significant uses in computing fields such as optimization and machine learning. They are famous for their expected ability to carry out '[[Shor's Algorithm]]', which can be used to factorise large numbers which are mathematically important to secure data transmission.

==The first and second quantum revolutions==
There are many devices available today which are fundamentally reliant on the effects of quantum mechanics. These include: [[laser]] systems, [[transistors]] and [[semi-conductor]] devices and other devices, such as [[MRI]] imagers. These devices are often referred to belonging to the 'first quantum revolution'; the UK [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] (Dstl) grouped these devices as 'quantum 1.0',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/pubs/dstl-uk-quantum-technology-landscape-2014/]&lt;/ref&gt; that is devices which rely on the effects of quantum mechanics. Quantum technologies are often described as the 'second quantum revolution' or 'quantum 2.0'. These are generally regarded as a class of device that actively create, manipulate and read out quantum states of matter, often using the quantum effects of superposition and entanglement.

==History==
The field of quantum technology was first outlined in a 1997 book by [[Gerard J. Milburn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/milburn/books/Schr_Mach.html ''Schrödinger's Machines''], G.J.Milburn, W H Freeman &amp; Co. (1997)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830190154/http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/milburn/books/Schr_Mach.html |date=August 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then followed by a 2003 article by [[Jonathan P. Dowling]] and [[Gerard J. Milburn]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20120714114853/http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/bdm1frlb9tfmr3ar/ Quantum Technology: The Second Quantum Revolution] ,"J.P.Dowling and G.J.Milburn, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 361, 3655 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206091 Quantum Technology: The Second Quantum Revolution]," J.P.Dowling and G.J.Milburn, arXiv:quant-ph/0206091v1&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a 2003 article by [[David Deutsch]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.qubit.org/people/david/structure/Documents/Research%20Papers/PPQT.pdf Physics, Philosophy, and Quantum Technology]," D.Deutsch in the Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Quantum Communication, Measurement and Computing, Shapiro, J.H. and Hirota, O., Eds. (Rinton Press, Princeton, NJ. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The field of quantum technology has benefited immensely from the influx of new ideas from the field of [[quantum information processing]], particularly [[quantum computing]]. Disparate areas of [[quantum physics]], such as [[quantum optics]], [[atom optics]], [[quantum electronics]], and [[quantum nanoscience|quantum nanomechanical]] devices, have been unified under the search for a [[quantum computer]] and given a common language, that of [[quantum information]] theory.

The [http://qurope.eu/system/files/u567/Quantum%20Manifesto.pdf Quantum Manifesto] was signed by 3,400 scientists and officially released at the 2016 [[Quantum Europe Conference]], calling for a quantum technology initiative to coordinate between academia and industry, to move quantum technologies from the laboratory to industry, and to educate quantum technology professionals in a combination of science, engineering, and business.&lt;ref&gt;

==National programmes==
From 2010 onwards, multiple governments have established programmes to explore quantum technologies, such as the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme, which created four quantum 'hubs', the [[Centre for Quantum Technologies]] in Singapore, and QuTech a Dutch centre to develop a topological quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21654566-after-decades-languishing-laboratory-quantum-computers-are-attracting 'A little bit, better' The Economist, 18th June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, there have been multiple investments into quantum technologies made by large companies. Examples include [[Google]]'s partnership with the John Martinis group at [[UCSB]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2014/09/martinis/ The man who will build Google's elusive quantum computer; Wired, 09.05.14]&lt;/ref&gt; multiple partnerships with the Canadian quantum computing company [[D-wave systems]], and investment by many UK companies within the UK quantum technologies programme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7377">In [[additive number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], a '''restricted sumset''' has the form 

:&lt;math&gt;S=\{a_1+\cdots+a_n:\ a_1\in A_1,\ldots,a_n\in A_n \ \mathrm{and}\ P(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\not=0\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; A_1,\ldots,A_n&lt;/math&gt; are finite nonempty subsets of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' and &lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial over ''F''. 

When &lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=1&lt;/math&gt;, ''S'' is the usual [[sumset]] &lt;math&gt;A_1+\cdots+A_n&lt;/math&gt; which is denoted by ''nA'' if &lt;math&gt;A_1=\cdots=A_n=A&lt;/math&gt;; when 

:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}(x_j-x_i),&lt;/math&gt;

''S'' is written as &lt;math&gt;A_1\dotplus\cdots\dotplus A_n&lt;/math&gt; which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;n^{\wedge} A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A_1=\cdots=A_n=A&lt;/math&gt;. Note that |''S''| &gt; 0 if and only if there exist &lt;math&gt;a_1\in A_1,\ldots,a_n\in A_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;P(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\not=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Cauchy–Davenport theorem ==
The '''Cauchy–Davenport theorem''' named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Harold Davenport]] asserts that for any prime ''p'' and nonempty subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of the prime order cyclic group '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' we have the inequality&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson (1996) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GR1412&gt;Geroldinger &amp; Ruzsa (2009) pp.141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|A+B|\ge\min\{p,\ |A|+|B|-1\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

We may use this to deduce the [[Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem]]: given any sequence of 2''n''−1 elements in '''Z'''/''n'', there are ''n'' elements that sums to zero modulo ''n''.  (Here ''n'' does not need to be prime.)&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson (1996) p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GR53&gt;Geroldinger &amp; Ruzsa (2009) p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct consequence of the Cauchy-Davenport theorem is: Given any set ''S'' of ''p''−1 or more nonzero elements, not necessarily distinct, of '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''', every element of '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' can be written as the sum of the elements of some subset (possibly empty) of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram's MathWorld, Cauchy-Davenport Theorem, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cauchy-DavenportTheorem.html, accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kneser's theorem (combinatorics)|Kneser's theorem]] generalises this to finite abelian groups.&lt;ref name=GR143&gt;Geroldinger &amp; Ruzsa (2009) p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erdős–Heilbronn conjecture ==
The '''Erdős–Heilbronn conjecture''' posed by [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Hans Heilbronn]] in 1964 states that &lt;math&gt;|2^\wedge A|\ge\min\{p,2|A|-3\}&lt;/math&gt; if ''p'' is a prime and ''A'' is a nonempty subset of the field '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson (1996) p.77&lt;/ref&gt;  This was first confirmed by J. A. Dias da Silva and Y. O. Hamidoune in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

who showed that 

:&lt;math&gt;|n^\wedge A|\ge\min\{p(F),\ n|A|-n^2+1\},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a finite nonempty subset of a field ''F'', and ''p''(''F'') is a prime ''p'' if ''F'' is of characteristic ''p'', and ''p''(''F'') = ∞ if ''F'' is of characteristic 0.

== Combinatorial Nullstellensatz ==
A powerful tool in the study of lower bounds for cardinalities of various restricted sumsets is the following fundamental principle: the combinatorial [[Nullstellensatz]].&lt;ref name="Alon1999"&gt;{{cite journal

Suppose that the coefficient of the monomial &lt;math&gt;x_1^{k_1}\cdots x_n^{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero and &lt;math&gt;k_1+\cdots+k_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total degree]] of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;A_1,\ldots,A_n&lt;/math&gt; are finite subsets of ''F'' with &lt;math&gt;|A_i|&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, then there are &lt;math&gt;a_1\in A_1,\ldots,a_n\in A_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\not = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The method using the combinatorial Nullstellensatz is also called the polynomial method. This tool was rooted in a paper of N. Alon and M. Tarsi in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

He later earned an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]]. During [[World War II]] he worked for a [[Theoretical physics|Theoretical Physics]] Division group in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. In 1946 he received his Ph.D at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] under the supervision of [[Solomon Lefschetz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=12968 Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning 1949 Bellman worked for many years at [[RAND corporation]] and it was during this time that he developed [[dynamic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Bellman R: ''An introduction to the theory of dynamic programming'' RAND Corp.

Later in life, Richard Bellman's interests began to emphasize biology and medicine, which he identified as "the frontiers of contemporary science". In 1967, he became founding editor of the journal [[Mathematical Biosciences]] which specialized in the publication of applied mathematics research for medical and biological topics.  In 1985, the [[Bellman Prize in Mathematical Biosciences]] was created in his honor, being awarded biannually to the journal's best research paper.

Bellman was diagnosed with a brain tumor &lt;!-- malignant or benign? --&gt; in 1973, which was removed but resulted in complications that left him severely disabled.

He was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1979, "for contributions to decision processes and control system theory, particularly the creation and application of dynamic programming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf|title=IEEE Medal of Honor Recipients|publisher=[[IEEE]]|accessdate={{Format date|2011|4|6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His key work is the [[Bellman equation]].

==Work==

===Bellman equation===
A [[Bellman equation]], also known as a ''dynamic programming equation'', is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as [[dynamic programming]]. Almost any problem which can be solved using [[optimal control theory]] can also be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering [[control theory]] and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in [[economic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lars |last=Ljungqvist |authorlink=Lars Ljungqvist |first2=Thomas J. |last2=Sargent |authorlink2=Thomas J. Sargent |title=Recursive Macroeconomic Theory |location= |publisher=MIT Press |edition=3rd |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-262-31202-8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-PxCwAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation===
The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] (HJB) is a [[partial differential equation]] which is central to [[optimal control]] theory. The solution of the HJB equation is the 'value function', which gives the optimal cost-to-go for a given [[dynamical system]] with an associated cost function. Classical variational problems, for example, the [[brachistochrone problem]] can be solved using this method as well. The equation is a result of the theory of [[dynamic programming]] which was pioneered in the 1950s by Richard Bellman and coworkers. The corresponding discrete-time equation is usually referred to as the [[Bellman equation]]. In continuous time, the result can be seen as an extension of earlier work in [[classical physics]] on the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morton I. |last=Kamien |first2=Nancy L. |last2=Schwartz |title=Dynamic Optimization: The Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control in Economics and Management |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |edition=2nd |year=1991 |isbn= |pages=259–263 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IoGUn8wjDQC&amp;pg=PA259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curse of dimensionality===
{{Main|Curse of dimensionality}}
The ''curse of dimensionality'' is an expression coined by Bellman to describe the problem caused by the exponential increase in [[volume]] associated with adding extra dimensions to a (mathematical) space. One implication of the curse of dimensionality is that some methods for numerical solution of the Bellman equation require vastly more computer time when there are more state variables in the value function. For example, 100 evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample a [[unit interval]] with no more than 0.01 distance between points; an equivalent sampling of a 10-dimensional [[unit hypercube]] with a lattice with a spacing of 0.01 between adjacent points would require 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; sample points: thus, in some sense, the 10-dimensional hypercube can be said to be a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; "larger" than the unit interval. (Adapted from an example by R. E. Bellman, see below.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adaptive control processes: a guided tour|year=1961|author=Richard Bellman|publisher=Princeton University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bellman–Ford algorithm===
Though discovering the algorithm after Ford he is referred to in the [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]], also sometimes referred to as the Label Correcting Algorithm, computes single-source shortest paths in a [[weighted digraph]] where some of the [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] weights may be negative. [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] accomplishes the same problem with a lower running time, but requires edge weights to be non-negative.

Over the course of his career he published 619 papers and 39 books. During the last 11 years of his life he published over 100 papers despite suffering from crippling complications of brain surgery (Dreyfus, 2003). A selection:&lt;ref name="SS08"/&gt;

In mathematics, a '''ringed topos''' is a generalization of a [[ringed space]]; that is, the notion is obtained by replacing a "[[topological space]]" by a "[[topos]]". The notion of a ringed topos has applications to deformation theory in [[algebraic geometry]] (cf. [[cotangent complex]]) and the mathematical foundation of [[quantum mechanics]]. In the latter subject, a [[Bohr topos]] is a ringed topos that plays the role of a quantum [[phase space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/07/bohr_toposes.html|title=Bohr toposes|last=Schreiber|first=Urs|authorlink=Urs Schreiber|date=2011-07-25|website=[[The n-Category Café]]|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heunen|first=Chris|last2=Landsman|first2=Nicolaas P.|last3=Spitters|first3=Bas|date=2009-10-01|title=A Topos for Algebraic Quantum Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-009-0865-6|journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]]|language=en|volume=291|issue=1|pages=63–110|doi=10.1007/s00220-009-0865-6|issn=0010-3616|via=|arxiv=0709.4364|bibcode=2009CMaPh.291...63H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a topos-version of a "locally ringed space" is not straightforward, as the meaning of "local" in this context is not obvious. One can introduce the notion of a '''locally ringed topos''' by introducing a sort of geometric conditions of [[local rings]] (see SGA4, Exposé IV, Exercice 13.9), which is equivalent to saying that all the stalks of the structure ring object are local rings when there are [[enough points]].

== Morphisms ==

A morphism &lt;math&gt;(T, \mathcal{O}_T) \to (T', \mathcal{O}_{T'})&lt;/math&gt; of ringed topoi is a pair consisting of a topos morphism &lt;math&gt;f: T \to T'&lt;/math&gt; and a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{T'} \to f_*\mathcal{O}_T&lt;/math&gt;.

If one replaces a "topos" by an [[∞-topos]], then one gets the notion of a '''ringed ∞-topos'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28378">A '''schema for horizontal dials''' is a set of instructions used to construct horizontal [[sundial]]s using [[compass and straightedge construction]] techniques, which were widely used in Europe from the late fifteen century to the late nineteen century. The common [[London dial|horizontal sundial]] is a geometric [[Graphical projection|projection]] of an [[equatorial sundial]] onto a horizontal plane.

The special properties of the [[polar-pointing gnomon]] (axial gnomon) were first known to the Moorish astronomer [[Abdul Hassan Ali]] in the early thirteenth century{{sfn|BSS Glossary|1}} and this led the way to the dial-plates, with which we are familiar, dial plates where the style and hour lines have a common root.

Through the centuries artisans have used different methods to markup the hour lines sundials using the methods that were familiar to them, in addition the topic has fascinated mathematicians and become a topic of study. Graphical projection was once commonly taught, though this has been superseded by [[trigonometry]], [[logarithms]], [[sliderule]]s and [[computer applications|computers]] which made [[arithmetic|arithmetical calculations]] increasingly trivial/ Graphical projection was once the mainstream method for laying out a sundial but has been sidelined and is now only of academic interest.

The first known document in English describing a schema for graphical projection was published in Scotland in 1440, leading to a series of distinct schema for horizontal dials each with characteristics that suited the target [[latitude]] and construction method of the time.

==Context==
[[File:The Ummayad Mosque also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus]]
The art of sundial design is to produce a dial that accurately displays local time. Sundial designers have also been fascinated by the mathematics of the dial and possible new ways of displaying the information. Modern dialling started in the tenth century when Arab astronomers made the great discovery that a gnomon parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines show [[equal hour]]s or ''legal hours'' on any day of the year: the dial of [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]] is the oldest dial of this type. {{efn|Time had been measured by dividing the daylight hours by twelve using ''unequal hours'', known as [[Italian hours]] or [[Babylonian hours]].}} Dials of this type appeared in Austria and Germany in the 1440s.{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=6}}

A dial plate can be laid out, by a pragmatic approach, observing and marking a shadow at regular intervals throughout the day on each day of the year. If the [[latitude]] is known the dial plate can be laid out using [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|geometrical construction techniques]] which rely on [[graphical projection|projection geometry]], or by calculation using the known formulas and [[trigonometric tables]] usually using [[logarithms]], or [[slide rule]]s or more recently [[computer application|computer]]s or [[mobile phone application|mobile phone]]s. [[Linear algebra]] has provided a useful language to describe the [[mathematical transformation|transformation]]s.

A sundial schema uses a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and a straight edge]] to firstly to derive the essential angles for that latitude, then to use this to draw the hourlines on the dial plate. In modern terminology this would mean that graphical techniques were used to derive &lt;math&gt; \sin x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m\tan y &lt;/math&gt; and from it &lt;math&gt; \sin x .\tan y &lt;/math&gt;. {{efn|The British Sundial Society publishes a glossary of computer terms and the symbols that are commonly used to represent them. Latitude is represented by ''phi'',&lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; or ''φ'' or Φ.}}

===Basic calculation===
*Using a large sheet of paper.
*Starting at the bottom a horizontal line is drawn, and a vertical one up the centre. Where they cross is becomes the origin O, the foot of the Gnomon.
*A horizontal line draw a line which fixes the size of the dial. Where it crosses the centre line is an important construction point F
*A construction line is drawn upwards from O at the angle of latitude.{{efn|All dials in these illustrations use a latitude of 52°, it was chosen randomly but is roughly that of [[Bletchley Park]], [[Den Haag]] or [[Bielefeld]].}}
*Using a square, (drop a line)  a line from F through the construction line is drawn so they cross at right angles. That point E, is an important construction point. To be precise it is the line FE that is important as it is length &lt;math&gt;\sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;.
*Using compasses, or dividers the length FE was copied upwards in the centre line from F. The new construction point is called G The construction lines and FE are erased.

Such geometric constructions were well known and remained part of the high school (UK grammar school) curriculum until the [[New Math]]s revolution in the 1970s.{{sfn|Durell|1921}}

The schema shown above was used in 1525 (from an earlier work 1440) by [[Dürer]] is still used today. The simpler schema were more suitable for dials designed for the lower latitudes, requiring a narrow sheet of paper for the construction,  than those intended for the higher latitudes. This prompted the quest for other constructions.

==Horizontal dials==
The first part of the process is common to many methods. It establishes a point on the north south line that is sin φ from the meridian line.

===Early Scottish method (1440) Dürer (1525) Rohr (1965) ===
*Start with the basic method shown above
*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 1, 2, 3 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=38–39}}
The significant problem is the width of the paper needed in the higher latitudes. {{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Benedetti (1574)===
Benedetti, an impoverished nobleman worked as a mathematician at the court of Savola. His book which describes this method was ''De gnomonum umbrarumque solarium usu'' published in 1574. It describes a method for displaying the legal hours, that is equal hours as we use today, while most people still used unequal hours which divided the hours of daylight into 12 equal hours- but they would change as the year progressed. Benedettis method divides the quadrant into 15° segments. Two construction are made: a parallel horizontal line that defines the tan h distances, and a gnomonic polar line GT which represents sin φ. 
* Draw a quadrant GRB, with 15° segments. GR is horizontal. 
* A parallel horizontal line is drawn from PE, and ticks made where it bisects the 15° rays. 
* GX is the latitude. T is the crossing point with PE. GTE is the gnomonic triangle.
* The length GT is copied to the bottom of E giving the point F. 
* The hour lines are drawn from F, and the dial is complete.
Benedetti included instructions for drawing a point gnomon so unequal hours could be plotted.

===Clavius method (1586)===
(''Fabica et usus instrumenti ad horologiorum descriptionem.'') Rome Italy.

The Clavius method looks at a quarter of the dial. It views the horizontal and the perpendicular plane to the polar axis as two rectangles hinged around the top edge of both dials. the polar axis will be at φ degrees to the polar axis, and the hour lines will be equispaced on the polar plane an equatorial dial. (15°). Hour points on the polar plane will connect to the matching point on the horizontal plane. The horizontal hour lines are plotted to the origin.

{{sfn|Gunella|2013}}
*Draw the gnomomic triangle, lying on it hypotenuse.
*On the small side, draw a (equatorial) square, with 15° hour markings.
*The dial plate is constructed with compasses taking it sizes from the triangle.
*The hour lines 12, 3, and 6 are known. The hour lines 1 and 2 are taken from the side of the square.
*A diagonal is taken from 12 to 6, and lines parallel to this drawn through 1 and 2, giving 5 and 4
*The morning dial is a reflection of this.

===Stirrup's method (1652)===
*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3.
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.
&lt;!--*If the paper is large enough, the method above works from 7 until 12, and 12 until 5 and the values before and after 6 are calculated through symmetry. However, there is another way of marking up 7 and 8, and 4 and 5. Call the point where 3 crosses the line R, and a drop a line at right-angles to the base line. Call that point W. Use a construction line to join W and F. Waugh calls the crossing points with the hours lines K, L, M.
*Using compasses or dividers, add two more points to this line N and P, so that the distances MN = ML, and MP = MK. The missing hour lines are drawn from O through N and through P. The construction lines are erased.--&gt;{{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Bettini method (1660)===
The [[Jesuit]] [[Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] penned a method which was posthumously  published in the book ''Recreationum Mathematicarum Apiaria Novissima'' 1660.
*Draw the gnonomic triangle with the hypotenuse against the ''meridian'' line, and φ to the bottom, C. The other point call M, the right angle call G.
*A horizontal line is drawn through M, this is the ''equinoctial''
*A circle centred an M with a radius MG is drawn. G2 and G3 are the intersections of the circle and meridian.
*In the top quadrants, points are marked each 30°. Two are named P, Q. 
*Construction lines are drawn from G2 and G3 through P and Q- the intersections with the equinoctial are marked.
*To finish the hourlines are drawn through these points from C, and the dial squared off.

===Leybourn (1669)===
[[William Leybourn]] published his "''Art of Dialling''"{{efn|The Art of Dialling : Performed Geometrically, by Scale and Compasses: Arithmetically, by the Canons of Sines and Tangents: Instrumentally, by a Trigonal Instrument ... ; To which is added A Supplement; Shewing, How by Scale and Compasses to inscribe such Circles of the Sphere into Sun-Dial-Plans, that shall shew (besides the hour of the day) the Diurnal Motion of the Sun ...}} in 1669, a with it a six-stage method. His description relies heavily on the term ''[[Scale of chords|line of chords]]'', for which a modern diallist substitutes a [[protractor]]. The line of chords was a scale found on the [[Sector(instrument)|sector]] which was used in conjunction with a set of dividers or compasses. It was still used by navigators up to the end of the 19th century.{{efn|The line of chords is available on a builders metal rule (Stanley 60R Line of Chords Rule) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://metal.brightcookie.com/shared/toolbook/tool_46.htm&lt;/ref&gt; }}
*Draw a circle, and its two cardinal diameters: E–W, and S–N (top to bottom). O is their crossing point or origin.
*Using a [[scale of chords]] or protractor, lay off two lines, ''"0a"'' that is 52° from  OS, and ''"0b"'' that is 52° from OW. (they will be at right angles. The points "a" and "b" are important.
*With a straight edge draw a line connect E with "a", it cuts SN (the meridian line) at P, which is called the ''pole of the world''. Now connect E to "a", it connects AE. This point is important as it is where the ''meridian crosses the equinoctial circle''. The points E, AE, and W lie on the equinoctial circle. The next task is to use this information to locate the centre and to draw the circle. Use a construction line to join AE and W. At the centre point, raise a line at right angles. Where it cuts the SN (the meridian) will be C, the centre of the equinoctial circle. Use C to draw an arc from E to W, it will pass through AE.
* There is now a semicircle passing through E and W, and the equinoctial arc passing through E and W. Divide the semicircle into 12 equal parts, i.e. 15° angles. Mark with a "construction point". {{efn|This can be done using the line of chords set at 60° and subdividing.}}
* A ruler joins O with the points on the semicircle. These lines cut the equinoctial arc: a series of unequal points ("markers) are created.
* A ruler from P (the pole of the world) takes a line from these markers back over the semicircle. Where it cuts it will be the "hour point"; these hour points are unequally spaced.
* The  hour lines are drawn from each of these "hour points" to O the origin. The origin is the foot of the style which is cut at 52°. {{sfn|Leybourn|1700}}{{sfn|Sawyer|191}}

===Ozanam's method (1673) Mayall (1938)===
This method requires a far smaller piece of paper,{{sfn|Sawyer|191}} a great advantage for higher latitudes.

*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 and represent the points &lt;math&gt;\tan h \sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;.  
*The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=38–39}}
*The lines through 9 and 3 are extended to the WE line and a line dropped orthogonally from 9 and 3 to the WE line, call the crossing points W' and E'. From W and E two more lines are drawn 15° apart, these cut the verticals creating the hour points 7, 8 and 4, 5. Lines taken from 0 to these hour points are the hour lines on the final dial.

===Encyclopedia method (1771)===
This method uses the properties of chords to establish distance &lt;math&gt; m. \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt; in the top quadrant, and then transfers this distance into the bottom quadrant so that &lt;math&gt;\sin \phi \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt; is established. Again, a transfer of this measure to the chords in the top quadrant. The final lines establish the formula &lt;math&gt;\tan \kappa =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sin\theta\sin\phi\over\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta\sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;

This is then transferred by symmetry to all quadrants. It was used in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica#1768–1826|Encyclopædia Britannica]] First Edition 1771, Sixth Edition 1823{{sfn|Sawyer|193|p=36}}

*The gnomon is drawn first against the north–south line. In doing so, a diameter at ''φ'' degrees to the vertical is drawn; its reflection will also be needed.
*The circumference is marked off at 15° intervals in the top quadrants. Chords parallel to the horizontal are drawn (the length of these chords will be sin Θ.
*The measurement of each chord is transferred to form a scale along the lower radiuses. When joined these points form a series of parallel lines that are sin θ. sin φ in length.
*These measurements are transferred up to the chord.
*The final hour lines are drawn from the origins through these crossing points. ( &lt;math&gt;\tan \kappa =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sin\theta\sin\phi\over\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta\sin\phi &lt;/math&gt; ){{sfn|Sawyer|193|p=37}}

*From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 if you take just 3 and represent the points &lt;math&gt;\tan h \sin\phi &lt;/math&gt;.

===Nicholson's method (1825)===
This method first appeared in Peter Nicholsons ''A popular Course of Pure and Mixed Mathematics'' in 1825. It was copied by School World in Jun 1903, then in Kenneth Lynch's, Sundial and Spheres 1971. {{sfn|Sawyer|194}} It starts by drawing the well known triangle, and takes the vertices to draw two circles at radius (OB) sin φ and (AB) tan φ. The 15° lines are drawn, intersecting these circles. Lines are taken horizontally, and vertically from these circles and their intersection point (OB sin t,AB cos t) is on the hour line. That is tan κ = OB sin t/ AB cos t which resolves to sin φ. tan t.

*Draw the NS line, and the EW line crossing at the origin O. At a convenient point in the first quadrant join the axes with a line set at the target angle. This forms the basic triangle OAB.
*Set the compasses at length OB and inscribe a circle. Set the compasses on AB and inscribe a concentric circle. On both of these circles mark out the 15° angles.
*Taking the lines vertically from the inner circle, and horizontally from the outer circle, Mark each of the intersections. These are on the hour lines.
*Connect the intersection points to the origin.

===Foster Serles Dialling Scales (1638)===
{{see|Dialing scales}}
* A right-angle is drawn on the dial-face and the latitude scale is laid against the ''x''-axis. 
* The target latitude point is marked across on to the dial face. The hour scale is placed from this point to the noon line (conventionally, the zero point is on the noon line). 
* Each of the hour points is copied over to the dial face, and this procedure is repeated, giving the hours both sides of noon. A straight edge is used to connect these points to the origin, thus drawing the hour lines for that location. 
* A vertical line from the target latitude point, and a horizontal line through the noon point will bisect at the three-hour (9am–3pm) marker. 
* The style will be at the same angle as the latitude.

===Saphea (As-Saphiah)===
This was an early and convenient method to use if you had access to an [[astrolabe]] as many [[astrologer]]s and [[mathematician]]s of the time would have had. The method involved copying the projections of the [[celestial sphere]] onto a plane surface. A vertical line was drawn with a line at the angle of the latitude drawn on the bisection of the vertical with the celestial sphere. {{sfn|Gunella|2013c}}

'''Stochastic partial differential equations''' ('''SPDEs''') generalize [[partial differential equations]] via random force terms and coefficients, in the same way ordinary [[stochastic differential equations]] generalize [[ordinary differential equations]].

They have relevance to [[quantum field theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

== Examples ==
One of the most studied SPDEs is the stochastic [[heat equation]], which may formally be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\partial_t u = \Delta u + \xi\;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplacian]] and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; denotes space-time [[white noise]].

== Discussion ==
One difficulty is their lack of regularity. In one space dimension, solutions to the stochastic heat equation are only almost 1/2-[[Hölder continuous]] in space and 1/4-Hölder continuous in time. For dimensions two and higher, solutions are not even function-valued, but can be made sense of as random [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17916">The concept of '''system of imprimitivity''' is used in [[mathematics]], particularly in [[algebra]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], both within the context of the [[theory]] of [[group representation]]s. It was used by [[George Mackey]] as the basis for his theory of [[induced representation|induced unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s.

The simplest case, and the context in which the idea was first noticed, is that of [[finite group]]s (see [[primitive permutation group]]). Consider a group ''G'' and subgroups ''H'' and ''K'', with ''K'' contained in ''H''. Then the left [[coset]]s of ''H'' in ''G'' are each the union of left cosets of ''K''. Not only that, but translation (on one side) by any element ''g'' of ''G'' respects this decomposition. The connection with [[induced representation]]s is that the [[permutation representation]] on cosets is the special case of induced representation, in which a representation is induced from a [[trivial representation]]. The structure, combinatorial in this case, respected by translation shows that either ''K'' is a [[maximal subgroup]] of ''G'', or there is a '''system of imprimitivity''' (roughly, a lack of full 'mixing'). In order to generalise this to other cases, the concept is re-expressed: first in terms of functions on ''G'' constant on ''K''-cosets, and then in terms of [[projection operator]]s (for example the averaging over ''K''-cosets of elements of the [[group algebra]]).

Mackey also used the idea for his explication of quantization theory based on preservation of [[relativity group]]s acting on [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. This generalized work of [[Eugene Wigner]] and others and is often considered to be one of the pioneering ideas in [[canonical quantization]].

== Illustrative Example ==

To motivate the general definitions, we first formulate a definition in the case of finite groups and their representations on finite-dimensional [[vector space]]s.

Suppose ''G'' is a finite group and ''U'' a representation of ''G'' on a finite-dimensional complex vector space ''H''. The action of ''G'' on elements of ''H'' induces an [[group action|action]] of ''G'' on the vector subspaces ''W'' of ''H'' in an obvious way:

:&lt;math&gt; U_g W = \{ U_{g} w: w \in W \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose ''X'' is a set of subspaces of ''H'' such that
# the elements of ''X'' are permuted by the action of ''G'' on subspaces and
# ''H'' is the (internal) algebraic [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] of the elements of ''X'', i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; H = \bigoplus_{W \in X} W. &lt;/math&gt;

Then (''U'',''X'') is a system of imprimitivity for ''G''.

Two assertions must hold in the definition above:
# the spaces ''W'' for ''W'' ∈ ''X'' must [[linear span|span]] ''H'', and
# the spaces ''W'' ∈ ''X'' must be [[linearly independent]], that is,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{W \in X} c_W v_W=0, \quad v_{W} \in W \setminus \{ 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

holds only when all the coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; are zero.

If the action of ''G'' on the elements of ''X'' is [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]], then we say this is a transitive system of imprimitivity.

Suppose ''G'' is a finite group, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; a subgroup of ''G''. A representation ''U'' of ''G'' is induced from a representation ''V'' of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there exist the following: 
* a transitive system of imprimitivity (''U'', ''X'') and 
* a subspace ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''X'' 
such that ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the fixed point subgroup of ''W'' under the action of ''G'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; G_0 = \{g \in G: U_g W_0\subseteq W_0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

and ''V'' is equivalent to the representation of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
on ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; given by ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for ''h'' ∈ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that by this definition, ''induced by'' is a relation between representations. We would like to show that there is actually a mapping on representations which corresponds to this relation.

For finite groups one can easily show that a [[well-defined]] inducing construction exists on equivalence of representations by considering the [[character theory|character]] of a representation ''U'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \chi_U(g) = \operatorname{tr}(U_g). &lt;/math&gt;

In fact if a representation ''U'' of ''G'' is induced from a representation ''V'' of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \chi_U(g) = \frac{1}{|G_0|} \sum_{\{ x \in G : {x}^{-1} \,
g \, x \in G_0\}} \chi_V({x}^{-1} \ g \ x), \quad \forall g \in G. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the character function χ&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; (and therefore ''U'' itself) is completely determined by χ&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Example ===

Let ''G'' be a finite group and consider the space ''H'' of complex-valued functions on ''G''. The left [[regular representation]] of ''G'' on ''H'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; [\operatorname{L}_g \psi](h) = \psi(g^{-1} h). &lt;/math&gt;

Now ''H'' can be considered as the algebraic direct sum of the one-dimensional spaces ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''x'' ∈ ''G'', where

:&lt;math&gt; W_x = \{\psi \in H: \psi(g) = 0, \quad \forall g \neq x\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spaces ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; are permuted by L&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Infinite dimensional systems of imprimitivity ==

To generalize the finite dimensional definition given in the preceding section, a suitable replacement for the set ''X'' of vector subspaces of ''H'' which is permuted by the representation ''U'' is needed. As it turns out, a naïve approach base on subspaces of ''H'' will not work; for example the translation representation of '''R''' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') has no system of imprimitivity in this sense. The right formulation of direct sum decomposition is formulated in terms of [[projection-valued measure]]s.

Mackey's original formulation was expressed in terms of a locally compact second countable (lcsc) group ''G'', a standard Borel space ''X'' and a Borel [[group action]]

:&lt;math&gt; G \times X \rightarrow X, \quad (g,x) \mapsto g \cdot x. &lt;/math&gt;

We will refer to this as a standard Borel ''G''-space.

The definitions can be given in a much more general context, but the original setup used by Mackey is still quite general and requires fewer technicalities.

'''Definition'''. Let ''G'' be a lcsc group acting on a standard Borel space ''X''. A system of imprimitivity based on (''G'', ''X'') consists of a separable [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' and a pair consisting of 
* A strongly-continuous [[unitary representation]] ''U'': ''g'' → ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G'' on ''H''.
* A [[projection-valued measure]] π on the Borel sets of ''X'' with values in the projections of ''H'';
which satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; U_g \pi(A) U_{g^{-1}} = \pi(g \cdot A). &lt;/math&gt;

===Example ===

Let ''X'' be a standard ''G'' space and μ a σ-finite countably additive ''invariant'' measure on ''X''. This means

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(g^{-1} A) = \mu(A) \quad &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''g'' ∈ ''G'' and Borel subsets ''A'' of ''G''.

Let π(''A'') be multiplication by the indicator function of ''A'' and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; be the operator

:&lt;math&gt; [U_g \psi] (x) =\psi(g^{-1} x).\quad &lt;/math&gt;

Then (''U'', π) is a system of imprimitivity of (''G'', ''X'') on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

This system of imprimitivity is sometimes called the ''Koopman system of imprimitivity''.

==Homogeneous systems of imprimitivity ==

A system of imprimitivity is homogeneous of multiplicity ''n'', where 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ ω [[if and only if]] the corresponding projection-valued measure π on ''X'' is homogeneous of multiplicity ''n''. In fact, ''X'' breaks up into a countable disjoint family {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt; 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ ω &lt;/sub&gt; of Borel sets such that π is homogeneous of multiplicity ''n'' on ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also easy to show ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''G'' invariant.

'''Lemma'''. Any system of imprimitivity is an orthogonal direct sum of homogeneous ones.

It can be shown that if the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is transitive, then any system of imprimitivity on ''X'' is homogeneous. More generally, if the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is [[ergodic]] (meaning that ''X'' cannot be reduced by invariant proper Borel sets of ''X'') then any system of imprimitivity on ''X'' is homogeneous.

We now discuss how the structure of homogeneous systems of imprimitivity can be expressed in a form which generalizes the Koopman representation given in the example above.

In the following, we assume that μ is a σ-finite measure on a standard Borel ''G''-space ''X'' such that the action of ''G'' respects the measure class of μ. This condition is weaker than invariance, but it suffices to construct a unitary translation operator similar to the Koopman operator in the example above. ''G'' respects the measure class of μ means that the Radon-Nikodym derivative

:&lt;math&gt; s(g,x) = \bigg[\frac{d \mu}{d g^{-1}\mu}\bigg](x) \in [0, \infty) &lt;/math&gt;

is well-defined for every ''g'' ∈ ''G'', where

:&lt;math&gt; g^{-1}\mu(A) = \mu(g A). \quad &lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that there is a version of ''s'' which is jointly Borel measurable, that is

:&lt;math&gt; s : G \times X \rightarrow [0, \infty) &lt;/math&gt;

is Borel measurable and satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; s(g,x) = \bigg[\frac{d \mu}{d g^{-1}\mu}\bigg](x) \in [0, \infty) &lt;/math&gt;

for almost all values of (''g'', ''x'') ∈ ''G'' &amp;times; ''X''.

Suppose ''H'' is a separable Hilbert space, U(''H'') the unitary operators on ''H''. A ''unitary cocycle'' is a Borel mapping

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi: G \times X \rightarrow \operatorname{U}(H) &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(e, x) = I \quad &lt;/math&gt;

for almost all ''x'' ∈ ''X''

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(g h, x) = \Phi(g, h \cdot x) \Phi(h, x) &lt;/math&gt;

for almost all (''g'', ''h'', ''x''). A unitary cocycle is '''strict''' if and only if the above relations hold for all (''g'', ''h'', ''x''). It can be shown that for any unitary cocycle there is a strict unitary cocycle which is equal almost everywhere to it (Varadarajan, 1985).

'''Theorem'''. Define

:&lt;math&gt; [U_g \psi](x) = \sqrt{s(g,g^{-1}x)}\ \Phi(g, g^{-1} x) \ \psi(g^{-1} x). &lt;/math&gt;

Then ''U'' is a unitary representation of ''G'' on the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X^\oplus H d \mu(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if for any Borel set ''A'', π(''A'') is the projection operator

:&lt;math&gt; \pi(A) \psi = 1_A \psi, \quad \int_X^\oplus H d \mu(x) \rightarrow \int_X^\oplus H d \mu(x), &lt;/math&gt;

then (''U'', π) is a system of imprimitivity of (''G'',''X'').

Conversely, any homogeneous system of imprimitivity is of this form, for some measure σ-finite measure μ. This measure is unique up to measure equivalence, that is to say, two such measures have the same sets of measure 0.

Much more can be said about the correspondence between homogeneous systems of imprimitivity and cocycles.

When the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is [[transitive action|transitive]] however, the correspondence takes a particularly explicit form based on the representation obtained by restricting the cocycle Φ to a fixed point subgroup of the action. We consider this case in the next section.

===Example ===
A system of imprimitivity (''U'', π) of (''G'',''X'') on a separable Hilbert space ''H'' is '''irreducible''' if and only if the only closed subspaces invariant under all the operators ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; and π(''A'') for ''g'' and element of ''G'' and ''A'' a Borel subset of ''X'' are ''H'' or {0}.

If (''U'', π) is irreducible, then π is homogeneous. Moreover, the corresponding measure on ''X'' as per the previous theorem is ergodic.

== Induced representations ==

If ''X'' is a Borel ''G'' space and ''x'' ∈ ''X'', then the fixed point subgroup

:&lt;math&gt; G_x = \{g \in G: g \cdot x = x \} &lt;/math&gt;

is a closed subgroup of ''G''. Since we are only assuming the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is Borel, this fact is non-trivial. To prove it, one can use the fact that a standard Borel ''G''-space can be imbedded into a compact ''G''-space in which the action is continuous.

'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''G'' acts on ''X'' transitively. Then there is a σ-finite quasi-invariant measure μ on ''X'' which is unique up to measure equivalence (that is any two such measures have the same sets of measure zero).

If Φ is a strict unitary cocycle

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi: G \times X \rightarrow \operatorname{U}(H) &lt;/math&gt;

then the restriction of Φ to the fixed point subgroup ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Borel measurable unitary representation ''U'' of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''H'' (Here U(''H'') has the strong operator topology). However, it is known that a Borel measurable unitary representation is equal almost everywhere (with respect to Haar measure) to a strongly continuous unitary representation. This restriction mapping sets up a fundamental correspondence:

'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''G'' acts on ''X'' transitively with quasi-invariant measure μ. There is a bijection from unitary equivalence classes of systems of imprimitivity of (''G'', ''X'') and unitary equivalence classes of representation of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Moreover, this bijection preserves irreducibility, that is a system of imprimitivity of (''G'', ''X'') is irreducible if and only if the corresponding representation of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is irreducible.

Given a representation ''V'' of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; the corresponding representation of ''G'' is called the '''representation induced by''' ''V''.

See Theorem 6.2 of (Varadarajan, 1985).

== Applications to the theory of group representations ==

Systems of imprimitivity arise naturally in the determination of the representations of a group ''G'' which is the [[semi-direct product]] of an abelian group ''N'' by a group ''H'' that acts by automorphisms of ''N''. This means ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'' and ''H'' a subgroup of ''G'' such that ''G'' = ''N H'' and ''N'' ∩ ''H'' = {''e''} (with ''e'' being the [[identity element]] of ''G'').

An important example of this is the inhomogeneous [[Lorentz group]].

Fix ''G'', ''H'' and ''N'' as above and let ''X'' be the character space of ''N''. In particular, ''H'' acts on ''X'' by 
:&lt;math&gt; [ h \cdot \chi](n) = \chi(h^{-1} n h). &lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem'''. There is a bijection between unitary equivalence classes of representations of ''G'' and unitary equivalence classes of systems of imprimitivity based on (''H'', ''X''). This correspondence preserves intertwining operators. In particular, a representation of ''G'' is irreducible if and only if the corresponding system of imprimitivity is irreducible.

This result is of particular interest when the action of ''H'' on ''X'' is such that every ergodic quasi-invariant measure on ''X'' is transitive. In that case, each such measure is the image of 
(a totally finite version) of Haar measure on ''X'' by the map

:&lt;math&gt; g \mapsto g \cdot x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

A necessary condition for this to be the case is that there is a countable set of ''H'' invariant Borel sets which separate the orbits of ''H''. This is the case for instance for the action of the Lorentz group on the character space of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Example: the Heisenberg group ===
The [[Heisenberg group]] is the group of 3 &amp;times; 3 ''real'' matrices of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; x &amp; z \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; y \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This group is the semi-direct product of

:&lt;math&gt; H = \bigg\{\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; w &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}: w \in \mathbb{R} \bigg\} &lt;/math&gt;

and the abelian normal subgroup

:&lt;math&gt; N = \bigg\{\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; s \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}: s,t \in \mathbb{R} \bigg\}. &lt;/math&gt;

Denote the typical matrix in ''H'' by [''w''] and the typical one in ''N'' by [''s'',''t'']. Then

:&lt;math&gt; [w]^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}s \\ t \end{bmatrix} [w] = \begin{bmatrix}s \\ - w s + t \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ -w &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} s \\ t \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

''w'' acts on the dual of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by multiplication by the transpose matrix

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -w \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to completely determine the orbits and the representation theory.

'''Orbit structure''': The orbits fall into two classes: 
#A horizontal line which intersects the ''y''-axis at a non-zero value ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, we can take the quasi-invariant measure on this line to be Lebesgue measure.
# A single point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,0) on the ''x''-axis.
[[Image:OrbitStructureDual.png|thumb|250px|Orbit structure on dual space]]
'''Fixed point subgroups''': These also fall into two classes depending on the orbit:
# The trivial subgroup {0}.
# The group ''H'' itself.
'''Classification''': This allows us to completely classify all irreducible representations of the Heisenberg group. These are parametrized by the set consisting of
# '''R''' &amp;minus; {0}. These are infinite-dimensional.
# Pairs (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, λ) ∈ '''R''' &amp;times; '''R'''. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the abscissa of the single point orbit on the ''x''-axis and λ is an element of the dual of ''H'' These are one-dimensional.

We can write down explicit formulas for these representations by describing the restrictions to ''N'' and ''H''.

'''Case (1)'''. The corresponding representation π is of the form: It acts on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') with respect to Lebesgue measure and 
:&lt;math&gt; (\pi [s,t] \psi)(x) = e^{i t y_0} e^{i s x} \psi (x). \quad &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\pi[w] \psi)(x) = \psi(x+w y_0).\quad &lt;/math&gt;

'''Case (2)'''. The corresponding representation is given by the 1-dimensional character

:&lt;math&gt; \pi [s,t] = e^{i s x_0}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \pi[w] = e^{i \lambda w}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

'''Tag''' is a [[List of traditional children's games|playground game]] that involves two or more players chasing other players in an attempt to "tag" or touch them, usually with their hands. There are many variations; most forms have no teams, scores, or equipment. Usually when a person is tagged, the tagger says, "Tag, you're it". 

==Basic rules==
[[File:Children playing tag.jpg|thumb|Children playing a version of tag]]
A group of players (two or more) decide who is going to be "it", often using a [[counting-out game]] such as [[eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]. The player selected to be "it" then chases the others, attempting to get close enough to "tag" one of them (touching them with a hand) while the others try to escape.&lt;ref name=games&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/349881.stm|title=The games children play|date=21 May 1999|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tag makes the tagged player "it". In some variations, the previous "it" is no longer "it" and the game can continue indefinitely, while in others, both players remain "it" and the game ends when all players have become "it".

There are many variants which modify the rules for team play, or place restrictions on tagged players' behavior. A simple variation makes tag an elimination game, so those tagged drop out of play.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wise|first=Debra |title=Great big book of children's games: over 450 indoor and outdoor games for kids|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2003|pages=320|isbn=0-07-142246-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTuZMWvmUisC&amp;pg=PA186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some variants have a rule preventing a player from tagging the person who has just tagged them (known as "no tag-backs", "no returns", or "can't tag your master").&lt;ref name=outdoor/&gt;

===Base and truce terms===
Players may be safe from being tagged under certain circumstances: if they are within a pre-determined area, off the ground, or when touching a particular structure.

Variants include gould, goul, and ghoul, and alternatives include base and home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19990217|title=gool|work=The Mavens' Word of the Day|year=1999|publisher=Random House, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the base is frequently known as "den". In much of Canada and parts of the northern United States, the state or home base of being immune from tagging is known as "times" or "T."

Players may also make themselves safe from being tagged by the use of a [[truce term]]. When playing the game tag, some may cross fingers as to let others know that  they, the player, cannot be it. Yet, this rule may only come into play if the crossing of fingers is shown, if the fingers are not shown to the person that is it, then the crossing does not count.

==Bans and restrictions==
Tag and other chasing games have been banned in some schools in the United States due to concerns about injuries, complaints from children that it can lead to harassment and bullying, and that there is an aspect to the game that possesses an unhealthily predatory element to its nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15316912/|title=Mass. grade school bans tag, other chase games|date=19 October 2006|work=Associated Press|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20535154/|title=Elementary school bans tag on its playground|date=31 August 2007|work=Associated Press|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a 10-year-old boy in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] died from brain injuries suffered from falling onto a metal pole while playing tag.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=4656718|title=Nanny State of Play? Another Tag Ban|last=Schoetz|first=David|date=16 April 2008|work=ABC News|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[lunch lady|school dinner lady]] in Dorset was left partially paralyzed after a boy playing tag ran into her in 2004; her claim for damage was rejected by three Court of Appeal judges, who ruled that the boy had not broken any school rules by playing the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7981652.stm|title=Dinner lady bid to sue boy fails|date=3 April 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A principal who banned tag in her school criticized the game for creating a "self-esteem issue" in nominating one child as a victim, and noted that the oldest and biggest children usually dominated the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91520&amp;page=1&amp;page=1|title=Is Tag Too Tough for Kids?|last=Sealey|first=Geraldine|date=24 June 2002|work=ABC News|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dislike of elimination games is another reason for banning tag.&lt;ref name=bafile&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.education-world.com/a_admin/admin/admin498.shtml|title=Is This "It" for Tag?|last=Bafile|first=Cara|date=8 October 2007|work=Education World|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some schools only supervised tag is allowed, sometimes with a type of tagging called butterfly tagging—a light tap on the shoulders, arms or upper back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=125252837589966900|title=Schools try to reduce playground conflicts|last=Anderson|first=Jennifer|date=10 September 2009|work=Portland Tribune|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education said that "Tag games are not inherently bad ... teachers must modify rules, select appropriate boundaries and equipment, and make sure pupils are safe. Teachers should emphasize tag games that develop self-improvement, participation, fair play, and cooperation."&lt;ref name=bafile/&gt;

==Variants==
&lt;!--Keep alphabetically ordered, please--&gt;
{{refimprove section |date=December 2012}}

===British bulldogs===
{{Main article|British bulldogs (game)}}
The game "British bulldogs" (sometimes also called Bullrush, Cat and Mouse, Red Rover, Cats and Mice, Sharks and Minnows, Spiders and Flies, or Octopus) is mainly played in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. It is banned from many schools. One or two players start as the "bulldogs", who stand in the middle of the play area, while the other players stand at one end of the area. The aim is to run from one end of the area to the other without being caught by the bulldogs. When a player is caught, they become a bulldog themselves. The winner is the last player "free".&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite web|last=McFarlane |first=Andy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7592648.stm |title=The return of British Bulldog |publisher=BBC News |date=2 September 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chain tag===
This is a variant of Build Ups in which each person to be caught joins hands with "it," and the chain thus formed must chase the others as a pair. As more people are caught they too join hands with the "it" players, forming a lengthening chain. This variation is also called Blob, or in some places, Gargon. Only those at the ends of the chain are able to catch someone, as they are the only ones with a free hand. A variant has chains of four splitting in two.

===Duck, duck, goose===
{{Main article|Duck, duck, goose}}
[[File:Duckduckgoose.gif|thumb|How duck, duck, goose is played]]
In this game, usually played by young children, the players sit in a circle facing inward. One player, the "picker" or "fox", walks around tapping or pointing to each player in turn, calling each of them a "duck", until finally announcing one of his choosing to be the "goose". The goose then rises and runs around the circle in the same direction as the picker, attempting to return to their seat before the "picker" can sit back down in the vacated spot. In Minnesota, this game is referred to as "Duck, duck, gray duck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lileks|first=James|title='Duck, duck' apparently has no shades of gray; 'Research' shows that Minnesota is only state that flat-out refuses to say 'goose'|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62469147.html|accessdate=4 September 2011|newspaper=StarTribune|date=19 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeze tag===
Also known as Stuck in the Mud, Scarecrow, Sticky-Glue, Zombie Tag, Ice-and-Water (in Asia) or Ice-and-Fire (in Malaysia), players who are tagged are "stuck in the mud" or "frozen" and must stand in place with their arms stretched out until they are unfrozen. An unstuck player can perform an action to unfreeze them, such as tagging them, crawling between their legs, or "flushing" them by hitting their outstretched hand. The last person standing, for most games, is usually the next person who will be it.

===Kiss chase===
{{Category see also|Kissing games}}
Kiss chase, also referred to as Catch and Kiss, is a tag variant in which tagging is performed by [[kissing]].&lt;ref name=games/&gt; All members of one gender are "it" at once and chase players of the opposite sex until everyone is caught, then the roles are reversed.&lt;ref name=dailyrecord&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2008/10/22/new-book-celebrates-games-which-were-playground-favourites-of-yesteryear-86908-20827082/|title=New book celebrates games which were playground favourites of yesteryear|last=McQueen|first=Craig|date=22 October 2008|work=Daily Record|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant is that the player chosen to be "it" will, with assistance from players of the same gender, chase all members of the opposite sex and [[kiss]] one of them, who is then "it" on behalf of the other gender.

===Last tag===
Last tag was played in the early 20th century, when it was a way to say goodbye when leaving school for home. A player tags another and makes them "it" before leaving on their way home. There is no tagging back. It was a point of honor not to be left with the last tag. If a player is unable to tag anyone by the end of the game, they became "it" the next day.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Claude H.|title=Outdoor sports and games|publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Company|location=Garden City, New York|year=1911|series=The Library of Work and Play|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16316/16316-h/16316-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Octopus tag===
[[Octopus tag]] is a mix between [[Red Rover]] and tag.&lt;ref name="famfun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyfun.go.com/games/indoor-outdoor-games/game/famfgam_octutag/|title=Disney Family - Recipes, Crafts and Activities|website=Disney Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It," or "octopus," attempts to tag the other players. The playing field is known as the ocean. The players, or "fish," line up along one side of the ocean. When the Octopus calls out, "Come fishies come!", they try to run to the other side without getting tagged. In a variation, once the fish run to the other side without getting tagged, the game pauses until the octopus starts it again. Upon getting tagged the fish become "seaweed" and must freeze or sit where they were tagged, but they can wave their arms around and assist the Octopus in tagging other fish within their reach. The last fish to be tagged becomes the next Octopus. This game can also be played in the water and then it is called Sharks and Minnows.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Team tag==

===Cops and robbers===
&lt;!--[[List of traditional children's games]] links directly here.--&gt;
Cops and robbers, sometimes called "jail", "jail tag", "team tag", "chase", "police and thief", "prisoner's base"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.databaseofgames.com/physical-games/chase-and-catch/377/prisoners-base|title=Prisoner’s base|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "jailbreak", "releaseo" or "manhunt",&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; has players split into two teams: cops and robbers.

[[A. M. Burrage]] calls this version of the game "Smee" in his 1931 ghost story of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories, OUP 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The cops, who are in pursuit of robbers (the team being chased), arrest the robbers by tagging and putting them in jail. Robbers can stage a jailbreak by tagging one of the prisoners without getting tagged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=wTuZMWvmUisC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=%22cops+and+robbers%22+childrens+game&amp;source=web&amp;ots=w_kxD5FGvk&amp;sig=CxWAXEqizRySVTFQ5S-Z7CSzR3o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result/ Great Big Book of Children's Games, by Debra Wise and Sandra Forrest. {{ISBN|0-07-142246-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-07-142246-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ends if all the robbers are in jail. In a variant, the robbers have five minutes to hide before being hunted, and only one jailbreak may be allowed per robber.

===Zombie tag===
{{Main article|Humans vs. Zombies}}
Humans vs. Zombies is a survival game of tag, where "human" players fight off increasingly large numbers of "zombies"; if a human is "turned" (i.e. tagged), then that player becomes a zombie in turn. At the game's beginning, there are only one or two zombies; the zombies multiply by tagging humans, turning them into zombies after a period of one hour. Humans can defend themselves from zombies by using socks, marshmallows, Nerf Blasters or any other toys deemed safe and appropriate; if a zombie is hit by one of these methods of defense, they are stunned (not allowed to interact with the game in any way) for 15 seconds. The goal of the zombies is to turn all the humans; the humans, meanwhile, must outlast all the zombies.

===Manhunt===
{{Main article|Manhunt (urban game)}}
&lt;!--Manhunt variants go in that article--&gt;
Manhunt is a mixture of [[hide and seek]] and tag, often played during the night. One person is "it", while the other players have to hide. Then, the person who is "it" tries to find and tag them. The game is over when all players are out. Manhunt is sometimes played in teams. In one variant there is a home base in which a player is safe. That version ends when all players who are not safe are out.

===Prisoner's Base===
In Prisoner's Base, each team starts in a chain, holding hands, with one end of the chain touching the base. The end two players on each team break from the chain and try to tag each other, taking them to their base if they do. The end pair progressively break from the chain and join the tagging. As with Cops and Robbers, prisoners can be freed by tagging them in the base. The game is thought to date back to the [[Renaissance]] period, and may be inspired by the act of [[bride kidnapping]].&lt;ref name=leibs/&gt;  A game of Prisoner's Base was played by members of Lewis &amp; Clark's [[Corps of Discovery]] against a group of Nez Perce.&lt;ref&gt;"Sunday 8th June 1806. the 2 men returnd from the villages. a number of the natives visited us and gave Frazer a fine young horse a number of the natives joined and got out our canoe which was Sank. our party exercised themselves running and playing games called base in the evening danced after the fiddle as the Indians were anxious to See them."

===What's the time, Mr Wolf?===
{{Main article|What's the time, Mr Wolf?}}
One player is chosen to be Mr Wolf and stands facing away from the other players at the opposite end of the playing field. All players except Mr Wolf chant in unison "What's the time, Mr Wolf?", and Mr Wolf will answer in one of two ways: Mr Wolf may call a time - usually an hour ending in "o'clock". The other players take that many steps towards Mr Wolf. They then ask the question again. Alternatively Mr Wolf may call "Dinner time!", and turn and chase the other players back to their starting point. If Mr Wolf tags a player, that player becomes Mr Wolf for the next round.

===Ringolevio===
{{Main article|Ringolevio}}
In Ringolevio, there are two teams. In one version, one team goes off and hides. The other team counts to a number such as 30 and then goes looking for them. In another version, each team has its own "jail", a park bench or other defendable area. The game goes on until all of one team is in jail. In many ways, Ringolevio is similar to Prisoner's Base.

==Variants requiring equipment==
[[File:Blindfold (PSF).png|thumb|right|The "Blind man's bluff" variant requires a blindfold to be played]]
Some variants of tag use equipment such as balls, paintball guns, or even flashlights to replace tagging by hand.

===Blind man's bluff===
{{Main article|Blind man's buff}}
Blind man's bluff, also known as Mr. Blind Man, is a version of tag in which one player, designated as "it", is [[blindfold]]ed and attempts to tag the other players, while the other players try to avoid them.

===Computer tag===
Research students developed a version of tag played using handheld WiFi-enabled computers with GPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/pcs-bring-a-game-of-tag-to-the-urban-playground-555212.html|title=PCs bring a game of tag to the urban playground|last=Reichardt|first=Patricia|date=3 August 2004|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 October 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cnm.open.ac.uk/projects/cititag/|title=CitiTag|work=Centre for New Media|publisher=Open University|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flashlight tag===
Flashlight tag, also called "Army tag", "Spotlight", and "German Spotlight",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameskidsplay.net/games/chasing_games/tag/tag_flashlight.htm|title=Flashlight Tag|work=Lori Donnahue|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is played at night. Rather than physically tagging, the "it" player tags by shining a [[flashlight]] beam on other players.

===Fox and geese===
A traditional type of line tag, sometimes played in snow, is Fox and geese. The fox starts at the centre of a spoked wheel, and the geese flee from the fox along the spokes and around the wheel. Geese that are tagged become foxes. The intersections of the spokes with the wheel are safe zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grover|first=Kathryn|title=Hard at play: leisure in America, 1840-1940|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=1992|pages=262|isbn=0-87023-792-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yu2oPyz_cusC&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kick the can===
{{Main article|Kick the can}}
One person is "it" and a can is placed in an open space. The other players run off and hide, then it tries to find and tag each of them. Tagged players are sent to jail. Any player who has not been caught can kick the can, setting the other players free from jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|title=The Games Children Play|last=Newcombe|first=Jack|date=6 March 1970|work=LIFE|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser tag===
{{Main article|Laser tag}}
Laser tag is similar to flashlight tag, but using special equipment to avoid the inevitable arguments that arise about whether one was actually tagged. Players carry guns that emit beams of light and wear electronic equipment that can detect the beams and register being hit. The equipment often has built-in scoring systems and various penalties for taking hits. Pay-per-game laser tag facilities are common in North America.

===Marco Polo===
{{main|Marco Polo (game)}}

An aquatic American variant of blind man's bluff, most commonly played in a [[swimming pool]], although it may also be played while swimming in shallow natural bodies of water (typically the areas near the shores of [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and [[lake]]s). The players may be [[swimming]], [[treading water]], or walking on the bottom of the pool or body of water. The person designated "it" is required to close their eyes, and shouts "Marco!" at regular intervals; the other players must shout "Polo!" in response. "It" must use [[sound localization]] to find one of the other players and tag them. The tagged player then generally becomes "it," and the process repeats. 

===Muckle===
Muckle (sometimes called "muckle the man with the ball", "kill-the-guy-with-the-ball",&lt;ref name=doll&gt;{{Cite book|last=Doll|first=Beth|author2=Katherine Brehm |title=Resilient Playgrounds|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|series=School-based Practice in Action|pages=256|isbn=0-415-96088-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LvUYjB0qLwC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; "kill the carrier", among other names) is the reverse of regular tag; all of the other players chase "it". This player is denoted by carrying a ball (usually a football). When they are caught, they are tackled, or "muckled". Whoever retrieves the ball first or whoever attacks the one who is it then becomes it. Sometimes the last player arriving to tackle the former ball carrier is the next person to be it; in other variations the player with the ball throws the ball up in the air, where it is caught by another player who becomes it.

===Paintball===
{{Main article|Paintball}}
Paintball is a sport in which players use compressed air guns (called paintball markers) to tag other players with paint-filled pellets. Games are usually played on commercial fields with a strict set of safety and gameplay rules.

===Sock tag===
A tube sock is filled with a small amount of flour in the toe of the sock; the sock is then gripped by the leg hole and wielded as a flail. Striking a player with any part of the sock counts as a tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbdDYoxZnQ0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22flour+filled%22+sock&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8h0qHIoU79&amp;sig=2vlPce4IP2ZzIBvHzrKlQigcPA0&amp;hl=en#PPA120,M1|title=The Gigantic Book of Games for Youth Ministry|first1=Michelle|last1=Anthony|first2=Group|last2=Publishing|first3=Dennis R.|last3=McLaughlin|date=24 February 1999|publisher=Group Pub.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecampresource.com/site/camp-activity/flour-sock-tag.html|title=Flour Sock Tag - Ultimate Camp Resource|website=www.ultimatecampresource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spud===
{{Main article|Spud (game)}}
Spud is a tag variant that is best played in large, open areas. Players begin each round in a central location. "it" then throws a ball high into the air. The other players run but must stop as soon as "it" catches the ball and shouts "Spud!" It may then take three large steps toward the player of his choosing before throwing the ball at that player. If the ball hits the target, that player becomes it, and the game starts over.

==Team tag sports==
{{Main article|Kabaddi|Kho Kho|Tag rugby}}
In [[South Asia]], two sports are variants of tag, played at the team level, sometimes internationally. In Kabaddi, raiders cross a dividing line to try to tag defenders, while continuously chanting "kabbadi" on one breath while over the line.&lt;ref name=leibs&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leibs|first=Andrew|title=Sports and games of the Renaissance|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|series=Sports and games through history|pages=199|isbn=0-313-32772-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LQ4-wUOrlgC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in the [[Asian Games]] and even has a world championship, being played throughout India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Iran, as well as in Indian communities in Canada, Great Britain, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. It was also demonstrated in 1936 Berlin Olympics. The other tag sport is called Kho Kho.

Tag or flag rugby is a non-contact variation in which each player wears a belt that has two velcro tags attached to it, or shorts with velcro patches. The mode of play is also similar to rugby league with attacking players attempting to dodge, evade and pass a rugby ball while defenders attempt to prevent them scoring by tagging - pulling a velcro attached tag from the ball carrier. However, the "tag" in "tag rugby" is derived from the "tags" that the players wear and the children's game of tag more closely resembles [[touch rugby]] whereby a touch replaces a tackle.

The 9th Century [[mathematician]], [[physician]], [[astronomer]] and [[translator]] [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] is credited as the first to study these numbers and their relation to [[amicable number]]s.&lt;ref name="Rashed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|title=The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra.|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, Boston, London|year=1994|volume=156|isbn=0-7923-2565-6|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
The binary representation of the Thabit number 3·2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−1 is ''n''+2 digits long, consisting of "10" followed by ''n'' 1s.

The first few Thabit numbers that are [[prime number|prime]] (also known as '''Thabit primes''' or '''321 primes'''):

{{As of|2015|10}}, there are 62 known prime Thabit numbers.  Their ''n'' values are :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mersenneforum.org/321search/How%20many%20digits%20these%20primes%20have.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=84769]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://primes.utm.edu/primes/lists/short.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 18, 34, 38, 43, 55, 64, 76, 94, 103, 143, 206, 216, 306, 324, 391, 458, 470, 827, 1274, 3276, 4204, 5134, 7559, 12676, 14898, 18123, 18819, 25690, 26459, 41628, 51387, 71783, 80330, 85687, 88171, 97063, 123630, 155930, 164987, 234760, 414840, 584995, 702038, 727699, 992700, 1201046, 1232255, 2312734, 3136255, 4235414, 6090515, 11484018, 11731850, 11895718, ... {{OEIS|id=A002235}}

The primes for ''n''≥234760 were found by the [[distributed computing]] project '''321 search'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mersenneforum.org/321search/The%20status%20of%20the%20search.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these, 3·2&lt;sup&gt;11895718&lt;/sup&gt;−1, has 3580969 digits and was found in June 2015.

In 2008, [[Primegrid]] took over the search for Thabit primes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=479]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still searching and has already found all currently known Thabit primes with n ≥ 4235414.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primes.utm.edu/primes/lists/short.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also searching for primes of the form 3·2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;+1, such primes are called '''Thabit primes of the second kind''' or '''321 primes of the second kind'''.

The first few Thabit numbers of the second kind are:

:4, 7, 13, 25, 49, 97, 193, 385, 769, 1537, 3073, 6145, 12289, 24577, 49153, 98305, 196609, 393217, 786433, 1572865, ... {{OEIS|id=A181565}}

The first few Thabit primes of the second kind are:

:7, 13, 97, 193, 769, 12289, 786433, 3221225473, 206158430209, 6597069766657, 221360928884514619393, ... {{OEIS|id=A039687}}

Their ''n'' values are:

:1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, 30, 36, 41, 66, 189, 201, 209, 276, 353, 408, 438, 534, 2208, 2816, 3168, 3189, 3912, 20909, 34350, 42294, 42665, 44685, 48150, 54792, 55182, 59973, 80190, 157169, 213321, 303093, 362765, 382449, 709968, 801978, 916773, 1832496, 2145353, 2291610, 2478785, 5082306, 7033641, 10829346, ... {{OEIS|id=A002253}}

==Connection with amicable numbers==

When both ''n'' and ''n''−1 yield Thabit primes (of the first kind), and &lt;math&gt;9 \cdot 2^{2n - 1} - 1&lt;/math&gt; is also prime, a pair of [[amicable numbers]] can be calculated as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;2^n(3 \cdot 2^{n - 1} - 1)(3 \cdot 2^n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^n(9 \cdot 2^{2n - 1} - 1).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, ''n'' = 2 gives the Thabit prime 11, and ''n''−1 = 1 gives the Thabit prime 5, and our third term is 71. Then, 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4, multiplied by 5 and 11 results in [[220 (number)|220]], whose divisors add up to [[284 (number)|284]], and 4 times 71 is 284, whose divisors add up to 220.

The only known ''n'' satisfying these conditions are 2, 4 and 7, corresponding to the Thabit primes 11, 47 and 383 given by ''n'', the Thabit primes 5, 23 and 191 given by ''n''−1, and our third terms are 71, 1151 and 73727. (The corresponding amicable pairs are (220, 284), (17296, 18416) and (9363584, 9437056))

==Generalization==

For integer ''b'' ≥ 2, a '''Thabit number base ''b''''' is a number of the form (''b''+1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 for a non-negative integer ''n''. Also, for integer ''b'' ≥ 2, a '''Thabit number of the second kind base ''b''''' is a number of the form (''b''+1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 for a non-negative integer ''n''.

The Williams numbers are also a generalization of Thabit numbers. For integer ''b'' ≥ 2, a '''Williams number base ''b''''' is a number of the form (''b''−1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 for a non-negative integer ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvey563.tripod.com/wills.txt List of Williams primes (of the first kind) base 3 to 2049 (for exponent ≥ 1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for integer ''b'' ≥ 2, a '''Williams number of the second kind base ''b''''' is a number of the form (''b''−1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 for a non-negative integer ''n''.

For integer ''b'' ≥ 2, a '''Thabit prime base ''b''''' is a '''Thabit number base ''b''''' that is also prime. Similarly, for integer ''b'' ≥ 2, a '''Williams prime base ''b''''' is a '''Williams number base ''b''''' that is also prime.

Every prime ''p'' is a Thabit prime of the first kind base ''p'', a Williams prime of the first kind base ''p''+2, and a Williams prime of the second kind base ''p''; if ''p'' ≥ 5, then ''p'' is also a Thabit prime of the second kind base ''p''−2.

It is a conjecture that for every integer ''b'' ≥ 2, there are infinitely many Thabit primes of the first kind base ''b'', infinitely many Williams primes of the first kind base ''b'', and infinitely many Williams primes of the second kind base ''b''; also, for every integer ''b'' ≥ 2 that is not [[congruence relation|congruent]] to 1 modulo 3, there are infinitely many Thabit primes of the second kind base ''b''. (If the base ''b'' is congruent to 1 modulo 3, then all Thabit numbers of the second kind base ''b'' are divisible by 3 (and greater than 3, since ''b'' ≥ 2), so there are no Thabit primes of the second kind base ''b''.)

The exponent of Thabit primes of the second kind cannot congruent to 1 mod 3 (except 1 itself), the exponent of Williams primes of the first kind cannot congruent to 4 mod 6, and the exponent of Williams primes of the second kind cannot congruent to 1 mod 6 (except 1 itself), since the corresponding polynomial to ''b'' is a [[reducible polynomial]]. (If ''n'' ≡ 1 mod 3, then (''b''+1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is divisible by ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b'' + 1; if ''n'' ≡ 4 mod 6, then (''b''−1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 is divisible by ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b'' + 1; and if ''n'' ≡ 1 mod 6, then (''b''−1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is divisible by ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b'' + 1) Otherwise, the corresponding polynomial to ''b'' is an [[irreducible polynomial]], so if [[Bunyakovsky conjecture]] is true, then there are infinitely many bases ''b'' such that the corresponding number (for fixed exponent ''n'' satisfying the condition) is prime. ((''b''+1)·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 is irreducible for all nonnegative integer ''n'', so if Bunyakovsky conjecture is true, then there are infinitely many bases ''b'' such that the corresponding number (for fixed exponent ''n'') is prime)

In [[quantum field theory]], and in the significant subfields of [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], the '''two-body Dirac equations (TBDE)''' of constraint dynamics provide a three-dimensional yet [[manifestly covariant]] reformulation of the [[Bethe–Salpeter equation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bethe|first=Hans A.|title=Quantum mechanics of one- and two-electron atoms|year=2008|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=978-0486466675|edition=Dover |author2=Edwin E. Salpeter }}&lt;/ref&gt; for two [[spin-1/2]] particles. Such a reformulation is necessary since without it, as shown by Nakanishi,&lt;ref&gt;N. Nakanishi, Supplement to Progress in Theoretical Physics 43 1, (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the Bethe–Salpeter equation possesses negative-norm solutions arising from the presence of an essentially relativistic degree of freedom, the relative time. These "ghost" states have spoiled the naive interpretation of the Bethe–Salpeter equation as a quantum mechanical wave equation. The two-body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics rectify this flaw. The forms of these equations can not only be derived from quantum field theory &lt;ref&gt;H. Sazdjian Physics Letters 156B, 381 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Jallouli and H. Sazdjian, Annals of Physics, 253 , 376 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; they can also be derived purely in the context of Dirac's constraint dynamics &lt;ref&gt;P.A.M. Dirac, Can. J.

A single two-body Dirac equation similar to the [[Breit equation]] can be derived from the TBDE.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Van Alstine and Horace W.

Crater, Chun Wa Wong, and Cheuk-Yin Wong, International Journal of Modern Physics E Vol. 5 , 589 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In applications of the TBDE to QED, the two particles interact by way of four-vector potentials derived from the field theoretic [[electromagnetic interaction]]s between the two particles. In applications to QCD, the two particles interact by way of four-vector potentials and Lorentz invariant scalar interactions, derived in part from the field theoretic chromomagnetic interactions between the quarks and in part by phenomenological considerations. As with the Breit equation a sixteen-component [[spinor]] Ψ is used.

==Equations==

For QED, each equation has the same structure as the ordinary one-body [[Dirac equation]] in the presence of an external [[electromagnetic field]], given by the [[4-potential]] &lt;math&gt;A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;. For QCD, each equation has the same structure as the ordinary one-body [[Dirac equation]] in the presence of an external field similar to the electromagnetic field and an additional external field given by in terms of a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] scalar &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In [[natural units]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9912386.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; those two-body equations have the form.

:&lt;math&gt;[(\gamma_1)_\mu (p_1-\tilde{A}_1)^\mu+m_1 + \tilde{S}_1]\Psi=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[(\gamma_2)_\mu (p_2-\tilde{A}_2)^\mu+m_2 + \tilde{S}_2]\Psi=0.&lt;/math&gt;

where, in coordinate space, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[4-momentum]], related to the [[4-gradient]] by (the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] used here is &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu}=(-1,1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = -i{\partial\over\partial x_\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

and γ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[gamma matrices]]. The two-body Dirac equations (TBDE) have the property that if
one of the masses becomes very large, say &lt;math&gt;m_{2}\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; then the 16-component Dirac equation reduces to the 4-component one-body [[Dirac equation]] for particle one in an external potential.

In [[SI units]]:

:&lt;math&gt;[(\gamma_1)_\mu (p_1-\tilde{A}_1)^\mu+m_1c + \tilde{S}_1]\Psi=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[(\gamma_2)_\mu (p_2-\tilde{A}_2)^\mu+m_2c + \tilde{S}_2]\Psi=0.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = -i\hbar{\partial\over\partial x_\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

Natural units will be used below. A tilde symbol is used over the two sets of potentials to indicate that they may have additional gamma matrix dependencies not present in the one-body Dirac equation.  Any coupling constants such as the [[Elementary charge|electron charge]] are embodied in the vector potentials.

==Constraint dynamics and the TBDE==

Constraint dynamics applied to the TBDE requires a particular form of mathematical consistency: the two Dirac operators must [[commutator|commute]] with each other. This is plausible if one views the two equations as two compatible constraints on the wave function. (See the discussion below on constraint dynamics.) If the two operators did not commute, (as, e.g., with the coordinate and momentum operators &lt;math&gt; x,p &lt;/math&gt;) then the constraints would not be compatible (one could not e.g., have a wave function that satisfied both &lt;math&gt; x\Psi=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\Psi=0&lt;/math&gt;).  This mathematical consistency or compatibility leads to three important properties of the TBDE. The first is a condition that eliminates the dependence on the relative time in the center of momentum (c.m.) frame defined by &lt;math&gt;P=p_1+p_2=(w,\vec 0)&lt;/math&gt;. (The variable &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy in the c.m. frame.) Stated another way, the relative time is eliminated in a covariant way. In particular, for the two operators to commute, the scalar and four-vector potentials can depend on the relative coordinate &lt;math&gt;x=x_1 - x_2&lt;/math&gt; only through its component &lt;math&gt; x_{\perp }&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in which

:&lt;math&gt; x_\perp^\mu =(\eta^{\mu \nu }-P^\mu P^\nu /P^2)x_\nu, \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_\mu x_\perp^\mu =0. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that in the c.m. frame &lt;math&gt;x_\perp =(0,\vec{x}=\vec{x}_1 -\vec{x}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, which has zero time component.

Secondly, the mathematical consistency condition also eliminates the relative energy in the [[Center-of-momentum frame|c.m. frame]]. It does this by imposing on each Dirac operator a structure such that in a particular combination they lead to this interaction independent form, eliminating in a covariant way the relative energy.

:&lt;math&gt;P\cdot p\Psi =(-P^0p^0+\vec P\cdot p)\Psi=0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In this expression &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the relative momentum having the form &lt;math&gt;(p_1 - p_2)/2&lt;/math&gt; for equal masses. In the c.m. frame (&lt;math&gt; P^0=w,\vec P=\vec 0&lt;/math&gt;), the time component &lt;math&gt;p^0&lt;/math&gt; of the relative momentum, that is the relative energy, is thus eliminated. in the sense that &lt;math&gt;p^0\Psi=0&lt;/math&gt;.

A third consequence of the mathematical consistency is that each of the world scalar &lt;math&gt;\tilde{S}_i&lt;/math&gt; and four vector &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}_{i}^{\mu }&lt;/math&gt; potentials has a term with a fixed dependence on &lt;math&gt;\gamma _{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma _{2}&lt;/math&gt; in addition to the gamma matrix independent forms of &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_i^\mu&lt;/math&gt; which appear in the ordinary one-body Dirac equation for scalar and vector potentials.
These extra terms correspond to additional recoil spin-dependence not present in the one-body Dirac equation and vanish when one of the particles becomes very heavy (the so-called static limit).

== More on constraint dynamics: generalized mass shell constraints ==

Constraint dynamics arose from the work of Dirac &lt;ref name="Dirac"/&gt;  and Bergmann.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Bergmann " Non-linear field theories"  Physical Review 75, 680–85  (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; This section
shows how the elimination of relative time and energy takes place in the
c.m. system for the simple system of two relativistic spinless particles.
Constraint dynamics was first applied to the classical relativistic two particle system by Todorov,&lt;ref&gt;I. T. Todorov, " Dynamics
of Relativistic Point Particles as a Problem with
Constraints", Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research
No. E2-10175, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todorov"&gt;I. T. Todorov, Annals of the Institute of H. Poincaré' {A28},207 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Kalb
and Van Alstine,&lt;ref&gt;M. Kalb and P. Van Alstine, Yale Reports, C00-3075-146
(1976),C00-3075-156 (1976),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Van Alstine, Ph.D. Dissertation Yale
University, (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Komar,&lt;ref&gt;A. Komar, Physical Review {D18}, 1881,1887
(1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and Droz-Vincent.&lt;ref&gt;P. Droz-Vincent Reports of Mathematical Physics,{8},79
(1975)&lt;/ref&gt; With constraint dynamics, these authors found a consistent and covariant approach to relativistic canonical Hamiltonian mechanics that also evades the Currie-Jordan-Sudarshan "No Interaction" theorem.&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Currie, T. F. Jordan and E. C. G. Sudarshan, Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol 35 350,1032 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;  That theorem states that without fields, one cannot have a relativistic [[Hamiltonian dynamics]]. Thus, the same covariant three-dimensional approach which allows the quantized version of constraint dynamics to remove [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|quantum ghosts]] simultaneously circumvents at the classical level the C.J.S. theorem. Consider a constraint on the otherwise independent coordinate and momentum four vectors, written in the form &lt;math&gt;\phi _{i}(p,x)\approx 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The symbol&lt;math&gt;\approx 0&lt;/math&gt; is called a weak equality and implies that the constraint is to be imposed only after any needed [[Poisson brackets]] are performed. In the presence of such constraints, the total
[[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; by adding to the [[Legendre Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;(p\dot{x}-\mathcal{L})&lt;/math&gt; the sum of the constraints times an appropriate set of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s &lt;math&gt;(\lambda _{i})&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}=p\dot{x}-\mathcal{L}+\lambda _{i}\phi _{i}&lt;/math&gt;,

This total Hamiltonian is traditionally called the Dirac Hamiltonian.
Constraints arise naturally from parameter invariant actions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;I=\int d\tau \mathcal{L(\tau )=}\int d\tau ^{\prime }\frac{d\tau }{d\tau
^{\prime }}\mathcal{L(\tau )=}\int d\tau ^{\prime }\mathcal{L(\tau }^{\prime
}\mathcal{)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of four vector and Lorentz scalar interactions for a single
particle the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L(\tau)}=-(m+S(x))\sqrt{-\dot{x}^{2}}+\dot{x}\cdot A(x) \, &lt;/math&gt;

The [[Canonical coordinates|canonical momentum]] is

:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}}=\frac{\mathcal{(}m+S(x))\dot{x}}{\sqrt{-\dot{x}^{2}}}+A(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and by squaring leads to the generalized mass shell condition or generalized
mass shell constraint

:&lt;math&gt; ( p-A)^2 + (m+S)^2 =0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since, in this case, the Legendre Hamiltonian vanishes

:&lt;math&gt;p\cdot \dot{x}-\mathcal{L}=0, \, &lt;/math&gt;

the Dirac Hamiltonian is simply the generalized mass constraint (with no
interactions it would simply be the ordinary mass shell constraint)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H=\lambda }\left[ \left( p-A\right)^2 + (m+S)^2 \right] \equiv \lambda
(p^{2}+m^{2}+\Phi (x,p)). &lt;/math&gt;

One then postulates that for two bodies the Dirac Hamiltonian is the sum of
two such mass shell constraints,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_i=p_i^2+m_i^2+\Phi_i (x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)\approx 0, \, &lt;/math&gt;

that is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} =\lambda_1[p_1^2+m_1^2+\Phi_1(x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)] + \lambda_2[p_2^2 + m_2^2+\Phi_2(x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  =\lambda_1 \mathcal{H}_1 + \lambda_2 \mathcal{H}_2, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and that each constraint &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_i&lt;/math&gt; be constant in the proper time associated with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{H}}_i=\{\mathcal{H}_i,\mathcal{H\}\approx }0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

Here the weak equality means that the [[Poisson bracket]] could result in terms proportional one of the constraints, the classical Poisson brackets for the relativistic two-body system being defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \{O_1,O_2\}=\frac{\partial O_1}{\partial x_1^\mu}
\frac{\partial O_2}{\partial p_{1\mu}}
-\frac{\partial O_1}{\partial p_1^\mu}
 \frac{\partial O_2}{\partial x_{1\mu}}
+\frac{\partial O_1}{\partial x_2^\mu}
 \frac{\partial O_2}{\partial p_{2\mu}}
-\frac{\partial O_1}{\partial p_2^\mu}
\frac{\partial O_2}{\partial x_{2\mu}}.&lt;/math&gt;

To see the consequences of having each constraint be a constant of the
motion, take, for example

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{\dot{H}}_1 = \{\mathcal{H}_1,\mathcal{H\}=}\lambda _1 \{\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_1\mathcal{\}+}\{\mathcal{H}_1,\lambda_1\mathcal{\}
\mathcal{H}}_2\mathcal{+\lambda}_2\{\mathcal{H}_2,\mathcal{H}_1
\mathcal{\}+}\{\mathcal{\lambda }_2,\mathcal{H}_1\mathcal{\}H}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{H}_1,\mathcal{H}_1\}=0&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{1}\approx 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2 \approx 0&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{H}}_{1}\approx \mathcal{\lambda }_{2}\{\mathcal{H}_{2}, \mathcal{H}_{1}\}\approx 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The simplest solution to this is

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _1 =\Phi _2 \equiv \Phi (x_\perp )&lt;/math&gt;

which leads to (note the equality in this case is not a weak one in that no constraint need be imposed after the Poisson bracket is worked out)

:&lt;math&gt; \{\mathcal{H}_2,\mathcal{H}_1\}=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

(see Todorov,&lt;ref name="Todorov"/&gt; and Wong and Crater &lt;ref&gt;Cheuk-Yin Wong and Horace W. Crater "The Relativistic N-body Problem in a Separable Two-Body Basis", Physical Review C63 (2001) 044907&lt;/ref&gt; ) with the same &lt;math&gt;x_\perp &lt;/math&gt; defined
above.

== Quantization ==

In addition to replacing classical dynamical variables by their quantum counterparts, quantization of the constraint mechanics takes place by replacing the constraint on the dynamical variables with a restriction on the wave function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{i}\approx 0\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{i}\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} \approx 0\rightarrow \mathcal{H}\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt;.

The first set of equations for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2 play the role for spinless particles that the two Dirac equations play for spin-one-half particles. The classical Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators

:&lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2\}\rightarrow \frac{1}{i}[O_1,O_2]. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt; [\mathcal{H}_2,\mathcal{H}_{1}]=0, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and we see in this case that the constraint formalism leads to the vanishing commutator of the wave operators for the two particlein.  This is the analogue of the claim stated earlier that the two Dirac operators commute with one another.

==  Covariant elimination of the relative energy ==

The vanishing of the above commutator ensures that the dynamics is
independent of the relative time in the c.m. frame.  In order to
covariantly eliminate the relative energy, introduce the relative momentum &lt;math&gt;p
&lt;/math&gt; defined by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p_{1} =\frac{p_{1}\cdot P}{P^{2}}P+p\,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}} 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p_{2} =\frac{p_{2}\cdot P}{P^{2}}P-p\,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
 
The above definition of the relative momentum forces the orthogonality of the total
momentum and the relative momentum,

:&lt;math&gt;P\cdot p=0&lt;/math&gt;,

which follows from taking the scalar product of either equation with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
From Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}), this relative momentum can be written in terms of 
&lt;math&gt;p_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{2}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{\varepsilon _{2}}{\sqrt{-P^{2}}}p_{1}-\frac{\varepsilon _{1}}{\sqrt{
-P^{2}}}p_{2} &lt;/math&gt;

where 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{1} =-\frac{p_{1}\cdot P}{\sqrt{-P^{2}}}=-\frac{
P^{2}+p_{1}^{2}-p_{2}^{2}}{2\sqrt{-P^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{2} =-\frac{p_{2}\cdot P}{\sqrt{-P^{2}}}=-\frac{
P^{2}+p_{2}^{2}-p_{1}^{2}}{2\sqrt{-P^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;
 
are the projections of the momenta &lt;math&gt;p_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{2}&lt;/math&gt; along the direction
of the total momentum &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Subtracting the two constraints &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}
_{1}\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{2}\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt;, gives

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(p_{1}^{2}-p_{2}^{2})\Psi =-(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})\Psi&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Thus on these states &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{1}\Psi  =\frac{-P^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2\sqrt{-P^{2}}}
\Psi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{2}\Psi  =\frac{-P^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2\sqrt{-P^{2}}}
\Psi&lt;/math&gt; .

The equation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt; describes both the c.m. motion and the
internal relative motion. To characterize the former motion, observe that
since the potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi &lt;/math&gt; depends only on the difference of the two
coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;[P,\mathcal{H}]\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt;.

(This does not require that &lt;math&gt;[P,\lambda _{i}]=0&lt;/math&gt; since the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}
_{i}\Psi =0&lt;/math&gt;.) Thus, the total momentum &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of motion and 
&lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate state characterized by a total momentum 
&lt;math&gt;P^{\prime }&lt;/math&gt;. In the c.m. system &lt;math&gt;P^{\prime }=(w,\vec{0}),&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; the
invariant center of momentum (c.m.) energy. Thus

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(P^{2}+w^{2})\Psi =0\,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

and so &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; is also an eigenstate of  c.m. energy operators for each of
the two particles, 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{1}\Psi  =\frac{w^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2w}\Psi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{2}\Psi  =\frac{w^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2w}\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.
 
The relative momentum then satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;p\Psi =\frac{\varepsilon _{2}p_{1}-\varepsilon _{1}p_{2}}{w}\Psi&lt;/math&gt;,

so that

:&lt;math&gt;p_{1}\Psi  =\left( \frac{\varepsilon _{1}}{w}P+p\right) \Psi &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{2}\Psi  =\left( \frac{\varepsilon _{2}}{w}P-p\right) \Psi &lt;/math&gt; ,

The above set of equations follow from the constraints &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{i}\Psi
=0&lt;/math&gt; and the definition of the relative momenta given in Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}).
If instead one chooses to define (for a more general choice see Horwitz),
&lt;ref&gt;L. Horwitz and F. Rohrlich, Physical Review
D, Vol 31, 932 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{1} =\frac{w^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2w},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{2} =\frac{w^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2w},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p =\frac{\varepsilon _{2}p_{1}-\varepsilon _{1}p_{2}}{w},&lt;/math&gt;
 
independent of the wave function, then
 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p_{1} =\left( \frac{\varepsilon _{1}}{w}P+p\right), &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p_{2} =\left( \frac{\varepsilon _{2}}{w}P-p\right), &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}} 
 
and it is straight forward to show that the constraint Eq.({{EquationNote|3}}) leads
directly to

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P\cdot p\Psi =0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

in place of &lt;math&gt;P\cdot p=0&lt;/math&gt;. This conforms with the earlier claim on the
vanishing of the relative energy in the c.m. frame made in conjunction with
the TBDE.\ In the second choice the c.m. value of the relative energy is
not defined as zero but comes from the original generalized mass shell
constraints.  The above equations for the relative and constituent
four-momentum are the relativistic analogues of the nonrelativistic equations

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} =\frac{m_{2}\vec{p}_{1}-m_{1}\vec{p}_{2}}{M}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p}_{1} =\frac{m_{1}}{M}\vec{P}+\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p}_{2} =\frac{m_{2}}{M}\vec{P}+\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Covariant eigenvalue equation for internal motion ==

Using Eqs.({{EquationNote|5}}),({{EquationNote|6}}),({{EquationNote|7}}), one can write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}\Psi  =\{\lambda _{1}[-\varepsilon
_{1}^{2}+m_{1}^{2}+p^{2}+\Phi (x_{\perp })]+\lambda _{2}[-\varepsilon
_{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+p^{2}+\Phi (x_{\perp })]\}\Psi &lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;=(\lambda _{1}+\lambda _{2})[-b^{2}(-P^{2};m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})+p^{2}+\Phi
(x_{\perp })]\Psi =0\,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

where

:&lt;math&gt;b^{2}(-P^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})=\varepsilon _{1}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}=\varepsilon
_{2}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}\ =-\frac{1}{4P^{2}}
(P^{4}+2P^{2}(m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2})+(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})^{2})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Eq.({{EquationNote|8}}) contains both the total momentum &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; [through the &lt;math&gt;
b^{2}(-P^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})&lt;/math&gt;] and the relative momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Using Eq. ({{EquationNote|4}}), one obtains the eigenvalue equation

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(\lambda _{1}+\lambda _{2})\left\{ p^{2}+\Phi (x_{\perp
})-b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})\right\} \Psi =0\,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

so that &lt;math&gt;b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})&lt;/math&gt; becomes the standard triangle
function displaying exact relativistic two-body kinematics:

:&lt;math&gt;b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})=\frac{1}{4w^{2}}\left\{
w^{4}-2w^{2}(m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2})+(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})^{2}\right\}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

With the above constraint Eqs.({{EquationNote|7}}) on &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p^{2}\Psi
=p_{\perp }^{2}\Psi &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_{\perp }=p-p\cdot PP/P^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This allows 
writing Eq. ({{EquationNote|9}}) in the form of an eigenvalue equation

:&lt;math&gt;\{p_{\perp }^{2}+\Phi (x_{\perp })\}\Psi
=b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})\Psi \,,&lt;/math&gt;

having a structure very similar to that of the ordinary three-dimensional
nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation. It is a manifestly covariant
equation, but at the same time its three-dimensional structure is evident.
The four-vectors &lt;math&gt;p_{\perp }^{\mu }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{\perp }^{\mu }&lt;/math&gt; have only
three independent components since

:&lt;math&gt;P\cdot p_{\perp }=P\cdot x_{\perp }=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The similarity to the three-dimensional structure of the nonrelativistic
Schrödinger equation can be made more explicit by writing the equation in
the c.m. frame in which

:&lt;math&gt;P =(w,\vec{0})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\perp } =(0,\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;x_{\perp } =(0,\vec{x})&lt;/math&gt;.

Comparison of the resultant form 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\{\vec{p}^{2}+\Phi (\vec{x})\}\Psi =b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})\Psi \,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

with the time independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left( \vec{p}^{2}+2\mu V(\vec{x})\right) \Psi =2\mu E\Psi \,,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

makes this similarity explicit.

== The two-body relativistic Klein–Gordon equations ==

A plausible structure for the quasipotential &lt;math&gt;\Phi &lt;/math&gt; can be found by
observing that the one-body Klein-Gordon equation  &lt;math&gt;(p^{2}+m^{2})\psi =(\vec{p
}^ {2}-\varepsilon ^{2}+m^{2})\psi =0&lt;/math&gt;  takes the form &lt;math&gt;(\vec{p}
^ {2}-\varepsilon ^{2}+m^{2}+2mS+S^{2}+2\varepsilon A-A^{2})\psi =0~&lt;/math&gt; when one
introduces a scalar interaction and timelike vector interaction via &lt;math&gt;
m\rightarrow m+S~&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \rightarrow \varepsilon -A&lt;/math&gt;. In the
two-body case, separate classical &lt;ref&gt;H. W. Crater and P. Van Alstine, Phys. Rev.  Vol. {D46} 766, (1992), H.W. Crater and D. Yang, J. Math. Phys. Vol. {32} 2374, (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and quantum field theory &lt;ref&gt;H.
Jallouli and H. Sazdjian, Annals of Physics, Vol 253 , 376 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
arguments show that when one includes world scalar and
vector interactions then &lt;math&gt;\Phi &lt;/math&gt; depends on two underlying invariant
functions &lt;math&gt;S(r)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A(r)&lt;/math&gt; through the two-body Klein-Gordon-like potential
form with the same general structure, that is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi =2m_{w}S+S^{2}+2\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}.  &lt;/math&gt;
Those field theories further yield the c.m. energy dependent forms 
:&lt;math&gt;
m_{w}=m_{1}m_{2}/w,  &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon _{w}=(w^{2}-m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})/2w,  &lt;/math&gt;
ones that Tododov introduced as the relativistic reduced mass
and effective particle energy for a two-body system. Similar to what
happens in the nonrelativistic two-body problem, in the relativistic case
we have the motion of this effective particle taking place as if it were in
an external field (here generated by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;).  The two kinematical
variables &lt;math&gt;m_{w}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{w}&lt;/math&gt; are related to one another by the
Einstein condition 
:&lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon _{w}^{2}-m_{w}^{2}=b^{2}(w),
&lt;/math&gt;
If one introduces the four-vectors, including a vector interaction &lt;math&gt;A^{\mu }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} =\varepsilon _{w}\hat{P}+p,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\mu } =\hat{P}^{\mu }A(r) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r =\sqrt{x_{\perp }^{2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and scalar interaction &lt;math&gt;S(r)&lt;/math&gt;, then the following classical minimal
constraint form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H=}\left( \mathfrak{p-}A\right) ^{2}+(m_{w}+S)^{2}\approx 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;
reproduces
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H=}p_{\perp }^{2}+\Phi -b^{2}\approx 0\,. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}
Notice, that the interaction in this "reduced particle" constraint depends
on two invariant scalars, &lt;math&gt;A(r)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(r)&lt;/math&gt;, one guiding the time-like
vector interaction and one the scalar interaction.

Is there a set of two-body Klein-Gordon equations analogous to the two-body Dirac
equations? The classical relativistic constraints analogous to the quantum
two-body Dirac equations (discussed in the introduction) and that have the same structure as the above
Klein-Gordon one-body form are
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{1}=(p_{1}-A_{1})^{2}+(m_{1}+S_{1})^{2}=p_{1}^{2}+m_{1}^{2}+\Phi _{1}\approx 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{2}=(p_{1}-A_{2})^{2}+(m_{2}+S_{2})^{2}=p_{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+\Phi _{2}\approx 0, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_{1} =\varepsilon _{1}\hat{P}+p;~~p_{2}=\varepsilon _{2}\hat{P}-p~.&lt;/math&gt;
Defining structures that display time-like vector and scalar interactions
:&lt;math&gt;\pi _{1} =p_{1}-A_{1}=[\hat{P}(\varepsilon _{1}-\mathcal{A}_{1})+p],&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi _{2} =p_{2}-A_{2}=[\hat{P}(\varepsilon _{2}-\mathcal{A}_{1})-p],&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{1} =m_{1}+S_{1},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2} =m_{2}+S_{2},&lt;/math&gt;
gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{1} =\pi _{1}^{2}+M_{1}^{2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{2} =\pi _{2}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Imposing
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Phi _{1} &amp; =\Phi _{2}\equiv \Phi (x_{\perp }) \\
&amp; =-2p_{1}\cdot A_{1}+A_{1}^{2}+2m_{1}S_{1}+S_{1}^{2} \\
&amp; =-2p_{2}\cdot A_{2}+A_{2}^{2}+2m_{2}S_{2}+S_{2}^{2} \\
&amp; =2\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}+2m_{w}S+S^{2}, 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and using the constraint &lt;math&gt;P\cdot p\approx 0&lt;/math&gt;, reproduces Eqs.({{EquationNote|12}}) provided

:&lt;math&gt;\pi _{1}^{2}-p^{2} =-\left( \varepsilon _{1}-\mathcal{A}_{1}\right)^{2}=-\varepsilon _{1}^{2}+2\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\pi _{2}^{2}-p^{2} =-\left( \varepsilon _{2}-\mathcal{A}_{2}\right)^{2}=-\varepsilon _{2}^{2}+2\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{1}{}^{2} =m_{1}^{2}+2m_{w}S+S^{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2}^{2} =m_{2}^{2}+2m_{w}S+S^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding Klein-Gordon equations are
:&lt;math&gt;\left( \pi _{1}^{2}+M_{1}^{2}\right) \psi  =0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left( \pi _{2}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}\right) \psi  =0,&lt;/math&gt;
and each, due to the constraint &lt;math&gt;P\cdot p\approx 0,&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H\psi =}\left( p_{\perp }^{2}+\Phi -b^{2}\right) \mathcal{\psi }=0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Hyperbolic versus external field form of the two-body Dirac equations ==

For the two body system there are numerous covariant forms of interaction. 
The simplest way of looking at these is from the point of view of the gamma
matrix structures of the corresponding interaction vertices of the single
paraticle exchange diagrams.  For scalar, pseudoscalar, vector,
pseudovector, and tensor exchanges those matrix structures are respectively 
:&lt;math&gt;
1_{1}1_{2}; \gamma _{51}\gamma _{52};  \gamma _{1}^{\mu }\gamma _{2\mu
};  \gamma _{51}\gamma _{1}^{\mu }\gamma _{52}\gamma _{2\mu };  \sigma _{1\mu
\nu }\sigma _{2}^{\mu \nu },
&lt;/math&gt;
in which
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma _{i\mu \nu }=\frac{1}{2i}[\gamma _{i\mu },\gamma _{i\nu }]; i=1,2.
&lt;/math&gt;
The form of the Two-Body Dirac equations which most readily incorporates
each or any number of these intereractions in concert is the so-called hyperbolic form of the TBDE
.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Crater, and P. Van Alstine, 
J. Math. Phys.31, 1998 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  For combined scalar and vector
interactions those forms ultimately reduce to the ones given in the first
set of equations of this article.  Those equations are called the external
field-like forms because their appearances are individually the same as
those for the usual one-body  Dirac equation in the presence of external
vector and scalar fields.

The most general hyperbolic form for compatible TBDE is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{1}\psi  =(\cosh (\Delta )\mathbf{S}_{1}+\sinh (\Delta )
\mathbf{S}_{2})\psi =0\mathrm{,} &lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{2}\psi  =(\cosh (\Delta )\mathbf{S}_{2}+\sinh (\Delta )
\mathbf{S}_{1})\psi =0,  
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt; represents any invariant interaction singly or in
combination.  It has a matrix structure in addition to coordinate
dependence. Depending on what that matrix structure is one has either
scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, pseudovector, or  tensor interactions.  The
operators &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are auxiliary constraints
satisfying 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_{1}\psi  \equiv (\mathcal{S}_{10}\cosh (\Delta )+\mathcal{S}
_{20}\sinh (\Delta )~)\psi =0,&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}_{2}\psi  \equiv (\mathcal{S}_{20}\cosh (\Delta )+\mathcal{S}
_{10}\sinh (\Delta )~)\psi =0, 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}
in which the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{i0}&lt;/math&gt; are the free Dirac operators 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_{i0}=\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\gamma _{5i}(\gamma _{i}\cdot
p_{i}+m_{i})=0, 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}
This, in turn leads to the two compatibility conditions 
:&lt;math&gt;
\lbrack \mathcal{S}_{1},\mathcal{S}_{2}]\psi =0,
&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;
\lbrack \mathbf{S}_{1},\mathbf{S}_{2}]\psi =0,
&lt;/math&gt;
provided that &lt;math&gt; \Delta =\Delta (x_{\perp }).&lt;/math&gt; These compatibility
conditions do not restrict the gamma matrix structure of &lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt;.  That
matrix structure is determined by the type of vertex-vertex structure 
incorporated in the interaction.   For the two types of invariant
interactions &lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt; emphasized in this article  they are
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta _{\mathcal{L}}(x_{\perp }) =-1_{1}1_{2}\frac{\mathcal{L}(x_{\perp })
}{2}\mathcal{O}_{1},\text{scalar}\mathrm{,} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta _{\mathcal{G}}(x_{\perp }) =\gamma_{1}\cdot \gamma_{2}\frac{\mathcal{G}(x_{\perp })
}{2}\mathcal{O}_{1},\text{vector}\mathrm{,} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{1}=-\gamma _{51}\gamma _{52}.&lt;/math&gt;

For general independent scalar and vector interactions
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta (x_{\perp })=\Delta _{\mathcal{L}}+\Delta _{\mathcal{G}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The vector interaction specified by the above matrix structure for an electromagnetic-like interaction would correspond to the Feynman gauge.

If  one inserts Eq.({{EquationNote|14}})  into ({{EquationNote|13}})  and brings the free
Dirac operator ({{EquationNote|15}})  to the right of the matrix hyperbolic functions
and uses standard gamma matrix commutators and anticommutators and &lt;math&gt;\cosh
^{2}\Delta -\sinh ^{2}\Delta =1&lt;/math&gt; one arrives at &lt;math&gt;\left(
\partial _{\mu }=\partial /\partial x^{\mu }\right) ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\big(G\gamma _{1}\cdot \mathcal{P}_{2}-E_{1}\beta _{1}+M_{1}-G\frac{i}{2}
\Sigma _{2}\cdot \partial (\mathcal{L}\beta _{2}\mathcal{-G}\beta
_{1})\gamma _{52}\big)\psi =0, &lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\big(-G\gamma _{2}\cdot \mathcal{P}_{1}-E_{2}\beta _{2}+M_{2}+G\frac{i}{2}
\Sigma _{1}\cdot \partial (\mathcal{L}\beta _{1}\mathcal{-G}\beta
_{2})\gamma _{51}\big)\psi =0,  
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}
in which 
:&lt;math&gt;
G =\exp \mathcal{G}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta _{i} =-\gamma _{i}\cdot \hat{P}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma _{i\perp }^{\mu } =(\eta ^{\mu \nu }+\hat{P}^{\mu }\hat{P}^{\nu
})\gamma _{\nu i}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma _{i} =\gamma _{5i}\beta _{i}\gamma _{\perp i}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_{i} \equiv p_{\perp }-\frac{i}{2}\Sigma _{i}\cdot \partial 
\mathcal{G}\Sigma _{i}, i=1,2.
&lt;/math&gt;
The (covariant) structure of these equations are analogous to those of a Dirac equation for each of the two particles, with &lt;math&gt;M_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
playing the roles that &lt;math&gt;m+S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon -A&lt;/math&gt; do in the single particle
Dirac equation  
:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{\gamma }\cdot \mathbf{p-}\beta (\varepsilon -A)+m+S)\psi =0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Over and above the usual kinetic part &lt;math&gt;\gamma _{1}\cdot p_{\perp }&lt;/math&gt; and 
time-like vector and scalar potential portions, the spin-dependent
modifications involving &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _{i}\cdot \partial \mathcal{G}\Sigma _{i}&lt;/math&gt;
and the last set of derivative terms are two-body recoil effects absent for
the one-body Dirac equation but essential for the compatibility
(consistency) of the two-body  equations.  The connections between what
are designated as the vertex invariants &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L},\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; and the
mass and energy potentials &lt;math&gt;M_{i},E_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are  
:&lt;math&gt;
M_{1} =m_{1} \cosh \mathcal{L} +m_{2}\sinh \mathcal{L}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2} =m_{2} \cosh \mathcal{L} +m_{1} \sinh \mathcal{L}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{1} =\varepsilon _{1} \cosh \mathcal{G} -\varepsilon _{2}\sinh 
\mathcal{G}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E_{2} =\varepsilon _{2} \cosh \mathcal{G}-\varepsilon _{1}\sinh \mathcal{G
}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Comparing Eq.({{EquationNote|16}}) with the first equation of this article one finds
that the spin-dependent vector interactions are 
:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{A}_{1}^{\mu } =\big((\varepsilon _{1}-E_{1})\big )\hat{P}^{\mu
}+(1-G)p_{\perp }^{\mu }-\frac{i}{2}\partial G\cdot \gamma _{2}\gamma
_{2}^{\mu },&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_{2}^{\mu } =\big((\varepsilon _{2}-E_{2})\big )\hat{P}^{\mu
}-(1-G)p_{\perp }^{\mu }+\frac{i}{2}\partial G\cdot \gamma _{1}\gamma
_{1}^{\mu },
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the first portion of the vector potentials is timelike (parallel
to &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}^{\mu })&lt;/math&gt; while the next portion is spacelike (perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;
\hat{P}^{\mu })&lt;/math&gt;. The spin-dependent scalar potentials &lt;math&gt;\tilde{S}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are 
:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{S}_{1} =M_{1}-m_{1}-\frac{i}{2}G\gamma _{2}\cdot \partial \mathcal{L}
,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{S}_{2} =M_{2}-m_{2}+\frac{i}{2}G\gamma _{1}\cdot {\partial }\mathcal{
L}{.}  
&lt;/math&gt;

The  parametrization for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; takes advantage of
the Todorov effective external potential forms (as seen in the above section
on the two-body Klein Gordon equations) and at the same time displays the
correct static limit form for the Pauli reduction to Schrödinger-like
form.  The choice for these parameterizations (as with the two-body Klein
Gordon equations) is  closely tied to classical or quantum field
theories for separate scalar and vector interactions. This
amounts to working in the Feynman gauge with the simplest relation between
space- and timelike parts of the vector interaction,.
The mass and energy potentials are respectively 
:&lt;math&gt;
M_{i}^{2} =m_{i}^{2}+\exp (2\mathcal{G)(}2m_{w}S\mathcal{+}S^{2}), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{i}^{2} =\exp (2\mathcal{G(A))(}\varepsilon _{i}-A)^{2},
&lt;/math&gt;
so that 
:&lt;math&gt;
\exp (\mathcal{L}) =\exp (\mathcal{L}(S,A))=\frac{M_{1}+M_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}
,  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G =\exp \mathcal{G=}\exp (\mathcal{G(}A\mathcal{))=}\sqrt{\frac{1}{(1-2A/w)
}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications and limitations ==

The TBDE can be readily applied to two body systems such as [[positronium]], [[muonium]], [[hydrogen]]-like atoms, [[quarkonium]], and the two-[[nucleon]] system.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Crater, R. Becker, C. Y. Wong, and P. Van Alstine, Physical Review 46, 5117 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crater|first=Horace|author2=Schiermeyer, James |title=Applications of two-body Dirac equations to the meson spectrum with three versus two covariant interactions, SU(3) mixing, and comparison to a quasipotential approach|journal=Physical Review D|year=2010|volume=82|issue=9|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.82.094020|arxiv = 1004.2980 |bibcode = 2010PhRvD..82i4020C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Liu and H. W. Crater, Physical Review C67, 024001 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  These applications involve two particles only and do not involve creation or annihilation of particles beyond the two.  They involve only elastic processes.  Because of the connection between the potentials used in the TBDE and the corresponding quantum field theory, any radiative correction to the lowest order interaction can be incorporated into those potentials.  To see how this comes about, consider by contrast how one computes scattering amplitudes without quantum field theory.  With no quantum field theory one must come upon potentials by classical arguments or phenomenological considerations.  Once one has the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; between two particles, then one can compute the scattering amplitude &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; from the [[Lippmann-Schwinger]] equation &lt;ref&gt;J.  J.  Sakurai,  Modern Quantum Mechanics, Addison Wesley (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T+V+VGT=0&lt;/math&gt;,

in which &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Green function determined from the Schrödinger equation.  Because of the similarity between the Schrödinger equation Eq. ({{EquationNote|11}})  and the relativistic constraint equation ({{EquationNote|10}}),one can derive the same type of equation as the above

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}+\Phi +\Phi \mathcal{GT}=0&lt;/math&gt;,

called the quasipotential equation with a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; very similar to that given in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation.  The difference is that with the quasipotential equation, one starts with the scattering amplitudes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; of quantum field theory, as determined from Feynman diagrams and deduces the quasipotential Φ perturbatively.  Then one can use that Φ in ({{EquationNote|10}}), to compute energy levels of two particle systems that are implied by the field theory.  Constraint dynamics provides one of many, in fact an infinite number of, different types of quasipotential equations (three-dimensional truncations of the Bethe-Salpeter equation) differing from one another by the choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Yaes, Phys D Vol 3, 3086 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;    
The relatively simple solution to the problem of relative time and energy from the generalized mass shell constraint for two particles, has no simple extension, such as presented here with the &lt;math&gt;x_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; variable, to either two particles in an external field &lt;ref&gt;J. Bijtebier and J.Broekaert, Nuovo Cimento, Vol. 105 , 625 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; or to 3 or more particles.  Sazdjian has presented a receipe for this extension when the particles are confined and cannot split into clusters of a smaller number of particles with no inter-cluster interactions &lt;ref&gt;H. Sazdjian, N-Body Bound State Relativistic Wave Equations, Annals of Physics, Vol 191,  52 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;    Lusanna has developed an approach, one that does not involve generalized mass shell constraints with no such restrictions, which extends to N bodies with or without fields.  It is formulated on spacelike hypersurfaces and when restricted to the family of hyperplanes orthogonal to the total timelike momentum gives rise to a covariant intrinsic 1-time formulation (with no relative time variables) called the "rest-frame instant form" of dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Luca Lusanna, The N- and 1-time classical descriptions of N-body relativistic kinematic and the electromagnetic interaction, International Journal of Modern Physics A, Vol 12 645, (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.

[[File:Filter vs ultrafilter.svg|thumb|The powerset lattice of the set {1,2,3,4}, with the [[upper set]] ↑{1,4} colored yellow. It is a ''principal filter'', but not an ''ultrafilter'', as it can be extended to the larger nontrivial filter ↑{1}, by including also the light green elements. Since ↑{1} cannot be extended any further, it is an ultrafilter.]]
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[set theory]], an '''ultrafilter''' on a given [[partially ordered set]] (poset) ''P'' is a [[maximal element|maximal]] filter on ''P'', that is, a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] on ''P'' that cannot be enlarged. Filters and ultrafilters are special subsets of ''P''. If ''P'' happens to be a [[Boolean algebra]], each ultrafilter is also a [[prime filter]], and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.1990"&gt;{{cite book | author=B.A. Davey and H.A. Priestley | title=Introduction to Lattices and Order | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=Cambridge Mathematical Textbooks | year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186}}  

If ''X'' is an arbitrary set, its [[power set]] [[Weierstrass p|℘]](''X''), ordered by [[set inclusion]], is always a Boolean algebra, and (ultra)filters on ℘(''X'') are usually called "(ultra)filters on ''X''".&lt;ref name="notation warning" group=note&gt;If ''X'' happens to be partially ordered, too, particular care is needed to understand from the context whether an (ultra)filter on ℘(''X'') or an (ultra)filter just on ''X'' is meant; both kinds of (ultra)filters are quite different. Some authors{{cn|date=July 2016}} use "(ultra)filter" ''of'' a partial ordered set" vs. "''on'' an arbitrary set"; i.e. they write "(ultra)filter on ''X''" to abbreviate "(ultra)filter of ℘(''X'')".&lt;!---guessed from a sentence in section "Types and existence of ultrafilters" which is now commented-out---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Ultrafilters have many applications in set theory, [[model theory]], and [[topology]].&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.1990"/&gt;{{rp|186}} An ultrafilter on a set ''X'' may be considered as a [[finitely additive]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]. In this view, every subset of ''X'' is either considered "[[Almost everywhere|almost everything]]" (has measure 1) or "almost nothing" (has measure 0).{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Ultrafilters on partial orders==
In [[order theory]], an '''ultrafilter''' is a [[subset]] of a [[partially ordered set]] that is [[maximal element|maximal]] among all [[filter (mathematics)#General definition|proper filter]]s.  This implies that any filter that properly contains an ultrafilter has to be equal to the whole poset.

Formally, if ''P'' is a set, partially ordered by (≤), then 
* a subset ''F'' of ''P'' is called a '''filter''' on ''P'' if
** ''F'' is nonempty,
** for every ''x'', ''y'' in ''F'', there is some element ''z'' in ''F'' such that ''z'' ≤ ''x'' and ''z'' ≤ ''y'', and
** for every ''x'' in ''F'' and ''y'' in ''P'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies that ''y'' is in ''F'', too;
* a proper subset ''U'' of ''P'' is called an '''ultrafilter''' on ''P'' if
** ''U'' is a filter on ''P'', and
** there is no filter ''F'' on ''P'' such that ''U'' ⊊ ''F'' ⊊ ''P''.

==Special case: Boolean algebra==
An important special case of the concept occurs if the considered poset is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].  In this case, ultrafilters are characterized by containing, for each element ''a'' of the Boolean algebra, exactly one of the elements ''a'' and ¬''a'' (the latter being the [[Boolean algebra#Nonmonotone laws|Boolean complement]] of ''a''):

If ''P'' is a Boolean algebra and ''F'' ⊊ ''P'' is a proper filter, then the following statements are equivalent:
# ''F'' is an ultrafilter on ''P'',
# ''F'' is a [[prime filter]] on ''P'',
# for each ''a'' in ''P'', either ''a'' is in ''F'' or (¬''a'') is in ''F''.&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.1990"/&gt;{{rp|186}}
A proof of 1.⇔2. is also given in (Burris, Sankappanavar, 2012, Cor.3.13, p.133)&lt;ref name="Burris.Sankappanavar.2012"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/UALG/univ-algebra2012.pdf | isbn=978-0-9880552-0-9 | author=Stanley N. Burris and H.P. Sankappanavar | title=A Course in Universal Algebra | year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, ultrafilters on a Boolean algebra can be related to [[ideal (order theory)#Prime ideals|prime ideal]]s, [[maximal ideal]]s, and [[homomorphism]]s to the 2-element Boolean algebra {true, false}, as follows:
*Given a homomorphism of a Boolean algebra onto {true, false}, the [[inverse image]] of "true" is an ultrafilter, and the inverse image of "false" is a maximal ideal.
*Given a maximal ideal of a Boolean algebra, its complement is an ultrafilter, and there is a unique homomorphism onto {true, false} taking the maximal ideal to "false".
*Given an ultrafilter of a Boolean algebra, its complement is a maximal ideal, and there is a unique homomorphism onto {true, false} taking the ultrafilter to "true".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set ==
Given an arbitrary set ''X'', its [[power set]] [[Weierstrass p|℘]](''X''), ordered by [[set inclusion]], is always a Boolean algebra; hence the results of the above section ''[[#Special case: Boolean algebra]]'' apply. An (ultra)filter on ℘(''X'') is often called just an "(ultra)filter on ''X''".&lt;ref name="notation warning" group=note/&gt; The above formal definitions can be particularized to the powerset case as follows:

Given an arbitrary set ''X'', an ultrafilter on ℘(''X'') is a set ''U'' consisting of subsets of ''X'' such that:
#The empty set is not an element of ''U''.
#If ''A'' and ''B'' are subsets of ''X'', the set ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', and ''A'' is an element of ''U'', then ''B'' is also an element of ''U''.
#If ''A'' and ''B'' are elements of ''U'', then so is the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ''A'' and ''B''.
#If ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then either&lt;ref name="exclusive or" group=note&gt;Properties 1 and 3 imply that ''A'' and {{nowrap|''X'' \ ''A''}} cannot ''both'' be elements of ''U''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A'' or its relative complement ''X'' \ ''A'' is an element of ''U''.

A characterization is given by the following theorem.
A filter ''U'' on ℘(''X'') is an ultrafilter if any of the following conditions are true:
#There is no filter ''F'' strictly [[Filter (mathematics)#Filter on a set|finer]] than ''U'', that is, ''U'' ⊆ ''F'' implies ''U'' = ''F''.
#If a union ''A''∪''B'' is in ''U'', then ''A'' is in ''U'' or ''B'' is.
#For each subset ''A'' of ''X'', either&lt;ref name="exclusive or" group=note/&gt; ''A'' is in ''U'' or (''X'' \ ''A'') is.

Another way of looking at ultrafilters on a power set ℘(''X'') is to define a function ''m'' on ℘(''X'') by setting ''m''(''A'') = 1 if ''A'' is an element of ''U'' and ''m''(''A'') = 0 otherwise. Such a function is called a [[2-valued morphism]]. Then ''m'' is [[finitely additive]], and hence a ''[[Content (measure theory)|content]]'' on ℘(''X''), and every property of elements of ''X'' is either true [[almost everywhere]] or false almost everywhere. However, ''m'' is usually not ''countably additive'', and hence does not define a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] in the usual sense.

For a filter ''F'' that is not an ultrafilter, one would say ''m''(''A'') = 1 if ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'' and ''m''(''A'') = 0 if ''X'' \ ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'', leaving ''m'' undefined elsewhere.{{cn|date=July 2016}}{{clarify|reason=A function m can certainly be defined in that way. However, this is pointless unless such an m can be shown to have some useful properties (e.g. being a 'content'). They should be stated here.|date=July 2016}}

==Completeness==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Martin measure]] --&gt;
The '''completeness''' of an ultrafilter ''U'' on a powerset is the smallest [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] κ such that there are κ elements of ''U'' whose intersection is not in ''U''. The definition implies that the completeness of any powerset ultrafilter is at least [[Aleph-naught|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]]. An ultrafilter whose completeness is ''greater'' than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;—that is, the intersection of any countable collection of elements of ''U'' is still in ''U''—is called '''countably complete''' or '''σ-complete'''.

The completeness of a countably complete [[#Types and existence of ultrafilters|nonprincipal]] ultrafilter on a powerset is always a [[measurable cardinal]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== {{vanchor|Types and existence of ultrafilters|Types}} ==
There are two very different types of ultrafilter: principal and free. A '''principal''' (or '''fixed''', or '''trivial''') ultrafilter is a filter containing a [[least element]]. Consequently, principal ultrafilters are of the form ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = {''x'' | ''a'' ≤ ''x''} for some (but not all) elements ''a'' of the given poset. In this case ''a'' is called the ''principal element'' of the ultrafilter. Any ultrafilter that is not principal is called a '''free''' (or '''non-principal''') ultrafilter. 

For ultrafilters on a powerset ℘(''S''), a principal ultrafilter consists of all subsets of ''S'' that contain a given element ''s'' of ''S''. Each ultrafilter on ℘(''S'') that is also a [[principal filter]] is of this form.&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.1990"/&gt;{{rp|187}} Therefore, an ultrafilter ''U'' on ℘(''S'') is principal if and only if it contains a finite set.&lt;ref group=note&gt;To see the "if" direction: If {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} ∈ ''U'', then {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;} ∈ ''U'', or ..., or {''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} ∈ ''U'' by induction on ''n'', using Nr.2 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem. That is, some {''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is the principal element of ''U''.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''S'' is infinite, an ultrafilter ''U'' on ℘(''S'') is hence non-principal if and only if it contains the [[Fréchet filter]] of [[cofinite subset]]s of ''S''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''U'' is non-principal iff it contains no finite set, i.e. (by Nr.3 of the [[#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|above]] characterization theorem) iff it contains every cofinite set, i.e. every member of the Fréchet filter.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=July 2016}} If ''S'' is finite, each ultrafilter is principal.&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.1990"/&gt;{{rp|187}}

One can show that every filter of a Boolean algebra (or more generally, any subset with the [[finite intersection property]]) is contained in an ultrafilter (see [[Ultrafilter lemma]]) and that free ultrafilters therefore exist, but the proofs involve the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) in the form of [[Zorn's Lemma]]. On the other hand, the statement that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter does not imply AC. Indeed, it is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (BPIT), a well-known intermediate point between the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and the ZF theory augmented by the axiom of choice (ZFC). In general proofs involving the axiom of choice do not produce explicit examples of free ultrafilters, though it is possible to find explicit examples in some  models of ZFC;  for example, Godel showed that this can be done in the constructible universe where one can write down an explicit global choice function.  &lt;!---commented out: "almost all" is vague in absence of a measure, "all UFs principal on finite sets" has been said above---Nonetheless, almost all ultrafilters on the powerset of an infinite set are free. By contrast, every ultrafilter of a finite poset (or ''on'' a finite set) is principal, since any finite filter has a least element.---&gt; In ZF without the axiom of choice, it is possible that every ultrafilter is principal.{see p.316, [Halbeisen, L.J.] "Combinatorial Set Theory", Springer 2012}

==Applications==
Ultrafilters on powersets are useful in [[topology]], especially in relation to [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] spaces, and in [[model theory]] in the construction of [[ultraproduct|ultraproducts and ultrapowers]]. Every ultrafilter on a compact Hausdorff space converges to exactly one point. Likewise, ultrafilters on Boolean algebras play a central role in [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone's representation theorem]].

The set ''G'' of all ultrafilters of a poset ''P'' can be topologized in a natural way, that is in fact closely related to the above-mentioned representation theorem. For any element ''a'' of ''P'', let ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = {''U'' ∈ ''G'' | ''a'' ∈ ''U''}. This is most useful when ''P'' is again a Boolean algebra, since in this situation the set of all ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is a base for a compact Hausdorff topology on ''G''. Especially, when considering the ultrafilters on a powerset ℘(''S''), the resulting [[topological space]] is the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of a [[discrete space]] of cardinality |''S''|.

The [[ultraproduct]] construction in [[model theory]] uses ultrafilters to produce [[elementary extension]]s of structures. For example, in constructing [[hyperreal number]]s as an ultraproduct of the [[real numbers]], the [[domain of discourse]] is extended from real numbers to sequences of real numbers. This sequence space is regarded as a [[superset]] of the reals by identifying each real with the corresponding constant sequence. To extend the familiar functions and relations (e.g., + and &lt;) from the reals to the hyperreals, the natural idea is to define them pointwise. But this would lose important logical properties of the reals; for example, pointwise &lt; is not a total ordering. So instead the functions and relations are defined "[[ultraproduct#Definition|pointwise modulo ''U'']]", where ''U'' is an ultrafilter on the [[index set]] of the sequences; by [[Łoś' theorem]], this preserves all properties of the reals that can be stated in [[first-order logic]]. If ''U'' is nonprincipal, then the extension thereby obtained is nontrivial.

In [[geometric group theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define the [[ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of a group. This construction yields a rigorous way to consider ''looking at the group from infinity'', that is the large scale geometry of the group. Asymptotic cones are particular examples of [[ultralimit]]s of [[metric space]]s.

[[Gödel's ontological proof]] of God's existence uses as an axiom that the set of all "positive properties" is an ultrafilter.

In [[social choice theory]], non-principal ultrafilters are used to define a rule (called a ''social welfare function'') for aggregating the preferences of ''infinitely'' many individuals. Contrary to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] for ''finitely'' many individuals, such a rule satisfies the conditions (properties) that Arrow proposes
(e.g., Kirman and Sondermann, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kirman | first1 = A.| last2 = Sondermann | first2 = D.| title = Arrow's theorem, many agents, and invisible dictators| journal = Journal of Economic Theory| volume = 5| pages = 267| year = 1972| doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=={{vanchor|Ordering on ultrafilters|Ordering}}==
The '''Rudin–Keisler ordering''' is a [[preorder]] on the class of powerset ultrafilters defined as follows: if ''U'' is an ultrafilter on ℘(''X''), and ''V'' an ultrafilter on ℘(''Y''), then ''V'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt; ''U'' if there exists a function ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' such that
:''C'' ∈ ''V'' ⇔ ''f''&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt;[''C''] ∈ ''U''
for every subset ''C'' of ''Y''.

Ultrafilters ''U'' and ''V'' are called '''Rudin–Keisler equivalent''', denoted ''U'' ≡&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt; ''V'', if there exist sets ''A'' ∈ ''U'' and ''B'' ∈ ''V'', and a [[bijection]] ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'' that satisfies the condition above. (If ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same cardinality, the definition can be simplified by fixing ''A'' = ''X'', ''B'' = ''Y''.)

It is known that ≡&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of ≤&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e., that ''U'' ≡&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt; ''V'' if and only if ''U'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt; ''V'' and ''V'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;RK&lt;/sub&gt; ''U''.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Ultrafilters on ℘(''ω'')==
There are several special properties that an ultrafilter on ℘([[Ordinal number#Ordinals extend the natural numbers|''ω'']]) may possess, which prove useful in various areas of set theory and topology.
* A non-principal ultrafilter ''U'' is called a '''P-point''' (or '''weakly selective''') if for every [[partition of a set|partition]] { ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''n''&lt;''ω'' } of ''ω'' such that ∀''n''&lt;''ω'': ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∉ ''U'', there exists some ''A'' ∈ ''U'' such that ''A'' ∩ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite set for each ''n''.
* A non-principal ultrafilter ''U'' is called '''Ramsey''' (or '''selective''') if for every partition { ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''n''&lt;''ω'' } of ''ω'' such that ∀''n''&lt;''ω'': ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∉ ''U'', there exists some ''A'' ∈ ''U'' such that ''A'' ∩ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[singleton set]] for each ''n''.

It is a trivial observation that all Ramsey ultrafilters are P-points. [[Walter Rudin]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] implies the existence of Ramsey ultrafilters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, many hypotheses imply the existence of Ramsey ultrafilters, including [[Martin's axiom]]. [[Saharon Shelah]] later showed that it is consistent that there are no P-point ultrafilters.&lt;ref&gt;

  | accessdate = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the existence of these types of ultrafilters is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC]].

P-points are called as such because they are topological [[P-point]]s in the usual topology of the space [[Stone–Čech compactification|{{nowrap|βω \ ω}}]] of non-principal ultrafilters. The name Ramsey comes from [[Ramsey's theorem]]. To see why, one can prove that an ultrafilter is Ramsey if and only if for every 2-coloring of [''ω'']&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; there exists an element of the ultrafilter that has a homogeneous color.

An ultrafilter on ℘(''ω'') is Ramsey if and only if it is [[minimal element|minimal]] in the Rudin–Keisler ordering of non-principal powerset ultrafilters.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

'''Vicky Brago-Mitchell''' is an American [[fractal]] [[artist]] known in the 1960s as a [[Stanford University]] student who, while working as a [[topless dancer]],{{citation-needed|date=August 2015}} ran for student body president.  She won the preliminary election, but lost to eventual [[Earth Day]] national coordinator [[Denis Hayes]] in a two-person runoff election.  She was born on September 30, 1946 in [[Yakima, Washington]].  Daughter of a [[Methodist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], she grew up as Victoria Jane Bowles in small towns in Washington, [[Oregon]] and [[Montana]]. After graduating from high school she attended Stanford University as a scholarship student majoring in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In 1967 she was the first American college girl to appear nude in a campus [[magazine]], the Stanford Chaparral  (''Stanford Chaparral'', Spring 1967). In 1968 she began working at night as a topless dancer under the stage name Vicky Drake, and ran for student body president with a campaign poster that was a photo of herself posing nude on the Stanford Mausoleum (''Stanford Alumni Magazine'', September/October 1994). This story was first reported by the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], May 1, 1968, then carried by [[wire services]] [[Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]] and published in [[newspapers]] worldwide. A feature about her titled Student Body appeared in the September 1968 edition of [[Playboy]] and was reprinted in the 1971 Playboy special edition The Youth Culture.

From 1970 to 1974 she toured the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] as a [[stripper]],{{citation-needed|date=August 2015}} then stayed in Japan for two years, working as a [[translator]], [[photographer]] and [[English language|English]] [[teacher]]. In 1977 she obtained a teaching credential from [[California State University, Fullerton]], then worked as an elementary school teacher until 2005.

In 2002, she produced a [[CD]] of her husband [[composer]] [[John Mitchell (composer)|John Mitchell]]’s [[chamber music]] for [[string instruments]], recorded in [[Moscow]], and in 2006 arranged the production of a double CD of his chamber music for [[woodwind instruments]] by MMC Recordings in [[Boston]], featuring [[clarinetist]] [[Richard Stoltzman]]. In 2005 her [[fractal art]] appeared on the cover of Latin Finance [[magazine]] and was shown at the  Biennale Internazionale dell’Arte Contemporanea in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[probability]], the '''Wiener sausage''' is a neighborhood of the trace of a [[Brownian motion]] up to a time ''t'', given by taking all points within a fixed distance of  Brownian motion. It can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is Brownian motion. The Wiener sausage was named after [[Norbert Wiener]]  by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Monroe D. Donsker |author2-link=S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan|first=M. D.|last= Donsker |first2=S. R. Srinivasa|last2= Varadhan|year=1975}} because of its relation to the [[Wiener process]]; the name is also a pun on [[Vienna sausage]], as "Wiener" means "Viennese" in [[German language|German]].

The Wiener sausage is one of the simplest [[Markov process|non-Markovian]] functionals of Brownian motion. Its applications include [[stochastic]] phenomena including [[heat conduction]]. It was first described  by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Frank Spitzer|first=Frank|last= Spitzer|year=1964}}, and it was used  by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Mark Kac |author2-link=Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger |first=Mark|last= Kac |first2=Joaquin Mazdak|last2= Luttinger|year=1973|year2=1974}} to explain results of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], with proofs published by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Monroe D. Donsker |author2-link=S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan|first=M. D.|last= Donsker |first2=S. R. Srinivasa|last2= Varadhan|year=1975}}.

==Definitions==
The Wiener sausage ''W''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') of radius δ and length ''t'' is the set-valued [[random variable]] on [[Brownian path]]s '''b''' (in some Euclidean space) defined by
:&lt;math&gt;W_\delta(t)({ b})&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points within a distance δ of some point '''b'''(''x'') of the path '''b''' with 0≤''x''≤''t''.

==Volume of the Wiener sausage==

There has been a lot of work on the behavior of the volume ([[Lebesgue measure]]) |''W''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')| of the Wiener sausage as it becomes thin (δ→0); by rescaling, this is essentially equivalent to studying the volume as the sausage becomes long (''t''→∞).

{{harvtxt|Spitzer|1964}} showed that in 3 dimensions the expected value of the volume of the sausage is
:&lt;math&gt;E(|W_\delta(t)|) = 2\pi\delta t + 4\delta^2\sqrt{2\pi t} +4\pi\delta^3/3.&lt;/math&gt;
In dimension ''d'' at least 3 the volume of the Wiener sausage is asymptotic to
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{d-2} \pi^{d/2}2t/\Gamma((d-2)/2)&lt;/math&gt;
as ''t'' tends to infinity. In dimensions 1 and 2 this formula gets replaced by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{8t/\pi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2{\pi}t/\log(t)&lt;/math&gt; respectively. {{harvtxt|Whitman|1964}}, a student of Spitzer, proved similar results for generalizations of Wiener sausages with cross sections given by more general [[Compact space|compact sets]]  than [[Ball (mathematics)|balls]].
