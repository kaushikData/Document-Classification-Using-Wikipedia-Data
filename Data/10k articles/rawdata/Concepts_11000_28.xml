      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">"'''A Causal Theory of Knowing'''" is a philosophical essay written by [[Alvin Goldman]] in 1967, published in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]''. It is based on existing theories of knowledge in the realm of [[epistemology]], the study of philosophy through the scope of knowledge. The essay attempts to define knowledge by connecting facts, beliefs and knowledge through underlying and connective series called causal chains. It provides a '''causal theory of knowledge'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

A [[causal chain]] is repeatedly described as a sequence of events for which one event in a chain causes the next. According to Goldman, these chains can only exist with the presence of an accepted fact, a belief in the fact, and a cause for the subject to believe the fact.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay also explores the ideas of perception and memory through the use of the causal chains and the concept of knowledge.

==Background==
The essay is regarded as an improvement and rebuttal of [[Edmund Gettier|Edmund Gettier's]] "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", which is one of many attempts to explain the necessary conditions for knowledge to develop. Goldman implements the causal connection to reiterate his own theory of knowledge. Knowledge exists, says Goldman, if and only if the belief is justified by a reaction to the accepted fact.

Goldman's theory later counters that of Michael Clark, stating that his own theory including figures and diagrams is more appropriate than Clark's. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" uses figures which make explicit references to causal beliefs. Clark's model does not utilize these arrows, and Goldman states that the lack of these arrows deems Clark's model deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
[[Alvin Goldman]], currently a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Rutgers University]], wrote "A Causal Theory of Knowing" when he was in his late twenties. Goldman received his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]], and has taught at numerous universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|Professional Biography|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman's research deals mainly with epistemology and other cognitive sciences. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" was Goldman's first published paper explaining his own views of epistemology. Currently, Goldman has written more than ten essays focusing on knowledge and cognitive science.

==Contents==
The essay starts with a definition of Gettier's theory, followed by multiple reiterations of the idea of causal connections, figures to explain knowledge through a visual perspective, and references to [[perception]] and [[memory]] through causal chains.

The essay tends to focus on examples in which knowledge or other sensations do not exist, rather than proving a certain fact to be known.  Goldman also states on multiple occasions that he does not wish to explain the causal process in detail, instead pointing out counterexamples.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At numerous times in the essay, he also points out that he does not intend to give definitive answers to each of the propositions mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman also refocuses the idea of [[perception]], or knowledge through sensation (specifically sight) using his own theory of knowing. The concept of causal perception indicates that one observes something only if the object itself causes the sensation of sight to be accepted as known.  Thus, the object's existence must be factual and one must believe its existence. While all knowledge comes from facts, inferred knowledge emerges when physical object facts cause sense data which can be perceived as senses. The sense data can also be used to make conclusions, known as inferred knowledge, about certain physical object facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|pp=358–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From "A Causal Theory of Knowing", Goldman constructs the idea that [[memory]] is also a causal process. Memory is explained as being an extension of knowledge into the future, and remembering is the act of recalling a fact that has already been known.  Further, the theory states that if knowledge is forgotten at one time, it cannot be considered a memory in the future. According to Goldman, if a fact is known at Time 1 but forgotten at Time 2, and then at Time 3 that the fact is perceived again but not known, at Time 3 the original fact is not a memory because there is no causal connection between the fact and the memory.

The '''amity-enmity complex''' was a term introduced by [[Sir Arthur Keith]]. His work, ''[[A New Theory of Human Evolution]]'' (1948), posited that humans evolved as differing races, tribes, and cultures, exhibiting patriotism, morality, leadership and nationalism. Those who belong are part of the [[in-group]], and tolerated; all others are classed as [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]], and subject to hostility; 'The code of enmity is a necessary part of the machinery of evolution. He who feels generous towards his enemy... has given up his place in the turmoil of evolutionary competition.' [[Conscience]] in humans evolved a duality; to protect and save friends,
and also to hate and fight enemies. &lt;ref&gt; Sir Arthur Keith, A new theory of evolution, Watts and Co, 1948, p 82 &lt;/ref&gt;
Keith's work summarized earlier opinions on human [[tribalism]] by [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwin, [[Descent of Man]], 1879, chapter 7, On the Races of man &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwinism, Wallace, 1889, chapter 15 &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Spencer]].

==Case studies==
{{Unsourced section|date=November 2017}}
# United States; [[racial segregation]]: Keith suggested that racial segregation imposed by [[Jim Crow law]]s was a 'vast experiment' in which ten million coloureds were 'marked off (in 1948) from the rest by a frontier as sharply defined and jealously guarded as the frontiers of a kingdom'.
# [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]: White 'dominance' was 'deeply seated in the primitive organization of the Human brain. [[Boer]] and British settlers both agree 'there is an impassable frontier between them and the native races of Africa and Asia'.
# Jews in Europe: 'The Jews maintain a racial frontier (in 1948), such as dominant races surround themselves with; they carry themselves as if racially distinct...the Jewish frontier may be strengthened by the faith which is (sic) the standard of the race.'  Keith alleged that Jews had a 'dual code; conduct towards their fellows is based on amity, that to all outside their circle is based on enmity. The use of the dual code is the mark of an evolving race.'
# The Indian [[caste system]].

==Disruption==
The amity-enmity complex maintains 'tribal spirit' and thus unity, of the community, 'as long as personal contact between its members is possible.' If the community grows beyond this limitation, then disruption, swarming and disintegration occur. Modern mass communication enables communities 'of 100 million' to remain intact.

==Cyclical effect==
Keith expressed regret that this phenomenon, which explains so much, had not become common knowledge:  "[W]e eternally experience the misery... of each new manifestation of the complex, then invent some new 'ism' to categorise this behavior as an evil, dealing with a common behavioural trait piecemeal [instead of] finally grasping and understanding the phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Keith]], ''A New Theory of Human Evolution'', 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

== Modern examples of tribal instinct==
Colleges, sports teams, churches, trades unions, female fashions and political parties enable people to exhibit tribal loyalty within large, mass-communicating nations. 'In politics we have to take sides.' But all these 'petty manifestations' are cast aside in time of war.
[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Lloyd George]] are cited as statesmen who knew how to exploit the tribal spirit for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/3/6/31369/|title=Index of /files/31369|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

==In later works==
[[Robert Ardrey]] pointed out that similar behavior can be observed in most primates, especially baboons and chimps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, pp. 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt; "Nationalism as such is no more than a human expression of the animal drive to maintain and defend a territory... the mentality of the single Germanic tribe under Hitler differed in no way from that of early man or late baboon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amity-enmity complex is a serious obstacle to [[world peace]] and [[world government]], and may even lead to [[nuclear holocaust]]:  "How can we get along without war?... if we fail to get along without war, the future will be as lacking in human problems as it will be remarkably lacking in men."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chapter one: Tribes and Supertribes; chapter four: Ingroups and Outgroups &lt;/ref&gt; makes a prescriptive point:  "We must try to step outside our groups and look down on human battlefields with the unbiased eye of a hovering Martian."  And he warns that "the truly violent species all appear to have exterminated themselves, a lesson we should not overlook."  The inherited aggression of the amity-enmity rivalry between communities is rationalized under a "persistent cloak of ideology... a matter of ideals, moral principles, social philosophies or religious beliefs....  [O]nly an immense amount of intellectual restraint will save the situation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chap. four.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War Two]], a debate about the place of instinct and learning (the [[nature versus nurture|nature-versus-nurture]] debate) has occurred. According to [[Steven Pinker]], the "bitter lessons of lynchings, world wars, and the Holocaust" have caused "prevailing theories of mind" to be "refashioned to make racism and sexism as untenable as possible. The doctrine of the [[blank slate]] became entrenched in intellectual life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker makes the point that "conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition."  Man is a product of nature, as much as malarial mosquitoes; both "are doing exactly what evolution designed them to do, even if the outcome makes people suffer...  [We] cannot call their behavior pathological...  [T]he belief that violence is an aberration is dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 313-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analysis''' is the process of breaking a [[complexity|complex topic]] or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384–322 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]), though ''analysis'' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Michael Beaney|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Michael Beaney|year=Summer 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἀνάλυσις (''analysis'', "a breaking up", from ''ana-'' "up, throughout" and ''lysis'' "a loosening").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=analysis (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analysis|work=ONLINE ETYMOLOGY DICTIONARY|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''), and [[Galileo Galilei]]. It has also been ascribed to [[Isaac Newton]], in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).

==Applications==

===Science===
[[File:Clinical Chemistry Analyzer , Клинички биохемиски анализатор 3.jpg|thumb|A clinical chemistry analyser; hand shows size]]
{{See also|Analytical chemistry|List of chemical analysis methods}}
The field of [[chemistry]] uses analysis in at least three ways: to identify the components of a particular [[chemical compound]] (qualitative analysis), to identify the proportions of components in a [[mixture]] (quantitative analysis), and to break down [[chemical process]]es and examine [[chemical reaction]]s between [[chemical element|elements]] of [[chemical matter|matter]]. For an example of its use, analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing a [[nuclear reactor]], so [[nuclear scientist]]s will analyse [[neutron activation analysis|neutron activation]] to develop discrete measurements within vast samples. A [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] can have a considerable effect on the way a chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results. Analysis can be done manually or with a [[analyzer|device]]. Chemical analysis is an important element of [[national security]] among the [[great power|major world powers]] with materials

====Isotopes====
{{See also|Isotope analysis|Isotope geochemistry}}
Chemists can use [[isotope analysis]] to assist analysts with issues in [[anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[food chemistry]], [[forensics]], [[geology]], and a host of other questions of [[physical science]]. Analysts can discern the origins of natural and man-made isotopes in the study of [[environmental radioactivity]].

===Business===
* [[Financial statement analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– the analysis of the accounts and the economic prospects of a firm
* [[Fundamental analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a stock valuation method that uses financial analysis
* [[Technical analysis]] – the study of price action in securities markets in order to forecast future prices
* [[Business analysis]] – involves identifying the needs and determining the solutions to business problems
* [[Price analysis]] – involves the breakdown of a price to a unit figure
* [[Market analysis]] – consists of suppliers and customers, and price is determined by the interaction of [[supply and demand]]
* Opportunity analysis – consists of customers trends within the industry, customer demand and experience determine purchasing behavior

===Computer science===
* [[Requirements analysis]] – encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users.
* [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)]] – shows how online algorithms perform and demonstrates the power of randomization in algorithms
* [[Lexical analysis]] – the process of processing an input sequence of characters and producing as output a sequence of symbols
* [[Object-oriented analysis and design]]&amp;nbsp;– à la [[Booch method|Booch]]
* [[Program analysis (computer science)]]&amp;nbsp;– the process of automatically analysing the behavior of computer programs
* [[Semantic analysis (computer science)]]&amp;nbsp;– a pass by a compiler  that adds semantical information to the parse tree and performs certain checks
* [[Static code analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that
* [[Structured systems analysis and design methodology]]&amp;nbsp;– à la [[Yourdon]]
* [[Syntax analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a process in compilers that recognizes the structure of programming languages, also known as parsing
* [[Worst-case execution time]]&amp;nbsp;– determines the longest time that a piece of software can take to run

===Economics===
* [[Agroecosystem analysis]]
* [[Input-output model]] if applied to a region, is called Regional Impact Multiplier System

===Engineering===
{{See also|Engineering analysis|Systems analysis}}
Analysts in the field of [[engineering]] look at [[Requirement analysis|requirements]], [[structural analysis|structures]], mechanisms, [[systems analysis|systems]] and [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]]. [[Electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] analyse [[system analysis|systems]] in [[electronics]]. [[Whole-life cost|Life cycles]] and [[Accident analysis|system failures]] are broken down and studied by engineers. It is also looking at different factors incorporated within the design.

===Intelligence===
{{See also|Intelligence analysis}}
The field of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] employs analysts to break down and understand a wide array of questions. [[Intelligence agency|Intelligence agencies]] may use [[heuristics]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]], [[social network analysis]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[Social network#Social network analysis|link analysis]], and [[brainstorming]] to sort through problems they face. [[Military intelligence]] may explore issues through the use of [[game theory]], [[Red Team]]ing, and [[military simulation|wargaming]]. [[Signals intelligence]] applies [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]] to break [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s. [[Business intelligence]] applies theories of [[competitive intelligence|competitive intelligence analysis]] and [[competitor analysis]] to resolve questions in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace]]. [[Police|Law enforcement]] intelligence applies a number of theories in [[crime analysis]].

===Linguistics===
{{See also|Linguistics}}
[[Linguistics]] look at individual languages and [[language]] in general. It breaks language down and analyses its component parts: [[theoretical linguistics|theory]], [[phonology|sounds and their meaning]], [[pragmatics|utterance usage]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word origins]], the [[etymology|history of words]], the meaning of [[lexical semantics|words]] and [[phraseology|word combinations]], [[syntax|sentence construction]], [[discourse analysis|basic construction beyond the sentence level]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], and [[conversation analysis|conversation]]. It examines the above using [[computational linguistics|statistics and modeling]], and [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantics]]. It analyses language in context of [[anthropological linguistics|anthropology]], [[biolinguistics|biology]], [[evolutionary linguistics|evolution]], [[language geography|geography]], [[historical linguistics|history]], [[neurolinguistics|neurology]], [[psycholinguistics|psychology]], and [[sociolinguistics|sociology]]. It also takes the [[applied linguistics|applied]] approach, looking at [[developmental linguistics|individual language development]] and [[clinical linguistics|clinical]] issues.

===Literature===
[[Literary criticism]] is the analysis of [[literature]]. The focus can be as diverse as the analysis of [[analysis (Homer)|Homer]] or [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freud]]. While not all literary-critical methods are primarily analytical in nature, the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid-twentieth century, literary formal analysis or close reading, is. This method, rooted in the academic movement labelled [[The New Criticism]], approaches texts – chiefly short poems such as [[sonnets]], which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis – as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves, without reference to biographical or historical frameworks. This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]], and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects.

===Mathematics===
{{Main|Mathematical analysis}}

Modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus.  It can be applied in the study of [[classical mathematics|classical]] concepts of mathematics, such as [[real analysis|real numbers]], [[complex analysis|complex variables]], [[Fourier analysis|trigonometric functions]], and [[numerical analysis|algorithms]], or of [[non-classical analysis|non-classical]] concepts like [[constructivist analysis|constructivism]], [[harmonic analysis|harmonics]], [[non-standard analysis|infinity]], and [[functional analysis|vectors]].

[[Florian Cajori]] explains in [[wikiquote:A History of Mathematics|''A History of Mathematics'']] (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The terms ''synthesis'' and ''analysis'' are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in  [appended to] [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]], XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]: "Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSe_ZEmHaXEC&amp; ''A Short History of Greek Mathematics''] (1884):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished ''theoretic'' from ''problematic'' analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To ''prove'' that A is B, ''assume'' first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be [[wiktionary:convertible#Adjective|convertible]], then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3195">'''Antipathy''' is a voluntary or involuntary dislike for something or somebody, the opposite of [[sympathy]]. While antipathy may be induced by experience, it sometimes exists without a rational cause-and-effect explanation being present to the individuals involved.&lt;ref name=fleming&gt;{{cite web|author1=William Fleming (1890)|title=Vocabulary of Philosophy: Moral, Ethical, Metaphysical|url=http://www.e-torredebabel.com/vocabularyofphilosophy/antipathy-philosophyvocabulary.htm|website=TORRE DE BABEL EDICIONES  Philosophy, Psychology and Humanities Web Site|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the origin of antipathy has been subject to various [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[psychology|psychological]] explanations, which some people find convincing and others regard as highly speculative. The exploration of a philosophical aspect for antipathy has been found in an essay by [[John Locke]], an early modern  17th century philosopher.&lt;ref name=fleming /&gt;

==Interpersonal antipathy==

Interpersonal antipathy is often irrationally ascribed to mannerisms or certain physical characteristics, which are perceived as signs for character traits (e.g., close, deep set eyes as a sign for dullness or cruelty&lt;ref name="Alexander1946a"&gt;Alexander, Chester. (1946a). Antipathy and Phobia. ''Sociometry, 9'' (2/3), 226-232.&lt;/ref&gt;). Further, the negative feeling sometimes takes place rapidly and without reasoning, functioning below the level of attention, thus resembling an automatic process.&lt;ref name="Alexander1946b"&gt;Alexander, Chester. (1946b). Antipathy and Social Behavior. ''The American Journal of Sociology, 51'' (4), 288-292.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chester Alexander’s empirical findings suggest that an important characteristic of antipathies is that they are "marginal to reflective consciousness". Alexander based this conclusion on the fact that many of the subjects of the study reported to have never thought much about their antipathies, have not tried to analyze them or discuss them with others.&lt;ref name="Alexander1946b"/&gt; 

Sympathy and antipathy modify social behavior. Although it is generally assumed that antipathy causes avoidance, some empirical studies gathered evidence that an antipathetic reaction to objects was not followed by any effort to avoid future encounters.&lt;ref name="Alexander1946a"/&gt;

===Personality psychology===
In personality psychology, antipathy may be related to low [[agreeableness]].

===Pseudo-antipathy===

[[Sophie Bryant]] observed the occurrence of pseudo-antipathy which consists in "the careless and arbitrary interpretation of another person's acts and expressions in accordance with the worst side of one's self".&lt;ref name="Bryant1895"&gt;Bryant, Sophie. (1895). Antipathy and Sympathy. ''Mind, 4'' (15), pp. 365-370.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people tend to project their own faults onto others and dislike or hate them. Pseudo-antipathy is based on the (implicit) knowledge about the negative sides of a person's own character. Bryant compares the resulting feeling with "a certain wrong-headed sense of cleansing".&lt;ref name="Bryant1895"/&gt;

The '''Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device''' or '''MUSTARD''', usually written as '''Mustard''', was a concept explored by the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) during the mid-1960s for launching payloads weighing as much as {{convert|5000|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} into orbit. Operating as a multi-stage rocket for launch, the individual stages were near-identical modules, each flying back to land as a spaceplane.

==History==
British interest in re-usable space vehicles started life under [[English Electric]] at [[Warton Aerodrome|Warton]], Lancashire, UK, as part of a government-sponsored series of wider studies into high-speed vehicles and sub-orbital [[spaceplane]]s. Their aerospace activities were later merged with other firms to form [[British Aircraft Corporation|BAC]]. American influence had already been seen, but now BAC studied the various transatlantic projects with greater interest. The [[Douglas Astro]] in particular impressed them and around the beginning of 1964 they took it as the starting point for their own clustered design, which they called the Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device or MUSTARD, but it was usually written simply as Mustard.

The last major design study was drawn up early in 1967 and the project continued at a lower level until it was finally terminated in 1970 by the British government's decision to participate in the new American post-Apollo project. Key Mustard project staff spent the first two years of the 1970s at [[North American Rockwell]] contributing to the initial study which would eventually lead to the [[Space Shuttle]]. By then the prospect of collaboration had faded and, with UK government interest also gone, the Mustard project was terminated.

BAC was itself later merged into [[British Aerospace]] (B.Ae) and when the [[HOTOL]] project arose in 1984 it was moved to Warton to take advantage of the expertise built up during the Mustard project.&lt;ref name="sharp2016"&gt;Sharp (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
===Modules===
Mustard was a modular re-usable space launch system, comprising multiple copies of a single vehicle design, each of which was configured for a different role as a booster stage or an orbital spaceplane. The core vehicle design followed the [[Douglas Astro]] delta-winged reusable vehicle, as would the later US [[Space Shuttle]], in being a vertically-launched rocket with integral wings so that it landed horizontally as an aeroplane.&lt;ref name="sharp2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"BAC MUSTARD Project Artwork Archive", ''Britain in Space'', {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926000930/http://www.britain-in-space.co.uk/info/pix-archive/mustard.html|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1966/1966%20-%200663.pdf "Space Transporters for Europe?"], ''Flight International'', 10 March 1966, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt; The design team was led by [[Tom Smith (engineer)|Tom Smith]], Chief of the Aerospace Department at BAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200816.html "Economical Space Transport"], ''Flight International'', 24 March 1966, p.473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design evolved through a total of fifteen proposed variants or schemes, each typically comprising a deep-keeled lifting-body airframe with delta wings in a smooth [[blended wing body]] layout, with twin tail fins rising from the wing tips and canted outwards. Some early variants had a compound-delta wing with inboard tail fins. Power was provided by anything from one to four rocket engines in the rear fuselage.

There were two primary vehicle configurations, respectively for the orbiter and booster stages. The orbiter could be manned and had ducting to receive fuel from the boosters. The boosters were unmanned and incorporated systems to pump fuel across to the orbiter or to each other. In this way the orbiter could remain fully topped-up for its long orbital injection flight, while all the vehicles could have a standard design of fuel tank.

===Clustering and stacking===
Various clustering and stacking arrangements were explored. Where the Astro had launched as a two-stage step-rocket with the booster much larger than the orbiter, Mustard comprised from three to five similar-sized modules.

Early studies focused around a vehicle with a shallow 120° "vee" underside to both body and wings, so that three could be clustered in a triangle. Some included a fourth, orbital vehicle mounted on top of three boosters. The most efficient regime was to empty one booster at a time, keeping the others topped up for as long as possible, so that the first-stage booster could be dropped as soon as possible. The three boosters would be emptied in turn. But this led to an asymmetric mass loading which BAC believed to be a significant problem, so later designs used a sideways stacking system in which flatter modules were stacked more like sheets of paper.&lt;ref name="sharp2016"/&gt;

At {{convert|150,000|to|200,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, at around 30 nautical miles, the last of the booster units would separate and land like aircraft.

The spacecraft would place its payload into orbit at around 1000 nautical miles, after 10 minutes from launch, and then return in a like manner.

'''Barthélemy Boganda''' (4 April 1910 – 29 March 1959) was the leading [[Nationalism|nationalist]] politician of what is now the [[Central African Republic]]. Boganda was active prior to his country's independence, during the period when the area, part of [[French Equatorial Africa]], was administered by [[France]] under the name of [[Oubangui-Chari]]. He served as the first [[List of heads of government of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|Prime Minister]] of the Central African Republic [[territorial autonomy|autonomous territory]].

Boganda was born into a family of subsistence farmers, and was adopted and educated by [[Roman Catholic Church]] [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]]. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During [[World War II]], Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of [[Bangui]] to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], where he maintained a political [[party platform|platform]] against [[racism]] and the [[Colonialism|colonial regime]]. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]]. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the [[MESAN|Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the [[working class]]. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was [[Defrocking|laicized]] from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and [[civil rights]] for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.

In 1958, after the [[French Fourth Republic]] began to consider granting independence to most of its African colonies, Boganda met with [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first [[List of heads of state of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|President of the independent CAR]]. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French secret service]], and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Boganda was born to a family of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] in [[Bobangui]], a large [[M'Baka]] village in the [[Lobaye]] basin located at the edge of the equatorial forest some {{convert|80|km|mi}} southwest of [[Bangui]].&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; French commercial exploitation of Central Africa had reached an apogee around the time of Boganda's birth, and although interrupted by [[World War I]], activity resumed in the 1920s. The French consortia used what was essentially a form of slavery—the ''corvée''—and one of the most notorious was the Compagnie forestière de la Sangha-Oubangui, involved in rubber gathering in the Lobaye district.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, Boganda's mother was beaten to death by the company's officials while collecting rubber in the forest.&lt;ref name="Chirot378"&gt;Chirot, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, whose son [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] would later crown himself as the Emperor of the [[Central African Empire]], was beaten to death at the colonial police station as a result of his alleged resistance to [[employment|work]].&lt;ref name="Chirot378"/&gt; Boganda's father was a [[witch doctor]] who had engaged in [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] rituals.&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Death of a Strongman |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810965,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=13 April 1959 |accessdate=22 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his early years, Boganda was adopted by Catholic missionaries. As a boy he attended the school opened at [[Mbaiki]] (the administrative centre for the Lobaye [[prefecture]]) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent two hours a day with [[Monsignor]] Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Barthélemy]],&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradshaw |first=Richard A. |title=Bibliography and Reference Work for the Central African Republic: Letra C |url=http://webs.ono.com/bradshawproject/letra%20C.htm |publisher= |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150104093215/http://webs.ono.com/bradshawproject/letra%20C.htm |archivedate=4 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in honour of one of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus Christ]] who was believed to have worked as [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in [[Brazzaville]] and [[Kisantu]] (under [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) before he moved on to the great seminary at [[Yaoundé]]. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve,&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; he was ordained and became the first [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest native to [[Oubangui-Chari]], as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, [[Grimari]] and [[Bangassou]],&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the [[French Army]]. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in [[World War II]], during which he served in a number of missions.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Biographies des députés de la IV République: Barthélémy Boganda |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/boganda-barthelemy-04041910.asp |publisher=[[National Assembly of France]] |accessdate=29 February 2008 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings in politics and marriage===
After World War II, Boganda was urged by the Bishop of Bangui, Mgr Grandin, to complement his humanitarian and social works through political action. Boganda decided to run for election to the [[National Assembly of France]]. On 10 November 1946, he became the first Oubanguian [[French legislative election, November 1946|elected]] to the assembly after winning almost half of the total votes cast and defeating three other candidates, including the outgoing incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt; Boganda arrived in [[Paris]] attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1947 on, Boganda conducted a lively campaign against racism and the colonial regime. Soon realizing the limits of his influence in France (he served in parliament until 1958 but gradually detached himself from its activities),&lt;ref&gt;An [[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]] deputy until 1950, Boganda was an independent thereafter. He only spoke twice, in 1947 on the abuses of colonialism and in 1950 on the lack of social justice in French Equatorial Africa. After 1956, he practically stopped attending the Paris parliament. National Assembly of France biography.&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Oubangui-Chari to organise a grassroots movement of teachers, truck drivers and small producers to oppose French colonialism, although his previous attempt to set up a marketing cooperative among African planters of his own ethnicity had failed.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Gardinier, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This was the Société Coopérative Oubangui, Lobaye, Lesse (SOCOULOLE), which aimed to provide food, clothing, lodging, medical care and education. The SOCOULOLE was disbanded after a few months. National Assembly of France biography; Kalck (2005), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1949, at Bangui, he founded the [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (MESAN), a quasi-religious [[political movement]] and [[political party|party]] that sought to affirm black humanity and quickly came to dominate local politics. His political creed was summed up in the [[Sango language|Sango]] phrase "''zo kwe zo''", which translated to "every human being is a person".&lt;ref&gt;The preamble of the CAR's 2004 Constitution reads, in part, 'Animated by the wish of assuring to man his dignity with respect to the principle of "ZO KWE ZO" enunciated by the Founder of the Central African Republic Barthélemy BOGANDA'. {{cite book|last=Heyns|first=Christoph (ed.)|authorlink=|year=1999|title=Human Rights Law in Africa|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|location=[[The Hague]]|isbn=90-411-0287-6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, he was looking for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks within the [[French Union]] rather than independence, at least for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;He declared MESAN's goal was "to promote the political, economic and social evolution of black Africa, to break down the barriers of tribalism and racism, to replace the degrading notion of colonial subordination with the more human ones of fraternity and cooperation." National Assembly of France biography. He also declared that MESAN "aims to develop and liberate the black race by progressive and pacific evolution, achieved by the combined efforts of all negroes throughout the world. Each ethnic or administrative group, each family, clan or tribe, each district, region, division, province or department, each territory, each federation, will organise its own branches, federations and committees." Kalck (1971), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He demarginalised large masses of people—women, youth, workers, poor cultivators—with the intent of unleashing the creativity of the Oubanguian people by placing them centre stage in the making of their country's history.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Gardinier, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Gaulle and Boganda.jpg|thumb|Boganda (right) receiving Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle in Brazzaville in 1958 to discuss the political future of Oubangui-Chari]]
The movement was more popular among villagers than among ''[[évolué]]'' townsmen, whom Boganda considered servile and to whom he applied the derogatory term "''Mboundjou-Voko''" ("Black-Whites").&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he created the Intergroupe Liberal Oubanguien (ILO) in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed to elect an equal number of black and white politicians to the assembly, so that a united [[electoral college]] could be established.&lt;ref name="Kalck1971p89"&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; MESAN's activities angered the French administration and the companies trading in cotton, coffee, diamonds and other commodities. The Bangui chamber of commerce was controlled by these companies, and the men who gathered at this club strongly resented the demise of forced labour and the resultant rise of black nationalism. They hated Boganda in particular, viewing him as a dangerous revolutionary demagogue and a threat to their "free enterprise", and they resolved to get rid of him.&lt;ref name="Titley"&gt;Titley, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; They also set up local [[Rally of the French People|RPF]] branches to counter MESAN, and the presence of African Democratic Rally (RDA) in the other three territories of French Equatorial Africa posed some menace for MESAN, but by 1958, although other parties were allowed, they had been reduced to tiny groups.&lt;ref name="Kalck"&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] expressed his sympathy for Oubangui-Chari, which had supported de Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]] as early as August 1940, and refused to support the violent intrigues of the RPF against Boganda and his men. He received Boganda, by then head of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa and pushing for independence, in Paris in July 1958 and was in turn received at Brazzaville in August. The discussions there led to the General accepting Boganda's demands for independence and the endorsement of the [[French Community]] in September throughout [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boganda's attachment to his chosen calling weakened when he met and fell in love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Titley"/&gt;

===Increasing popularity and move toward autonomy===
On 29 March 1951, Boganda was sentenced to two months in prison&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; following his arrest on 10 January for "endangering the peace" after intervening in a local market dispute (the "Bokanga incident" in Lobaye).&lt;ref name="AppiahandGatesp277"&gt;Appiah and Gates, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was sentenced to 15 days in prison, but neither served their terms. On 17 June, he was [[French legislative election, 1951|re-elected]] to the National Assembly with 48% of the vote despite the obstacles placed in his way by the administration and strong opposition by the authorities, colonists, and the missions, with two prominent French candidates seeking to oust him.&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt; At this time, he emerged as an extraordinarily popular messianic folk hero and his country's leading nationalist; MESAN became the majority party in the [[Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election, 1952|Territorial Assembly elections]] in March 1952. In this period he divided his time between his coffee plantation, his emancipation work and new political positions.&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt; In April 1954, an incident that would showcase Boganda's talent and appeal with crowds erupted at [[Berbérati]]. A white public works agent, who had recently been reprimanded for his brutality toward Africans, announced that his cook and the cook's wife had died.&lt;ref name="Kalck1971p89"/&gt; A riot broke out and the governor sent in parachutists while armoured vehicles patrolled the streets. Boganda hesitated to appear in a village that was not one of his strongholds, but did so anyway and declared before the rioters that justice would be the same for blacks and whites. Upon hearing Boganda's words, the crowd became calm and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Barthélemy Boganda's proposed United States of Latin Africa.png|thumb|250px|Map of the proposed [[United States of Latin Africa]]: the Central African Republic alongside the present-day states of [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]] and [[Rwanda]].]]
He played a crucial role at the beginning of internal autonomy (1956–1958), although the relatively conservative Boganda remained sympathetic to French interests and still did not advocate immediate independence.&lt;ref&gt;Appiah and Gates, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As late as April 1958, with the [[French Fourth Republic]] in its death throes, he formed part of a majority of African francophone leaders who still sought associational formulae that would somehow preserve viable links between France and its African empire. For them, "independence" meant autonomy within some form of French political community, not complete rejection of France and all it had meant for them. This is not entirely surprising, as these leaders had participated in the Republic's birth, helped write its constitution and laws, and participated in its legislatures and political parties. Le Vine, pp. 122, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; For Boganda, the [[French legislative election, 1956|1956 election]], in which he took 89% of the vote against another Oubanguian, was an uncontested speaker's platform with which the colonial administration had come to terms; the French had realised that opposing him would be dangerous and sought to accommodate him. That year he agreed to European representation on election lists in exchange for the financial support of French business leaders, and on 18 November, was elected as the first mayor of Bangui. On 31 March 1957, MESAN won all seats in the [[Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election, 1957|Territorial Assembly election]]; on 18 June, Boganda was elected president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa (a forum he used to broadcast his views on African unity)&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and in May was appointed vice-president of the Oubangui-Chari Government Council (the French governor was still its president).&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pragmatist, Boganda spoke before the local assembly on 30 December 1957 in praise of the new Comité de Salut Economique, which envisioned joint administration of the economy between French colonials and MESAN territorial councilors (he called it "the union of capital and Oubanguian labour"), but lack of French investment and opposition by Oubanguians soon led him to turn away from the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; With the numerous declarations of independence being made in much of Francophone Africa, Boganda advised that an independent Oubangui-Chari would face major economic problems from the onset. Instead, he advocated the independence of all of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and its integration into a [[United States of Latin Africa]] comprising the former French, Belgian, and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonies of Central Africa;&lt;ref name="AppiahandGatesp277"/&gt; he intended for Oubangui-Chari to become a federal unit within that structure. However, such a federation proved unrealistic, foundering on the rocks of regional jealousy and personal ambition,&lt;ref&gt;On 28 September, at Boganda's call, 98% of Oubanguian voters endorsed a referendum establishing the [[French Community]]. However, it emerged at the Brazzaville Conference of 24–25 November that the leaders of Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, and above all Gabon (which had seen its revenues transferred for the development of the Middle Congo) were determined to go it alone, and their nations became autonomous republics within the French Community on 28 November 1958. Kalck (2005), p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and Boganda came to accept a constitution covering only Oubangui-Chari as the Central African Republic. Thus, after 1 December 1958, when Boganda declared the establishment of the Central African Republic as an autonomous member of the French Community, the name was applied only to the former Oubangui-Chari.&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"/&gt; On 8 December, the CAR's first government came into being with Boganda as prime minister; a French governor remained in the country but was now called high commissioner. The new government began by adopting a law banning nudity and vagabondage, Boganda's missionary education still showing through.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"/&gt; Its main task, however, was to draw up a constitution, which was democratic and modelled to some extent on that of France; this was approved by the assembly on 16 February 1959. Formal independence came later, on 13 August 1960.&lt;ref name="StateDept"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Central African Republic (03/08) |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4007.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=March 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306025418/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4007.htm| archivedate= 6 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and aftermath===
Boganda was poised to become the first president of the independent CAR when he boarded a plane at Berbérati for a flight to Bangui on 29 March 1959, just prior to legislative elections. The aircraft exploded in midair over Boukpayanga in the [[Sub-prefectures of the Central African Republic|sub-prefecture]] of [[Boda, Lobaye|Boda]] (about {{convert|160|km|mi|-1}} west of Bangui), killing all passengers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Aboard were four crew and five passengers, including the government's information chief and a member of parliament. {{cite news |last= |first= |title=African Leader Found Dead in Crashed Plane |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=1 April 1959|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prunierp103"&gt;Prunier, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; No clear cause has ever been ascertained for the mysterious crash&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"/&gt; and no commission of inquiry was ever formed;&lt;ref name="Prunierp103"/&gt; sabotage was widely suspected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Prunier]] footnotes his statement, "the probability of foul play was very high", saying, without a direct accusation, "The whites who worked for what was left of the Grandes Compagnies Concessionaires hated Boganda, who had been instrumental in finally getting compulsory labor outlawed in 1946.  They also hated his intelligence, which was unsettling to their view of black inferiority." Prunier, pp. 103 &amp; 393&lt;/ref&gt; The nation was shocked at the death of its revered leader, whose funeral on 2 April at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Bangui saw a great outpouring of grief from thousands of Oubanguians.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 May edition of the Paris weekly ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' revealed that experts had found traces of explosive in the wreckage, but the French high commissioner banned the sale of that magazine edition when it appeared in the CAR. Many suspected that expatriate businessmen from the Bangui chamber of commerce, possibly aided by the French secret service, played a role.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"/&gt; Michelle Jourdain was also suspected of being involved: by 1959, relations between Boganda and his wife had deteriorated, and he thought of leaving her and returning to the priesthood. She had a large insurance policy on his life, taken just days before the accident. According to Brian Titley, author of ''Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa'', there are good reasons for suspecting her involvement in the plane crash.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"&gt;Titley, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abel Goumba]], the vice-premier and finance minister whom Titley describes as "intelligent, honest, and strongly nationalistic",&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as Boganda's logical successor. However, his close confidant and cousin, interior minister [[David Dacko]], more likely to lead a regime deferential to foreign interests, was backed by the high commissioner, Colonel Roger Barberot, with the support of the chamber of commerce and Michelle Jourdain.&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (1971), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus brushed aside Goumba and by 1962 had shut down the opposition, with MESAN becoming the country's single party.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The events after Boganda's death are strongly evocative of other French efforts to maintain economic domination by ensuring that compliant leaders came to power in its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It also robbed the country of a charismatic leader in the [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny|Houphouët-Boigny]] or [[Léopold Sédar Senghor|Senghor]] mould, whose prestige alone might have sufficed to retain civilian rule, which ended when Bokassa deposed the unpopular Dacko in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Boganda 1959 stamp.jpg|thumb|200px|His country's first postage stamp, from 1959, features Boganda flanked by his design for the [[flag of the Central African Republic]]. He combined the red, white and blue of the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] with the [[Pan-African colours]]: red, green and yellow.]]
Boganda is not only considered the hero and father of his nation but also as one of the great leaders of [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization in Africa]]; the historian Georges Chaffard described him after his death as "the most prestigious and the most capable of Equatorial political men,"&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p27"/&gt; while political historian [[Gérard Prunier]] called him "probably the most gifted and most inventive of French Africa's decolonization generation of politicians."&lt;ref&gt;Prunier, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the places named after him are an avenue in Bangui, one of the city's largest high schools, a Château Boganda and [[Barthélemy Boganda Stadium]]. 29 March, the anniversary of his death, is Boganda Day, a public holiday. Boganda was also the designer of the [[flag of the Central African Republic]], originally intended for the [[United States of Latin Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalck (2005), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boganda is one in a long line of African political leaders who, in an attempt to develop specifically national political cultures, were presented (or presented themselves) as the great national leader, glorified and sometimes nearly deified. They were hailed as the fathers of their nations and considered wise in the ways of understanding the best interests of their peoples. Others who became particular objects of hero-worship include [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], [[Modibo Keïta]], [[Léon M'ba]] and [[Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly]].&lt;ref name="Le Vinep106"&gt;Le Vine, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Boganda did little to discourage wide circulation of tales about his supernatural powers, putative invulnerability and even immortality. Shortly before his death, a large crowd waited on the shore of the [[Ubangui River]] to see him cross by walking upon the waters. He did not show up, but apparently a good many people still believed that he could have made the miraculous crossing.&lt;ref name="Le Vinep106"/&gt; More than just a charismatic political leader, he was seen as the "black Christ", a great religious figure endowed with extraordinary powers. Along with [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]]'s [[Fulbert Youlou]], who remained a priest while president, Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he unabashedly used the enormous popular respect for the Church and the cloth to political advantage. He successfully manipulated religious symbols (clerical garb, crosses, baptism, disciples, acolytes, etc.) for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he died, his mystique grew: he was a national martyr, and miracles were regularly attributed to him. The Boganda myth continues to exercise a strong hold on many people in the CAR, and it has frequently been used by his successors in their appeals for national unity. Those who were related to him even tenuously, such as Bokassa (who was from the same village and minority ethnic group, was the son of his mother's uncle, justified his coup using Boganda's name and created a cult of Boganda as founder of the party and state),&lt;ref name="Kalck"/&gt; or Dacko (who posed as the ideological successor of Boganda by championing for "national reconciliation" during the [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1981|1981 election]])&lt;ref&gt;Titley, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; were able to capture some of his aura and use it to their advantage.&lt;ref name="Titleyp16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Vinep106"/&gt;

James Larson further defined collective induction tasks as "[tasks] in which problem solvers work cooperatively to induce a general rule or principle that can account [[parsimoniously]] for a given set of facts or observations" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larson|first=James|title=In Search of Synergy in Small Group Performance|year=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8058-5943-0|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;     This particular process has been used to determine if groups are better problem solvers than individuals.

'''Rule Induction Tasks'''

The most frequently used collective induction task is a task that requires participants to discern the [[pattern]] that a particular series of [[playing cards]] are laid in.  The task experimenter first generates a rule about how cards should be laid.  The rule may be determined based on any facet of the cards.  For example, the pattern could be two red cards followed by a spade.  The experimenter begins by laying a card that fits the rule.  Then group members make suggestions for what card should be laid next.  If the card fits the pattern, the experimenter places the card to the right of the previous correctly laid card.  If the card does not fit the pattern, then the experimenter places it below the previous card.  Participants work to discern the pattern.  After ten rounds, participants are asked to propose their [[hypothesis]] about what the rule could be. Some modifications to this procedure have been used.  For example, in some variations, groups are allowed to put forth multiple hypotheses and use multiple card displays &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=Magley, Shupe|title=Positive and negative hypothesis testing by cooperative groups|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=1997|volume=69|pages=265–275|doi=10.1006/obhd.1997.2687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, less widely used collective induction task also involves cards.  In this task, four cards are used with the letters A or D on one side of the card and the numbers 4 or 7 on the other side.  The cards are placed on the table to show one face of each letter and number.  Participants are asked to determine the minimum number of cards they will need to turn over in order to determine if cards with vowels always have even numbers on their opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wason |first=P. C. |chapter=Reasoning |title=New Horizons in Psychology |year=1966 |editor=B. Foss |pages=135–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Do groups perform better than individuals?'''

This question has been tested by comparing group [[performance]] to the performance of individuals alone or in a [[Nominal group technique|nominal group]], a group of individuals whose performance is grouped together even though they did not work together.&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;{{cite book|last=Larson|first=James|title=In Search of Synergy in Small Group Performance|year=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8058-5943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if groups of four worked on a task together, then researchers could see if they performed better than individuals by randomly combining the efforts of four individuals who worked on the same task independently.  This allows researchers to assess the potential gains or losses caused by group interaction while recognizing that more people working on a task may be more likely to arrive at the solution by random chance.  Group performance is compared against both the best performing individual in each nominal group (thus answering the question, "do groups perform better than all individuals?") and the average of all individual performances ("do groups perform better than average?").  Several experiments have sought to address this question and results have consistently suggested that groups perform better than the average individual though not as well as the best individual in nominal groups.

The first researchers to test if group performance is better than individual performance were Laughlin and Shippy in 1983.&lt;ref name=Larson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=Shippy|title=Collective induction|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1983|volume=45|pages=94–100|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that groups performed better than individuals, proposing more plausible hypotheses and finding the correct rule with fewer rounds than individuals.  However, this does not address whether individuals working cooperatively can perform better than the best member of a similarly sized nominal group.  This was tested in three separate experiments by Laughlin and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=Bonner, Altermatt|title=Collective versus individual induction with single versus multiple hypotheses|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=75|pages=1481–1489|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.6.1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|author2=VanderStoep, Hollingshead|title=Collective versus individual induction: Recognition of truth, rejection of error, and collective information processing|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|pages=50–67|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.1.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these studies, results indicated that groups working cooperatively performed about as well as the best individual in each nominal group and significantly better than the second, third, and worst members of the nominal group.  No study to date has shown that groups perform better than the best member of a nominal group.&lt;ref name=Larson /&gt;

'''Twelve Postulates of Collective Induction Tasks'''

As noted by Patrick Laughlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laughlin|first=Patrick|title=Group Problem Solving|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14790-1|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are twelve postulates of collective induction tasks.  These rules are the result of years of research on collective induction tasks with groups and were originally published in the journal [[Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughlin|first=Patrick|title=Collective Induction: Twelve Postulates|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=1999|volume=80|issue=1|pages=50–69|doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2854}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These twelve postulates compose a theory of collective induction.&lt;ref name=Laughlin /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">A '''conservation management system''' (CMS) is a procedure for maintaining a species or habitat in a particular state. It is a means whereby humankind secures wildlife in a favourable condition for contemplation, education or research, in perpetuity.  It is an important topic in [[cultural ecology]], where conservation management counterbalances the unchecked exploitative management of natural resources.  Conservation management systems are vital for turning [[sustainable development]] strategies into successful operations.

In New Zealand the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] develops conservation management strategies in conjunction with the community as a means of prioritising conservation issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/getting-involved/consultations/conservation-management-strategies/how-the-strategies-are-developed/|title=Developing conservation management strategies: Consulting|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation management has historically adopted ideals deriving from 3 discursive approaches: the classic approach, populist approach, and neoliberal approach. All three approaches have differing ideas about the nexus of conservation and development and their potential interactions. 
* The Classic Approach understands local people to be a threat environmental conservation and therefore people occupying landed intended for conservation have historically and presently been evicted from their land. 
* The Populist Approach understands that conservation requires the participation and the empowerment of local people in order to reach both social and environmental aims. 
* The Neoliberal Approach sees the need for value to be placed on biodiversity in order for conservation to be incorporated in the economic systems and be successful as a tool of economic development&lt;ref&gt;Brown, K. (2002). Innovations for Conservation and Development. The Geographical Journal,168(1), 6-17. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/3451218 &lt;/ref&gt;.

National Parks are heavily managed conservations areas. The approach adopted by a conservation authority will influence the management of a Park and dictate how the park authorities view the role of the park and the relationship visitors may have with it.  
An example of a park adopting a populist approach is the [[Rouge National Urban Park]] located in Canada’s largest city [[Toronto]]. Though controlled by the Government of Canada through Parks Canada, the Rouge National Urban Park encourages the community to access the park to learn, play and live. The complexity of the Park being in a large metropolitan city has meant that [[Parks Canada]] has incorporated the surrounding communities into the planning, implementation, and management of the park. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/on/rouge/info/~/media/028EC69FE3264676AD660595012FED36.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">{{distinguish|text=[[Winding number]] or [[degree of a continuous mapping]], sometimes called "covering number" or "engulfing number"}}

In mathematics, a '''covering number''' is the number of spherical [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]s of a given size needed to completely cover a given space, with possible overlaps. Two related concepts are the ''packing number'', the number of disjoint balls that fit in a space, and the ''metric entropy'', the number of points that fit in a space when constrained to lie at some fixed minimum distance apart.

== Definition ==

Let (''M'', ''d'') be a [[metric space]], let ''K'' be a subset of ''M'', and let ''r'' be a positive [[real number]]. Let ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') denote the [[Ball (mathematics)#Balls in general metric spaces|ball]] of radius ''r'' centered at ''x''. A subset ''C'' of ''M'' is an ''r-external covering'' of ''K'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \cup_{x \in C} B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, for every &lt;math&gt;y\in K&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;x\in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq r&lt;/math&gt;.

If furthermore ''C'' is a subset of ''K'', then it is an ''r-internal covering''.

The '''external covering number''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum cardinality of any external covering of ''K''. The '''internal covering number''', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum cardinality of any internal covering.

A subset ''P'' of ''K'' is a ''packing'' if &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq K&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;\{B_r(x)\}_{x \in P}&lt;/math&gt; is [[pairwise disjoint]]. The '''packing number''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{pack}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the maximum cardinality of any packing of ''K''.

A subset ''S'' of ''K'' is ''r''-''separated'' if each pair of points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'' satisfies ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ ''r''. The '''metric entropy''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{met}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the maximum cardinality of any ''r''-separated subset of ''K''.

== Examples ==
1. The metric space is the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of real numbers whose absolute value is at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an external covering of &lt;math&gt;\lceil 2k/r \rceil&lt;/math&gt; intervals of length &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, covering the interval &lt;math&gt;[k,-k]&lt;/math&gt;. Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq (2 k / r)&lt;/math&gt;

2. The metric space is the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Euclidean metric]].
&lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a set of vectors whose length (norm) is at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; lies in a ''d''-dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then:&lt;ref name=book14&gt;{{Cite Shai Shai 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}}
:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq (2 k \sqrt{d}/r)^d&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The metric space is the space of real-valued functions, with the [[l-infinity]] metric.
The covering number &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;
is the smallest number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; 
such that, there exist &lt;math&gt;h_1,\ldots,h_k \in K&lt;/math&gt;
such that, for all &lt;math&gt;h\in K&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the supremum distance between &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt;
is at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
The above bound is not relevant since the space is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional.
However, when &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact set]], every covering of it has a finite sub-covering, 
so &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref name=book12&gt;{{Cite Mehryar Afshin Ameet 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

== Properties ==

1. The internal and external covering numbers, the packing number, and the metric entropy are all closely related. The following chain of inequalities holds for any subset ''K'' of a metric space and any positive real number ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tao|first1=Terrance|title=Metric entropy analogues of sum set theory|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/metric-entropy-analogues-of-sum-set-theory/|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{met}}_{2 r}(K) \leq N^{\text{pack}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{int}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{met}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;

2. Each function except the internal covering number is non-increasing in ''r'' and non-decreasing in ''K''. The internal covering number is monotone in ''r'' but not necessarily in ''K''.

The following properties relate to covering numbers in the standard [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=book14/&gt;{{rp|338}}

3. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are translated by a constant vector &lt;math&gt;k_0\in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then the covering number does not change.

4. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are multiplied by a scalar &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_{|k|\cdot r}(k\cdot K) = N^{\text{ext}}_{r}(K)&lt;/math&gt;

5. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are operated by a [[Lipschitz function]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with [[Lipschitz constant]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_{|k|\cdot r}(\phi\circ K) \leq N^{\text{ext}}_{r}(K)&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to machine learning ==
Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a space of real-valued functions, with the [[l-infinity]] metric (see example 3 above).
Suppose all functions in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are bounded by a real constant &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, the covering number can be used to bound the [[generalization error]]
of learning functions from &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
relative to the squared loss:&lt;ref name=book12/&gt;{{rp|61}}

::&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Prob}\big[
\sup_{h\in K}|\text{GeneralizationError}(h)-\text{EmpiricalError}(h)|\geq \epsilon
\big]
\leq
N^{\text{int}}_r(K)\cdot 2\exp{-m\epsilon^2 \over 2M^4}
&lt;/math&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;r={\epsilon \over 8M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of samples.

'''DPSIR''' (drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention) is a causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment: [[Human impact on the environment]] and vice versa because of the [[interdependence]] of the components.

== Description ==

This framework has been adopted by the [[European Environment Agency]]. The components of this model are:
* '''D'''riving forces: e.g. [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[economic growth]]
* '''P'''ressures: e.g. [[pollution]], [[land-use change]], [[population growth]]
* '''S'''tates : e.g. [[water quality]], [[soil quality]], [[air quality]], [[habitat]], [[vegetation]]
* '''I'''mpacts : e.g. ill [[public health]], [[habitat fragmentation]], [[economic crisis]], [[environmental damage]], [[biodiversity loss]]
* '''R'''esponses : e.g. [[tax]]es, [[environmental law]]s, 

This framework is an extension of the pressure-state-response model developed by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a first step, data and information on all the different elements in the DPSIR chain is collected. Then possible connections between these different aspects are postulated. Through the use of the DPSIR modelling framework, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of responses put into place.

The '''Dalit Bahujan Shramik Union (DBSU)''' is a [[Dalit]]-[[Bahujan]] civil rights organization locally coordinated from Gandhinagar, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], Andhra Pradesh, [[South India]].

==Origins==
The DBSU was previously known as the Andhra Pradesh Dalit Bahujan Vyavasaya Vruthidharula Union (APDBVVU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianaidconnect.org/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_73530 Attack on Dalits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928171238/http://www.christianaidconnect.org/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_73530 |date=September 28, 2007 }} at ChristianAidConnect.org Retrieved April 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a conglomeration of various Dalit-Bahujan owned and managed community-based organisations across [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is dedicated to Damodaram Sanjeevaiah (former Chief Minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and President of [[All India Congress Committee|AICC]]) and Shyam Sundar. Its vision is "equal opportunities for all to identity, security, livelihoods and future."
==''Kartavyam'' (Task)==
To defend and expand ''dalit bahujan'' (DB) right to land, livelihoods and self-respect through sustained public action ensuring equal participation of women.
==About==
DBSU works in 16 districts of [[Andhra Pradesh]] with 550,000 DB families, establishing an efficient structure with equal participation of women. They possess legal ownership of 25,000&amp;nbsp;acres (100&amp;nbsp;km²) of land, while utilizing government programmes to further public safety and secure civil rights.  In panchayati raj DBSU has become a viable political force, working so others can live with dignity.

==Interventions==
* Efficient structure established with equal women's participation and effective leadership from Village to State, protecting rights of the DB, supporting livelihood opportunities and self dignity.
* Food security of 25,000 DB families established with at least {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} of land assigned and ownership rights and development.
* Using available Government plans, including Supreme Court directives regarding basic food rights, one lakh DB families were guaranteed an additional 100 days of employment per year with minimum wages.
* DBSU members of the 16 districts are asserting and protecting their rights by raising awareness of the various Acts related to child  labour, bonded labour, [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989]]&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR Article (1990)[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rsd/rsddocview.html?tbl=jghr43uytuyt6564567 jghjkk RSDLEGAL&amp;id=3ae6b52a1c Research/Evaluation  - Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (No.33 of 1989)]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''UNHCR''. Retrieved April 22, 2006. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other right protection Acts like right to information, etc.
* In 16 districts DB is politically aware of their rights and responsibilities, gained political authority and positions and supporting the socio-economic and political development of the DB.
* DBSU has established connections with many movements and organizations, from mandal to state and national levels, influencing policy on employment, political rights, self-dignity, and public safety.

==Administration==
The DBSU is headed by a State Committee, operating through a General Secretary and an Organising Secretary elected for a term of two years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14660">'''Daniel Spoerri''' (born 27 March 1930 in [[Galați]]) is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] artist and writer born in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wieland Schmied]] and Daniel Spoerri, ''Daniel Spoerri: Coincidence as Master = Le Hasard comme maître = Der Zufall als Meister = Il caso come maestro'', [[Bielefeld]], Germany, 2003 at p. 8, hereinafter "Schmied and Spoerri"&lt;/ref&gt; Spoerri is best known for his "snare-pictures," a type of [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] or object art, in which he captures a group of objects, such as the remains of meals eaten by individuals, including the plates, silverware and glasses, all of which are fixed to the table or board, which is then displayed on a wall. He also is widely acclaimed for his book, ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard'' (''An Anecdoted Topography of Chance''), a literary analog to his snare-pictures, in which he mapped all the objects located on his table at a particular moment, describing each with his personal recollections evoked by the object. [[Image: Daniel Spoerri (1995).png|thumb|right|300px |Daniel Spoerri with snare-picture.]]

== Early life==
[[File:Daniel Spoerri-by Lothar Wolleh.jpg|thumb|240px|Portrait of Daniel Spoerri, Milan, Photo: [[Lothar Wolleh]]]]
Spoerri was born '''Daniel Isaac [[Feinstein]]''', on 27 March 1930, in [[Galați]], Romania. Although his father, '''Isaac Feinstein''', had converted to [[Christianity]], after Romania entered the War on the side of Nazi Germany he was arrested and killed in 1941. His mother, born '''Lydia Spoerri''', was Swiss and was therefore able to emigrate with her family of 6 children to Switzerland in 1942. There, he was adopted by his maternal uncle Professor [[Theophil Spoerri]] and registered as Daniel Spoerri, a name he has retained.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied and Spoerri, supra, at p. 8; Spoerri, ''An Anecdoted Topography of Chance (Re-Anecdoted Version)'', New York, 1966, p. 175, hereinafter "Spoerri 1966".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theophil Spoerri, ''Lydias Dankhefte: Ein Sohn auf den Spuren seiner Mutter'', Theodor Boder Verlag, Mumpf (Suisse), 2014, 304 pages, {{ISBN|9783905802542}}, pp. 16-25 [https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=3905802546]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s he was active in dance, studying classical dance with [[Olga Preobrajenska]] and in 1954 becoming the lead dancer at the State Opera of [[Bern]], Switzerland. He later staged several avant-garde plays including [[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco]]'s ''[[The Bald Soprano]]'' and [[Picasso]]'s surrealist ''[[Desire Trapped by the Tail]].'' During that period he met a number of [[Surrealist]] artists, including [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]], and also a number of artists subsequently associated with the [[Fluxus]] movement, including [[Robert Filliou]], [[Dieter Roth]] and [[Emmett Williams]]. In the late 1950s, Spoerri married Vera Mertz.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied and Spoerri, supra, at p. 144; Spoerri 1966, supra, at p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions MAT ==
In 1959 Spoerri founded Editions MAT ("Multiplication d'art Transformable"), a venture which produced and sold copies of three-dimensional constructed artworks by artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Dieter Roth, Jean Tinguely and [[Victor Vasarely]]. One of the best known works produced by Editions MAT was [[Man Ray]]'s [[Object to Be Destroyed|Indestructible Object]]. Spoerri is credited with coining the term "multiples" for such works.&lt;ref&gt;Judith E. Stein, Art in America, July, 2002; Effie Stephano, "Multiples:The First Decade by John L. Tancock" (review) in Leonardo, Vol. 7, no. 1 (Winter 1974), at p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Snare-Pictures (Tableau Pièges) ==
In 1960, Spoerri made his first "snare-picture". Spoerri later explained snare-pictures as follows: "objects found in chance positions, in order or disorder (on tables, in boxes, drawers, etc.) are fixed (‘snared’) as they are. Only the plane is changed: since the result is called a picture, what was horizontal becomes vertical. Example: remains of a meal are fixed to the table at which the meal was consumed and the table hung on the wall." His first "snare-picture",  ''Kichka's Breakfast'' was created from his girlfriend's leftover breakfast. The piece is now in the collection in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Spoerri 1966, supra, at p. 181. They are referred to as "trap pictures" in Schmied and Spoerri, supra, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; One snare-picture, made in 1964, consists of the remains of a meal eaten by Marcel Duchamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artcurial.com/pdf/presse/2008/r1419_en.pdf |title=Auction by Artcurial - Briest Le Fur Poulain F.

== ''An Anecdoted Topography of Chance'' ==
[[Image:Spoerri1.jpg|thumb|right|300px |Portion of map of objects on table, ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard''.]] In connection with a one-man show of his snare-pictures at the Galerie Lawrence in Paris in 1962, Spoerri wrote his ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard'' (Anecdoted Topography of Chance). Spoerri was then living at the Hotel Carcassone in Paris, in room number 13 on the fifth floor. To the right of the entrance door was a table which his wife Vera had painted blue. Spoerri drew on a ‘map" the overlapping outlines of all the 80 objects that were lying on the table on 17 October 1961 at exactly 3:47&amp;nbsp;p.m. Each object was assigned a number and Spoerri wrote a brief description of each object and the memories or associations it evoked. The descriptions cross referenced other objects on the table which were related. The ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard'' was printed as a small pamphlet of 53 pages plus a fold out map and index and was distributed as an advertisement for the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Spoerri 1966, supra, at pp. xv-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard'' is more than just a catalog of random objects, however; read in its entirety, it provides a coherent and compelling picture of Spoerri's travels, friends and artistic endeavors.

''The Anecdoted Topography of Chance'' has been called a "quasi-autobiographical ''tour de force''." &lt;ref&gt;Peter Frank, ''Something Else Press: an Annotated Bibliography, 1983, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the [[Something Else Press]] in New York City published an English translation of the ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard'' by Emmett Williams, entitled ''An Anecdoted Topography of Chance (Re-Anecdoted Version)''. [[Roland Topor]] added sketches of each object and additional annotations were added "at random" by Williams and others and by Spoerri himself. A number of appendices were added to the work and a greatly expanded index. The ''Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard'' became a cult classic and was published in German translation by Dieter Roth in 1968 as ''Anekdoten zu einer Topographie des Zufalls''. Roth increased in fact the volume of the book by almost a third by adding his own poetic annotations. In 1990, the original French version was reprinted by the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris, and in 1995, an expanded English version was published by the [[Atlas Press]] in London, with additional material and annotations, and all of Dieter Roth's texts.

== New Realism ==
Spoerri was one of the original signers of the manifesto creating the [[Nouveau réalisme]] (New Realism) art movement, an avant garde endeavor begun in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;with Yves Klein, Arman, Cesar, Gerard Deschamps, jacques Villegle, Niki De Saint Phalle .[http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-newrea-EN/ENS-newrea-EN.htm New Realism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114124219/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-newrea-EN/ENS-newrea-EN.htm |date=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of everyday life as the main subject-matter of his art reflects his involvement in the New Realism movement.

== Fluxus ==
Spoerri is also closely associated with the [[Fluxus]] art movement, a movement formed in the early 1960s, "characterized by a strongly [[Dadaist]] attitude, [whose] participants were a divergent group of individualists whose most common theme was their delight in spontaneity and humor." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/f/fluxus.html ArtLex on the Fluxus Movement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231051924/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/f/fluxus.html |date=2007-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that his ''Anecdoted Topography of Chance'' "seems perfectly to embody aspects of its spirit." &lt;ref&gt;Spoerri, ''An anecdoted topography of chance'', Atlas Press, London, 1995, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eat Art ==
A major theme of Spoerri's artwork is food, and he has called this aspect of his work "Eat Art." This is seen not only in his snare-pictures of eaten meals, but in a variety of other contexts. For example, in 1961 he sold in an art-gallery in Copenhagen store-bought canned food which he had signed and rubber-stamped "Attention: Work of Art." In 1963, he enacted a sort of performance art called ''Restaurant de la Galerie J'' in Paris, for which he cooked on several evenings. Art-critics took over the role of waiters, playing on the idea of the critic bringing the art to the consumers and giving them an understanding of the work. On June 18, 1968, Spoerri opened the Restaurant Spoerri in Düsseldorf, and on September 18, 1970, he opened the Eat-Art-Gallery upstairs.&lt;ref name="Stein, supra"&gt;Stein, supra.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published in 1970 a diary of his life on the Greek island of [[Symi]], in which he included numerous recipes of the dishes he ate there. Originally titled ''A Gastronomic Itinerary'',&lt;ref&gt;this was included in Spoerri's ''The Mythological Travels of a Modern Sir John Mandeville, being an account of the Magic, Meatballs and other Monkey Business Peculiar to the Sojourn of Daniel Spoerri upon the Isle of Symi, etc.'', published by Something Else Press, New York, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; it was later republished under the title ''Mythology &amp; Meatballs''.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent work ==
Spoerri continued to make snare-pictures, including snares of eaten meals, into the 1990s. He also has created assemblage works, mounting objects on reproductions of 19th century medical illustrations as backgrounds. Spoerri has also produced serigraph and bronze versions of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmeid and Spoerri, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoerri has led a nomadic life, living variously in Bern, Paris, the Greek island of Symi, Düsseldorf, Basel, Munich and Vienna.&lt;ref name="Stein, supra"/&gt; In 1997 he moved to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] town of [[Seggiano]] where he opened ''Il Giardino di Daniel Spoerri'' (the Garden of Daniel Spoerri), a sculpture garden, where works by a number of artists are displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, supra, and [http://www.danielspoerri.org/englisch/home.htm Il Giardino di Daniel Spoerri ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29315">This is a list of some [[vector calculus]] formulae for working with common [[curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear]] [[coordinate system]]s.

== Notes ==

* This article uses the standard notation [[ISO 80000-2]], which supersedes [[ISO 31-11#Coordinate systems|ISO 31-11]], for [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (other sources may reverse the definitions of ''θ'' and ''φ''):
** The  polar angle is denoted by ''θ'': it is the angle between the ''z''-axis and the radial vector connecting the origin to the point in question.
** The [[azimuth|azimuthal angle]]  is denoted by ''φ'': it is the angle between the ''x''-axis and the projection of the radial vector onto the ''xy''-plane.
* The function {{nowrap|[[atan2]](''y'', ''x'')}} can be used instead of the mathematical function {{nowrap|[[arctan]](''y''/''x'')}} owing to its [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. The classical arctan function has an image of {{nowrap|(−π/2, +π/2)}}, whereas atan2 is defined to have an image of {{nowrap|(−π, π]}}.

== Unit vector conversion formula ==
The unit vector of a coordinate parameter u is defined in such a way that a small positive change in u causes the position vector '''&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;''' to change in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\partial\boldsymbol\vec{r} \over \partial u}={\partial{s} \over \partial u}{\boldsymbol\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; where s is the arc length parameter.

For two sets of coordinate systems &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;, according to [[Differential of a function|chain rule]], &lt;math&gt;d\boldsymbol\vec{r}=\sum_{i}{\partial{\boldsymbol\vec{r}}\over\partial u_i}du_i=\sum_{i}{\partial{s}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{u_i}du_i=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}dv_j=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}\sum_{i}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}du_i=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}du_i&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let all of &lt;math&gt;du_i=0&lt;/math&gt; but one and then divide both sides by the corresponding differential of that coordinate parameter, we find:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial{s}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{u_i}=\sum_{j}{\partial{s}\over\partial v_j}{\partial{v_j}\over\partial u_i}\boldsymbol\hat{v_j}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''divergent question''' is a [[question]] with no specific answer, but rather exercises one's ability to think broadly about a certain topic.

==In education==
Popular in [[inquiry education]], divergent questions allow students to explore different avenues and create many different variations and alternative answers or scenarios. Correctness may be based on logical projections, may be contextual, or arrived at through basic knowledge, conjecture, inference, projection, creation, intuition, or imagination. These types of questions often require students to analyze, synthesize, or evaluate a knowledge base and then project or predict different outcomes.

A simple example of a divergent question is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Write down as many different uses as you can think of for the following objects: (1) a brick, (2) a blanket.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries.

Efficiency is very often confused with [[effectiveness]]. In general, efficiency is a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of useful output to total input.  Effectiveness is the simpler concept of being able to achieve a desired result, which can be expressed quantitatively but doesn't usually require more complicated mathematics than addition. Efficiency can often be expressed as a percentage of the result that could ideally be expected, for example if no energy were lost due to friction or other causes, in which case 100% of fuel or other input would be used to produce the desired result.  This does not always apply, not even in all cases in which efficiency can be assigned a numerical value, e.g. not for [[specific impulse]].

A common but confusing way of distinguishing between efficiency and effectiveness is the saying "Efficiency is doing things right, while effectiveness is doing the right things."  This saying indirectly emphasizes that the selection of objectives of a production process is just as important as the quality of that process. This saying popular in business however obscures the more common sense of "effectiveness", which would/should produce the following mnemonic: "Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is getting things done." This makes it clear that effectiveness, for example large production numbers, can also be achieved through inefficient processes if, for example, workers are willing or used to working longer hours or with greater physical effort than in other companies or countries or if they can be forced to do so. Similarly, a company can achieve effectiveness, for example large production numbers, through inefficient processes if it can afford to use more energy per product, for example if energy prices or labor costs or both are lower than for its competitors.

For example, one may measure how directly two objects are communicating: downloading music directly from a computer to a mobile device is more efficient than using a mobile device's microphone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-10|title=Microphone|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microphone&amp;oldid=784923957|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to record music sounds that come from a computer's speakers.

Efficiency is often measured as the ratio of useful output to total input, which can be expressed with the mathematical formula ''r''=''P''/''C'', where ''P'' is the amount of useful output ("product") produced per the amount ''C'' ("cost") of resources consumed. This may correspond to a percentage if products and [[consumables]] are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are transformed into products via a conservative process.  For example, in the analysis of the [[energy conversion efficiency]] of [[heat engine]]s in [[thermodynamics]], the product ''P'' may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable ''C'' is the amount of high-temperature heat input.  Due to the [[conservation of energy]], ''P'' can never be greater than ''C'', and so the efficiency ''r'' is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).

{{short description|}}
'''Evolutionary psychology of language''' is the study of the evolutionary history of language as a psychological faculty within the discipline of [[evolutionary psychology]]. It makes the assumption that language is the result of a [[Darwinian adaptation]].

There are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an [[adaptation]], an [[exaptation]], or a by-product. [[Heredity|Genetics]] also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the [[FOXP2]] gene may be what gives [[human]]s the ability to develop [[grammar]] and [[syntax]].

==Language evolution theories==

In the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an [[adaptation]], those who believe it is a [[by-product]] of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an [[exaptation]].

===Adaptation===
Scientist and psychologists [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the [[evolutionary psychology|psychological evolved]] traits and the [[evolutionary biology|physical evolved]] traits.&lt;ref name="Richardson 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Richardson,  | first = R. | title = The prospects for an evolutionary psychology: Human language and human reasoning |publisher = Springer | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00389658 | journal = Minds and Machines| volume =6| issue = 4| pages = 541–557| date = November 1996 | accessdate = 2 January 2014 | doi=10.1007/BF00389658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker, though he mostly agrees with [[Noam Chomsky]], a [[linguist]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientist]], in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the [[organic (model)|organic]] nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) ''Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.'' Cambridge University Press p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By-product/Spandrel===
Noam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words.&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;Chomsky, N., ''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use.'' Praeger, New York. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt; Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt;
On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2011). ''The Evolution of Language.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. p. 15. {{ISBN|052167736X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether "Language has evolved as an adaptation" as being misleading.&lt;ref name="Fitch" /&gt;
He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use [[symbolic communication]] is integrated in all other [[cognitive process]]es.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon, T. The Symbolic Species. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exaptation===
Exaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botha|first1=Rudolf P|title=How much of language, if any, came about in the same sort of way as the brooding chamber in snails?|journal=Language &amp; Communication| volume=21| issue=3|year=2001|pages=225–243|doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(01)00002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001" /&gt; The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the [[larynx]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Fitch2"&gt;Fitch, T., "Evolutionary Developmental Biology and Human Language Evolution: Constraints on Adaptation." "Evolutionary Biology". 39:4. pp. 613-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose.&lt;ref name="Fitch2" /&gt;

==Genes and language==
Research has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chater | first1 = N. | last2 = Florencia | first2 = R. | last3 = Christiansen | first3 = M. H. | year = | title = Restrictions on biological adaptation in language evolution | url = | journal = [[PNAS]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 1015–1020 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807191106 | pmc = 2633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;
 
The [[Baldwin effect]] provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;

===FOXP2 gene===
[[File:Protein FOXP2 PDB 2a07.png|thumb|Structure of the [[FOXP2]] protein. Based on [[PyMOL]] rendering of [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) 2ao9.]]
{{main|FOXP2}}
The genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works.&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff"&gt;Fisher, S.E. &amp; Scharff, C. (2009). "FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language." ''Cell Press'' pp.166-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 [[gene]] may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist [[Myrna Gopnik]] identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the [[KE family]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[language disorder]]. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]].&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff" /&gt;

This gene most likely evolved in the [[hominini|hominin]] line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby"&gt;Christianse, M. H. &amp; Kirby, S. (2004). ''Language Evolution.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a unique [[allele]] of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby" /&gt; This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution.

==Variation in human language==
In the world there are nearly 7000 languages, there is great amount of variation and this variation is thought to have come about through [[Cultural differentialism|cultural differentiation]]. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: [[founder effect]]s, [[drift (linguistics)|drift]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Levinson | first1 = SC. | last2 = Gray | first2 = RD. | title = Tools from evolutionary biology shed new light on the diversification of languages. | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–73 |date=March 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2012.01.007 | pmid = 22336727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"/&gt;

Atkinson theorized that language may have originated in [[Africa]] since [[African languages]] have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world.&lt;ref name="Bower 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bower|first1=Bruce|title=Darwin's tongues: Languages, like genes, can tell evolutionary tales|journal=Science News|volume=180| issue=11|year=2011| pages=22–25|issn=0036-8423|doi=10.1002/scin.5591801128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication in other animals==
Research indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages.&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;Hauser, M. D., et al. (2002). The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? Science 298. pp. 1569-1579.&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;
Vocal imitation is not uniquely human as well.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating.&lt;ref name="Haesler 2004"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Haesler S, Wada K, Nshdejan A, etal |title=FoxP2 expression in avian vocal learners and non-learners |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=24 |issue=13 |pages=3164–75 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15056696 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4369-03.2004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haesler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haesler S, Rochefort C, Georgi B, Licznerski P, Osten P, Scharff C |title=Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e321 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18052609 |pmc=2100148 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

[[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and [[Nim Chimpsky]] are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Berkley student. She was able to master 600 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

'''Ewa Partum''' (born 1945, [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]] near [[Warsaw]], Poland) is a poetry artist, performance artist, filmmaker, mail artist, and conceptual artist. Her involvement with [[feminist movement]]s and themes includes the [[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt; Her honors include an exhibition honoring female artists’ work at the [[Regional Contemporary Art Fund of Lorraine]] (Frac Lorraine) in [[Metz]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Prószyński, Kazimierz, Bolesław Matuszewski, and Madame Olinka. [http://monoskop.org/Poland "Poland."] Monoskop. 20 Sept. 2014. Web. 12 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Beginning in 1963, Partum studied at the State Higher School of Fine Arts in [[Łódź]]. She then went to the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw]] in 1965. She studied in the Department of Painting, where Partum was particularly interested in [[poetry]] as art, and she received her diploma in 1970.&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt; &lt;!--- commenting out close paraphrasing content -- She has been engaged in and studied linguistic activities and has taken part in linguistic actions and installations, which have been exhibited in galleries and outdoors.  One example is her [[Metaphysical_poets|meta-poetry]], which is the spreading of letters through texts from the history of literature. The female identity and how women are viewed are concepts that Partum examines through her studies and artwork.&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt;---&gt;

==Major works==
Partum engages in linguistic and performative play in an attempt to discover new artistic language. This search for a "new language" is rooted in her belief that painting has exhausted its potential to generate new or transformative ideas.&lt;ref name="Gorzodek" /&gt;

Partum's work explores issues of female identity, including the gender bias of the art world. In interviews, she speaks about the difficulties and discrimination that she has faced as a female performance artist. This bias inspired her decision to perform naked in many pieces. At one point, Partum declared she would perform naked until women in the art world obtained equal rights.&lt;ref name="Gorzodek" /&gt; In interviews, she has spoken of the naked performances, saying "In their interpretations, many critics concentrate on the use of my naked body in my actions without actually understanding that for me it was a matter of creating a sign: a sign pointing into one direction. It was a tautological and not, as so many are inclined to believe, an egocentric strategy... My naked body is merely a tool. I'm very focused, not making any spontaneous movements. When the performance is finished I bow towards my audience as a virtuoso after a concert..."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.obieg.pl/english/31894|title = On historicizing Conceptualism and the interpretation of feminism. A conversation with Ewa Partum|date = 2014-04-08|accessdate = 2015-12-20|website = OBIEG|last = Majewska|first = Karolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partum's public work began in 1969 and continued through the seventies, integrating poetry and performance. In a performance called ''Change,'' in 1974, Partum had a makeup artist work on half of her naked body in front of an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Kazmierczak, Malgorzata. [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=fd44a84c-4bba-4f6f-bc13-ce9ae90640c9&amp;articleId=5addbd5b-ead4-4ac4-8adf-a6483db47058 "Art and Documentation: English Summaries."] Google Scholars. Central and Eastern European Online Library, 2012. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She announced that she was a work of art, making her body an element of the [[feminist]] [[discourse]].  This can be used as an example of [[essentialism]], in that art is about the woman’s body, and using the body as a canvas in feminist performance.

Another work, ''Self-Identification ''(1980)'','' included photomontages of her naked figure superimposed against scenes of Warsaw, among pedestrians, next to a policewoman, and in front of the presidential place, showing the controversial nature of the naked female body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://culture.pl/en/artist/ewa-partum|title = EWA PARTUM|date = 2014-05-19|accessdate = 2014-03-07|website = CULTURE.PL|publisher = Culture.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece's title speaks to the complicated and fraught search for a female identity in a world in which the female body is often observed as a source of shock or shame.

Partum's work often focuses on the harm of traditional gender biases and expectations. For example, in ''Stupid Woman ''(1981)'' ''she performed exaggerated compliance to norms of female submissiveness and stupidity by "kiss[ing] hands of members of the audience, pour[ing] alcohol over [her] head, writ[ing] with whipped cream on the floor 'sweet art' - in other words act[ing] like a drunk and stupid woman."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In another work, ''Women, Marriage is Against You! ''(1980)'', ''she dressed in a wedding dress and wrapped herself in transparent foil, topped with a sign that said "For Men."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then, she cut through the dress and the foil, emerging naked.

Since 1971, she has been creating "Poems By Ewa," conceptual poetry in the shape of poetic objects in which she often imprints her lips. Early conceptual-poetic pieces include Active Poetry, in which Partum used the wind to scatter cut-out letters in a variety of landscapes, using their random distribution to create poetry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her later poems compose of a strong feminist and social tone, although it is never stated in a clear or obvious way to the viewer. In one of Partum’s performances during the period of martial law in 1982, she is naked and wearing red lipstick, and formed the word “Solidarnosc,” meaning solidarity, one by one with her lips on a piece of white paper.&lt;ref name="Pawel"&gt;Leszkowicz, Pawel. [http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.61faa4b4-995f-3a8e-b135-4304b41360c9 "Sex and Subversion in the Art of the People's Republic of Poland."] The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities 20 (2007): 51-85. Google Scholars. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expresses one of the themes of her work that includes parodying the manners in which women try to conform to men’s idealized expectations of them. In an exhibition on the subject of the [[Berlin Wall]], she photographs herself naked in high-heels, and holding up a big letter “O” in her right hand and a “W” in her left, signifying Ost-West Schatten, or East-West shadows.&lt;ref name="Pawel" /&gt;

Partum's films act both as documentation of her poetic and performative work and as explorations of film as a medium, in line with the structural cinema of the 1960s. For example, in ''Tautological Cinema (''a series of short films made between 1973 and 1974), Partum examines the automated nature and materiality of film.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artmuseum.pl/en/filmoteka/praca/partum-ewa-tautological-cinema|title = EWA PARTUM: Tautological Cinema|date = 2011-06-11|accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = FILMOTEKA MUZEUM|publisher = Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of one piece, ''Ten Meters of Film, ''draws a simple correlation between film length and running time, denoting on the screen the number of meters of film that have run through the projector (up to ten). Another short film display the artist's face in a variety of scenes with at least one feature obscured. The film calls into question the ability of the artist to fully communicate an idea, arguing that once the work is observed by another, the authority of the artist is lost. Of the films and of film as a medium, Partum as said, "It’s not dealing with aesthetics. It’s rather a new sort of philosophical practice that operates in the area in which the relation between the film image and the camerawork covers the whole interest in the film itself.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Partum also worked as the organizer and curator of a very influential mail art gallery from 1971 through 1977. The gallery, Galeria Address, displayed the work of Fluxus artists, and others. As part of the gallery, Partum published catalogs and books.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Partum's work was often affected by Polish censors, who refused to allows its distribution in publications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
 
==Exhibitions==
&lt;!--- commenting out close paraphrasing content --In 1972, Partum founded one of the most significant galleries of mail art and art theory, Adres, in [[Lodz]]. More exhibitions showing Partum’s work include [[Bonn_Women's_Museum|Museum of Women]] in [[Bonn]] in 1985, and an exhibition at Badischer Kunstverein in [[Karlsruhe]] in 2001, called “Act of a Thought is an Act of Art.” She was also recognized at The Legality of Space at the Wyspa Institute of Art in [[Gdansk]] and in the Self-identification in [[Krolikarnia]], which is a division of the [[National Museum in Warsaw]]. Partum's art has been included in group exhibitions in [[Spain]], [[Canada]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], [[Japan]], [[Uruguay]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]], specifically located in [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]].&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt;----&gt;In July 2013, the Frac Lorraine in [[Metz, France]]p held an exhibition entitled, “Bad Girls: A Collection in Action,” honoring female artists who dedicated their work to deconstructing established order and creating room for freedom, experience, and life, changing the audience’s vision of the future and encouraging social change.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Several retrospectives of Partum's work have occurred, including ''Ewa Partum: The Legality of Space ''at the Wyspa Institute of Art (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.itsliquid.com/ewa-partum.html|title = ewa partum – the legality of space|accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = itsliquid|publisher = itsliquid}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Partum has celebrated the work of retrospective exhibitions, in that they allow the audience and critics to "trace the genealogy of the artist's language."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In her early years of being an artists Ewa Partum became upset with the discrimination of her art for being and female artists so she began to use her naked body in her artworks. Even though Patrum knew she would receive even more discrimination for this she continued to do it because of the later message she knew it would send.

'''Gender inequality''' is the idea and situation that [[men]] and [[women]] are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their [[gender]]. It arises from differences in [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Gender systems]] are often [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.

==Natural gender differences==
{{main|Gender differences in humans}}
Natural differences exist between the sexes base on biological and anatomic factors, most notably differing reproductive roles. Biological differences include [[chromosome]]s and [[hormone|hormonal]] differences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Wood, Julia. Gendered Lives. 6th. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Watson JS, Weir J |year=1983 |title=Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/338/1/37.abstract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |pmid=6875963 |pmc=1197179 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frontera, Hughes, Lutz, Evans |year=1991 |title=A cross-sectional study of muscle strength and mass in 45- to 78-yr-old men and women |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/644 |journal =J Appl Physiol |volume=71 |issue=2|pages=644–50 |pmid=1938738|doi=10.1152/jappl.1991.71.2.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Samaras 2007 33–61"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Human body size and the laws of scaling |last= Samaras|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Nova Science|location=New York|isbn= 978-1-60021-408-0|pages= 33–61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCU0RwDI6c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women live significantly longer than men,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html|title=Life expectancy at birth, Country Comparison to the World|publisher=US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=n.d.|website=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see [[Life expectancy#gender differences|Life expectancy]].

Girls are more commonly introduced to the colour pink, dolls, dresses, and playing house where they are taking care of the dolls as if they were children. The norm of blue is for boys and pink is for girls is cultural and has not always historically been around. These paths set by parents or other adult figures in the child's life set them on certain paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordier|first=B|year=2012|title=Gender, betwixt biology and society|url=|journal=European Journal of Sexology and Sexual Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a difference in personality, career paths, or relationships.

=== Income disparities linked to job stratification ===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}} 
The gender pay gap is the average difference between men's and women's aggregate [[wage]]s or [[salary|salaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-08-01|title=Using education to reduce the wage gap between men and women|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000370|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=412–416|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.04.006|issn=1053-5357|last1=Miki|first1=Malul|last2=Yuval|first2=Fany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap is due to a variety of factors, including differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experiences, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author=CONSAD Research Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patten, Eileen|website=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/|title=On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Blau&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francine D.

[[Human capital]] theories refer to the education, knowledge, training, experience, or skill of a person which makes them potentially valuable to an employer. This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming [[deskilling|deskilled]]. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name="Stratification"&gt;Massey, Douglas. "Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System." NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to [[occupational segregation]], where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Occupational gender segregation can be understood {{who|date=October 2012}} to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

As women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the census data, women occupy the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]] jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional [[gender role]]s that causes gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles, E. Social Inequality. 6th. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US gender pay gap, by sex, race-ethnicity-2009.png|thumb|330px|Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, U.S., 2009.&lt;ref name="bls 2009"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswom2009.pdf ''Highlights of Women’s Earnings in 2009.''] Report 1025, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) 
Scholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained,&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt; while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap.&lt;ref name="CONSAD wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|author1=CONSAD research corp. |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2015 |date=12 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain "additional portions of the raw gender wage gap".

The [[glass ceiling]] effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman. "Social Forces: The Glass Ceiling Effect." Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered [[inequality in the workplace]]. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.&lt;ref name="Burstein, Paul 1994"&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Grasmuck and Rosario Espinal. "Market Success or Female Autonomy?" Sage Publications, Inc, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ Census]&lt;/ref&gt; data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, and Reeve Vanneman.

The gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.

There are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], female workers in the Gulf state of [[Bahrain]] earn 40 percent more than male workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedior.com/hr-portal/recruitment-news/women-earn-less-than-men-across-the-globe.html?c=3052 Women 'earn less than men across the globe'], Vedior, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/theresa-de-langis/what's-woman-worth-wages-and-democracy-in-cambodia|title=What's a woman worth?: wages and democracy in Cambodia|date=2015-02-01|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education and careers===
The gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence F. Katz. "On The Pill: Changing the course of women's education." The Milken Institute Review, Second Quarter 2001: p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the highly effective [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to "pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Katz |first2=Lawrence F. |year=2002 |title=The Power Of The Pill: Contraceptives And Women's Career And Marriage Decisions |url= |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |page=731 |doi=10.1086/340778|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161242/http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who "delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill ''could'' have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |year=2006 |title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education, And Family |url= |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corinne |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students |journal=PNAS |volume=109|issue= 41|pages=16474–16479|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109 |pmid=22988126 |pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes "preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles" for tenure-track positions.&lt;ref name="Williams and Ceci STEM sexism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy|last2=Stephen|first2=Ceci|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=PNAS|date=28 April 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|accessdate=30 October 2015|pmid=25870272|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;What Lies Behind Gender Inequality in Education? 2015, s.n., S.l.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer preference studies===
A 2010 study conducted by [[David R.

=== Gender roles in parenting and marriage ===
Gender roles are heavily influenced by biology, with male-female play styles correlating with sex hormones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Golombok|first2=Susan|last3=Rust|first3=John|last4=Johnston|first4=Katie J.|last5=Golding|first5=Jean|last6=Team|first6=The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Study|title=Testosterone during Pregnancy and Gender Role Behavior of Preschool Children: A Longitudinal, Population Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 January 2002|volume=73|issue=6|pages=1678–1687|jstor=3696409|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00498}}&lt;/ref&gt; sexual orientation, aggressive traits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collaer|first1=Marcia L.|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|title=Human behavioral sex differences: A role for gonadal hormones during early development?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 July 1995|volume=118|issue=1|pages=55–107|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.118.1.55|pmid=7644606|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/118/1/55/|language=English|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craft|first1=Rebecca M.|last2=Mogil|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Aloisi|first3=Anna Maria|title=Sex differences in pain and analgesia: the role of gonadal hormones|journal=European Journal of Pain|date=1 October 2004|volume=8|issue=5|pages=397–411|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.01.003|pmid=15324772|language=en|issn=1532-2149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, females with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] demonstrate increased masculinity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Brook|first2=Charles|last3=Conway|first3=Gerard S.|title=Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1 January 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=75–81|jstor=3813405|doi=10.1080/00224490409552215|pmid=15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been shown that rhesus macaque children exhibit preferences for stereotypically male and female toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/developmental_cognitive_neuroscience/toy_preferences.html |title=Yerkes - Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans |publisher=Yerkes.emory.edu |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender inequality in relationships====
Gender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Hooff|first=Jenny H.|title=Rationalising inequality: heterosexual couples' explanations and justifications for the division of housework along traditionally gendered lines|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymanowicz|first=Agata|author2=Adrian Furnham|title=Do intelligent women stay single? Cultural stereotypes concerning the intellectual abilities of men and women|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, "Has Feminism Changed Science?", she claims that "Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers," while "for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, statistics had shown that "only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts in equalizing household work====
Despite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen, and Jennifer Marshall. Issues of Gender. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"/&gt;  One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.

There was a study conducted at an "urban comprehensive school". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Gender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, "The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?" concluded by saying, "(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children." (703).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Gender inequalities in relation to technology====
One survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women.  However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities.  It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.&lt;ref&gt;Eszter Hargittai, What Causes Variation in Contributing to Participatory Web Sites?&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income.&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"/&gt; When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.

=== Property inheritance ===
Many countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/substatics/Property%20Rights%20in%20Law%20and%20Practice%20for%20Women_2011tif_wmlogo3.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], {{Quran-usc|4|11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural marginalization ===
Gender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Marginalization]] occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).

=== Gender stereotypes ===
{{main|Gender stereotypes}}
{{see also|Category:Feminism and the arts}}
Cultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these [[stereotype]]s are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} While these skills are culturally valued,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

Gender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Annual Review of Psychology Gender Stereotypes|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 69|pages = 275–298|last=Ellemers|first=Naomi|date=27 September 2017|doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719|pmid = 28961059}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender "not supposed" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family.  The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.

===Biological fertilisation stereotypes===
Bonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=London|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0674005440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the "passive" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)

===Sexism and discrimination===
Gender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of [[sexism]]. [[Discrimination]] takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.

Discrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only seven women producers have won the Best Picture category (all of whom were co-producers with men), and only eight women have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. [[Lina Wertmuller]] (1976), [[Jane Campion]] (1994), [[Sofia Coppola]] (2004), and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. 77%  of the Academy Awards' voters are male.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"/&gt;

A group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/02/harvard-edcast-ask-more-him|title=Harvard Edcast Ask More of Him|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place... After all, the vast majority of sexual harassment, abuse and violence is perpetrated by men, whether in Hollywood or not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-arquette-david-schwimmer-join-hollywood- men-activists-launch-askmoreofhim-campaign-1090121|title=David Schwimmer Join Hollywood Men and Activists to Launch #AskMoreOfHim Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accountability is set to change the way women are seen and treated in the film and television industry, hopefully ending in the closing of the gap women are experiencing in pay, promotion, and overall respect. This initiative was created in response to the #MeToo movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=Politics Turning Corner on Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The #MeToo movement, started by a single tweet, asked women to share their stories of sexual assault against men in a professional setting. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/metoo-hashtag-becomes-anti-sexual-harassment-assault-rallying-cry-n810986|title=Me Too Anti Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one day, 30,000 women had used the hashtag sharing their stories. Many women feel as if they have more power in their voices than they ever had and are choosing to make personal claims that may have been brushed under the rug prior to the internet culture we’re now living in. According to Time Magazine, 95% of women in the film and entertainment industry admit to being sexually harassed by men in their industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/|title=Time Person of the Year 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the #MeToo movement, women in industry are using #TimesUp, with the goal of aiming to help prevent sexual harassment in the workplace for victims who cannot afford their own resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesupnow.com/|title=Times Up Now Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Impact and counteractions ==
Gender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] in society as a whole.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Nicola Jones, Rebecca Holmes, Jessica Espey 2008. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results Gender and the MDGs: A gender lens is vital for pro-poor results]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Household and intra-household knowledge and resources are key influences in individuals' abilities to take advantage of external livelihood opportunities or respond appropriately to threats.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; High education levels and social integration significantly improve the productivity of all members of the household and improve equity throughout society. Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Poverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Nicola Jones and Rebecca Holmes 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4943&amp;title=gender-politics-social-protection Gender, politics and social protection]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued{{By whom|date=March 2016}} that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue.  Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  These targets are significantly off-track.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Addressing gender inequality through [[social protection]] programmes designed to increase [[Gender equity|equity]] would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Community childcare to give women greater opportunities to seek employment
* Support parents with the care costs (e.g. South African child/disability grants)
* Education stipends for girls (e.g. Bangladesh’s Girls Education Stipend scheme)
* Awareness-raising regarding [[gender-based violence]], and other preventive measures, such as financial support for women and children escaping abusive environments (e.g. NGO pilot initiatives in Ghana)
* Inclusion of programme participants (women and men) in designing and evaluating social protection programmes
* Gender-awareness and analysis training for programme staff
* Collect and distribute information on coordinated care and service facilities (e.g. access to [[micro-credit]] and micro-entrepreneurial training for women)
* Developing monitoring and evaluation systems that include sex-disaggregated data
The ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

NGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and [[structural violence]].

During war, combatants primarily target men.  Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormhaug ''et al'' say "In a widely respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted."&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 review  of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded "It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall."&lt;ref name="Ormhaug"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Armed Conflict Deaths Disaggregated by Gender |author=Christin Ormhaug, in collaboration with Patrick Meier and Helga Hernes|publisher=PRIO|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the [[Falklands War]] 904 of the 907 dead were men.  Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.

Another opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern [[information and communication technologies]]. In a carefully controlled study,&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|date=November–December 2011|title=Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries?

Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others ([[ICT4D]]), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.

{{Main|Global Gender Gap Report}}
Gender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation.  It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}   While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rape Epidemic Raises Trauma of Congo War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/world/africa/07congo.html?ref=congothedemocratirepublicof|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filins|first=Dexter|title=A School Bus for Shamsia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23school-t.htm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]], particularly in developing countries.  The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.

===Asia===
{{See also|Sex-selective abortion}}
One example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the "[[Missing women of China|missing girls]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristoff|first=Nicholas D.|title=The Women's Crusade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|date=August 23, 2009|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income. In China, females are perceived as less valuable for labor and unable to provide sustenance." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Kevin|title=The Missing Girls from China|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Fall 2014 – Winter 2015|volume=36|issue=2|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gender inequality also reflected in educational aspect in rural China . Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannum|first=Emily|last2=Kong|first2=Peggy|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuping|title=Family sources of educational gender inequality in rural China: A critical assessment|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=29|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2009.04.007|pmid=20161037|pmc=2753976|year=2009|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12627}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.

=== Cambodia ===
A Cambodian said, "Men are gold, women are white cloth", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt; In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family. Females have a less important role, mainly to carry out domestic chores, and taking care of husbands and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coedu.usf.edu/zalaquett/mcdp/Asian%20handout.htm|title=Characteristics of  the Traditional Asian Family|website=www.coedu.usf.edu|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also the main victims of  poverty as they have little or no access to education, low pay and low chances owning assets such as lands, homes or even basic items.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt;

In Cambodia, the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) was formed in 1998 with the role of improving women's overall power and status in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The Global Gender Gap Report put out by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, [[Albania]] at 108 and [[Turkey]] at 120. The [[Nordic countries|Nordic Countries]], for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from [[Denmark]] who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Western Europe ====
[[Western Europe]], a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/home/E/europe-geographical-and-political|title=EUROPE, GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL - National Geographic Style Manual|website=stylemanual.natgeo.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. [[Portugal]] is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====
A large portion of [[Eastern Europe]], a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include [[Lithuania]], which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, [[Latvia]], which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

===India===
{{main|Gender inequality in India}}
India ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf 2011 Gender Gap Report] World Economic Forum, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on [[sex selective abortion]]. India also scores poorly on overall female to male [[literacy]] and health rankings. India with a 2013 ranking of 101 out of 136 countries had an overall score of 0.6551, while Iceland, the nation that topped the list, had an overall score of 0.8731 (no gender gap would yield a score of 1.0).&lt;ref name="Global Gender Gap Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Gender Gap Report 2013|url=http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331190253/http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequalities impact India's sex ratio, women's health over their lifetimes, their educational attainment, and economic conditions. It is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike.

The labor force participation rate of women was 80.7% in 2013.&lt;ref name=undp&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Report for 2012|url=https://data.undp.org/dataset/Table-4-Gender-Inequality-Index/pq34-nwq7|publisher=United Nations Development Project|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Lockwood of the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, in a 2009 report wrote that female labor participation is lower than men, but has been rapidly increasing since the 1990s. Out of India's 397 million workers in 2001, 124 million were women, states Lockwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is on target to meet its [[Millennium Development Goal]] of gender parity in education before 2016.&lt;ref name="in.one.un.org"&gt;http://in.one.un.org/task-teams/gender-equality-and-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  UNICEF's measures of attendance rate and Gender Equality in Education Index (GEEI) attempt to capture the quality of education.&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalther, E.

=== United States ===
{{main|Gender inequality in the United States}}
The [[World Economic Forum]] measures gender equity through a series of economic, educational, and political benchmarks.  It has ranked the United States as 19th (up from 31st in 2009) in terms of achieving gender equity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=World Economic Forum|year=2009|volume=Global Gender Gap Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Department of Labor has indicated that in 2009, "the median weekly earnings of women who were full-time wage and salary workers was... 80 percent of men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Stats on Women Workers |url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |website=U.S. Department of Labor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194948/http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice found that in 2009, "the percentage of female victims (26%) of intimate partner violence was about 5 times that of male victims (5%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The United States ranks 41st in a ranking of 184 countries on maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, below all other industrialized nations and a number of developing countries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW 2011 website|url=http://www.cedaw2010.org/index.php/about-cedaw/cedaw-by-the-numbers|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women only represent 20% of members of Congress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Political affiliations and behaviors ====
Existing research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people "Democrat" or "Republican"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|last2=Spencer|first2=Anthony T.|last3=McKee|first3=Connie|date=2014-03-15|title=Religion, Religiosity, Sex, and Willingness to Express Political Opinions: A Spiral of Silence Analysis of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.890001|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditonto|first=Tessa M.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Allison J.|last3=Redlawsk|first3=David P.|date=2013-05-14|title=Gender Stereotypes, Information Search, and Voting Behavior in Political Campaigns|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9232-6|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.

Research shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|last2=Norris|first2=Pippa|date=2000-01-01|title=The Developmental Theory of the Gender Gap: Women's and Men's Voting Behavior in Global Perspective|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale de Science Politique|volume=21|issue=4|pages=441–463|jstor=1601598|doi=10.1177/0192512100214007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Challenges to women in politics ====
Overall, [[politics in the United States]] are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere.  As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yu-Kang|date=2014|title=Gender stereotypes as a double-edged sword in political advertising Persuasion effects of campaign theme and advertising style|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|doi=10.2501/IJA-33-2-203-234|pmid=|access-date=|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics|last=Parry-Giles|first=Shawn|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being "conspicuous." When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as "deficient."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flicker|first=Eva|date=2013|title=Fashionable (dis-)order in politics: Gender, power and the dilemma of the suit|url=|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|doi=10.1386/macp.9.2.201_3|pmid=|access-date=|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Nickie|date=2014-07-01|title=Doing Gender, Practising Politics: Workplace Cultures in Local and Devolved Government|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=368–380|doi=10.1111/gwao.12042|issn=1468-0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a "double-bind" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Political knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2011-01-01|title=Do Women and Men Know Different Things? Measuring Gender Differences in Political Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=73|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1017/S0022381610000897|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpini|first=Michael|last2=Keeter|first2=Scott|year=1993|title=Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things First|jstor=2111549|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1179–1206|doi=10.2307/2111549|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a "men's game."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert G.|date=2005-12-01|title=Religion, Race, and Gender Differences in Political Ambition|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X05050154|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=null|issue=4|pages=577–596|doi=10.1017/S1743923X05050154|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=Jennifer|last2=Fox|first2=Richard|date=2008|title=Why are women still not running for public office?|url=|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|volume=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Steps needed for change ====
Several forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or "talk back" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term "undoing gender." This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging "social interactions that reduce gender difference."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some feminists argue that "undoing gender" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest "doing gender differently" by dismantling [[gender norm]]s and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through "gender-balanced decision-making," particularly at the international level, which "establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Maria|last2=Amancio|first2=Ligia|last3=Alves|first3=Helder|date=2013|title=Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgments about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas|url=|journal=Portuguese Journal of Social Science|doi=10.1386/pjss.12.2.133_1|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–149|hdl=10071/14575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on "the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience." This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|date=2013-03-01|title=A Feminist Scientific Approach to the Analysis of Politics and Gender|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X12000761|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=9|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.1017/S1743923X12000761|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the "intersection between gender and perceptions"; (2) investigating the influence of "local electoral politics"; (3) examining "gender socialization"; (4) discerning the connection "between gender and political conservatism"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Richard L.|date=2011-03-01|title=Studying Gender in U.S. Politics: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X10000589|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–99|doi=10.1017/S1743923X10000589|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11405">The '''Handschu agreement''' is a set of guidelines that regulate police behavior in [[New York City]] with regard to political activity.

==Background==
In 1971, 21 members of the [[Black Panther Party]] were tried for conspiracy to blow up police stations and department stores. They were acquitted of all charges after only 90 minutes of jury deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOkYzy4t2VEC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=1971+new+york+panther+21+acquitted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awUaLAZn0z&amp;sig=_oyKmE0C-cSVljTz7DF9PDo56S0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ShGUrm9E-GkyQGQyoHwAg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=1971%20new%20york%20panther%2021%20acquitted&amp;f=false | title =Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy | author =Joy James | author2 =''[[Duke University]]'' | isbn =978-0822339236 | pages =74 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed the extent to which the NYPD had infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on [[anti-war]] groups, [[gay rights]] activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations.&lt;ref name ="ApuzzoGoldberg"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UWBLg4JRmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20panther&amp;f=false | title =Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America | author =Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldberg| author2 =''[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'' | isbn =978-1476727936 | pages =44 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handschu agreement, or decree, was the result of a [[class-action lawsuit]] filed against the City of New York, its Police Commissioner and the Intelligence Division of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of [[Barbara Handschu]] and fifteen other [[plaintiffs]] affiliated with various political or ideological associations and organizations, known as ''Handschu v. Special Services Division'', 605 F.Supp. 1384, affirmed 787 F.2d 828.&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20070215_nycruling.pdf | title =Handschu v. Special Services Division | author =''[[New York Times]]'' | publisher =nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs claimed that "informers and infiltrators provoked, solicited and induced members of lawful political and social groups to engage in unlawful activities"; that files were maintained with respect to "persons, places, and activities entirely unrelated to legitimate law enforcement purposes, such as those attending meetings of lawful organizations"; and that information from these files was made available to academic institutions, prospective employers, licensing agencies and others. In addition, plaintiffs protested seven types of police misconduct: (1) the use of informers; (2) infiltration; (3) interrogation; (4) overt surveillance; (5) summary punishment; (6) intelligence gathering; and (7) electronic surveillance, and alleged that these police practices which punished and repressed lawful dissent had had a "chilling effect" upon the exercise of freedom of speech, assembly and association, that they violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they abridged rights of privacy and due process.&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-police-surveillance-of-political-activity-history-and-current-state-of-handschu-de| author=Arthur N. Eisenberg| title=Testimony: Police Surveillance of Political Activity -- The History and Current State of the Handschu Decree| publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the court found that police surveillance of political activity violated [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] protections of [[free speech]].&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"/&gt; This ruling resulted in a [[consent decree]] which prohibited the NYPD from engaging "in any investigation of political activity except through the … Intelligence Division [of the Police Department]" and required that any "such investigations shall be conducted" only in accordance with the Guidelines incorporated into the Decree. The Guidelines further prohibited the Intelligence Division from "commencing an investigation" into the political, ideological or religious activities of an individual or group unless "specific information has been received by the Police Department that a person or group engaged in political activity is engaged in, about to engage in or has threatened to engage in conduct which constitutes a crime…."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/nypd-intelligence-chief-agents-mosque | title =NYPD intelligence chief wanted sources in every mosque within 250 miles | author =Ryan Devereaux | publisher =theguardian.com | date =February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
According to the terms of the agreement, purely political activity can only be investigated by the Public Security Section (PSS) of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, and then only when the Section suspects criminal activity. When the PSS does suspect criminal activity on the part of political groups, it must obtain a warrant from the three-person Handschu Authority, a commission made up of two deputy commissioners and a mayor-appointed civilian.

The agreement also prohibits indiscriminate police videorecording and photographing of public gatherings when there is no indication that unlawful activity is occurring.

The department is also prohibited from sharing information pertaining to political activity with other law enforcement agencies unless those agencies agree to abide by the terms of the Handschu agreement.

The court order mandates the compiling of annual, publicly available reports listing the surveillance requests made by the NYPD and the number of such requests granted.

==Current status==
In 2002, the NYPD asked federal judge [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.]], the judge who presided over the original case, to abrogate numerous provisions of the agreement, claiming that they inhibited the department's ability to prevent future [[terrorist]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The department also requested that the function of the Handschu authority be changed to investigating complaints of constitutional violations, which would take away the authority's power to oversee political investigations.

In regards to the requested changes, Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] said, "Today we live in a more dangerous, constantly changing world, one with challenges and threats that were never envisioned when the Handschu guidelines were written."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/nyregion/threats-responses-surveillance-police-ask-change-rules-ease-restrictions.html | title =THREATS AND RESPONSES: SURVEILLANCE; Police Ask to Change the Rules and Ease Restrictions on Political Investigations | author =Kevin Flynn, Jacob H.

Chris Dunn of the New York [[American Civil Liberties Union|Civil Liberties Union]], called the proposal "troubling," stating that the NYPD "has no legitimate reason to spy on lawful political activity."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"/&gt;

Former New York City mayor [[Ed Koch]], previously a critic of police surveillance, agreed with the proposal to rescind large portions of the Handschu agreement. "That's the necessary cost of protecting the public in these times where we're dealing with terrorism," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On February 11, 2003, Haight ruled that the NYPD should be permitted to modify the 1985 Decree, but not to the extent originally requested by the City. The judge instructed the city to adapt the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations, issued by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] in May, 2002. This weakened the original decree in that a preliminary inquiry could be initiated when there is "information … which indicates the possibility of criminal activity."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;

In February 2007, [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.|Judge Haight]] ruled that the NYPD had violated the terms of the agreement by videotaping two demonstrations by advocates of the [[homeless]], one in [[Harlem]] in March 2005, the other in front of New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s house in December 2005. On June 13, 2007, Haight reversed the ruling, saying that attorneys for the city had provided new evidence indicating that the protestors may have been "disorderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''hedonic treadmill''', also known as '''hedonic adaptation''', is the observed tendency of [[human]]s to quickly return to a relatively stable level of [[happiness]] despite major positive or negative events or life changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. Brickman and Campbell coined the term in their essay "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" (1971).&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; During the late 1990s, the concept was modified by [[Michael Eysenck]], a British psychologist, to become the current "hedonic treadmill theory" which compares the [[pursuit of happiness]] to a person on a [[treadmill]], who has to keep walking just to stay in the same place.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The concept dates back centuries, to such writers as [[St. Augustine]], cited in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s 1621 ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]'': "A true saying it is, ''Desire hath no rest'', is infinite in itself, endless, and as one calls it, a perpetual rack, or horse-mill."{{synthesis inline|date=May 2016}}

The '''hedonic''' (or '''happiness''') '''set point''' has gained interest throughout the field of [[positive psychology]] where it has been developed and revised further.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; Given that hedonic adaptation generally demonstrates that a person's long-term happiness is not significantly affected by otherwise impacting events, positive psychology has concerned itself with the discovery of things that can lead to lasting changes in happiness levels.
{{Hedonism}}

==Overview==
Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the affective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness "set point", whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their environment.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brickman |last2=Campbell|title=Hedonic relativism and planning the good society|date=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=287–302}} in M.&amp;nbsp;H. Apley, ed., ''Adaptation Level Theory: A Symposium,'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt; The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness. Others conceptualize hedonic adaptation as functioning similarly to a thermostat (a [[negative feedback]] system) that works to maintain an individual's happiness set point. One of the main concerns of positive psychology is determining how to maintain or raise one's happiness set point, and further, what kind of practices lead to lasting happiness.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hedonic adaptation can occur in a variety of ways. Generally, the process involves cognitive changes, such as shifting values, goals, attention and interpretation of a situation.&lt;ref name="Frederick1999"/&gt; Further, neurochemical processes desensitize overstimulated hedonic pathways in the brain, which possibly prevents persistently high levels of intense positive or negative feelings.&lt;ref name="Solomon1974"/&gt; The process of adaptation can also occur through the tendency of humans to construct elaborate rationales for considering themselves deprived through a process social theorist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] calls "abundance denial".&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, Gregg.  ''The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse'' (Random House, 2003). {{ISBN|0812973038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theoretical approaches==

===Behavioral/psychological approach===
The "Hedonic Treadmill" is a term coined by Brickman and Campbell in their article "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" (1971), describing the tendency of people to keep a fairly stable baseline level of happiness despite external events and fluctuations in demographic circumstances.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; The idea of relative happiness had been around for decades when in 1978 Brickman et al. began to approach hedonic pleasure within the framework of Helson's adaptation level theory, which holds that perception of stimulation is dependent upon comparison of former stimulations.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt; The hedonic treadmill functions similarly to most [[adaptation]]s that serve to protect and enhance perception. In the case of hedonics, the sensitization or desensitization to circumstances or environment can redirect motivation. This reorientation functions to protect against complacency, but also to accept unchangeable circumstances, and redirect efforts towards more effective goals. Frederick and Lowenstein classify three types of processes in hedonic adaptation: shifting adaptation levels, [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], and [[sensitization]]. Shifting adaptation levels occurs when a person experiences a shift in what is perceived as a "neutral" stimulus, but maintains sensitivity to stimulus differences. For example, if Sam gets a raise he will initially be happier, and then habituate to the larger salary and return to his happiness set point. But he will still be pleased when he gets a holiday bonus. Desensitization decreases sensitivity in general, which reduces sensitivity to change.  Those who have lived in war zones for extended periods of time may become desensitized to the destruction that happens on a daily basis, and be less affected by the occurrence of serious injuries or losses that may once have been shocking and upsetting. Sensitization is an increase of hedonic response from continuous exposure, such as the increased pleasure and selectivity of connoisseurs for wine, or food.&lt;ref name="Frederick1999"/&gt;

Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman were among the first to investigate the hedonic treadmill in their 1978 study, "Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?". Lottery winners and paraplegics were compared to a control group and as predicted, comparison (with past experiences and current communities) and [[habituation]] (to new circumstances) affected levels of happiness such that after the initial impact of the extremely positive or negative events, happiness levels typically went back to the average levels.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt; This interview-based study, while not longitudinal, was the beginning of a now large body of work exploring the relativity of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Best Walking Machine aka Treadmills on Amazon

Brickman and Campbell originally implied that everyone returns to the same neutral set point after a significantly emotional life event.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; In the literature review, "Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill, Revising the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being" (2006), Diener, Lucas, and Scollon concluded that people are not hedonically neutral, and that individuals have different set points which are at least partially heritable. They also concluded that individuals may have more than one happiness set point, such as a [[life satisfaction]] set point and a [[Subjective well-being|subjective well being]] set point, and that because of this, one's level of happiness is not just one given set point but can vary within a given range. Diener and colleagues point to longitudinal and cross-sectional research to argue that happiness set point can change, and lastly that individuals vary in the rate and extent of adaptation they exhibit to change in circumstance.&lt;ref name="Diener2006"/&gt;

In a longitudinal study conducted by Mancini, Bonnano, and Clark, people showed individual differences in how they responded to significant life events, such as marriage, divorce and widowhood. They recognized that some individuals do experience substantial changes to their hedonic set point over time, though most others do not, and argue that happiness set point can be relatively stable throughout the course of an individual's life, but the life satisfaction and subjective well being set points are more variable.&lt;ref name="Mancini2011"/&gt;

Similarly, the longitudinal study conducted by Fujita and Diener (2005) described the life satisfaction set point as a "soft baseline". This means that for most people, this baseline is similar to their happiness baseline. Typically, life satisfaction will hover around a set point for the majority of their lives and not change dramatically. However, for about a quarter of the population this set point is not stable, and does indeed move in response to a major life event.&lt;ref name="Fujita2005"/&gt;
Other longitudinal data has shown that subjective well being set points do change over time, and that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable. In his archival data analysis, Lucas found evidence that it is possible for someone's subjective well-being set point to change drastically, such as in the case of individuals who acquire a severe, long term disability.&lt;ref name="Lucas2003"/&gt;  However, as Diener, Lucas, and Scollon point out, the amount of fluctuation a person experiences around their set point is largely dependent on the individual's ability to adapt.&lt;ref name="Diener2006"/&gt;

After following over a thousand sets of twins for 10 years, Lykken and Tellegen (1996) concluded that almost 50% of our happiness levels are determined by genetics.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; Headey and Wearing (1989) suggested that our position on the spectrum of the stable [[Trait theory|personality traits]] ([[Revised NEO Personality Inventory|neuroticism, extraversion, and openness]] to experience) accounts for how we experience and perceive life events, and indirectly contributes to our happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Headey|first1=Bruce|last2=Wearing|first2=Alexander J.|title=Understanding Happiness: A Theory of Subjective Well-being|date=1992|publisher=Longman Cheshire|isbn=9780582875081|url=http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/freetexts/headey_b_1992.pdf|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515202531/http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/freetexts/headey_b_1992.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on happiness has spanned decades and crossed cultures in order to test the true limits of our hedonic set point.

==Major empirical findings==
In general there is conflicting evidence on the validity of the hedonic treadmill, if people always return to a baseline level of happiness or if some events have the ability to change this baseline for good. While some researchers believe life events change people's baseline for good over the course of one's life, others believe people will always return to their baseline.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x|title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being. Does Happiness Change After Major Life Events?|author1=Richard E. Lucas|volume=16|issue=2|pages=75-79|date=April 1, 2007|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aforementioned Brickman study (1978), researchers interviewed 22 lottery winners and 29 [[paraplegia|paraplegics]] to determine their change in happiness levels due to their given event (winning lottery or becoming paralyzed). The event in the case of lottery winners had taken place between one month and one and a half years before the study, and in the case of paraplegics between a month and a year. The group of lottery winners reported being similarly happy before and after the event, and expected to have a similar level of happiness in a couple of years. These findings show that having a large monetary gain had no effect on their baseline level of happiness, for both present and expected happiness in the future. They found that the paraplegics reported having a higher level of happiness in the past than the rest (due to a nostalgia effect), a lower level of happiness at the time of the study than the rest (although still above the middle point of the scale, that is, they reported being more happy than unhappy) and, surprisingly, they also expected to have similar levels of happiness than the rest in a couple of years. One must note that the paraplegics did have an initial decrease in life happiness, but the key to their findings is that they expected to eventually return to their baseline in time.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt;

In a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629606000853|title=Money and mental wellbeing: A longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins|author1=Jonathan Gardner|author2=Andrew J.Oswald|journal=Journal of Health Economics|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 2007|pages=49-60|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some research suggests that hedonic setpoints can potentially be raised with new compounds like [[NSI-189]].&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.neuralstem.com/2013-04-22-FDA-Approves-Neuralstem-To-Treat-Final-Cohort-In-NSI-189-Phase-Ib-Trial-In-Major-Depressive-Disorder{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could potentially have critical implications for the treatment of dysthymia and depression. Other research suggests that resilience to suffering is partly due to a decreased fear response in the amygdala and increased levels of BDNF in the brain. New genetic research have found that changing a gene could increase intelligence and resilience to depressing and traumatizing events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2015/08/17-2.htm#.VuviaVnD9qU Cites: {{cite journal|last1=McGirr|first1=Alexander|last2=Lipina|first2=Tatiana V|last3=Mun|first3=Ho-Suk|last4=Georgiou|first4=John|last5=Al-Amri|first5=Ahmed H|last6=Ng|first6=Enoch|last7=Zhai|first7=Dongxu|last8=Elliott|first8=Christina|last9=Cameron|first9=Ryan T|last10=Mullins|first10=Jonathan GL|last11=Liu|first11=Fang|last12=Baillie|first12=George S|last13=Clapcote|first13=Steven J|last14=Roder|first14=John C|title=Specific Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase-4B Results in Anxiolysis and Facilitates Memory Acquisition|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2015|volume=41|issue=4|pages=1080–1092|doi=10.1038/npp.2015.240|pmid=26272049|pmc=4748432}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could have crucial benefits for those suffering from anxiety and [[PTSD]]. 
 
Recent research reveals certain types of brain training can increase brain size. The hippocampus volume can affect mood, hedonic setpoints, some forms of memory. A smaller hippocampus has been linked to depression and dysthymia.&lt;ref&gt;http://psychcentral.com/news/2015/07/06/recurrent-depression-linked-to-smaller-hippocampus/86512.html&lt;/ref&gt; Certain activities and environmental factors can reset the hedonic setpoint and also grow the hippocampus to an extent. London taxi drivers' hippocampi grow on the job, and the drivers have a better memory than those who didn't become taxi drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/677048.stm|date = 14 March 2000|work = BBC NEWS |title = Taxi drivers' brains 'grow' on the job}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the posterior hippocampus seemed to be the most important for enhanced mood and memory.

Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, and Diener (2003) researched changes in baseline level of [[well-being]] due to marital status, birth of first child, and layoff. While they found that a negative life event can have a greater impact on a person's psychological state and happiness set point than a positive event, they concluded that people completely adapt, finally returning to their baseline level of well-being, after divorce, losing a spouse, the birth of a child, and for women losing their job. They did not find a return to baseline for marriage or for layoffs in men. This study also illustrated that the amount of adaptation depends on the individual.&lt;ref name="Lucas2003"/&gt;

Wildeman, Turney, and Schnittker (2014) studied the effects of [[imprisonment]] on one's baseline level of well-being. They researched how being in jail affects one's level of happiness both short term (while in prison) and long term (after being released). They found that being in prison has negative effects on one's baseline well-being; in other words one's baseline of happiness is lower in prison than when not in prison. Once people were released from prison, they were able to bounce back to their previous level of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wildeman, Kristin Turney, and Jason Schnittker, [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol104/iss1/4 "The Hedonic Consequences of Punishment Revisited"], 103 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver (1982) researched the effects of a traumatic accident on one's baseline level of happiness. Silver found that accident victims were able to return to a happiness set point after a period of time. For eight weeks, Silver followed accident victims who had sustained severe [[spinal cord injuries]]. About a week after their accident, Silver observed that the victims were experiencing much stronger negative emotions than positive ones. By the eighth and final week, the victims' positive emotions outweighed their negative ones. The results of this study suggest that regardless of whether the life event is significantly negative or positive, people will almost always return to their happiness baseline.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1982).

Fujita and Diener (2005) studied the stability of one's level of subjective well-being over time and found that for most people, there is a relatively small range in which their level of satisfaction varies. They asked a panel of 3,608 German residents to rate their current and overall satisfaction with life on a scale of 0-10, once a year for seventeen years. Only 25% of participants exhibited shifts in their level of life satisfaction over the course of the study, with just 9% of participants having experienced significant changes. They also found that those with a higher mean level of life satisfaction had more stable levels of life satisfaction than those with lower levels of satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Fujita2005"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Happiness set point===
The concept of the happiness set point (proposed by [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/fashion/happiness-inc.html | title = Happiness Inc.|work = The New York Times|date= 19 April 2013|last = Weil|first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be applied in clinical psychology to help patients return to their hedonic set point when negative events happen. Determining when someone is mentally distant from their happiness set point and what events trigger those changes can be extremely helpful in treating conditions such as depression. When a change occurs, clinical psychologists work with patients to recover from the depressive spell and return to their hedonic set point more quickly. Because acts of kindness often promote long-term well-being, one treatment method is to provide patients with different altruistic activities that can help a person raise his or her hedonic set point.&lt;ref name="Sheldon2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elias|first1=Marilyn|title=Psychologists now know what makes people happy|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-12-08-happy-main_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can in turn be helpful in reducing reckless habits in the pursuit of well-being.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vacounseling.com/hedonic-treadmill/ |title=The Hedonic Treadmill: From Overconsumption to Minimalism |last=Mathews |first=John |publisher=Virginia Counseling |date=2015 |website=Virginia Counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, helping patients understand that long-term happiness is relatively stable throughout one's life can help to ease anxiety surrounding impactful events.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Resilience research===
Hedonic adaptation is also relevant to resilience research. Resilience is a "class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk," meaning that resilience is largely the ability for one to remain at their hedonic setpoint while going through negative experiences. Psychologists have identified various factors that contribute to a person being resilient, such as positive attachment relationships (see [[Attachment Theory]]), positive self-perceptions, self-regulatory skills (see [[Emotional self-regulation]]), ties to prosocial organizations (see [[prosocial behavior]]), and a positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., Cutuli, J. J., Herbers, J. E., &amp; Reed, M.-G. J. (2009). Resilience in development. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology, 2nd ed. (pp. 117–131). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors can contribute to maintaining a happiness set point even in the face of adversity or negative events.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Critical views==
One critical point made regarding our individual set point is to understand it may simply be a genetic tendency and not a completely determined criterion for happiness, and it can still be influenced.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; In a study on moderate to excessive drug intake on rats, Ahmed and Koob (1998), sought to demonstrate that the use of [[mind-altering drugs]] such as [[cocaine]] could change an individual's hedonic set point. Their findings suggest that drug usage and addiction lead to neurochemical adaptations whereby a person needs more of that substance to feel the same levels of pleasure. Thus, drug abuse can have lasting impacts on one's hedonic set point, both in terms of overall happiness and with regard to pleasure felt from drug usage.&lt;ref name="Ahmed1998"/&gt;

Genetic roots of the hedonic set point are also disputed. Sosis (2014) has argued the "hedonic treadmill" interpretation of twin studies depends on dubious assumptions. Pairs of identical twins raised apart aren't necessarily raised in substantially different environments. The similarities between twins (such as intelligence or beauty) may invoke similar reactions from the environment. Thus, we might see a notable similarity in happiness levels between twins even though there aren't happiness genes governing affect levels.&lt;ref name="Sosis2014"/&gt;

Further, hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing with positive events as opposed to negative ones. [[Negativity bias]], where people tend to focus more on negative emotions than positive emotions, can be an obstacle in raising one's happiness set point. Negative emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered better, overshadowing any positive experiences that may even outnumber negative experiences.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister2001"/&gt; Given that negative events hold more psychological power than positive ones, it may be difficult to create lasting positive change.

Headey (2008) concluded that an internal [[locus of control]] and having "positive" personality traits (notably low [[neuroticism]]) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being. Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's [[disposable income]] does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction. And, contradicting set point theory, Headey found no return to homeostasis after sustaining a disability or developing a chronic illness. These disabling events are permanent, and thus according to [[cognitive model]] of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], may contribute to depressive thoughts and increase neuroticism (another factor found by Headey to diminish subjective well-being). Disability appears to be the single most important factor affecting human subjective well-being. The impact of disability on subjective well-being is almost twice as large as that of the second strongest factor affecting life satisfaction—the personality trait of [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name="Headey2008"/&gt;

'''''Galateo: The Rules of Polite Behavior''''' (''Il Galateo, overo de' costumi''){{refn|group="nb"|Complete title: ''Trattato nel quale, sotto la persona d'un vecchio idiota ammaestrante un suo giovanetto, si ragiona de' modi che si debbono o tenere o schifare nella comune conversazione, cognominato Galateo overo de' costumi''}} by Florentine [[Giovanni Della Casa]] (1503–56) was published in [[Venice]] in 1558. A guide to what one should do and avoid in ordinary social life, this [[courtesy book]] of the Renaissance explores subjects such as dress, table manners, and conversation. It became so popular that the title, which refers to the name of one of the author’s distinguished friends, entered into the Italian language as a general term for social etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galateo|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/galateo/|work=Enciclopedia Treccani|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Della Casa did not live to see his manuscript’s widespread and lasting success, which arrived shortly after its publication. It was translated into French (1562), English (1576), Latin (1580), Spanish (1585), and German (1587), and has been read and studied in every generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healey|first=Robin Patrick|title=Italian Literature Before 1900 in English Translation|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Della Casa's work set the foundation for modern [[etiquette]] writers and authorities on [[manners]], such as “Miss Manners” [[Judith Martin]], [[Amy Vanderbilt]], and [[Emily Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Urso|first=Valentina|title=Le Buone Maniere|year=1997|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

In the twentieth century, scholars usually situated ''Galateo'' among the courtesy books and conduct manuals that were very popular during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pine-Coffin|first=R. S|title=Galateo: A New Translation.|year=1958|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Castiglione’s celebrated ''Courtier'', other important Italian treatises and dialogues include [[Alessandro Piccolomini]]’s ''Moral institutione'' (1560), [[Luigi Cornaro]]’s  ''Treatise on the Sober Life'' (1558-1565), and [[Stefano Guazzo]]’s ''Art of Civil Conversation'' (1579). 

In recent years, attention has turned to the humor and dramatic flair of Della Casa’s book. It has been argued that the style sheds light on Shakespeare’s comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrapodi|first=Michele|title=Italian Culture in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Michele|first=Laura|title=Shakespeare: Una "Tempesta" Dopo L’altro|year=2005|publisher=Liguori|location=Napoli|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When it first appeared in English translation by Robert Peterson in 1575, it would have been available in book stalls in Shakespeare's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce|title=Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts|year=2001|publisher=Bedford|pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Greenblatt, author of ''Will in the World'', writes, "To understand the culture out of which Shakespeare is writing, it helps to read Renaissance courtesy manuals like Baldassare Castiglione’s famous Book of the Courtier (1528) or, still better, Giovanni della Casa’s ''Galateo or, The Rules of Polite Behavior'' (1558, available in a delightful new translation by M.F. Rusnak). It is fine for gentlemen and ladies to make jokes, della Casa writes, for we all like people who are funny, and a genuine witticism produces “joy, laughter, and a kind of astonishment.” But mockery has its risks. It is perilously easy to cross a social and moral line of no return." &lt;ref&gt;New York Review of Books, September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguished historians argue that ''Galateo'' should be read in the context of international European politics, and some contend that the work expresses an attempt to distinguish Italian excellence.  “During the half-century when Italy fell prey to foreign invasion (1494-1559) and was overrun by French, Spanish and German armies, the Italian ruling classes were battered by - as they often envisaged them - "barbarians". In their humiliation and laboured responses, Italian writers took to reflecting on ideals, such as the ideal literary language, the ideal cardinal, ideal building types, and the ideal general or field commander. But in delineating the rules of conduct, dress and conversation for the perfect gentleman, they were saying, in effect, "We are the ones who know how to cut the best figure in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Lauro Martines, Times Literary Supplement, August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

A skilled writer in Latin, Della Casa followed [[Erasmus]] in presenting a harmonious and simple morality based on [[Aristotle]]’s ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and notion of the mean, as well as other classical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Della Casa|first=Giovanni|title=Galateo: A Renaissance Treatise on Manners|year=2001|publisher=CRRS|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His treatise also reveals an obsession with graceful conduct and self-fashioning during the time of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]]: “A man must not be content with doing good things, but he must also study to do them gracefully. Grace is nothing other than that luster which shines from the appropriateness of things that are suitably ordered and well arranged one with the other and together.”  The work has been edited in this light by such distinguished Italian scholars as Stefano Prandi, Emanuela Scarpa, and Giorgio Manganelli.

The work may be read in the context of what [[Norbert Elias]] called the “civilizing process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elias|first=Norbert|title=The Civilizing Process: The History of Manners|year=1969|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally agreed that, given the popularity and impact of ''Galateo'', the cultural elite of the Italian Renaissance taught Europe how to behave. Giulio Ferroni argues that Della Casa “proposes a closed and oppressive conformity, made of caution and hypocrisy, hostile to every manifestation of liberty and originality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferroni|first=Giulio|title=Storia Della Letterature Italiana|year=1991|publisher=Einaudi|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others contend, on the contrary, that the work represents ambivalence, self-control, and a modern understanding of the individual in a society based on civility, [[intercultural competence]] and [[social networking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Harry|title=Sprezzatura and Suspicion in Two Renaissance Courtesy Books|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Della Casa addresses gentlemanly citizens who wish to convey a winning and attractive image. With a casual style and dry humor, he writes about everyday concerns, from posture to telling jokes to [[table manners]]. “Our manners are attractive when we regard others’ pleasure and not our own delight,” Della Casa writes.

Unlike [[Baldassare Castiglione]]’s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', the rules of polite behavior in ''Galateo'' are not directed to ideal men in a Renaissance court. Instead, Della Casa observes the ordinary habits of people who do not realize that clipping one’s nails in public is bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Hilary|title=Il Cortegiano and Il Galateo|journal=Modern Language Review|year=1947|volume=42|pages=457–466|doi=10.2307/3716799|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   “One should not annoy others with such stuff as dreams, especially since most dreams are by and large idiotic,” we are advised.

Valentina D’Urso, Professor of Psychology and author of ''Le Buone Maniere'', writes, “The founding father of this literary genre, [Galateo] is an extraordinary read, lively and passionate.  One doesn’t know whether to admire more its rich style or the wisdom of the practical words of advice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Urso|first=Valentina|title=Le Buone Maniere|year=1997|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Language and Style==

The work was preceded by a short treatise on the same subject in Latin, ''De officiis inter tenuiores et potentiores amicos'' (1546). Latin at the time was the language of learned society, and Della Casa was a first-rate classicist and public speaker. The treatise opens with a Latinate ''conciossiacosaché'', which gained Galateo a reputation for being pedantic and labored. However, [[Giuseppe Baretti]] and poets such as [[Giacomo Leopardi]] ranked Della Casa alongside [[Machiavelli]] as a master of Italian prose style. "Una delle prose più eleganti e più attiche del secolo decimosesto," (one of the most elegant and Attic prose works of the sixteenth century) Leopardi said.  Della Casa’s ''Galateo'' is, in the words of scholar E. H. Wilkins, “still valuable…for the pleasant ease with which most of it is written, and for its common sense, its plentiful humor, and its general amenity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins|first=E. H.|title=History of Italian Literature|year=1954|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Della Casa frequently alludes to [[Dante]] and more often to [[Boccaccio]], whose [[Decameron]] he evidently knew very well and whose style he imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonora|first=Ettore|title=della prosa del Rinascimento. Il boccaccismo del "Galateo"|journal=Giornale storico della letteratura italiana|date=luglio–sett 1956|volume=133|issue=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several comments on language in Galateo reflect the Tuscan language model proposed about the same time by Della Casa’s friend [[Pietro Bembo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biow|first=Douglass|title=The culture of Cleanliness in Renaissance Italy|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=2006|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of Galateo==
{{inappropriate person|section|date=January 2013}}
In the first chapter it is said that a gentleman should be at all times courteous, pleasant, and in manners beautiful. Although good manners may not appear as important as liberality, constancy, or magnanimity, they are nonetheless a virtue for achieving the esteem of others.  

One must not mention, do, or think anything that invokes images in the mind that are dirty or disreputable. One should not reveal by one's gestures that said person has just returned from the bathroom, do not blow one's nose and look into the handkerchief, avoid spitting and yawning. 

Della Casa tells his reader that outward appearance is very important, so clothes must be tailored and conform to prevailing custom, reflecting one’s social status. 

In Chapter 7, Della Casa deals with a pivotal subject - conversation: you have to talk about topics of interest to all present and show respect to everyone, avoiding anything that is base or petty. 

In Chapter 14 of the way we talk about the places where you are with other people and the first thing that the author discusses types of ceremonies, false flatteries, and fawning behavior. Another matter is whether the ceremonies are made to us: never refuse because it could be taken as a sign of arrogance.

Della Casa returns to illustrate the customs of conversation and public speaking.  Language should, as much as possible, be "orderly and well-expressed" so that the listener is able to understand what the speaker intends. In addition to the clarity of the words used, it is also important that they sound pleasant. Before talking about any topic, it is good to have it formed in your mind. It is not polite to interrupt someone while talking, nor to help him find his words.

In the last three chapters, the author writes about behaviour in general: what you do should be appropriate and done with grace.  A gentleman should never run, or walk too slowly. Della Casa brings us to behavior at the table, such as not scratching, not eating like a pig, not using a toothpick or sharing food.  In Della Casa’s vision, slight slips of decorum become [[taboo]].

==Publication history and reception==

It was probably first drafted during his stay at the Abbey of Saint Eustace at Nervesa, near Treviso, between 1551 and 1555.  ''Galateo'' was first published in Venice, and was edited by Erasmus Gemini in 1558. The first separate publication appeared in Milan a year later. 
The Vatican manuscript (formerly Parraciani Ricci), in Latin with autograph corrections, was edited and published by Gennaro Barbarisi in 1990. The manuscript contains neither the title nor the division into chapters. Many variants in the first edition are attributed to Erasmus Gemini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Benedetto|first=Arnaldo|title=Appunti sul "Galateo"|journal=Giornale storico della letteratura italiana|year=1995|volume=172:557-560|pages=481–508}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Spanish Galateo of Lucas Gracián Dantisco was very influential in the seventeenth century.  In the Enlightenment, the letters of Lord Chesterfield show the influence of Galateo, as does a self-help manuscript of George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookhiser|first=Richard|title=Rules of Civility: The 110 Precepts that Guided Our First President in War and Peace|year=2003|publisher=University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first American edition was published in Baltimore in 1811, with a short appendix on how to slice and serve meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Della Casa|first=Giovanni|title=Galateo, or, A treatise on politeness and delicacy of manners|year=1811|publisher=G. Hill|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30395">The '''illusion of control''' is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events; for example, it occurs when someone feels a sense of control over outcomes that they demonstrably do not influence.&lt;ref name="thompson_defn"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|1999|pp=187,124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was named by psychologist [[Ellen Langer]] and has been replicated in many different contexts.&lt;ref name="plous171"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to influence [[gambling]] behavior and belief in the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vyse|1997|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[illusory superiority]] and [[optimism bias]], the illusion of control is one of the [[positive illusions]].

Psychological theorists have consistently emphasized the importance of perceptions of control over life events. One of the earliest instances of this is when [[Alfred Adler|Adler]] argued that people strive for proficiency in their lives. [[Fritz Heider|Heider]] later proposed that humans have a strong motive to control their environment and Wyatt Mann hypothesized a basic competence motive that people satisfy by exerting control. [[Bernard Weiner|Wiener]], an [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] theorist, modified his original theory of achievement motivation to include a controllability dimension. [[Harold Kelley|Kelley]] then argued that people's failure to detect noncontingencies may result in their attributing uncontrollable outcomes to personal causes. Nearer to the present, Taylor and Brown&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt; argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, foster mental health.&lt;ref name="Social behavior"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Presson|first=Paul K.|last2=Benassi|first2=Victor A.|title=Illusion of control: A meta-analytic review|journal=Journal of Social Behavior &amp; Personality|year=1996|volume=11|issue=3|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-06041-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion is more common in familiar situations, and in situations where the person knows the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="thompson187"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|1999|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback that emphasizes success rather than failure can increase the effect, while feedback that emphasizes failure can decrease or reverse the effect.&lt;ref name=thompson188 /&gt; The illusion is weaker for [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] individuals and is stronger when individuals have an emotional need to control the outcome.&lt;ref name=thompson187 /&gt; The illusion is strengthened by stressful and competitive situations, including [[trader (finance)|financial trading]].&lt;ref name=trading /&gt; Although people are likely to overestimate their control when the situations are heavily chance-determined, they also tend to underestimate their control when they actually have it, which runs contrary to some theories of the illusion and its adaptiveness.&lt;ref name="Control"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gino|first1=Francesca|last2=Sharek|first2=Zachariah|last3=Moore|first3=Don A.|title=Keeping the illusion of control under control: Ceilings, floors, and imperfect calibration|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|date=2011|volume=114|issue=2|pages=104–114|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also showed a higher illusion of control when they were allowed to become familiar with a task through practice trials, make their choice before the event happens like with throwing dice, and when they can make their choice rather than have it made for them with the same odds.  People are more likely to show control when they have more answers right at the beginning than at the end, even when the people had the same number of correct answers.&lt;ref name="Social behavior" /&gt;

The illusion might arise because people lack direct [[introspection|introspective]] insight into whether they are in control of events. This has been called the [[introspection illusion]]. Instead they may judge their degree of control by a process that is often unreliable. As a result, they see themselves as responsible for events when there is little or no [[causality|causal link]]. In one study, college students were in a virtual reality setting to treat a fear of heights using an elevator. Those who were told that they had control, yet had none felt as though they had as much control as those who actually did have control over the elevator. Those who were led to believe they did not have control said they felt as though they had little control.&lt;ref name="Virtual Reality Illusion of Control"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Christin |author2=Kreiner, Honeycutt |author3=Hinds, Brockman|title=The Illusion of Control in a Virtual Reality Setting|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2010|volume=12|issue=3|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/North-American-Journal-Psychology/245167898.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By proxy==
At times, people attempt to gain control by transferring responsibility to more capable or “luckier” others to act for them.  By forfeiting direct control, it is perceived to be a valid way of maximizing outcomes. This illusion of control by proxy is a significant theoretical extension of the traditional illusion of control model. People will of course give up control if another person is thought to have more knowledge or skill in areas such as medicine where actual skill and knowledge are involved. In cases like these it is entirely rational to give up responsibility to people such as doctors. However, when it comes to events of pure chance, allowing another to make decisions (or gamble) on one's behalf, because they are seen as luckier is not rational and would go against people's well-documented desire for control in uncontrollable situations.  However, it does seem plausible since people generally believe that they can possess luck and employ it to advantage in games of chance, and it is not a far leap that others may also be seen as lucky and able to control uncontrollable events.

In one instance, a lottery pool at a company decides who picks the numbers and buys the tickets based on the wins and losses of each member. The member with the best record becomes the representative until they accumulate a certain number of losses and then a new representative is picked based on wins and losses. Even though no member is truly better than the other and it is all by chance, they still would rather have someone with seemingly more luck to have control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enzle|first=Michael E.|author2=Michael J. A. Wohl|title=Illusion of control by proxy: Placing one's fate in the hands of another|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|date=March 2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=183–200|doi=10.1348/014466607x258696}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In another real-world example, in the 2002 Olympics men's and women's hockey finals, Team Canada beat Team USA but it was later believed that the win was the result of the luck of a [[Loonie#Lucky loonie|Canadian coin]] that was secretly placed under the ice before the game. The members of Team Canada were the only people who knew the coin had been placed there. The coin was later put in the Hockey Hall of Fame where there was an opening so people could touch it. People believed they could transfer luck from the coin to themselves by touching it, and thereby change their own luck.

==Demonstration==
The illusion of control is demonstrated by three converging lines of evidence: 1) laboratory experiments, 2) observed behavior in familiar games of chance such as lotteries, and 3) self-reports of real-world behavior.&lt;ref name="illusions116"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One kind of laboratory demonstration involves two lights marked "Score" and "No Score". Subjects have to try to control which one lights up. In one version of this experiment, subjects could press either of two buttons.&lt;ref name="Jenkins1965"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=Herbert M.|last2=Ward|first2=William C.|title=Judgment of contingency between responses and outcomes|journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|date=1965|volume=79|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1037/h0093874|pmid=14300511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version had one button, which subjects decided on each trial to press or not.&lt;ref name="allan_jenkins"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allan |first1= L.G.|last2=Jenkins |first2=H.M. |year=1980 |title=The judgment of contingency and the nature of the response alternatives |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |volume=34 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1037/h0081013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects had a variable degree of control over the lights, or none at all, depending on how the buttons were connected. The experimenters made clear that there might be no relation between the subjects' actions and the lights.&lt;ref name="allan_jenkins" /&gt; Subjects estimated how much control they had over the lights. These estimates bore no relation to how much control they actually had, but was related to how often the "Score" light lit up. Even when their choices made no difference at all, subjects confidently reported exerting some control over the lights.&lt;ref name="allan_jenkins" /&gt;

Ellen Langer's research demonstrated that people were more likely to behave as if they could exercise control in a chance situation where "skill cues" were present.&lt;ref name="langer1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langer |first=Ellen J.  |year=1975 |title= The Illusion of Control |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=311–328 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.2.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headstails"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langer |first1= Ellen J. |last2=Roth |first2=Jane |year=1975 |title= Heads I win, tails it's chance: The illusion of control as a function of the sequence of outcomes in a purely chance task |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=951–955 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.6.951}}&lt;/ref&gt; By skill cues, Langer meant properties of the situation more normally associated with the exercise of skill, in particular the exercise of choice, competition, familiarity with the stimulus and involvement in decisions. One simple form of this effect is found in [[casino]]s: when rolling [[dice]] in a [[craps]] game people tend to throw harder when they need high numbers and softer for low numbers.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Henslin |first=J. M. |year=1967 |title=Craps and magic |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=316–330 |doi=10.1086/224479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment, subjects had to predict the outcome of thirty coin tosses. The feedback was rigged so that each subject was right exactly half the time, but the groups differed in where their "hits" occurred. Some were told that their early guesses were accurate. Others were told that their successes were distributed evenly through the thirty trials. Afterwards, they were surveyed about their performance. Subjects with early "hits" overestimated their total successes and had higher expectations of how they would perform on future guessing games.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="headstails" /&gt; This result resembles the ''[[Confirmation bias#Preference for early information|irrational primacy effect]]'' in which people give greater weight to information that occurs earlier in a series.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt; Forty percent of the subjects believed their performance on this chance task would improve with practice, and twenty-five percent said that distraction would impair their performance.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="headstails" /&gt;

Another of Langer's experiments—replicated by other researchers—involves a lottery. Subjects are either given tickets at random or allowed to choose their own. They can then trade their tickets for others with a higher chance of paying out. Subjects who had chosen their own ticket were more reluctant to part with it. Tickets bearing familiar symbols were less likely to be exchanged than others with unfamiliar symbols. Although these lotteries were random, subjects behaved as though their choice of ticket affected the outcome.&lt;ref name="langer1975" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants who chose their own numbers were less likely to trade their ticket even for one in a game with better odds.&lt;ref name="Social behavior" /&gt;

Another way to investigate perceptions of control is to ask people about hypothetical situations, for example their likelihood of being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in "high-control" situations, such as when they are driving, than in "low-control" situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver.&lt;ref name="illusions116" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=It won't happen to me: Unrealistic optimism or illusion of control? |last=McKenna |first= F. P. |journal=British Journal of Psychology |year=1993 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=39–50|publisher=British Psychological Society|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1993.tb02461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hardman /&gt;

==Explanations==
Ellen Langer, who first demonstrated the illusion of control, explained her findings in terms of a confusion between skill and chance situations. She proposed that people base their judgments of control on "skill cues". These are features of a situation that are usually associated with games of skill, such as competitiveness, familiarity and individual choice. When more of these skill cues are present, the illusion is stronger.&lt;ref name="thompson188"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|1999|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trading /&gt;&lt;ref name="pohl_explanations"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Thompson and colleagues argued that Langer's explanation was inadequate to explain all the variations in the effect. As an alternative, they proposed that judgments about control are based on a procedure that they called the "control heuristic".&lt;ref name=thompson188 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Illusions of Control, Underestimations, and Accuracy: A Control Heuristic Explanation| first1=Suzanne C. |last1=Thompson |first2=Wade |last2=Armstrong| first3=Craig |last3=Thomas|journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=123 |issue=2|year=1998| pages=143–161 |pmid=9522682|ref=harv | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.123.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that judgments of control to depend on two conditions; an intention to create the outcome, and a relationship between the action and outcome. In games of chance, these two conditions frequently go together. As well as an intention to win, there is an action, such as throwing a die or pulling a lever on a [[slot machine]], which is immediately followed by an outcome. Even though the outcome is selected randomly, the control heuristic would result in the player feeling a degree of control over the outcome.&lt;ref name="pohl_explanations" /&gt;

[[Self-regulation theory]] offers another explanation. To the extent that people are driven by internal goals concerned with the exercise of control over their environment, they will seek to reassert control in conditions of chaos, uncertainty or stress. One way of coping with a lack of real control is to falsely attribute oneself control of the situation.&lt;ref name="trading" /&gt;

The [[core self-evaluations]] (CSE) trait is a stable personality trait composed of [[locus of control]], [[neuroticism]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=Judge1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judge|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Locke|first2=Edwin A.|last3=Durham|first3=Cathy C.|year=1997|chapter=The dispositional causes of job satisfaction: A core evaluations approach|title=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=19|pages=151–188|isbn=978-0762301799}}&lt;/ref&gt; While those with high core self-evaluations are likely to believe that they control their own environment (i.e., internal locus of control),&lt;ref name="Judge2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Judge|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Kammeyer-Mueller|first2=John D.|title=Implications of core self-evaluations for a changing organizational context|journal=Human Resource Management Review|volume=21|issue=4|year=2011|pages=331–341| url=http://timothy-judge.com/documents/ImplicationsofCSEsforachangingorgcontext.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.hrmr.2010.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; very high levels of CSE may lead to the illusion of control.

==Benefits and costs to the individual==
{{see also|Depressive realism}}
Taylor and Brown have argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, are adaptive as they motivate people to persist at tasks when they might otherwise give up.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor |first1=Shelley E. |last2=Brown |first2=Jonathon D. |title=Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=103 |issue=2 |year=1988 |pages=193–210 |url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/1988_Illusion%20and%20well-being_A%20social%20psychological%20perspective%20on%20mental%20health.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193 |pmid=3283814 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719204438/http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/1988_Illusion%20and%20well-being_A%20social%20psychological%20perspective%20on%20mental%20health.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is supported by [[Albert Bandura]]'s claim that "optimistic self-appraisals of capability, that are not unduly disparate from what is possible, can be advantageous, whereas [[veridical]] judgements can be self-limiting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bandura |first= A.  |year=1989 |title=Human Agency in Social Cognitive Theory |journal=American Psychologist |volume= 44 |issue=9 |pages=1175–1184 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.44.9.1175|pmid= 2782727  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is essentially concerned with the adaptive effect of optimistic beliefs about control and performance in circumstances where control is possible, rather than perceived control in circumstances where outcomes do not depend on an individual's behavior.

Bandura has also suggested that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In activities where the margins of error are narrow and missteps can produce costly or injurious consequences, personal well-being is best served by highly accurate efficacy appraisal."&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). ''[[Self-efficacy: The exercise of control]]''. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taylor and Brown argue that positive illusions are [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]], since there is evidence that they are more common in normally mentally healthy individuals than in depressed individuals. However, Pacini, Muir and Epstein have shown that this may be because depressed people overcompensate for a tendency toward maladaptive intuitive processing by exercising excessive rational control in trivial situations, and note that the difference with non-depressed people disappears in more consequential circumstances.&lt;ref name="PaciniMuir1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacini|first1=Rosemary|last2=Muir|first2=Francisco|last3=Epstein|first3=Seymour|title=Depressive realism from the perspective of cognitive-experiential self-theory|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=4|year=1998|pages=1056–1068|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.1056|pmid=9569659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also [[empirical evidence]] that high self-efficacy can be maladaptive in some circumstances. In a scenario-based study, Whyte et al. showed that participants in whom they had induced high self-efficacy were significantly more likely to escalate commitment to a failing course of action.&lt;ref name="WhyteSaks1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whyte|first1=Glen|last2=Saks|first2=Alan M.|last3=Hook|first3=Sterling|title=When success breeds failure: the role of self-efficacy in escalating commitment to a losing course of action|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=18|issue=5|year=1997|pages=415–432|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199709)18:5&lt;415::AID-JOB813&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knee and Zuckerman have challenged the definition of mental health used by Taylor and Brown and argue that lack of illusions is associated with a non-defensive personality oriented towards growth and learning and with low ego involvement in outcomes.&lt;ref name=KneeZuckerman1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knee|first1=C.Raymond|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Miron|title=A Nondefensive Personality: Autonomy and Control as Moderators of Defensive Coping and Self-Handicapping|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1998|volume=32|issue=2|pages=115–130|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2207 |url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/32_J_Research_Personality_115_(Knee).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present evidence that self-determined individuals are less prone to these illusions. In the late 1970s, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]] and [[Lauren Alloy|Alloy]] demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured illusion of control.&lt;ref name="AbramsonAlloy1980"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Baum|editor-first1=A.|editor-last2=Singer|editor-first2=J.

However, when replicating the findings Msetfi et al. (2005, 2007) found that the overestimation of control in nondepressed people only showed up when the interval was long enough, implying that this is because they take more aspects of a situation into account than their depressed counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470210601002595 |vauthors=Msetfi RM, Murphy RA, Simpson J |year=2007 |title=Depressive realism and the effect of intertrial interval on judgements of zero, positive, and negative contingencies |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=461–481 |pmid=17366312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.1.10 |vauthors=Msetfi RM, Murphy RA, Simpson J, Kornbrot DE |year=2005 |title=Depressive realism and outcome density bias in contingency judgments: the effect of the context and intertrial interval |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology.

(1989) showed that depressed people believe they have no control in situations where they actually do, so their perception is not more accurate overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.3.431 |author=Dykman, B.M., Abramson, L.Y., Alloy, L.B., Hartlage, S. |year=1989 |title=Processing of ambiguous and unambiguous feedback by depressed and nondepressed college students: Schematic biases and their implications for depressive realism |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=431–445 |pmid=2926638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allan et al. (2007) has proposed that the pessimistic bias of depressives resulted in "depressive realism" when asked about estimation of control, because depressed individuals are more likely to say no even if they have control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470210601002686 |vauthors=Allan LG, Siegel S, Hannah S |year=2007 |title=The sad truth about depressive realism |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=482–495 |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/hannahsd/pubs/AllanSiegelHannah%2707.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=17366313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have found a link between a sense of control and health, especially in older people.&lt;ref name="plous172"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton-O'Creevy et al.&lt;ref name="trading" /&gt; argue, as do Gollwittzer and Kinney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gollwitzer |first1= P.M. |last2=Kinney |first2=R.F. |year=1989 |title=Effects of Deliberative and Implemental Mind-Sets On Illusion of Control |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=531–542 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.4.531}}&lt;/ref&gt; that while illusory beliefs about control may promote goal striving, they are not conducive to sound decision-making. Illusions of control may cause insensitivity to feedback, impede learning and predispose toward greater objective risk taking (since subjective risk will be reduced by illusion of control).

==Applications==
Psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]] argues that an illusion of control over external events underlies belief in [[psychokinesis]], a supposed paranormal ability to move objects directly using the mind.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

In one experiment, subjects watched a [[basketball]] player taking a series of [[free throws]]. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success.&lt;ref name=Pronin2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pronin |first1=Emily |last2=Wegner |first2=Daniel M. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Kimberly |last4=Rodriguez |first4=Sylvia |title=Everyday magical powers: The role of apparent mental causation in the overestimation of personal influence. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=2006 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=218–231 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.2.218 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin%2C%20Wegner%2C%20McCarthy%2C%20%26%20Rodriguez%20%282006%29.pdf |pmid=16881760 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105011719/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin%2C%20Wegner%2C%20McCarthy%2C%20%26%20Rodriguez%20%282006%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study examined traders working in the [[City of London]]'s [[investment banking|investment banks]]. They each watched a graph being plotted on a computer screen, similar to a real-time graph of a stock price or index. Using three computer keys, they had to raise the value as high as possible. They were warned that the value showed random variations, but that the keys might have some effect. In fact, the fluctuations were not affected by the keys.&lt;ref name="trading" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hardman" /&gt; The traders' ratings of their success measured their susceptibility to the illusion of control. This score was then compared with each trader's performance. Those who were more prone to the illusion scored significantly lower on analysis, [[risk management]] and contribution to profits. They also earned significantly less.&lt;ref name="trading"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton-O'Creevy|first1=Mark|last2=Nicholson|first2=Nigel|last3=Soane|first3=Emma|last4=Willman|first4=Paul|title=Trading on illusions: Unrealistic perceptions of control and trading performance|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|date=2003|volume=76|issue=1|pages=53–68|doi=10.1348/096317903321208880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardman"&gt;{{harvnb |Hardman|2009|pp=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton-O'Creevy, M., Nicholson, N. and Soane, E., Willman, P.

An '''insult''' is an expression or statement (or sometimes behavior) which is [[Respect|disrespectful]] or scornful. Insults  may be intentional or accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; An insult may be [[fact]]ual, but at the same time [[pejorative]], such as the word "[[Inbreeding|inbred]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Vos|first1=George|title=Status inequality: the self in culture|date=1990|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jocular exchange==

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered insults a primary form of [[social interaction]], central to the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary order]] – "a situation that is symbolised in the 'Yah-boo, so are you' of the transitivist quarrel, the original form of aggressive communication".{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;!-- WTF with this transitivist yah-boo? This is encyclopedia, supposed to explain things, not for wisecracks--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] points out that every "crack or remark set up the possibility of a counter-riposte, topper, or squelch, that is, a comeback".&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; He cites the example of possible interchanges at a dance in a school gym:
{{quotation|

Backhanding is referred to as [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]] someone using the back of the hand instead of the palm—that is generally a symbolic, less forceful blow.{{citation needed|date= October 2016}} Correspondingly, a backhanded (or left-handed) compliment, or [[wikt:asteism|asteism]], is an insult that is disguised as, or accompanied by, a [[wikt:compliment|compliment]], especially in situations where the belittling or condescension is intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backhanded |title=Backhanded — Definition of Backhanded at Dictionary.com: |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211212617/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backhanded| archivedate= 11 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual==

Verbal insults often take [[Prick (slang)|a phallic form]]; this includes offensive [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Renold, ''Girls, Boys, and Junior Sexualities'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and may also include insults to ones [[sexuality]].

==Formal==

The [[flyting]] was a formalized sequence of literary insults: invective or flyting, the literary equivalent of the spell-binding curse, uses similar incantatory devices for opposite reasons, as in [[William Dunbar|Dunbar]]'s ''Flyting with Kennedy''.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973 )p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

"A little-known survival of the ancient 'flytings', or contests-in-insults of the Anglo-Scottish bards, is the type of [[xenophobic]] humor once known as 'water wit' in which passengers in small boats crossing the [[Thames]] ... would insult each other grossly, in all the untouchable safety of being able to get away fast."&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' Vol I (1973) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson]] once triumphed in such an exchange: "a fellow having attacked him with some coarse raillery, Johnson answered him thus, 'Sir, your wife, ''under pretence of keeping a bawdy-house'', is a receiver of stolen goods.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson|The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomies==
[[File:Uwot.jpg|thumb|The use of the [[V sign]] as an insult, combined with the upwards swing movement]]

Various typologies of insults have been proposed over the years. [[Ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]], noting that "almost any action can operate as an Insult Signal if it is performed out of its appropriate context – at the wrong time or in the wrong place", classes such signals in ten 'basic categories":&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''Manwatching'' (London 1987) p. 186-192. {{ISBN|9780810913103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Disinterest signals
# Boredom signals
# Impatience signals
# Superiority signals
# Deformed-compliment signals
# Mock-discomfort signals
# Rejection signals
# Mockery signals
# Symbolic insults
# Dirt signals

[[Elizabethans]] took great interest in such analyses, distinguishing out, for example, the "fleering frump ... when we give a mock with a scornful countenance as in some smiling sort looking aside or by drawing the lip awry, or shrinking up the nose".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Puttenham]] in Boris Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 72=3&lt;/ref&gt;  Shakespeare humerously set up an insult-hierarchy of seven-fold "degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Shakespeare]]. ''[[As You Like It]]'', Act V, Scene IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions==

What qualifies as an insult is also determined both by the individual social situation and by changing social [[mores]]. Thus on one hand the insulting "obscene invitations of a man to a strange girl can be the spicy endearments of a husband to his wife".&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

(2010). ''Group Dynamics'', 5th Edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-534-36822-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this hypothesis predicts that positive behaviors evoke positive behaviors, negative behaviors evoke negative behaviors, [[dominance and submission|dominant behaviors]] evoke [[dominance and submission|submissive behaviors]], and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Sadler&gt;Sadler, P., &amp; Woody, E.

Essentially, each action carried out by a member of a group has the ability to elicit predictable actions from other group members. For example, individuals who display evidence of positive behavior (e.g., smiling, behaving cooperatively) tend to trigger positively valenced behaviors from others.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;Carson, R. C. (1969). ''Interaction concepts of personality.'' Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; In much the same way, group members who behave in a docile or submissive fashion tend to elicit complementary, dominant behaviors from other members of the group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7614">In [[mathematics]], a '''Klein geometry''' is a type of [[geometry]] motivated by [[Felix Klein]] in his influential [[Erlangen program]]. More specifically, it is a [[homogeneous space]] ''X'' together with a [[group action|transitive action]] on ''X'' by a [[Lie group]] ''G'', which acts as the [[symmetry group]] of the geometry.

For background and motivation see the article on the [[Erlangen program]].

==Formal definition==
A '''Klein geometry''' is a pair {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} where ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and ''H'' is a [[closed set|closed]] [[Lie subgroup]] of ''G'' such that the (left) [[coset space]] ''G''/''H'' is [[connected space|connected]]. The group ''G'' is called the '''principal group''' of the geometry and ''G''/''H'' is called the '''space''' of the geometry (or, by an abuse of terminology, simply the ''Klein geometry''). The space {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''/''H''}} of a Klein geometry is a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension
:dim ''X'' = dim ''G'' − dim ''H''.

There is a natural smooth [[group action|left action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' given by
:&lt;math&gt;g.(aH) = (ga)H.&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, this action is transitive (take {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}}), so that one may then regard ''X'' as a [[homogeneous space]] for the action of ''G''. The [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of the identity coset {{nowrap|''H'' ∈ ''X''}} is precisely the group ''H''.

Given any connected smooth manifold ''X'' and a smooth transitive action by a Lie group ''G'' on ''X'', we can construct an associated Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} by fixing a basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' and letting ''H'' be the stabilizer subgroup of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''G''. The group ''H'' is necessarily a closed subgroup of ''G'' and ''X'' is naturally [[diffeomorphic]] to ''G''/''H''.

Two Klein geometries {{nowrap|(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are '''geometrically isomorphic''' if there is a [[Lie group isomorphism]] {{nowrap|''φ'' : ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} so that {{nowrap|1=''φ''(''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In particular, if ''φ''  is [[conjugacy class|conjugation]] by an element {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}, we see that {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} and {{nowrap|(''G'', ''gHg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} are isomorphic. The Klein geometry associated to a homogeneous space ''X'' is then unique up to isomorphism (i.e. it is independent of the chosen basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Bundle description==
Given a Lie group ''G'' and closed subgroup ''H'', there is natural [[group action|right action]] of ''H'' on ''G'' given by right multiplication.  This action is both free and [[proper action|proper]]. The [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] are simply the left [[coset]]s of ''H'' in ''G''. One concludes that ''G'' has the structure of a smooth [[principal bundle|principal ''H''-bundle]] over the left coset space ''G''/''H'':
:&lt;math&gt;H\to G\to G/H .&lt;/math&gt;

==Types of Klein geometries==

===Effective geometries===
The action of ''G'' on {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''/''H''}} need not be effective. The '''kernel''' of a Klein geometry is defined to be the kernel of the action of ''G'' on ''X''. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K = \{k \in G : g^{-1}kg \in H\;\;\forall g \in G\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The kernel ''K'' may also be described as the [[core (group)|core]] of ''H'' in ''G'' (i.e. the largest subgroup of ''H'' that is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in ''G''). It is the group generated by all the normal subgroups of ''G'' that lie in ''H''.

A Klein geometry is said to be '''effective''' if {{nowrap|1=''K'' = 1}} and '''locally effective''' if ''K'' is [[discrete group|discrete]]. If {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is a Klein geometry with kernel ''K'', then {{nowrap|(''G''/''K'', ''H''/''K'')}} is an effective Klein geometry canonically associated to {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}}.

===Geometrically oriented geometries===
A Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is '''geometrically oriented''' if ''G'' is [[connected space|connected]]. (This does ''not'' imply that ''G''/''H'' is an [[orientability|oriented manifold]]). If ''H'' is connected it follows that ''G'' is also connected (this is because ''G''/''H'' is assumed to be connected, and {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G''/''H''}} is a [[fibration]]).

Given any Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}}, there is a geometrically oriented geometry canonically associated to {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} with the same base space ''G''/''H''. This is the geometry {{nowrap|(''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''H'')}} where ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity component]] of ''G''. Note that {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''H''}}.

===Reductive geometries===
A Klein geometry {{nowrap|(''G'', ''H'')}} is said to be '''reductive''' and ''G''/''H'' a '''reductive homogeneous space''' if the [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' has an ''H''-invariant complement in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">In mathematics, a '''Kline sphere characterization,''' named after [[John Robert Kline]], is a [[topology|topological]] characterization of a two-dimensional [[sphere]] in terms of what sort of subset separates it.  Its proof was one of the first notable accomplishments of [[R. H. Bing]];  Bing gave an alternate proof using [[brick partitioning]] in his paper ''Complementary domains of continuous curves'' &lt;ref name="cdcc"&gt;Bing, R.H., Complementary domains of continuous curves, ''Fund. Math.'' '''36''' (1949), [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm36/fm36131.pdf 303-318].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Curve|simple closed curve]] in a two-dimensional sphere (for instance, its equator) [[Connected space|separates]] the sphere into two pieces upon removal.  If one removes a pair of points from a sphere, however, the remainder is [[Connected space|connected]].  Kline's sphere characterization states that the converse is true:  If a nondegenerate [[Locally connected space|locally connected]] [[metric space|metric]] [[continuum (topology)|continuum]] is separated by any simple closed curve but by no pair of points, then it is a two-dimensional sphere.

In 1971, the San Francisco school system desegregated based on the result of Supreme Court case ''[[Guey Heung Lee v. Johnson|Lee v. Johnson]].'' 2856 Chinese students, who were not fluent in English, were integrated back into the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD). Only about 1000 of those students were provided supplemental English instruction. Of the other 1800-plus Chinese students who weren't fluent in English, many were placed in special education classes while some were forced to be in the same grade for years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Even though the [[Bilingual Education Act]] was passed by Congress in 1968 to address the needs of Limited English Speaking Abilities students, the funding was limited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punches|first=Michael W.|date=1985-01-01|title=The Shaping of a Social Policy: The Bilingual Education Act, 1968-1984|jstor=42589123|journal=Journal of Thought|volume=20|issue=4|pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; School participation in those programs was also voluntary, and by 1972, "only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a [[Title VII]]-funded program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrzela|first=Natalia M|year=2010|title=Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California|url=|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=85|pages=414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Steinman, a public-interest lawyer, reached out to the parents of Kinney Kinmon Lau and other Chinese students with limited English proficiency. He encouraged them to challenge the school district, and they filed a class action suit against [[Alan Nichols|Alan H. Nichols]], the president of the SFUSD at the time, and other officials in the school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1984/01/25/05300020.h03.html|title=Languages, Law, and San Francisco - Education Week|date=1984-01-25|newspaper=Education Week|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students claimed that they were not receiving special help in school due to their inability to speak English, and they argued they were entitled to special help under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] because of equal protection and the ban on educational discrimination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|District Court for the Northern District of California]] denied the relief and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed the decision. The District Court argued that since a uniform policy was used for all students in SFUSD and that the district didn't intentionally discriminate against students with limited English proficiency, equal protection was provided and the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated. The Court of Appeals claimed that since the school district provided the same treatment for all students, even though some students were disadvantaged due to their limited fluency in English, the school district was not required to make up for the different starting points of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugarman|first=Stephen D.|last2=Widess|first2=Ellen G.|date=1974-01-01|title=Equal Protection for Non-English-Speaking School Children: Lau v. Nichols|jstor=3479823|journal=California Law Review|volume=62|issue=1|pages=157–182|doi=10.2307/3479823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court.

== Decision of the Supreme Court ==
[[File:Justice_Blackmun_Official.jpg|left|thumb|245x245px|Justice Harry Blackmun, who concurred with the decision and stated that the number of students affected in this case was substantial enough to deem affirmative remedies necessary.]]

The Supreme Court issued its decision on January 21, 1974, with the Court unanimously ruling in favor of Lau. Instead of examining the equal protection clause from the 14th Amendment, the Court relied on Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Since the school system received federal funding, it was required to provide equal opportunities and access to all students. The Court claimed that even though the school districts provided equal treatment for all students, it still imposed disparate impact on the non-English speaking students since they were not able to understand the class material as effectively as other students and therefore were deprived of having "meaningful" education. The Court also referenced the guideline established by [[Office for Civil Rights|the Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR) of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|the Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] in 1970, which stated that language could be used as a proxy of discrimination on national origin and that "the district must take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency in order to open its instructional program to these students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/lau1970.html|title=DHEW Memo Regarding Language Minority Children|date=2015-10-15|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court demanded the school district to make necessary changes to provide equal education to the non-English speakers, but it didn't state any specific remedies for the district to follow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Justice [[Potter Stewart]], joined by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger|Burger]] and Justice [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]], concurred with this decision as he stated that affirmative remedial efforts, suggested by the OCR, were constitutional and appropriate in this case as long as the efforts were "reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation." In his concurrence joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Blackmun also suggested that "numbers are at the heart of this case" and that if the case only involved a few students, rather than nearly 2,000, the decision would not be the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Lau remains an important decision in bilingual education history. In this case, the Supreme Court found the violation of Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on the discriminatory effect of the school policy regardless of the intent of the officials. It prohibited the "sink and swim" policy and set a precedent of finding disparate impact in violation of the Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran|first=Rachel F.|year=2005|title=Undone by Law: The Uncertain Legacy of Lau v. Nichols|url=|journal=Berkeley La Raza Law Journal|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was subsequently followed by the passing of [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]] in Congress, which specifically prohibited discrimination against faculty and student in public schools and required the school districts to take "appropriate action" to overcome the barriers to equal participation of all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3776#axzz1pm57fScr|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Equal Educational Opportunities and School Busing.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased funding to the Bilingual Education Act and made additional English instruction mandatory, which effectively extended the Lau ruling to all public schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Officer for Civil Rights then developed a remedial guideline in 1975, otherwise known as the Lau Remedies, that specified methods and approaches for the school districts to follow in order to provide a meaningful education to students with limited English proficiency. This led to the development of bilingual programs and additional English instructions in most public schools.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Health, Education and Welfare Department. ''Task Force Findings Specifying Remedies Available for Eliminating past Educational Practices Ruled Unlawful under LAU v. NICHOLS''. N.p.: n.p., 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been challenges to the Lau decision in recent decades. In the Supreme Court case ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'', [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 532|532]] [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 275 (2001), the Court claimed that private plaintiffs did not have the right of action to sue against disparate impact violation under Title VI and they must provide proofs of intentional discrimination. It implied that students can no longer sue schools for policies that cause disparate impact, which significantly weakened the foundation of the Lau decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=Sara|date=2004-01-01|title=Reducing Discrimination Affecting Persons with Limited English Proficiency: Federal Civil Rights Guidelines under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act|jstor=20056643|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=119|issue=1|pages=93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities''' ({{lang-hr|Zakon o uporabi jezika i pisma nacionalnih manjina}}) is [[law]] which defines use of [[minority language]]s in [[Croatia]]. Additionally ''[[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]]'' and ''The Law on Education in language and script of national minorities'' explicitly define rights on usage of minority languages in Croatia.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=6 December 2014 |author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local governments to which this law applies ''([[Municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy or municipality where right is defined by international agreement)'' are required to explicitly prescribe equal official use of minority language or script throughout its territory, regulate in detail realization of those rights and expressly prescribe all particular rights guaranteed by Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities.&lt;ref name="Naputak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istra-istria.hr/fileadmin/dokumenti/upravna_tijela/UO_za_tal_nac_zaj/Instrumenti_zastite_ljudskih_prava/III.Nacionalno-unutarnje_zakonodavstvoRH/3.Akti_Vlade,Ministarstava/III-3.12.Naputak_za_dosljednu_provedbu_Zakona_o_uporabi_jezika_i_pisma_nacionalnih_manjina_u_RH.pdf |title=NAPUTAK ZA DOSLJEDNU PROVEDBU ZAKONA O UPORABI JEZIKA I PISMA NACIONALNIH MANJINA U REPUBLICI HRVATSKOJ|accessdate=6 December 2014 |author=[[Ministry of Public Administration]]|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to define these rights in their local [[statute]]s.&lt;ref name="Naputak"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[software development]], a '''leaky abstraction''' is an [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] that leaks details that it is supposed to abstract away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seibel, Peter |title=Practical Common Lisp|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVJvr8PtCMUC&amp;pg=PA96|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0017-8|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "leaky abstraction" was popularized in 2002 by [[Joel Spolsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spolsky|first=Joel|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html|year=2002|accessdate=2010-09-22|title=The Law of Leaky Abstractions}} - a blog post by Spolsky that asserts that all non-trivial abstractions are 'leaky' and therefore problematic.&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier paper by [[Gregor Kiczales|Kiczales]] describes some of the issues with imperfect abstractions and presents a potential solution to the problem by allowing for the customization of the abstraction itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiczales |first= Gregor |url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/publications/papers/Kiczales-IMSA92/for-web.pdf|year=1992|accessdate=2010-02-03| title=Towards a New Model of Abstraction in the Engineering of Software}} - a paper by Gregor Kiczales that describes the problem of imperfect abstractions and suggests a programming model for coping with them.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Law of Leaky Abstractions==
As coined by Spolsky, the '''Law of Leaky Abstractions''' states:

{{Cquote|All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.}}

This statement highlights a particularly problematic cause of software defects: the reliance of the software developer on an abstraction's infallibility.

Spolsky's article gives examples of an abstraction that works most of the time, but where a detail of the underlying complexity cannot be ignored, thus leaking complexity out of the abstraction back into the software that uses the abstraction.

==Effect on software development==
As systems become more complex, software developers must rely upon more abstractions.  Each abstraction tries to hide complexity, letting a developer write software that "handles" the many variations of modern computing.

However, this law claims that developers of ''reliable'' software must learn the abstraction's underlying details anyway.

==Examples==
Spolsky's article cites many examples of leaky abstractions that create problems for software development:
*The [[TCP/IP]] protocol stack is the combination of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which tries to provide reliable delivery of information, running on top of [[Internet Protocol|IP]], which provides only 'best-effort' service.  When IP loses a packet TCP has to retransmit it, which takes additional time. Thus TCP provides the abstraction of a reliable connection, but the implementation details leak through in the form of potentially variable performance (throughput and latency both suffer when data has to be retransmitted).
*[[Iterator|Iterating]] over a large two-dimensional [[Array data structure|array]] can have radically different performance if done horizontally rather than vertically, depending on the order in which elements are stored in memory. One direction may vastly increase [[CPU cache#Cache_miss|cache misses]] and [[page fault]]s, both of which greatly delay access to memory.
*The [[SQL]] language abstracts away the procedural steps for querying a [[database]], allowing one to merely define what one wants. But certain SQL queries are thousands of times slower than other logically equivalent queries.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} On an even higher level of abstraction, [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]] systems, which isolate object-oriented code from the implementation of object persistence using a relational database, still force the programmer to think in terms of databases, tables, and native SQL queries as soon as performance of ORM-generated queries becomes a concern.
*Although network file systems like [[Network File System|NFS]] and [[Server Message Block|SMB]] let one treat files on remote machines as if they were local, the connection to the remote machine may slow down or break, and the file stops acting as if it were local.
*The [[ASP.NET]] web forms programming platform, not to be confused with ASP.NET MVC, abstracts away the difference between HTML code to handle clicking on a hyperlink (&lt;a&gt;) and code to handle clicking on a button. However, ASP.NET needs to hide the fact that in HTML there is no way to submit a form from a hyperlink. It does this by generating a few lines of JavaScript and attaching an [[DOM_events#Common.2FW3C_events|onclick]] handler to the hyperlink. However, if the end user has JavaScript disabled, the ASP.NET application malfunctions. Furthermore, one cannot naively think of event handlers in ASP.NET in the same way as in a desktop GUI framework such as [[Windows Forms]]; due to the asynchronous nature of the Web, processing event handlers in ASP.NET requires exchanging data with the server and reloading the form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10923">'''Legal certainty''' is a principle in national and international law which holds that the law must provide those subject to it with the ability to regulate their conduct.  Legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the [[rule of law]].

== Definition ==
The legal system needs to permit those subject to the law to regulate their conduct with certainty and to protect those subject to the law from arbitrary use of state power. Legal certainty represents a requirement that decisions be made according to legal rules, i.e. be lawful. The concept of legal certainty may be strongly linked to that of [[individual autonomy]] in national jurisprudence. The degree to which the concept of legal certainty is incorporated into law varies depending on national jurisprudence. However, legal certainty frequently serves as the central principle for the development of legal methods by which law is made, interpreted and applied.&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

Legal certainty is an established legal concept both in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law legal systems]] and [[common law legal systems]]. In the civil law tradition, legal certainty is defined in terms of maximum predictability of officials' behaviour. In the common law tradition, legal certainty is often explained in terms of citizens' ability to organise their affairs in such a way that does not break the law. In both legal traditions, legal certainty is regarded as grounding value for the legality of legislative and administrative measures taken by public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Claes| first = Erik| last2 = Devroe| first2 = Wouter | last3 = Keirsblick| first3 = Bert| title = Facing the limits of the law| publisher = Springer| year = 2009| pages =92–93 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXrCHgUptpUC&amp;dq=%22legal+certainty%22+%22Void+for+vagueness%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-3-540-79855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule of law ==
The legal philosopher [[Gustav Radbruch]] regarded legal certainty, justice and purposiveness as the three fundamental pillars of [[law]].&lt;ref name="Leawood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leawood|first1=Heather|title=Gustav Radbruch: An Extraordinary Legal Philosopher|journal=Washington University Journal of Law &amp; Policy|date=2000|volume=2|page=489|ref=Leawood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) the concept of the rule of law "first and foremost seeks to emphasize the necessity of establishing a rule-based society in the interest of legal certainty and predictability." At the G8 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in [[Potsdam]] in 2007, the G8 committed to the rule of law as a core principle entailing adherence to the principle of legal certainty.&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

== England and Europe ==
Most European nations regard legal certainty as a fundamental quality of the legal system and a guiding requirement for the [[rule of law]], although they have differing meanings of the term. 

The concept can be traced through [[English common law]]&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; in that system's recognition that legal certainty requires that laws be made such that people can comply with them.

It also recognised in all European civil legal systems.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page= 454 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is recognised in Germany as ''[[:de:Rechtssicherheit|Rechtssicherheit]]'', in France as ''[[:fr:Sécurité juridique|sécurité juridique]]'', in Spain as ''[[:es:Seguridad juridica|seguridad juridica]]'', in Italy as ''[[:it:Certezza del diritto|certezza del diritto]]'', in the Benelux countries as ''rechtszekerheid'', in Sweden as ''[[:sv:Rättssäkerhet|rättssäkerhet]]'', in Poland as ''[[:pl:Pewność prawa|pewność prawa]]'', and in Finland as ''[[:fi:Oikeusvarmuus|oikeusvarmuus]]''. Legal certainty is now recognised as one of the general principles of [[European community law]] and "requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail".&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; The principle of legal certainty, and as such the rule of law, requires that:
* laws and decisions must be made public
* laws and decisions must be definite and clear
* the decisions of courts must be regarded as binding
* the [[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]] of laws and decisions must be limited
* legitimate interests and expectations must be protected.&lt;ref name="Maxeiner"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Maxeiner| first = James R.| title = Some realism about legal certainty in globalization of the rule of law| publisher = Houston Journal of International law| date = Fall 2008| url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/193182657.html| accessdate = 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General principle of European Union law ===
The concept of legal certainty has been recognised as one of the [[general principles of European Union law]] by the [[European Court of Justice]] since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt; It is an important [[general principle of international law]] and [[public law]], which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law, it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.&lt;ref name="Kaczorowsky 2008 232"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kaczorowsky| first = Alina| title = European Union law | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 2008| page = 232 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9atmZGmyJKoC&amp;dq=general+principle+of+community+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-415-44797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[European Union law]] the general principle of legal certainty prohibits [[Ex post facto law|''Ex post facto'' laws]], i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties to know what the law is and comply with it. For example in ''Opel Austria v Council''&lt;ref&gt;''Opel Austria v Council'' [1997] ECR II-39 Case T-115/94&lt;/ref&gt; the European Court of Justice held that [[European Council]] Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt; The doctrine of [[legitimate expectation]], which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and [[good faith]], is also a central element of the [[General principles of European Union law#Legal certainty|general principle of legal certainty in European Union law]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 455"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 455 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is, or seems to be, should not be frustrated in their expectations".&lt;ref name="Kaczorowsky 2008 232"/&gt; This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause that party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being ''Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij'' [1988] ECR 2321 Case 120/86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 455"/&gt;

The misuse of power test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was conferred. According to the misuse of power test a decision by a European Union institution is only a misuse of power if "it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving any end other than those stated." A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a European Union institution has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is ''Giuffrida v Commission''.&lt;ref&gt;''Giuffrida v Commission'' [1976] ECR 1395 Case 105/75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 456 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt;

=== European human rights law ===
The concept of legal certainty is recognised by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

== United States ==
In United States law the principle of legal certainty is phrased as [[fair warning (law)|fair warning]] and the [[void for vagueness]] principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Claes| first = Erik| last2 = Devroe| first2 = Wouter | last3 = Keirsblick| first3 = Bert| title = Facing the limits of the law| publisher = Springer| year = 2009| pages =93 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXrCHgUptpUC&amp;dq=%22legal+certainty%22+%22Void+for+vagueness%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-3-540-79855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the ''[[Calder v. Bull]]'' case it was established that in the U.S. the prohibition of [[ex post facto]] laws applies only to criminal cases, not to civil law.

[[Inverse problem|Inverse modeling]] is a mathematical technique where the objective is to determine the physical properties of the subsurface of an earth region that has produced a given [[seismogram]]. Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=D. A.|author2=Schneider W. A. |title=Generalized linear inversion of reflection seismic data|journal=Geophysics|date=June 1983|volume=48|issue=6|pages=665–676|doi=10.1190/1.1441497}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined it as calculation of the earth’s structure and physical [[parameters]] from some set of observed [[seismic]] data. The underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an earth structure that matches the cross-section computed from the inversion [[algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Pica1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pica|first=A.|author2=Diet J. P. |author3=Tarantola A. |title=Nonlinear inversion of seismic reflection data in a laterally invariant medium|journal=Geophysics|date=March 1990|volume=55|issue=3|pages=284–292|doi=10.1190/1.1442836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common earth properties that are inverted for include acoustic velocity, [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] and fluid [[Density|densities]], [[acoustic impedance]], [[Poisson's ratio]], formation compressibility, shear rigidity, [[porosity]], and fluid saturation.

The method has long been useful for geophysicists and can be categorized into two broad types:&lt;ref name="Earthworks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=A.M.|title=Understanding Stochastic and Seismic Inversion|journal=First Break|date=November 2006|volume=24|issue=11|doi=10.3997/1365-2397.2006026}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deterministic algorithm|Deterministic]] and [[stochastic]] inversion. Deterministic inversion methods are based on comparison of the output from an earth model with the observed field data and continuously updating the earth model parameters to minimize a function, which is usually some form of difference between model output and field observation. As such, this method of inversion to which linear inversion falls under is posed as an minimization problem and the accepted earth model is the set of model parameters that minimizes the [[objective function]] in producing a numerical seismogram which best compares with collected field seismic data.

On the other hand, stochastic inversion methods are used to generate constrained models as used in [[reservoir]] flow simulation, using geostatistical tools like [[kriging]]. As opposed to deterministic inversion methods which produce a single set of model parameters, stochastic methods generate a suite of alternate earth model parameters which all obey the model constraint. However, the two methods are related as the results of deterministic models is the average of all the possible non-unique solutions of stochastic methods.&lt;ref name="Earthworks"/&gt; Since seismic linear inversion is a deterministic inversion method, the stochastic method will not be discussed beyond this point.

== Linear inversion ==

The [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] nature of [[Inverse problem|linear inversion]] requires a [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationship which models, in terms of the earth model [[parameters]], the seismic variable to be inverted. This functional relationship is some mathematical model derived from the fundamental laws of physics and is more often called a forward model. The aim of the technique is to minimize a function which is dependent on the difference between the convolution of the forward model with a source [[wavelet]] and the field collected [[seismic trace]]. As in the field of optimization, this function to be minimized is called the [[objective function]] and in convectional inverse modeling, is simply the difference between the convolved forward model and the seismic trace. As earlier mentioned, different types of variables can be inverted for but for clarity, these variables will be referred to as the [[Wave impedance|impedance]] series of the earth model. In the following subsections we will describe in more detail, in the context of linear inversion as a minimization problem, the different components that are necessary to invert seismic data.

=== Forward model ===

The centerpiece of seismic linear inversion is the forward model which models the generation of the experimental data collected.&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; According to Wiggins (1972),&lt;ref name="wiggns1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiggins|first=Ralph|title=The general linear inverse problem: Implication of surface waves and free oscillations for Earth structure|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=251–285|doi=10.1029/RG010i001p00251}}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides a functional (computational) relationship between the model parameters and calculated values for the observed traces. Depending on the seismic data collected, this model may vary from the classical [[wave equation]]s for predicting [[particle displacement]] or fluid pressure for sound wave propagation through rock or fluids, to some variants of these classical equations. For example, the forward model in Tarantola (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarantola|first=A.|title=Linearized and inversion of seismic reflection-data|journal=Geophysical Prospecting|year=1984|volume=32|issue=6|pages=908–1015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2478.1984.tb00751.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the wave equation for pressure variation in a liquid media during seismic wave propagation while by assuming constant velocity layers with plane interfaces, Kanasewich and Chiu (1985)&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanasewich|first=E. R.|author2=Chiu S. K. L |title=Least squares inversion of spatial seismic refraction data|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|date=June 1985|volume=75|issue=3|pages=865–880|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/75/3/865.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the brachistotrone model of John Bernoulli for travel time of a [[Ray (geometry)|ray]] along a path. In Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; the model is a synthetic trace generation algorithm expressed as in Eqn. 3, where R(t) is generated in the Z-domain by recursive formula. In whatever form the forward model appears, it is important that it not only predicts the collected field data, but also models how the data is generated. Thus, the forward model by Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; can only be used to invert CMP data since the model invariably assumes no spreading loss by mimicking the response of a laterally [[homogeneous]] earth to a plane-wave source

&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;t=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\big[(x_i-x_{i-1})^2+(y_i-y_{i-1})^2+(z_i-z_{i-1})^2\big]^{\frac{1}{2}}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

where t is ray travel time, x, y, z are depth coordinates and vi is the constant velocity between interfaces i − 1 and i.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{1}{K(\vec{r})}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\nabla\cdot\big(\frac{1}{\rho(\vec{r}\big)}\nabla)\right] U(\vec{r},t)= s(\vec{r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; represent bulk modulus, &lt;math&gt;\rho(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; density, &lt;math&gt;s(\vec{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; the source of acoustic waves, and &lt;math&gt;U(\vec{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;  the pressure variation.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;s(t)=w(t)*R(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

where ''s''(''t'') = synthetic trace, ''w''(''t'') = source wavelet, and ''R''(''t'') = reflectivity function.

===Objective function===

An important numerical process in inverse modeling is to minimize the objective function, which is a function defined in terms of the difference between the collected field seismic data and the numerically computed seismic data. Classical objective functions include the sum of squared deviations between experimental and numerical data, as in the [[least squares]] methods, the sum of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the difference between field and numerical data, or some variant of these definitions. Irrespective of the definition used, numerical solution of the inverse problem is obtained as earth model that minimize the objective function.

In addition to the objective function, other constraints like known model parameters and known layer interfaces in some regions of the earth are also incorporated in the inverse modeling procedure. These constraints, according to Francis 2006,&lt;ref name="Earthworks"/&gt; help to reduce non-uniqueness of the inversion solution by providing a priori information that is not contained in the inverted data while Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; reports their useful in controlling noise and when working in a geophysically well-known area.

===Mathematical analysis of generalized linear inversion procedure===

The objective of mathematical analysis of inverse modeling is to cast the generalized linear inverse problem into a simple [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra by considering all the components described in previous sections. viz; forward model, objective function etc. Generally, the numerically generated seismic data are non-linear functions of the earth model parameters. To remove the non-linearity and create a platform for application of [[linear algebra]] concepts, the forward model is [[Linearization|linearized]] by expansion using a [[Taylor series]] as carried out below. For more details see Wiggins (1972),&lt;ref name="wiggns1972"/&gt; Cooke and Schneider (1983).&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt;

Consider a set of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; seismic field observations &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;j = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; earth model parameters &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to be inverted for, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. The field observations can be represented in either &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;F_j\,(p_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; are vectorial representations of model parameters and the field observations as a function of earth parameters. Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; representing guesses of model parameters, &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of numerical computed seismic data using the forward model of Sec. 1.3. Taylor's series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is given below.

&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p}) = \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})+(\vec{p}-\vec{q})\frac{\partial \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}}+(\vec{p}-\vec{q})^2\frac{\partial^2 \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}^2} +O(\vec{p}-\vec{q})^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

On linearization by dropping the non-linear terms (terms with (p⃗ − ⃗q) of order 2 and above), the equation becomes

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p}) - \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})=(\vec{p}-\vec{q})\frac{\partial \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Considering that &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; components and &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; components, the discrete form of Eqn. 5 results in a system of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; [[linear equation]]s in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables whose matrix form is shown below.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F} = \mathbf{A}\,\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{F} = \begin{bmatrix}F_1(\vec{p})-F_1(\vec{q})\\\vdots\\F_m(\vec{p})-F_m(\vec{q})\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p} = \vec{p}-\vec{q} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
p_1-q_1\\
\vdots	\\
p_n-q_n
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_{n-1}} &amp; \frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots	&amp;  \frac{\partial F_j(\vec{q})}{\partial p_i} &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called the difference [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] in Cooke and Schneider (1983).&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; It has a size of &lt;math&gt;m\times 1&lt;/math&gt; and its components are the difference between the observed trace and the numerically computed seismic data. &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the corrector vector of size &lt;math&gt;n\times 1&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the sensitivity matrix. It has a size of &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; and its comments are such that each column is the [[partial derivative]] of a component of the forward function with respect to one of the unknown earth model parameters. Similarly, each row is the partial derivative of a component of the numerically computed seismic trace with respect to all unknown model parameters.

===Solution algorithm===

&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed from the forward model, while &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; is the experimental data. Thus,&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a known quality. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is unknown and is obtained by solution of Eqn. 10. This equation is theoretically solvable only when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, that is, if it is a square matrix so that the number of observations &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of unknown earth parameters. If this is the case, the unknown corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, is solved for as shown below, using any of the classical direct or iterative solvers for solution of a set of linear equations.

&lt;ol start="10"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\,\Delta\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In most [[seismic inversion]] applications, there are more observations than the number of earth parameters to be inverted for, i.e. &lt;math&gt;m&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a system of equations that is mathematically over-determined. As a result, Eqn. 10 is not theoretically solvable and an exact solution is not obtainable.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt; An estimate of the corrector vector is obtained using the least squares procedure to find the corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}\,^T \vec{e}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the sum of the squares of the error, &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt;

The error&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

 &lt;ol start="11"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{e} = \Delta\vec{F}-\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In the least squares procedure, the corrector vector that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}\,^T\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as below.

&lt;ol start="12"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p} &amp;=\Delta\vec{F}\\
\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p}  &amp;= \mathbf{A}^T\Delta\vec{F}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Thus,

&lt;ol start="13"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \vec{p}  = (\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A})^{-1}\,\mathbf{A}^T\Delta\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

From the above discussions, the objective function is defined as either the &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; norm of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; given by
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n|\Delta p_j|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n|\Delta p_j|^2&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m|\Delta F_i|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m|\Delta F_i|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The generalized procedure for inverting any experimental seismic data for &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m &gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, using the mathematical theory for inverse modeling, as described above, is shown in Fig. 1 and described as follows.

An initial guess of the model impedance is provided to initiate the inversion process. The forward model uses this initial guess to compute a synthetic seismic data which is subtracted from the observed seismic data to calculate the difference vector.

# An initial guess of the model impedance &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is provided to initiate the inversion process.
# A synthetic seismic data &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed by the forward model, using the model impedance above.
# The difference vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{p})-\vec{F}(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed as the difference between experimental and synthetic seismic data.
# The sensitivity matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is computed at this value of the impedance profile.
# Using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and the difference vector from 3 above, the corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated. A new impedance profile is obtained as &lt;ol start="14"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{p}=\vec{q}+\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
# The &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; norm of the computed corrector vector is compared with a provided tolerance value. If the computed norm is less than the tolerance, the numerical procedure is concluded and the inverted impedance profile for the earth region is given by &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; from Eqn. 14. On the other hand, if the norm is greater than the tolerance, iterations through steps 2-6 are repeated but with an updated impedance profile as computed from Eqn. 14. Fig. 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=D|author2=Cant J. |title=Model-based seismic inversion: Comparing deterministic and probabilistic approaches|journal=CSEG Recorder|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a typical example of impedance profile updating during successive iteration process. According to Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; use of the corrected guess from Eqn. 14 as the new initial guess during iteration reduces the error.

==Parameterization of the earth model space==

Irrespective of the variable to be inverted for, the earth’s impedance is a continuous function of depth (or time in seismic data) and for numerical linear inversion technique to be applicable for this continuous physical model, the continuous properties have to be discretized and/or sampled at discrete intervals along the depth of the earth model. Thus, the total depth over which model properties are to be determined is a necessary starting point for the discretization. Commonly, as shown in Fig. 3, this properties are sampled at close discrete intervals over this depth to ensure high resolution of impedance variation along the earth’s depth. The impedance values inverted from the [[algorithm]] represents the average value in the discrete interval.

Considering that inverse modeling problem is only theoretically solvable when the number of discrete intervals for sampling the properties is equal to the number of observation in the trace to be inverted, a high-resolution sampling will lead to a large matrix which will be very expensive to invert. Furthermore, the matrix may be singular for dependent equations, the inversion can be unstable in the presence of noise and the system may be under-constrained if parameters other than the primary variables inverted for, are desired. In relation to parameters desired, other than impedance, Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; gives them to include source wavelet and scale factor.

Finally, by treating constraints as known impedance values in some layers or discrete intervals, the number of unknown impedance values to be solved for are reduced, leading to greater accuracy in the results of the inversion algorithm.

==Inversion examples==

===Temperature inversion from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;===

We start with an example to invert for earth parameter values from temperature depth distribution in a given earth region. Although this example does not directly relate to [[seismic inversion]] since no traveling acoustic waves are involved, it nonetheless introduces practical application of the inversion technique in a manner easy to comprehend, before moving on to seismic applications. In this example, the temperature of the earth is measured at discrete locations in a well bore by placing temperature sensors in the target depths. By assuming a forward model of linear distribution of temperature with depth, two parameters are inverted for from the temperature depth measurements.

The forward model is given by
&lt;ol start="15"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q}) = \vec{T} = a+bz&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{q} = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is 2 i.e. the number of parameters inverted for is 2.

The objective of this inversion algorithm is to find &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the value of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the difference between the observed temperature distribution and those obtained using the forward model of Eqn. 15. Considering the dimension of the forward model or the number of temperature observations to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the components of the forward model is written as

&lt;ol start="16"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_1&amp;=a+bz_1		\\
T_2&amp;=a+bz_2	\\
\vdots	\\
T_{n-1}&amp;=a+bz_{n-1}		\\
T_n&amp;=a+bz_n	\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q}) = T&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; z_1  \\
1 &amp; z_2  \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots	\\
1 &amp; z_{n-1}  \\
1 &amp; z_n  \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

We present results from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marescot|first=Laurent|title=Introduction to Inversion in Geophysics|url=http://www.tomoquest.com|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the case of &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; for which the observed temperature values at depths were &lt;math&gt;T_1 = 19 ^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=2m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2=22^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=8m&lt;/math&gt;. These experimental data were inverted to obtain earth parameter values of &lt;math&gt;a = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=18^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt;. For a more general case with large number of temperature observations, Fig. 4 shows the final linear forward model obtained from using the inverted values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The figure shows a good match between experimental and numerical data.

===Wave travel time inversion from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;===

This examples inverts for earth layer [[velocity]] from recorded seismic wave travel times. Fig. 5 shows the initial velocity guesses and the travel times recorded from the field, while Fig. 6a shows the inverted [[heterogeneous]] velocity model, which is the solution of the inversion algorithm obtained after 30 [[iteration]]s. As seen in Fig. 6b, there is good comparison between the final travel times obtained from the forward model using the inverted velocity and the field record travel times. Using these solutions, the ray path was reconstructed and is shown to be highly tortuous through the earth model as shown in Fig. 7.

===Seismic trace inversion from Cooke and Schneider (1983)===

This example, taken from Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; shows inversion of a CMP seismic trace for earth model impedance (product of density and velocity) profile. The seismic trace inverted is shown in Fig. 8 while Fig. 9a shows the inverted impedance profile with the input initial impedance used for the inversion algorithm. Also recorded alongside the seismic trace is an impedance log of the earth region as shown in Fig. 9b. The figures show good comparison between the recorded impedance log and the numerical inverted impedance from the seismic trace.

The term '''linguistic performance''' was used by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1960 to describe "the actual use of language in concrete situations".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, P. H. "performance." Oxford Reference. 30 Oct. 2014. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-2494.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used to describe both the [[Language production|production]], sometimes called '' parole'', as well as the comprehension of language.&lt;ref name =":Reishaan"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Reishaan| first = Abdul-Hussein Kadhim| authorlink = Abdul-Hussein Kadhim Reishaan| title = The Relationship between Competence and Performance: Towards a Comprehensive TG Grammar| journal = اداب الكـوفة | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | date = 2008 | url = http://www.journals.uokufa.edu.iq/index.php/kufa_arts/article/download/108/pdf_20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance is defined in opposition to "[[Linguistic competence|competence]]"; the latter describes the mental knowledge that a speaker or listener has of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Carlson| first = Marvin| author-link = Marvin Carlson | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction| edition = revised| publisher = Routledge| year = 2013| url = https://books.google.com/?id=9MJdAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=linguistic+performance| isbn = 9781136498657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the motivation for the distinction between performance and competence comes from [[speech error]]s: despite having a perfect understanding of the correct forms, a speaker of a language may unintentionally produce incorrect forms. This is because performance occurs in real situations, and so is subject to many non-linguistic influences. For example, distractions or memory limitations can affect lexical retrieval (Chomsky 1965:3), and give rise to errors in both production and perception&lt;ref name =":Myers"&gt;{{Citation| last = Myers| first = David G.| author-link = David G.

Such non-linguistic factors are completely independent of the actual knowledge of language,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Noam Chomsky.(2006).''Language and Mind Third Edition''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-85819-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establish that speakers' knowledge of language (their competence) is distinct from their actual use of language (their performance).&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1965 4"&gt;{{Citation| last = Chomsky| first = Noam| author-link = Noam Chomsky| title = Aspects of the Theory of Syntax| publisher =| year = 1965| page = 4| isbn = 0-262-53007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Langue versus parole ===
{{main|Langue and parole}}Published in 1916, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' describes [[language]] as ''"a system of signs that express ideas".''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  de Saussure describes two components of language: [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']]. ''Langue'' consists of the structural relations that define a language, which includes [[grammar]], [[syntax]] and [[phonology]]. ''Parole'' is the physical manifestation of [[sign (linguistics)|sign]]s; in particular the concrete manifestation of ''langue'' as [[speech]] or [[writing]]. While ''langue'' can be viewed strictly as a system of rules, it is not an absolute system such that ''parole'' must utterly conform to ''langue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Image and Representation: Key Concepts in Media Studies|last = Lacey|first = Nick|publisher = Palgrave|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing an analogy to chess, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|de Saussure]] compares ''langue'' to the rules of chess that define how the game should be played, and ''parole'' to the individual choices of a player given the possible moves allowed within the system of rules.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Competence versus performance ===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}

Proposed in the 1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]], [[generative grammar]] is an analysis approach to language as a structural framework of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;A Chomsky, Noam (1956). "Three Models for the Description of Language". IRE Transactions on Information Theory 2 (2): 113 123.doi:10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813.&lt;/ref&gt; Through formal analysis of components such as [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[semantics]] and [[phonology]], a [[generative grammar]] seeks to model the implicit linguistic knowledge with which speakers determine [[grammaticality]].

In [[transformational grammar|transformational generative grammar theory]], [[Chomsky]] distinguishes between two components of [[language production]]: [[Linguistic competence|competence]] and performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Linguistic competence|Competence]] describes the mental knowledge of a language, the speaker's intrinsic understanding of sound-meaning relations as established by linguistic rules. '''Performance''' – that is the actual observed use of language – involves more factors than phonetic-semantic understanding. Performance requires extra-linguistic knowledge such as an awareness of the speaker, audience and the context, which crucially determines how speech is constructed and analyzed. It is also governed by principles of cognitive structures not considered aspects of language, such as [[memory]], [[distractions]], [[attention]], and [[speech errors]].

=== I-Language versus E-Language ===
In 1986, [[Chomsky]] proposed a distinction similar to the competence/performance distinction, entertaining the notion of an [[i-language|I-Language (internal language)]] which is the intrinsic linguistic knowledge within a native speaker and [[E-language|E-Language (external language)]] which is the observable linguistic output of a speaker. It was I-Language that [[Chomsky]] argued should be the focus of inquiry, and not E-Language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1986).Knowledge of Language. New York:Praeger. {{ISBN|0-275-90025-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

E-language has been used to describe the application of artificial systems, such as in [[calculus]], [[set theory]] and with [[natural language]] viewed as sets, while performance has been used purely to describes applications of natural language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chomsky: Ideas and Ideals|last = Smith|first = Neilson Voyne|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between I-Language and [[Linguistic competence|competence]], I-Language refers to our intrinsic faculty for language, competence is used by Chomsky as an informal, general term, or as term with reference to a specific competency such as "grammatical competence" or "pragmatic competence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Performance-grammar correspondence hypothesis==

[[John A. Hawkins (linguist)|John A. Hawkins]]'s Performance-Grammar Correspondence Hypothesis (PGCH) states that the syntactic structures of [[grammar]]s are conventionalized based on whether and how much the structures are preferred in performance.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=John A.|title=Efficiency and Complexity in Grammars|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-199-25268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance preference is related to structure complexity and [[sentence processing|processing]], or comprehension, efficiency.  Specifically, a complex structure refers to a structure containing more linguistic elements or words at the end of the structure than at the beginning. It is this structural complexity that results in decreased processing efficiency since more structure requires additional processing.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt; This model seeks to explain word order across languages based on avoidance of unnecessary complexity in favour of increased processing efficiency. Speakers make an automatic calculation of the [[Immediate constituent analysis|Immediate Constituent(IC)]]-to-word order ratio and produce the structure with the highest ratio.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;  Structures with a high IC-to-word order are structures that contain the fewest number of words required for the listener to parse the structure into constituents which results in more efficient processing.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

===Head-initial structures===
In [[head (linguistics)|head-initial structures]], which includes example [[Subject-verb-object|SVO]] and VSO word order, the speaker's goal is to order the sentence constituents from least to most complex.

====SVO word order====
SVO word order can be exemplified with English; consider the example sentences in (1). In (1a) three immediate constituents (ICs) are present in the [[verb phrase]], namely VP, PP1 and PP2, and there are four words (''went, to, London, in'') required to parse the VP into its constituents. Therefore, the IC-to-word ratio is 3/4=75%. In contrast, in (1b) the VP is still composed of three ICs but there are now six words that are required to determine the constituent structure of the VP (''went, in, the, late, afternoon, to''). Thus, the ratio for (1b) is 3/6 = 50%. Hawkins proposes that speakers prefer to produce (1a) since it has a higher IC-to-word ratio and this leads to faster and more efficient processing.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

   1a.  ''John'' [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; '''''went''''' [&lt;sub&gt;PP1&lt;/sub&gt; '''''to London'''''] [&lt;sub&gt;PP2&lt;/sub&gt; '''''in''' the late afternoon'']]
   1b.  ''John'' [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; '''''went''''' [&lt;sub&gt;PP2&lt;/sub&gt; '''''in the late afternoon''''']] [[&lt;sub&gt;PP1&lt;/sub&gt; '''''to''' London'']]

Hawkins supports the above analysis by providing performance data to demonstrate the preference speakers have for ordering short phrases before long phrases when producing head-initial structures. The table based on English data, below, illustrates that the short [[Preposition and postposition|prepositional phrase]] (PP1) is preferentially ordered before the long PP (PP2) and that this preference increases as the size differential between the two PPs increases.  For example, 60% of the sentences are ordered short (PP1) to long (PP2) when PP2 was longer than PP1 by 1 word. In contrast, 99% of the sentences are ordered short to long when PP2 is longer than PP1 by 7+ words.

a percentage; actual numbers of sequences in parentheses. An additional 
71 sequences had PPs of equal length (total n=394)&lt;/small&gt;

====VSO word order====
Hawkins argues that the preference for short followed by long phrases applies to all languages that have head-initial structuring. This includes languages with [[Verb-subject-object|VSO]] word order such as from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].  By calculating the IC-to-word ratio for the Hungarian sentences in the same way as was done for the [[English language|English]] sentences, 2a. emerges as having a higher ratio than 2b.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

  2a.  ''VP['''Döngetik''' NP['''facipöink''' NP['''az''' utcakat] ]''
         ''batter   wooden shoes-1PL  the streets-ACC''
         ''Our wooden shoes batter the streets''
  2b.  ''VP['''Döngetik''' NP['''az utcakat'''] NP[[ '''facipöink''' ] ]''

The Hungarian performance data (below) show the same preference pattern as the English data. This study looked at the ordering of two successive [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) and found that the shorter NP followed by the longer NP is preferred in performance, and that this preference increases as the size differential between NP1 and NP2 increases.

to long-short given as a percentage; actual numbers of sequences 
given in parentheses. An additional 21 sequences had NPs of equal length
(total n = 16).&lt;/small&gt;

===Head-final structures===
Hawkins' explanation of performance and word order extends to head-final structures. For example, since [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a [[subject-object-verb|SOV]] language the head (V) is at the end of the sentence. This theory predicts that speakers will prefer to order the phrases in head-final sentences from long phrases to short, as opposed to short to long as seen in head-initial languages.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;  This reversal of ordering preference is due to the fact that in head-final sentences it is the long followed by short phrasal ordering that has the higher IC-to-word ratio.

   3a. ''Tanaka ga vp[pp[Hanako '''kara''']np['''sono''' '''hon o'''] '''katta''']''
       ''Tanaka NOM  Hanako from that book ACC bought''
        ''Tanako bought that book from Hanako'' 
   3b. ''Tanaka ga vp[np[sono hon '''o'''] pp['''Hanako kara'''] ['''katta''']''

The VP and its constituents in 4. are constructed from their heads on the right. This means that the number of words used to calculate the ratio is counted from the head of the first phrase (PP in 3a. and NP in 3b.) to the verb (as indicated in bold above). The IC-to-word ratio for the VP in 3a. is 3/5=60% while the ratio for the VP in 3b. is 3/4=75%. Therefore, 3b. should be preferred by Japanese speakers since it has a higher IC-to-word ratio which leads to faster parsing of sentences by the listener.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

The performance preference for long to short phrase ordering in SVO languages is supported by performance data. The table below shows that production of long to short phrases is preferred and that this preference increases as the size of the differential between the two phrases increases. For example, ordering of the longer 2ICm (where ICm is either a direct object NP with an accusative case particle or a PP constructed from the right periphery) before the shorter 1ICm is more frequent, and the frequency increases to 91% if the 2ICm is longer than the 1ICm by 9+ words.

Proportion of long-to short to short-long orders given as a percentage; actual numbers of sequences in parentheses. an additional 91 sequences had ICs of equal length (total n=244)&lt;/small&gt;

==Utterance planning hypothesis==

[[Tom Wasow]] proposes that word order arises as a result of utterance planning benefiting the speaker.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasow|first=Thomas|title=Postverbal behavior|year=2002|publisher=Centre for the Study of Language and Information|volume =lecture notes, No. 145|isbn=978-1-57586-401-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduces the concepts of early versus late commitment, where commitment is the point in the utterance where it becomes possible to predict subsequent structure.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; Specifically, early commitment refers to the commitment point present earlier in the utterance and late commitment refers to the commitment point present later in the utterance.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; He explains that early commitment will favour the listener since early prediction of subsequent structure enables faster processing.  Comparatively, late commitment will favour the speaker by postponing decision making, giving the speaker more time to plan the utterance.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; Wasow illustrates how utterance planning influences syntactic word order by testing early versus late commitment in [[Heavy NP shift|heavy-NP shifted]] (HNPS) sentences. The idea is to examine the patterns of HNPS to determine if the performance data show sentences that are structured to favour the speaker or the listener.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt;

===Examples of early/late commitment and heavy-NP shift===

The following examples illustrate what is meant by early versus late commitment and how heavy-NP shift applies to these sentences. Wasow looked at two types of verbs:&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt;

Vt ([[transitive verbs]]): require NP objects.

     4a. ''Pat VP[brought NP[a box with a ribbon around it] PP[ [to the party] ] ''
     4b. ''Pat VP[brought PP[to the party] NP[ [a box with a ribbon around it] ] ''

In 4a. no heavy-NP shift has been applied.  The NP is available early but does not provide any additional information about the sentence structure – the "to" appearing late in the sentence is an example of late commitment. In contrast, in 4b., where heavy-NP shift has shifted the NP to the right, as soon as "to" is uttered the listener knows that the VP must contain the NP and a PP. In other words, when "to" is uttered it allows the listener to predict the remaining structure of the sentence early on. Thus for transitive verbs HNPS results in early commitment and favors the listener.

Vp ([[prepositional verbs]]): can take an NP object or an immediately following PP with no NP object

     5a. ''Pat VP[wrote NP[something about Chris] PP[ [on the blackboard]].''
     5b. ''Pat VP[wrote PP[on the blackboard] NP[ [something about Chris.]] ''

No HNPS has been applied to 5a. In 5b. the listener needs to hear the word "something" in order to know that the utterance contains a PP and an NP since the object NP is optional but "something" has been shifted to later in the sentence. Thus for prepositional verbs HNPS results in late commitment and favours the speaker.

===Predictions and findings===

Based on the above information Wasow predicted that if sentences are constructed from the speaker's perspective then heavy-NP shift would rarely apply to sentences containing a transitive verb but would apply frequently to sentences containing a prepositional verb. The opposite prediction was made if sentences are constructed from the listener's perspective.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt;

{|  class="wikitable"
|-
!       !!Speaker's Perspective    !! Listener's Perspective
|-
| Vt    ||Heavy-NP shift= rare                || Heavy-NP shift= relatively common
|-
| Vp    ||Heavy-NP shift= relatively common   || Heavy-NP shift =very rare

To test his predictions Wasow analyzed performance data (from corpora data) for the rates of occurrence of HNPS for Vt and Vp and found HNPS occurred twice as frequently in Vp than in Vt, therefore supporting the predictions made from the speaker's perspective.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; In contrast, he did not find evidence in support of the predictions made based on the listener's perspective. In other words, given the data above, when HNPS is applied to sentences containing a transitive verb the result favors the listener. Wasow found that HNPS applied to transitive verb sentences is rare in performance data thus supporting the speaker's perspective. Additionally, when HNPS is applied to prepositional verb structures the result favors the speaker. In his study of the performance data, Wasow found evidence of HNPS frequently applied to prepositional verb structures further supporting the speaker's perspective.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; Based on these findings Wasow concludes that HNPS is correlated with the speaker's preference for late commitment thereby demonstrating how speaker performance preference can influence word order.

==Alternative grammar models==
While the dominant views of grammar are largely oriented towards competence, many, including Chomsky himself, have argued that a complete model of grammar should be able to account for performance data.  But while Chomsky argues that competence should be studied first, thereby allowing further study of performance,&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1965 4"/&gt; some systems, such as [[constraint grammar]]s are built with performance as a starting point (comprehension, in the case of constraint grammars&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Karlsson | first = Fred | author-link = Fred Karlsson | last2 = Voutilainen | first2 =  Atro  | author2-link =  Atro Voutilainen|last3 = Heikkilae|first3 = Juha|author-link3 = Juha Heikkilae|last4 = Anttila|first4 = Arto|author-link4 = | title = Constraint Grammar: A Language-Independent System for Parsing Unrestricted Text  | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | origyear = |date=January 1995  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=2avNr3SPtyEC&amp;dq=Constraint+Grammar:+A+Language-Independent+System+for+Parsing+Unrestricted+Text | isbn = 9783110882629}}&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional models of generative grammar have had a great deal of success in describing the structure of languages, they have been less successful in describing how language is interpreted in real situations.  For example, traditional grammar describes a sentence as having an "underlying structure" which is different from the "surface structure" which speakers actually produce.  In a real conversation, however, a listener interprets the meaning of a sentence in real time, as the surface structure goes by.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sag, I. A. &amp; Wasow, T., 2011. [https://www.academia.edu/download/39233619/0fcfd50d1eb7c4aa9d000000.pdf Performance-Compatible Competence Grammar]. In: R. Borsley &amp; K. Börjars, eds. Non-Transformational Syntax: Formal and Explicit Models of Grammar. s.l.:John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 359-377.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of on-line processing, which accounts for phenomena such as finishing another person's sentence, and starting a sentence without knowing how it is going to finish, is not directly accounted for in traditional generative models of grammar.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Several alternative grammar models exist which may be better able to capture this surface-based aspect of linguistic performance, including
[[Constraint Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]].

==Errors in linguistic performance==

Errors in linguistic performance not only occur in children newly acquiring their native language, second language learners, those with a disability or an acquired brain injury but among competent speakers as well. Types of performance errors that will be of focus here are those that involve errors in [[syntax]], other types of errors can occur in the [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Semantics|semantic]] features of words, for further information see [[speech errors]]. Phonological and semantic errors can be due to the repetition of words, mispronunciations, limitations in verbal [[working memory]], and length of the [[utterance]].&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Crain|author2=Rosalind Thornton|title=Investigations in Universal Grammar: A Guide to Experiments on the Acquisition of Syntax and Semantics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwDS0vlTepwC|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-53180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slips of the tongue are most common in spoken languages and occur when the speaker either: says something they did not mean to; produces the incorrect order of sounds or words; or uses the incorrect word.&lt;ref name="Menn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lise Menn|title=Psycholinguistics: Introduction and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1F6GQAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Plural Pub.|isbn=978-1-59756-283-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of errors in linguistic performance are slips of the hand in [[Sign language|signed languages]], slips of the ear which are errors in comprehension of utterances and slips of the pen which occur while writing. Errors of linguistic performance are perceived by both the speaker and the listener and can therefore have many interpretations depending on the persons judgement and the context in which the sentence was spoken.&lt;ref name="SanzLaka2013p002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montserrat Sanz|author2=Itziar Laka|author3=Michael K. Tanenhaus|title=Language Down the Garden Path: The Cognitive and Biological Basis for Linguistic Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YhuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2|date=29 August 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967713-9|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is proposed that there is a close relation between the linguistic units of grammar and the psychological units of speech which implies that there is a relation between linguistic rules and the psychological processes that create utterances.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Fromkin|title=Errors in linguistic performance: slips of the tongue, ear, pen, and hand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UG95AAAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-268980-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in performance can occur at any level of these psychological processes. [[Lise Menn]] proposes that there are five levels of processing in speech production, each with its own possible error that could occur.&lt;ref name="Menn2011"/&gt; According to the proposed speech processing structure by Menn an error in the syntactic properties of an utterance occurs at the '''positional level'''.
#Message Level
#Functional Level
#Positional Level
#Phonological Encoding
#Speech Gesture

Another proposal for the levels of speech processing is made by [[Willem Levelt|Willem J. M. Levelt]] to be structured as so:&lt;ref name="Levelt1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem J. M. Levelt|title=Speaking: From Intention to Articulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbVCdCE-NQAC|year=1993|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-62089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Conceptualization
#Formulation
#Articulation
#Self-Monitoring
Levelt (1993) states that we as speakers are unaware of most of these levels of performance such as '''articulation''', which includes the [[Manner of articulation|movement]] and [[Place of articulation|placement]] of the articulators, the '''formulation''' of the utterance which includes the words selected and their pronunciation and the rules which must be followed for the utterance to be grammatical. The levels speakers are consciously aware is the intent of the message which occurs at the level of '''conceptualization''' and then again at '''self-monitoring''' which is when the speaker would become aware of any errors that may have occurred and correct themselves.&lt;ref name="Levelt1993"/&gt;

===Slips of the tongue===

One type of slip of the tongue which cause an error in the syntax of the utterance are called '''transformational errors'''. [[Transformational grammar|Transformational]] errors are a mental operation proposed by [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] in his Transformational Hypothesis and it has three parts which errors in performance can occur. These transformations are applied at the level of the underlying structures and predict the ways in which an error can occur.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; 
*Structural analysis
*Structural Change
*Conditions

'''Structural Analysis'''
errors can occur due to the application of (a) the rule misanalyzing the tense marker causing the rule to apply incorrectly, (b) the rule not being applied when it should or (c) a rule being applied when it should not.

This example from [[Victoria Fromkin|Fromkin]] (1980) demonstrates a rule misanalyzing the tense marker and for subject-auxiliary inversion to be incorrectly applied. The [[subject-auxiliary inversion]] is misanalyzed as to which structure it applies, applying without the verb ''be'' in the tense as it moves to the C position. This causes "[[do-support]]" to occur and the verb to lack tense causing the syntactic error.

The following example from Fromkin (1980) demonstrates how a rule is being applied when it should not. The subject-auxiliary inversion rule is omitted in the error utterance, causing affix-hopping to occur and putting the tense onto the verb "say" creating the syntactic error. In the target the subject-auxiliary rule and then do-support applies creating the grammatically correct structure.
     7a. Error: And what he said?
     7b. Target: And what did he say?

'''Structural Change'''
Errors can occur in the carrying out of rules, even though the analysis of the phrase marker is done correctly. This can occur when the analysis requires multiple rules to occur.

The following example from Fromkin (1980) shows the relative clause rule copies the [[determiner phrase]] "a boy" within the [[Relative clause|clause]] and this causes front attaching to the Wh-marker. Deletion is then skipped, leaving the determiner phrase in the clause in the error utterance causing it to be ungrammatical. 
     9a. Error: A boy who I know a boy has hair down to here.
     9b. Target: A boy who I know has hair down to here.

'''Conditions''' errors restrict when the rule can and cannot be applied.

This last example from Fromkin (1980) shows that a rule was applied under a certain condition in which it is restricted. The subject-auxiliary inversion rule cannot apply to embedded clauses. In the case of this example it has causing for the syntactic error.

===Slips of the hand===
The linguistic components of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) can be broken down into four parts; the hand configuration, place of articulation, movement and other minor parameters. '''Hand configuration''' is determined by the shape of the hand, fingers and thumbs and is specific to the sign that is being used. It allows the signer to articulate what they are wanting to communicate by extending, flexing, bending or spreading the digits; the position of the thumb to the fingers; or the curvature of the hand. However, there are not an infinite amount of possible hand configurations, there are 19 classes of hand configuration primes as listed by the ''Dictionary of American Sign Language''. '''Place of articulation''' is the particular location that the sign is being performed known as the "signing place". The "signing place" can be the whole face or a particular part of it, the eyes, nose, cheek, ear, neck, trunk, any part of the arm, or the neutral area in front of the signers head and body. '''Movement''' is the most complex as it can be difficult to analyze. Movement is restricted to directional, rotations of the wrist, local movements of the hand and interactions of the hands. These movements can occur singularly, in sequence, or simultaneously. '''Minor parameters''' in ASL include contacting region, orientation and hand arrangement. They are subclasses of hand configuration.
 
Performance errors resulting in ungrammatical signs can result due to processes that change the hand configuration, place, movement or other parameter of the sign. These processes can be anticipation, preservation, or metathesis. '''Anticipation''' is caused when some characteristic of the next sign is incorporated into the sign that is presently being performed. '''Preservation''' is the opposite of anticipation where some characteristic of the preceding sign is carried over into the performance of the next sign. '''Metathesis''' occurs when two characteristics of adjacent signs are combined into one in the performance of both signs.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; Each of these errors will result in an incorrect sign being performed. This could result in either a different sign being performed instead of the intended one, or nonexistent signs which forms are possible and those which forms are not possible due to the structural rules.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; These are the main types of performance errors in sign language however on the rare occasion there is also the possibility of errors in the order of the signs performed resulting in a different meaning than what the signer intended.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt;

===Other types of errors===
'''Unacceptable Sentences'''
are ones which, although are grammatical, are not considered proper utterances. They are considered unacceptable due to the lack of our cognitive systems to process them. Speakers and listeners can be aided in the performance and processing of these sentences by eliminating time and memory constraints, increasing motivation to process these utterances and using pen and paper.&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt; In English there are three types of sentences that are grammatical but are considered unacceptable by speakers and listeners.&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt;
# Repeated self-embedded clauses: ''The cheese that the rat that the cat chased ate is on the table.''
# Multi Right Branching: ''This is the cat that caught the rat that ate the cheese that is on the table.''
# Ambiguity or Garden Path Sentences: ''The horse raced past the barn fell''
When a speaker makes an utterance they must translate their ideas into words, then syntactically proper phrases with proper pronunciation.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael W. Eysenck|author2=Mark T. Keane|title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk21ehtrE8oC|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-86377-550-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker must have prior world knowledge and an understanding of the grammatical rules that their language enforces. When learning a second language or with children acquiring their first language, speakers usually have this knowledge before they are able to produce them.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2000"/&gt; Their speech is usually slow and deliberate, using phrases they have already mastered, and with practice their skills increase. Errors of linguistic performance are judged by the listener giving many interpretations if an utterance is well-formed or ungrammatical depending on the individual. As well the context in which an utterance is used can determine if the error would be considered or not.&lt;ref name="SanzLaka2013p258"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montserrat Sanz|author2=Itziar Laka|author3=Michael K. Tanenhaus|title=Language Down the Garden Path: The Cognitive and Biological Basis for Linguistic Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YhuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|date=29 August 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967713-9|pages=258–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing "Who must telephone her?" and "Who need telephone her?" the former would be considered the ungrammatical phrase. However, when comparing it to "Who want telephone her?" it would be considered the grammatical phrase.&lt;ref name="SanzLaka2013p258" /&gt; The listener may also be the speaker. When repeating sentences with errors if the error is not comprehended then it is performed. As well if the speaker does notice the error in the sentence they are supposed to repeat they are unaware of the difference between their well-formed sentence and the ungrammatical sentence.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt;
An unacceptable utterance can also be performed due to a brain injury. Three types of brain injuries that could cause errors in performance were studied by Fromkin are dysarthria, apraxia and literal paraphasia. [[Dysarthria]] is a defect in the [[neuromuscular]] connection that involves speech movement. The speech organs involved can be paralyzed or weakened, making it difficult or impossible for the speaker to produce a target utterance. [[Apraxia]] is when there is damage to the ability to initiate speech sounds with no paralysis or weakening of the articulators. Literal [[paraphasia]] causes disorganization of linguistic properties, resulting in errors of [[word order]] of [[phonemes]].&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; Having a brain injury and being unable to perform proper linguistic utterances, some individuals are still able to process complex sentences and formulate syntactically well formed sentences in their mind.&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt;
'''Child productions''' when they are acquiring language are full of errors of linguistic performance. Children must go from imitating adult speech to create new phrases of their own. They will need to use their cognitive operations of the knowledge of their language they are learning to determine the rules and properties of that language.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2000"/&gt; The following are examples of errors in English speaking children's productions.

==Performance measures==

===Mean length of utterance===

The most commonly used measure of syntax complexity is the [[mean length of utterance]], also known as MLU.&lt;ref name="Scott, CM pp. 309-320"&gt;Scott, CM &amp; Stokes, SL 1995 'Measures of Syntax in School Age Children and Adolescents', ''Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools'', vol.56, pp. 309-320&lt;/ref&gt;    This measure is independent from how often children talk and focuses on the complexity and development of their grammatical systems, including morphological and syntactic development.&lt;ref name="Cymerman, E 2002, pp. 337"&gt;Huttenlocher, J, Vasilyeva, M, 
Cymerman, E &amp; Levine, S 2002, 'Language input and child syntax', ''Cognitive Psychology'', vol. 45, pp. 337–374.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number representing a person's MLU corresponds to the complexity of the syntax being used.  In general, as the MLU increases, the syntactic complexity also increases.  Typically, the average MLU corresponds to a child's age due to their increase in working memory, which allows for sentences to be of greater syntactic complexity.&lt;ref name="everydaylanguage.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu"&gt;Everyday Language Discovering the Hidden Powers of Speech and Language 2014, ''Morphology and MLU''.  Available from: &lt;http://everydaylanguage.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/2014/03/08/morphology-and-mlu/&gt;. [12 November 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the average MLU of a 7 year old child is 7 words.  However, children show more individual variability of syntactic performance with more complex syntax.&lt;ref name="Cymerman, E 2002, pp. 337"/&gt; Complex syntax have a higher number of phrases and clause levels, therefore adding more words to the overall syntactic structure.  Seeing as there are more individual differences in MLU and syntactic development as children get older, MLU is particularly used to measure grammatical complexity among school-aged children.&lt;ref name="Cymerman, E 2002, pp. 337"/&gt;  Other types of segmentation strategies for discourse are the [[T-unit]] and C-unit (communicative unit).  If these two measurements are used to account for discourse, the average length of the sentence will be lower than if MLU is used alone.  Both the T-units and C-units count each clause as a new unit, hence a lower number of units.

Typical MLU per age group can be found in the following table, according to [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]]'s five stages of syntactic and morphological development:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R 1973, ''A first language: The early stages'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage !! MLU !! Approximate Age (in months)
|-
| 1 || 1.0-2.0 || 12-26
|-
| 2 || 2.0-2.5 || 27-30
|-
| 3 || 2.5-3.0 || 31-34
|-
| 4 || 3.0-3.75 || 35-40
|-
| 5 || 3.75-4.5 || 41-46
|-
| 6 || 4.5+ || 47+
|}
Here are the steps for calculating MLU:&lt;ref name="everydaylanguage.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu"/&gt;

# Acquire a language sample of about 50-100 utterances
# Count the number of [[morphemes]] said by the child, then divide by the number of utterances
# The investigator can assess what stage of syntactic development the child is at, based on their MLU

Here's an example of how to calculate MLU:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Example utterance !! Morpheme and MLU Analysis !! Total MLU
|-
| go home now || go (=1) home (=1) now (=1) || 3
|-
| I live in Billingham || I (=1) live (=1)  in (=1) Billingham (=1) || 4
|-
| Mommy kissed my Daddy || Mommy (=1) kiss (=1) -ed (=1) my (=1) daddy (=1) || 5
|-
| I like your dogs || I (=1) like (=1) your (=1) dog (=1) -s (=1) || 5
|}

In total there are 17 morphemes in this data set.  In order to find the MLU, we divide the total number of morphemes (17) by the total number of utterances (4). In this particular data set, the mean length of utterance is 17/4 = 4.25.&lt;ref&gt;Speech Language Therapy Info 2014, ''Mean Length of Utterance''.  Available from: &lt;http://www.sltinfo.com/mean-length-of-utterance/&gt;. [12 November 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clause density===

Clause density refers to the degree to which utterances contain dependent [[clauses]].  This density is calculated as a ratio of the total number of clauses across sentences, divide by the number of sentences in a discourse sample.&lt;ref name="Scott, CM pp. 309-320"/&gt;  For example, if the clause density is 2.0, the ratio would indicate that the sentence being analyzed has 2 clauses on average: one main clause and one subordinate clause.

Here is an example of how clause density is measured, using T-units, adapted from Silliman &amp; Wilkinson 2007:&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, ER &amp; Wilkinson, LC 2007, ''Language and Literacy Learning in Schools''. The Guilford Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! T-unit !! Number of words !! Number of clauses !! Example sentences from a story
|-
| 1 || 12 || 2 || When the night was dark I was watching TV in my room
|-
| 2 || 5 || 1 || I heard a howling noise
|-
| 3 || 3 || 1 || I looked outside
|}

===Indices of syntactic performance===

Indices track structures to show a more comprehensive picture of a person's syntactic complexity.  Some examples of indices are Development Sentence Scoring, the Index of Productive Syntax and the Syntactic Complexity Measure.

====Developmental sentence scoring====
Developmental Sentence Scoring is another method to measure syntactic performance as a clinical tool.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"&gt;Rheinhardt, KM 1972, 'The Developmental Sentence Scoring Procedure', ''Independent Studies and Capstones'', vol. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this indice, each consecutive utterance, or sentence, elicited from a child is scored.&lt;ref&gt;Politzer, RL, 1974, 'Developmental Sentence Scoring as a Method of Measuring Second Language Acquisition', ''Modern Language Journal'', vol. 58, no. 5/6, pp. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a commonly applied measurement of syntax for first and [[Second-language acquisition|second language]] learners, with samples gathered from both elicited and spontaneous oral discourse.  Methods for eliciting speech for these samples come in many forms, such having the participant answering questions or re-telling a story.  These elicited conversations are commonly tape-recorded for playback during analysis to see how well the person can incorporate syntax among other linguistic cues.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  For every utterance elicited, the utterance will receive one point if it is a correct form used in adult speech.  A score of 1 indicates the least complex syntactic form in the category, whereas a higher score reflects higher level grammaticality.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  Points are specifically awarded to an utterance based on whether or not it contains any of the eight categories outlined below.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;

Syntactic categories measured by developmental sentence scoring with examples:

   '''[[Indefinite pronouns]]'''
   11a. '''Score of 1:''' it, this, that
   11b. '''Score of 6:''' both, many, several, most, least

   '''Personal [[pronouns]]'''
   12a. '''Score of 1:''' I, me, my, mine, you, your(s)
   12b. '''Score of 6:''' Wh-pronouns (i.e. who, which, what, how) and wh-word + [[infinitive]] (i.e. I know ''what'' to do)

   '''Main [[verb]]'''
   13a. '''Score of 1:''' Uninflected verb (i.e. I "see" you) and copula, is or 's (i.e. It'' 's'' red)
   13b. '''Score of 6:''' Must, shall + verb (i.e. He "must come" or We "shall see"), have + verb + '-en' (i.e. I ''have eaten'')

   '''Secondary [[verb]]'''
   14a. '''Score of 1:''' [[Infinitival]] complements (i.e. I wan"na see" = I want ''to see'')
   14b. '''Score of 6:''' [[Gerund]] (i.e. ''Swinging'' is fun)

   '''Negatives'''
   15a. '''Score of 1:''' it, this or that + [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] or [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] 'is' or 's + not (i.e. It's "not" mine)
   15b. '''Score of 5:''' Uncontracted negative with 'have' (i.e. I have "not" eaten it), auxiliary'have'-negative contraction (i.e. I had"n't" eaten 
        it), pronoun auxiliary 'have' contraction (i.e. I've "not" eaten it)

   '''[[Conjunctions]]'''
   16a. '''Score of 1:''' and 
   16b. '''Score of 6:''' where, than, how

   '''[[Interrogative]] reversals'''
   17a. '''Score of 1:''' Reversal of copula (i.e. "Is it" red?)
   17b. '''Score of 5:''' Reversal with three auxiliaries (i.e. "Could he" have been going?)

   '''[[Wh-questions]]'''
   18a. '''Score of 1:''' who or what (i.e. "What" do you mean?), what + noun (i.e. "What book" are you reading?)
   18b. '''Score of 5:''' whose or which (i.e. "Which" do you want?), which + noun (i.e. "Which book" do you want?)

In particular, those categories that appear the earliest in speech receive a lower score, whereas later-appearing categories receive a higher score.  If an entire sentence is correct according to adult-like forms, then the utterance would receive an extra point.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  The eight categories above are the most commonly used structures in syntactic formation, thus structures such as possessives, articles, plurals, prepositional phrases, adverbs and descriptive adjectives were omitted and not scored.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  Additionally, the scoring system is arbitrary when applied to certain structures.  For example, there is no indication as to why "if" would receive four points rather than five.  The scores of all the utterances are totalled in the end of the analysis and then averaged to get a final score.  This means that the individual's final score reflects their entire syntactic complexity level, rather than syntactic level in a specific category.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  The main advantage of development sentence scoring is that the final score represents the individual's general syntactic development and allows for easier tracking of changes in language development, making this tool effective for longitudinal studies.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;

====Index of productive syntax====

Similar to Development Sentence Scoring, the Index of Productive Syntax evaluates the grammatical complexity of spontaneous language samples.  After age 3, Index of Productive Syntax becomes more widely used than MLU to measure syntactic complexity in children.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, A, Sagae, K, MacWhinney, B, 'Automatic Measurement of Syntactic Development in Child Language', ''Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics'', pp.197-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because at around age 3, MLU does not distinguish between children of similar language competency as well as Index of Productive Syntax does.  For this reason, MLU is initially used in early childhood development to track syntactic ability, then Index of Productive Syntax is used to maintain validity.  Individual utterances in a discourse sample are scored based on the presence of 60 different syntactic forms, placed more generally under four subscales: [[noun phrase]], [[verb phrase]], question/negation and sentence structure forms.&lt;ref&gt;Springer Reference 2014, Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn). Available from: &lt;http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/333184.html&gt;. [26 October 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;  After a sample is recorded, a corpus is then formed based on 100 utterance transcriptions with 60 different language structures being measured in each utterance.  Not included in the corpus are imitations, self-repetitions and routines, which constitute language that does not represent productive language usage.&lt;ref name="Moyle, M 2013"&gt;Moyle, M &amp; Long, S 2013, 'Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn)', ''Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders'', pp. 1566-1568&lt;/ref&gt;  In each of the four sub-scales previously mentioned, the first two unique occurrences of a form are scored.  After this, occurrences of a sub-scale are not scored.  However, if a child has mastered a complex syntax structure earlier than expected, they will receive extra points.&lt;ref name="Moyle, M 2013"/&gt;

====Standardized tests====

The six main tasks in standardized testing for syntax:&lt;ref name="Scott, CM pp. 309-320"/&gt;
*What is the level of syntactic complexity?
*What specific syntactic structures are found? (a syntactic content analysis)
*Are specific structures representative of what is known about syntactic development within the age range of standardization sample?
*What are the processing requirements of the test format? (a task analysis)
*Are processing requirements similar to or different from language processing in more naturalistic contexts?
*Is syntactic ability in naturalistic language predicted by performance on the test?

Some of the common standardized tests for measuring syntactic performance are the TOLD-2 Intermediate (Test of Language Development), the TOAL-2 (Test of Adolescent Language) and the CELF-R (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Revised Screening Test).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Task being tested !! TOLD-2 Intermediate !! TOAL-2 !! CELF-R
|-
| Listening || Grammaticality Judgement (hears 1 sentence: judges correct/incorrect) || Syntactic Paraphrase (hears 3 sentences; marks 2 with similar meaning) || 
|-
| Speaking || Sentence Combining (hears 2-4 sentences, says 1 sentence that combines input sentences) || Sentence Imitation (hears 1 sentence, repeats verbatim) || Formulating Sentences (hears 1-2 words and sees a picture;  makes up a sentence using words), Imitating Sentences (hears 1 sentence, repeats verbatim), Scrambled Sentences (hears/sees/reads sentence components out of order; says 2 different recorded/correct versions)
|-
| Reading ||  || Syntactic paraphrase (read 5 sentences; marks 2 with similar meaning) || 
|-
| Writing ||  || Sentence combining (reads 2-6 sentences; writes 1 sentence that combines input sentences) ||

An '''unusual unit of measurement''' is a [[unit of measurement]] that does not form part of a coherent [[systems of measurement|system of measurement]]; especially in that its exact quantity may not be well known or that it may be an inconvenient multiple or fraction of base units in such systems. This definition is deliberately not exact since it might seem to encompass units such as the week or the [[light-year]] which are quite "usual" in the sense they are often used; if they are used out of context, they may be "unusual", as demonstrated by the [[FFF system|Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight (FFF)]] system of units. Many of the unusual units of measurements listed here are colloquial measurements, units devised to compare a measurement to common and familiar objects.

==Length==
===Rack unit===
[[File:Server rack rail dimensions.svg|thumb|upright|A typical section of rack rail, showing rack unit distribution.]]
{{Main article|Rack unit}}
One rack unit (U) is {{convert|1.75|in|2}} and is used to measure rack-mountable audiovisual and computing equipment (hence, 24000U = 1 [[Verst]].) Rack units are typically denoted without a space between the number of units and the 'U'. Thus a 4U [[server (computing)|server]] enclosure (case) is {{convert|7|in|1|spell=in}} high.

===Hand===
{{main article|Hand (unit)}}
The '''hand''' is a non-[[SI]] unit of length equal to exactly {{convert|4|in|mm|1}}. It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-26 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.

===Smoot===
{{main article|Smoot}}
The '''smoot'''  is a nonstandard, humorous unit of length created as part of an MIT fraternity prank. It is named after Oliver R. Smoot, a fraternity pledge to Lambda Chi Alpha, who in October 1958 lay down repeatedly on the Harvard Bridge (between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts) so that his fraternity brothers could use his height{{Snd}} {{Convert|67|in|m}}{{Snd}} to measure the length of the bridge (it was 364.4 Smoots, plus or minus an ear)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light-nanosecond===
{{See also|Light-foot}}
The light-nanosecond was popularized as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): "The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond."&lt;ref&gt;The exact length is 29.9792458 cm.&lt;/ref&gt; In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed, and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metric foot===
A [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&amp;nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm ''"Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)..."''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220032259/http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm |date=20 December 2014 }} [[BBC Television Centre]] plans&lt;/ref&gt; but has never been an official unit.

===Horse===
{{main article|Horse length}}
Horses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] – a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}. Shorter distances are measured in fractions of a ''horse length''; also common are measurements of a full or fraction of a ''head'', a ''neck'', or a ''nose''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spreadex.com/sports/get-started/horse-racing-spread-betting/winning-distances/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boat length===
In rowing races such as the [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]], the margin of victory and of defeat is expressed in fractions and multiples of ''lengths''. The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman.

===Football field (length)===
An [[American football field]] is usually understood to be {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, though it is technically {{convert|120|yd|m|1}} when including the two {{convert|10|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones. The field is {{convert|160|ft|yd m|abbr=on}} wide. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2015-nfl-rulebook#rule-1.-the-field|title=2015 NFL Rulebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, including two {{convert|20|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones.

Media in the UK also use the [[association football pitch|football pitch]] as a unit of length, although the area of the [[association football]] pitch is not fixed, but may vary within limits of {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in width. The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

===Block===
A [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement "block" usually refers to a north-south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in cities with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east-west and north-south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east-west plus the number north-south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tall buildings===
[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|thumb|upright|The Empire State Building is taller than 4 American football fields stood on end, including their end zones.]]
{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in the world}}
Throughout the world, well-known tall structures such as the [[Empire State Building]] ({{convert|449|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are often used as comparative measurements of height.

In the UK, well-known structures such as the [[Blackpool Tower]] ({{convert|158|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-395145/Nelson-facelift-loses-16ft.html|title=Nelson has a facelift but loses 16ft|website=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; are commonly used by British newspapers or reference books to give the comparative heights of buildings or, occasionally, mountains.

In Canada, the Toronto [[CN Tower]] ({{convert|553|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is used as a unit of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628004821/http://routesonthered.ca/pdf/lake_agassiz.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=28 June 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccnmatthews.com/news/releases/show.jsp?action=showRelease&amp;actionFor=528581&amp;searchText=false&amp;showText=all|title=Computer Recycling and Donating, Electronic Recycling Association Expands its Operations|website=Marketwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Mont Saint-Michel]] are commonly used as units of height or volume. The [[Tour Montparnasse|Montparnasse Tower]] (Paris) is also – but less – used as a measurement for modern buildings, mostly in Parisian Area.

===The Earth's circumference===
The circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40,000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator "would circle the Earth four and a half times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40,007,862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40,075,016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1,852|m|ft}}.

The metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.

===Earth-to-Moon distance===
The distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380,000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end "would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times".

The abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is "LD" which stands for "[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]," used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.

===Siriometer===
The [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&amp;nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].&lt;!--Google test prefers US spelling--&gt;

===Barn===
{{Main article|Barn (unit)}}
One barn is 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus. The name probably derives from early neutron-deflection experiments, when the uranium nucleus was described, and the phrases "big as a barn" and "hit a barn door" were used. Additional units include the microbarn (or "outhouse")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearglossary.com/abcs/nuclearglossary_O.html#outhouse |title=An Exceptional Nuclear Glossary |publisher=Nuclearglossary.com |date=2006-11-25 |accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the yoctobarn (or "shed").&lt;ref name="Rowlett"&gt;{{cite web |author= Russ Rowlett |date= 1 September 2004 |title= Units: S |url= http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictS.html |website= How Many?

===Brass===
One brass is {{convert|100|ft2|sigfig=3}} area (used in measurement of work done or to be done, such as plastering, painting, etc.). It is also equal, however, to {{convert|100|ft3|sigfig=3}} of estimated or supplied loose material, such as sand, gravel, rubble, etc. This unit is prevalent in construction industry in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gardentia.net/chart/|title=Chart|author=|date=|website=gardentia.net|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/mumbai-builders-hit-sand-trap-110021200018_1.html|title=Mumbai builders hit sand trap|first=Sanjay|last=Jog|date=12 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Square===
The ''[[square (unit)|square]]'' is an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] of [[area]] that is used in the construction industry in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031018185707/http://www.p1m.com/um.htm|title=Units of Measurements|author=|date=18 October 2003|website=archive.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was historically used in [[Australia]] by real estate agents. One square is equal to {{convert|100|sqft|m2|2|lk=on}}. A [[roof]]'s area may be calculated in square feet, then converted to squares.

===Cow's grass===
In Ireland, before the 19th Century, a "cow's grass" was a measurement used by farmers to indicate the size of their fields. A cow's grass was equal to the amount of land that could produce enough grass to support a cow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly|first=John|title=The Graves are Walking: The Great Famine and Saga of the Irish People|page=15|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c9A9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=a+%22cow's+grass%22+ireland#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cow's%20grass%22&amp;f=false|title=Letters on the Condition of the People of Ireland|last=Foster|first=Thomas Campbell|date=1846|publisher=Chapman and Hall|language=en|quote=The land is not let by the acre, but by what is termed a “cow's grass” — so many “cows' grass” to a farm.

A variation called a "cow field"{{clarify|reason=How big is a cow field, in standard units?|date=April 2016}} is still often used in the [[Channel Islands]], particularly [[Guernsey]], where classified advertisements in the local newspaper ([[Guernsey Press]]) for land can be seen referring to "A plot of land measuring X cow fields." This is probably still used because an acre of land in Guernsey is rather unusual due to the small size of the island and therefore a cow-field is a more suitable unit of measurement.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

An [[American football field]], including both end zones, is {{convert|360|by|160|ft|yd m|1|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|57,600|sqft|m2}} ({{convert|0.535|ha|acre|disp=or}}). A [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m}} wide and {{convert|110|yd|m}} long with end zones adding a combined {{convert|40|yd|m}} to the length, making it {{convert|87,750|sqft|m2}} or {{convert|0.8215|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.

An [[Australian rules football playing field|Australian rules football field]] may be approximately {{convert|150|m|yd}} (or more) long goal to goal and {{convert|135|m|yd}} (or more) wide, although the field's elliptical nature reduces its area to a certain extent.

===Morgen===
{{Main article|Morgen}}
A [[morgen]] ("morning" in Dutch and German) was approximately the amount of land tillable by one man behind an ox in the morning hours of a day. This was an official unit of measurement in South Africa until the 1970s, and was defined in November 2007 by the South African Law Society as having a conversion factor of 1 Morgen = {{val|0.856532|u=hectare}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Countries, regions, and cities===
[[File:British Isles United Kingdom WA highlighted.svg|thumb|upright|Wales (red) in the UK (pink)]]
The area of a familiar country, state or city is often used as a unit of measure, especially in [[journalism]].

====Wales====
Equal to 20,779&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (8,023&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), the country of [[Wales]] is used in phrases such as "an area the size of Wales" or "twice the area of Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4543070.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Wales - South West Wales - Expat joins Falklands council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5184332.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Diary: The Amazon rainforest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]] is 6.275 times the size of Wales, and Scotland is roughly four times the size of Wales. [[Ireland]] is four times larger than Wales, and [[France]] is about twenty-five times larger.

In older British and Commonwealth atlases, it was common to show a known area at the same scale, and the usual area to show was either Wales for smaller scales, or Great Britain for larger areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The British comedy show ''[[The Eleven O'Clock Show]]'' parodied the use of this measurement, by introducing a news article about an earthquake in Wales, stating that an area the size of Wales was affected. The Radio 4 programme ''More or Less'' introduced the idea of "kilowales"&amp;nbsp;– an area 1,000 times the size of Wales. ''[[The Register]]'' introduced the nanowales (20.78 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haines|first=Lester|title=So, what's the velocity of a sheep in a vacuum?|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/vulture_central_standards/?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114110120/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/vulture_central_standards/?page=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 November 2013|publisher=The Register|date=24 August 2007|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States====
In the United States the area of the smallest state, [[Rhode Island]] ({{convert|1,545|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the largest of the contiguous 48 states, [[Texas]] ({{convert|268601|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}), and, less commonly, [[Alaska]] ({{convert|656425|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) are used in a similar fashion. [[Antarctica]]'s [[Larsen Ice Shelf|Larsen B ice shelf]] was approximately the size of Rhode Island until it broke up in 2002. In the 1979 movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', radiation is expected to contaminate "an area the size of [[Pennsylvania]]". Any state may be used in this fashion to describe the area of another country.

The US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] uses [[Washington, D.C.]] ({{convert|61.4|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) as a comparison for city-sized objects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Other countries====
In the Netherlands, its smallest province, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] ({{convert|1386|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}), is often used as a comparison for regions in general.

The country of [[Belgium]] ({{convert|30528|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) has also often been used when comparing areas, to the point where it has been regarded as a [[meme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Edwards |title=Quizzical: this month, Chris Edwards tackles temperature extremes, the size of Belgium, categorising nations' development status, the hydrogen bombs dropped on Japan and the number of people who speak Scottish Gaelic |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_8_77/ai_n29198390/ |work=[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]] |date=August 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413081725/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_8_77/ai_n29198390/ |archivedate=13 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and where there is a [http://www.sizeofbelgium.com/ website] dedicated to notable areas which have been compared to that of Belgium.

The [[Isle of Wight]] ({{convert|380|km2|sqmi|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}), an island off the south coast of mainland [[England]], is commonly used to define smaller areas.

In [[Denmark]], the island of [[Bornholm]] (588 square kilometers) is often used to describe the size of an area.

In Germany, the [[Saarland]] ({{convert|2569.69|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) is often used to define areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article6452153/Das-Saarland-das-Vergleichsmass-vieler-Dinge.html|title=Größenordnungen: Das Saarland – das Vergleichsmaß vieler Dinge - DIE WELT|author=Marco Krefting|date=18 February 2010|website=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], it is common to compare relatively small areas to the state of [[Sergipe]] ({{convert|21910.4|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the smallest in the country. Smaller areas are sometimes compared to the cities of [[São Paulo]] ({{convert|1521.11|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or [[Rio de Janeiro]] ({{convert|1221|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

==Volume==
&lt;!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order, smallest volume first --&gt;

===Metric ounce===
A metric ounce is an approximation of the imperial ounce, US dry ounce, or US fluid ounce. These three customary units vary. However, the metric ounce is usually taken as 25 or 30&amp;nbsp;ml when volume is being measured, or grams when mass is being measured.

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) defines the "food labeling ounce" as 30&amp;nbsp;ml, slightly larger than the 29.6&amp;nbsp;ml [[fluid ounce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/21cfr101.9.htm |title=Food and Drugs: FDA Food Labeling |date=1 April 2004 |publisher=[[US Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;br/&gt;For [[Nutrition facts label]]ing "a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (ml), a tablespoon means 15 ml, a cup means 240 ml, 1 fl oz means 30 ml, and 1 oz in weight means 28 g".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shot===
{{Main article|Shot glass}}
[[File:Three shotglasses.jpg|thumb|right|Three shot glasses of varying shape and size]]
The [[shot glass|shot]] is a liquid volume measure that varies from country to country and state to state depending on legislation. It is routinely used for measuring strong [[liquor]] or spirits when the amount served and consumed is smaller than the more common measures of alcoholic "drink" and "pint". There is a legally defined maximum size of a serving in some jurisdictions. The size of a "single" shot is {{convert|20|-|60|ml|abbr=on}}. The smaller "pony" shot is {{convert|20|-|30|ml|abbr=on}}. According to Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2009, a pony is 0.75 [[fluid ounce]]s{{clarify|date=September 2014|reason=Imperial fluid ounces, US fluid ounces, or something else?}} of liquor.&lt;ref name="BritannicaAlmanac"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2009|date=2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-1593398392|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nxLkMspauIC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Spirits+Measure|editor=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.

===Board foot or super foot===
{{Main article|Board foot}}
A board foot is a United States and Canadian unit of volume, used for lumber. It is equivalent to {{nowrap|1 inch × 1 foot × 1 foot}} ({{convert|144|cuin|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}). It is also found in the unit of density ''pounds per board foot''. In Australia and New Zealand the terms ''super foot'' or ''superficial foot'' were formerly used for this unit.

===Hoppus foot===
{{details|Hoppus}}
A system of measure for timber in the round (standing or felled), now largely superseded by the metric system except in measuring hardwoods in certain countries. Its purpose is to estimate the value of sawn timber in a log, by measuring the unsawn log and allowing for wastage in the mill. Following the so-called "quarter-girth formula" (the square of one quarter of the circumference in inches multiplied by {{frac|1|144}} of the length in feet), the notional log is four feet in circumference, one inch of which yields the hoppus board foot, 1 foot yields the hoppus foot, and 50 feet yields a hoppus ton. This translates to a hoppus foot being equal to {{convert|1.273|ft3|in3 m3}}. The hoppus board foot, when milled, yields about one [[board foot]]. The volume yielded by the quarter-girth formula is 78.54% of cubic measure (i.e. 1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.7854&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;ft; 1&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;ft = 1.273&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="forest mensuration"&gt;{{cite book |last= Husch |first= Bertram |author2=Thomas W.

===Cubic ton===
{{Main article|Cubic ton}}
A cubic ton is an antiquated measure of volume, varying based on the commodity from about {{convert|16|to|45|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}. It is now only used for lumber, for which one cubic ton is equivalent to {{convert|40|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}.

===Cord and rick===
[[File:Cord of wood.jpg|thumb|A cord of wood]]
{{Main article|Cord (unit)}}
The cord is a unit of measure of [[dry measure|dry volume]] used in Canada and the United States to measure [[firewood]] and [[pulpwood]]. A cord is the amount of wood that, when "ranked and well stowed" (arranged so pieces are aligned, parallel, touching and compact), occupies a volume of {{convert|128|cuft|m3|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range|title=Glossary of Forestry Terms in British Columbia|url=http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to a well-stacked woodpile, 4 feet deep by 4 feet high by 8 feet wide {{nowrap|(122 cm × 122 cm × 244 cm)}}, or any other arrangement of linear measurements that yields the same volume. A more unusual measurement for firewood is the "rick" or [[face cord]]. It is stacked {{convert|16|in|cm|sigfig=3}} deep with the other measurements kept the same as a cord, making it {{frac|3}} of a cord; however, regional variations mean that its precise definition is nonstandardized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictR.html How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement], Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-foot equivalent unit===
{{main article|Twenty-foot equivalent unit}}
The twenty-foot equivalent unit is the volume of the smallest standard [[intermodal container|shipping container]]. It is equivalent to {{convert|1360|cuft|m3}}. Larger intermodal containers are commonly described in multiples of TEU, as are container ship capacities.

===Double decker bus===
The approximate volume of a [[double-decker bus]], abbreviated to DDB, has been used informally to describe the size of hole created by a major sewer collapse. For example, a report might refer to "a 4 DDB hole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8wpnoExCJOcC&amp;dq=sewer+collapse+ddb |title=Sewers : Repair and Renovation|publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann|author=Geoffrey F Read, Ian Vickridge eds.|date=24 December 1996|accessdate=29 June 2016|isbn=978-0080541129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acre-foot===
{{Main article|Acre-foot}}

It is defined by the volume of one acre of surface area to a depth of one foot (43,560&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) which is about {{convert|1233.48|m3|usgal impgal|abbr=on}}.

===Olympic-size swimming pool===
[[File:Olympic Swimming Pool - Fast Lane.JPG|thumb|An Olympic-size swimming pool holds over 2 acre-feet of water.]]
For larger volumes of liquid, one measure commonly used in the media in many countries is the [[Olympic-size swimming pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hudson: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulhudson/2010/06/3rd-anniversary-of-july-2007-f.shtml 3rd anniversary of June 2007 floods], showing a storm water storage tank "half the size of an Olympic swimming pool"&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|50|×|25|m|abbr=on}} Olympic swimming pool, built to the FR3 minimum depth of {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} would hold {{convert|2,500|m3|l impgal USgal acre·ft|abbr=on}}.

A common measure of volume in [[Australia]], and in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in particular, is the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], the largest stadium in Australia and [[list of stadiums by capacity|13th largest in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/05/1070351787509.html |title=Trouble brewing at the bottom of the bay |author= The Age |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume of the Melbourne Cricket Ground is 1,574,000 cubic metres, or about 630 [[#Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic swimming pools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-20/surveyors-find-exact-measurements-of-melbourne-cricket-ground/6709520 |title=How big is the MCG?

===Sydney Harbour===
[[File:Sydney(from air) V2.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour ([[Port Jackson]]), contains enough water to fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground 357 times or about 238,000 Olympic swimming pools.]]
A unit of volume used in Australia for water. One Sydney Harbour, also called a ''Sydharb (or sydarb)'', is the amount of water in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]: approximately 562 gigalitres (562,000,000 cubic metres, or 0.562 of a cubic [[kilometre]]); or in terms of the more unusual measures above, about 357 [[#Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne Cricket Grounds]], 238,000 [[#Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic Swimming pools]], or 476,000 [[#Acre-foot|acre-feet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-secret-harbour-uncovered/2004/12/10/1102625541209.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116134156/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-secret-harbour-uncovered/2004/12/10/1102625541209.html|title=The secret harbour uncovered|archivedate=16 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/39/when-dam-size-matters/ |title=When dam size matters |author= Australian Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NSW Irrigators' Council (NSWIC)|title=Useful Water Comparisons|url=http://www.nswic.org.au/pdf/fact_sheets/USEFUL%20WATER%20COMPARISONS.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grand Canyon===
With a volume measure approximately 4 orders of magnitude greater than a Sydharb, the volume of the [[Grand Canyon]] may be used to visualize even larger things, like the magma chamber underneath Yellowstone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/23/scientists-find-missing-link-in-yellowstone-plumbing-this-giant-volcano-is-very-much-alive/|title=Scientists find missing link in Yellowstone plumbing: This giant volcano is very much alive|author=Joel Achenbach|date=23 April 2015|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk|title=How Many Things Are There?|date=28 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eesmyal.com/2012/02/human-cube/|title=Human Cube - eesmyal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Park Service]], the volume of the Grand Canyon is {{convert|4.17|e12m3|e12yd3|abbr=off}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/management/statistics.htm|title=Park Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is {{convert|4.17|e12m3|km3|disp=output only}} ({{convert|4.17|e12m3|mi3|disp=output only}}).

==Flow rate==
===Miner's inch===
{{main|Miner's inch}}
The volume of water which flows in one unit of time through an orifice one inch square or in diameter. The size of the unit varies from one place to another.

==Mass==
===Grave===
In 1793, the French term "[[grave (mass)|grave]]" (from "gravity") was suggested as the base unit of mass for the metric system. In 1795, however, the name "[[kilogramme]]" was adopted instead.

===Bag of cement and bag mix===
The mass of an old bag of [[Portland cement|cement]] was one [[hundredweight]] ~ 112&amp;nbsp;lb, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;kg. The amount of material that, say, an aircraft could carry into the air is often visualised as the number of bags of cement that it could lift. In the concrete and petroleum industry, however, a bag of cement is defined as 94 pounds (~ 42.6&amp;nbsp;kg), because it has an apparent volume close to 1 cubic foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cement.org/tech/faq_unit_weights.asp|title=Frequently Asked Questions, unit weights|publisher=Portland Cement Association|date=2011|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[ready-mix concrete]] is specified, a "bag mix" unit is used as if the batching company mixes 5 literal bags of cement per cubic yard (or cubic metre) when a "5 bag mix" is ordered.

===Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter by Cassini-Huygens.jpg|thumb|upright|Jupiter]]
When reporting on the masses of [[extrasolar planet]]s, astronomers often discuss them in terms of multiples of [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]] ({{Jupiter mass}} = 1.9 {{e|27}}&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/extrasolar-planet-types-100214.html |title=Out There: A Strange Zoo of Other Worlds |publisher=Space.com |date=2010-02-14 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, "Astronomers recently discovered a planet outside our Solar System with a mass of approximately 3 Jupiters." Furthermore, the mass of Jupiter is nearly equal to one thousandth of the mass of the Sun.

===Sun===
[[Solar mass]] ({{Solar mass}} = {{val|2.0|e=30|u=kg}}) is also often used in astronomy when talking about masses of stars or galaxies; for example, [[Alpha Centauri A]] has the mass of 1.1 suns, and the [[Milky Way]] has a mass of approximately {{Solar mass|6{{e|11}}}}.

Solar mass also has a special use when estimating orbital periods and distances of 2 bodies using [[Kepler's laws]]: ''a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''a'' is length of [[semi-major axis]] in [[astronomical unit|AU]], ''T'' is orbital period in years and ''M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the combined mass of objects in {{Solar mass}}. In case of planet orbiting a star, ''M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be approximated to mean the mass of the central object. More specifically in the case of Sun and Earth the numbers reduce to ''M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;'' ~ 1, ''a'' ~ 1 and ''T'' ~ 1.

==Time==
&lt;!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order --&gt;

===Light-distance===
[[George Gamow]] discussed measurements of time such as the "light-mile" and "[[light-foot]]", the time taken for light to travel the specified unit distance, defined by "reversing the procedure" used in defining a light-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Gamow|title=One Two Three ... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science|location=New York|publisher=Viking|date=1947|page=77|title-link=One Two Three ... Infinity}}&lt;/ref&gt; One light-[[nanosecond]] is roughly 30 centimeters (29.9792458 cm exactly), or about a foot (30.48 cm).

===Shake===
In [[nuclear chain reaction|nuclear engineering]] and astrophysics contexts, the [[shake (time)|shake]] is sometimes used as a conveniently short period of time. 1&amp;nbsp;shake is defined as 10&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pathogenesis and Therapy of Combined Radiation Injury |url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106134035/http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 January 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Defense Threat Reduction Agency |accessdate=2006-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jiffy===
In [[computing]], the [[jiffy (time)|jiffy]] is the duration of one tick of the system timer [[interrupt]]. Typically, this time is 0.01&amp;nbsp;seconds, though in some earlier systems (such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[8-bit]] machines) the jiffy was defined as {{frac|1|60}} of a second, roughly equal to the vertical refresh period (i.e. the field rate) on [[NTSC]] video hardware (and the [[utility frequency|period of AC electric power]] in North America).

===Martian second===
{{main|timekeeping on Mars}}
The United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a "sol"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88775 SI seconds, 2375 longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars, so that Martian hours, minutes and seconds are 2.75% longer than their SI counterparts..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microfortnight===
One unit derived from the [[FFF system]] of units is the microfortnight, one millionth of the fundamental time unit of FFF, which equals 1.2096&amp;nbsp;seconds. This is a fairly representative example of "[[computer humor|hacker humor]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/microfortnight.html|title=microfortnight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is occasionally used in operating systems; for example, the [[OpenVMS]] TIMEPROMPTWAIT parameter is measured in microfortnights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/vms/part3 |title=OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), Part 3/11 |at=4.1.1.1.4 EXE$GL_TODR |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sidereal day===
The [[sidereal day]] is based on the Earth's rotation rate relative to fixed stars, rather than the Sun. A sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 SI seconds.

===Decimal time systems===
{{main article|Decimal time}}
[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumb|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]
The measurement of time is unique in SI in that while the [[second]] is the base unit, and measurements of time smaller than a second use prefixed units smaller than a second (e.g. microsecond, nanosecond, etc.), measurements larger than a second instead use traditional divisions, including the [[sexagesimal]]-based ''[[minute]]'' and ''[[hour]]'' as well as the less regular ''[[day]]'' and ''[[year]]'' units. SI allows for the use of larger prefixed units based on the second, a system known as [[metric time]], but this is unusual.

There have been numerous proposals and usage of [[decimal time]], most of which were based on the day as the base unit. For instance, in dynastic China, the [[kè]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day "weeks". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day], precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.

In addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].

===Dog year===
{{main article|Aging in dogs}}
[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]
There are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a popular myth regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.
*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.&lt;ref name=dogyear&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals/ Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)]. ''MSNBC.com''. Retrieved 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; When this definition is used, a standard calendar year is known as a "human year".
*A standard (365-day) calendar year of a dog's life, whereas a "human year" is the period of a dog's (or other animal's) life that is claimed to be equivalent to a year of a human being's life (or seven calendar years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url         = http://www.dog-food-corner.com/dog-years-human-years-age.htm

  | archivedate = 14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these units are used, measurements in both "dog years" and "human years" are often included together, to more clearly indicate which name is used for each unit.&lt;ref name=dogyear/&gt;

In fact, the aging of a dog varies by breed (larger breeds tend to have shorter lifespans than small and medium-sized breeds); dogs also develop faster and have longer adulthoods relative to their total life span than humans. Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=2009-06-10|title=Sexual Maturity&amp;nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galactic year===
{{Main article|Galactic year}}
The most common large-scale time scale is millions of years ([[megaannum]] or "Ma"). However, for long-term measurements, this still requires rather large numbers. Using as a measure the time it takes for the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core (GY - not to be confused with Gyr for [[gigayear]]), approximately 250&amp;nbsp;Ma, yields some easily memorizable numbers. In this scale, oceans appeared on Earth after 4&amp;nbsp;GY, life is detectable at 5&amp;nbsp;GY, and multicellular organisms first appeared at 15&amp;nbsp;GY. Dinosaurs became extinct about {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;GY ago, and the true age of mammals began about 0.2&amp;nbsp;GY ago. The [[age of the Earth]] is estimated at about 20&amp;nbsp;GY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geologic Time Galactic |url=http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/geologic_time_galactic/ |publisher="vendian.org" |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angular measure==
===Furman===
The Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s. It is named for Alan T. Furman, the American mathematician who adapted the [[CORDIC]] algorithm for 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic sometime around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Furman |first=Alan T. |title=The Cordic Algorithm for Fixed-Point Polar Geometry |url=http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf |journal=FORTH Dimensions |volume=4 |pages=14–15 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 bits give a resolution of 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; = 65,536 distinct angles.

===Binary degree, binary radian, brad===
{{See also|Binary scaling#Binary angles}}
A related unit of angular measure equal to {{Frac|1|256}} of a circle, represented by 8 bits, has found some use in machinery control where fine precision is not required, most notably crankshaft and camshaft position in [[engine control unit|internal combustion engine controllers]], and in video game programming. There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation.

===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===
{{Main article|Grad (angle)}}
Coordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9° or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1 km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30° and 60° are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this "decimal" unit failed to displace the "sexagesimal" units equilateral-vertex — degree — minute — second invented by Babylonian astronomers.

===Angular mil===
[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating angular mils by hand]]
The [[angular mil]] is used by many military organisations to measure plane angle and so to triangulate distances, given an object's apparent and actual size. It is approximately the angle which has a tangent of {{frac|1|1,000}}; in NATO standard, this is rounded to {{frac|1|6,400}} of a circle, although other definitions are in use. Its name derives from {{lang-la|millesimus}} ("thousandth") and so the fact it is used mostly by the military is coincidental to its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Concise Dictionary of the English Language|date=1982|isbn=978-0-00-433091-4|editor-first=William T|editor-last=Macleod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==
===Electronvolt mass===
{{Main article|Electronvolt#Mass}}
It is common in particle physics, where mass and energy are often interchanged, to use eV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where eV (electronvolt) is the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] accelerated over one [[volt]] ({{val|1.6|e=-19}} [[joule]]s), c is the speed of light in a vacuum (from E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This definition is intuitive for a [[linear particle accelerator]] when accelerating electrons.

::1 [[atomic mass unit|amu]]&amp;nbsp;= 931.46 MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Even more common is to use a system of natural units with c set to 1, and simply use eV as a unit of mass.

===Gasoline gallon equivalent===
{{Main article|Gasoline gallon equivalent}}
In 2011 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced the ''gallon gasoline equivalent'' as a unit of energy because their research showed most U.S. citizens do not understand the standard units. The gallon gasoline equivalent is defined as 33.7 kWh,&lt;ref name=EPAstudy10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy Label - Final Report|authors=Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA, and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], Us DoT|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1.213{{e|8}} joules.

Efficiency or fuel economy can be given as [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]].

===Tons of TNT equivalent===
{{Main article|TNT equivalent|Richter magnitude scale#Examples}}
The energy of various amounts of the explosive [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (kiloton, megaton, gigaton) is often used as a unit of [[explosion]] energy, and sometimes of asteroid impacts and violent explosive volcanic eruptions. One ton of TNT produces 4.184{{e|9}} joules, or (by arbitrary definition) exactly {{10^|9}} [[calorie|thermochemical calories]] (approximately 3.964{{e|6}} BTU). This definition is only loosely based on the actual physical properties of TNT.

===Hiroshima bomb and Halifax explosion===
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiroshima bomb explosion]]
[[File:Halifax Explosion blast cloud.jpg|thumb|upright|Halifax explosion]]
{{Main article|Moment magnitude scale#Nuclear explosions}}
The energy released by the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] explosion (about 15&amp;nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 6{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;J) is often used by [[geologist]]s as a unit when describing the energy of [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, and [[impact event|asteroid impact]]s.

Prior to the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the size of the [[Halifax Explosion]] (about 3&amp;nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 1.26{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;J), was the standard for this type of relative measurement. Each explosion had been the largest known man-made detonation to date.&lt;ref name=TimeDisaster&gt;{{cite book |title=Time: Disasters that Shook the World|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|location=New York City|date=2012|page=56|isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foe===
A [[Foe (unit)|foe]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|44}}&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s (≈9.478{{e|40}} [[British thermal unit|BTU]]) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of [[Stony Brook University]]. To measure the staggeringly immense amount of energy produced by a [[supernova]], specialists occasionally use the "foe", an acronym derived from the phrase [ten to the power of] '''f'''ifty-'''o'''ne '''e'''rgs, or {{10^|51}}&amp;nbsp;[[erg]]s. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds).

==Other metric-compatible scales==
===Power: Ton of refrigeration===
{{Main article|Ton of refrigeration}}
The rate at which heat is removed by melting {{convert|1|ST|kg|spell=in}} of ice over twenty-four hours is referred to as a ton of refrigeration, or sometimes a ton of cooling. This unit of refrigeration capacity came from the days when large blocks of ice were used for cooling, and is still used to describe the heat-removal capabilities of refrigerators and chillers today. One ton of refrigeration is equal to 12,000 BTU/h exactly, or 3.517&amp;nbsp;kW.

===Flow: Amazon River===
The volume of discharge of the [[Amazon River]] sometimes used to describe large volumes of water flow such as ocean currents. The unit is equivalent to 216,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s ([[cumec]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18722/Amazon-River "Amazon River"], "Encyclopædia Britannica", 2010, Retrieved 8 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow: Sverdrup ===
One [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

===Energy intensity===
The [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&amp;nbsp;J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ≈3.684 BTU/sq&amp;nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.

===Kinematic viscosity===
One of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s, i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s (≈1.08×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft/s).

===Angular velocity===
'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to 1/1000 of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour ≈ 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electromagnetic flux===
In [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in base units, about 8.8×10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTU/ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.

===Metre of water equivalent===
{{main|Meter water equivalent}}
A material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (≈39.4&amp;nbsp;in) of water.

This unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.

===Strontium unit: radiation dose===
The [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&amp;nbsp;S.U.

===Banana equivalent dose===
[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]
Bananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes—even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s - in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 μSv.

===Molar mass of cellulose===
In the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [η] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [η] = 0.070 M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0.70&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mürşide Kes, Bjørn E. Christensen, A re-investigation of the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry, Journal of Chromatography A, Volume 1281, 15 March 2013, Pages 32-37, ISSN 0021-9673, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038 doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is typical to cite [η] values directly in dL/g, as the "viscosity" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.

===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===
In measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.

In pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine_and_hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.

==Demography and epidemiology==
[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as "people", "births", "infections" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|"deaths per year"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.

[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.

===Micromort===
{{Main article|Micromort}}
A micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.

===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===
[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]
The large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people. For example, Uruguay's [[Estadio Centenario]] is often used in [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta/ Ahora la borrachera es "previa" a la fiesta] - Diario El País, 11 October 2009 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/97129-los-desocupados-colmarian-tres-y-medio-estadios-centenarios] - La República, 7 November 2002 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; while in parts of the United States, [[Michigan Stadium]] is used in this manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In Australia, the capacity of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (about 100,000) is often cited in this manner. Hence the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] serves as both a measure of people and a [[#Melbourne Cricket Ground|unit of volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Diabetes Australia|title=Diabetes - The Facts|url=https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/PageFiles/1615/the%20facts%20DA%20FINAL%202011.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NSW Department of Education and Communities|title=What the experts say about cyberbullying|url=http://www.schoolatoz.nsw.edu.au/technology/cyberbullying/what-the-experts-say |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Age|title=Trouble brewing at the bottom of the bay|url=http://www.scubadoctor.com.au/article-bay-trouble-brewing.htm|accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Struck by lightning===
"Struck by Lightning" is often used to put highly-infrequent events into perspective.  Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example: “A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer and information science==
The growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.

===Data volume===
[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]
Volume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].

When the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version - Project Gutenberg|accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.

The print version of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=2011-12-07|date=1994-02-08|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.

The term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R. Varian|title=How Much Information?|accessdate=2011-11-29|date=2000-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nibble===
A measure of quantity of data or information, the "[[nibble]]" (sometimes spelled "nybble" or "nybl") is normally equal to 4 bits, or one half of the common 8-bit byte. The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. "6-bit nibble"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.

===FLOPS===
{{Main article|FLOPS}}
In [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.

It is also used to compare the performance of algorithms in practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== BogoMips ===
{{Main article|BogoMips}}
A measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.

===KLOC: computer program length===
A computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for "kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Triumph of the Nerds|network=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure "assembly equivalent lines of code" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).

Error rates in programming are also measured in "Errors per K-LOC", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (&gt;500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.

An alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the "WaP" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm&lt; (April 2017 article)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ticks===
The "tick" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU. The amount of time is processor-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplante |first1=Phillip A. |last2=Ovaska |first2=Seppo J. |title=Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis: Tools for the Practitioner |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470768648 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ez6-aSfbqtsC&amp;pg=PA122|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bovet |first1=Daniel P. |last2=Cesati |first2=Marco |title=Understanding the Linux Kernel: From I/O Ports to Process Management |date=17 November 2005 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn=9780596554910 |page=245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0lltXyJ8aIC&amp;pg=PT245 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purchasing power parity==
===Big Mac Index===
{{Main article|Big Mac Index}}
[[File:Big Mac hamburger.jpg|thumb|A McDonald's Big Mac hamburger, as advertised in the United States]]
''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Big Mac Index]] compares the [[purchasing power parity]] of countries in terms of the cost of a [[Big Mac]] hamburger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big MacCurrencies |publisher=The Economist |date=1998-04-09 |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TVJRVJ |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was felt to be a good measure of the prices of a basket of commodities in the local economy including labour, rent, meat, bread, cardboard, advertising, lettuce, etc.

A similar system used in the UK is the '[[Mars bar]]'. Tables of prices in Mars Bars have intermittently appeared in newspapers over the last 20 years, usually to illustrate changes in wages or prices over time without the confusion caused by inflation.&lt;ref name="ft_inflation"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9f128868-68b4-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html Mars Bar], Nico Colchester Fellowship, FT.com (Financial Times website). Article dated 2001-01-26. Retrieved 2007-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coffee/Latte===
The cost of a cup of coffee (or sometimes latte) from a coffeehouse or cafe is often used as a measurement of two vectors: the relatively diminuitive expense of something frivolous, versus the power of collective contributions towards something important. Campaigns implore something to the effect of, "for the cost of a cup of coffee, you can help stamp out diabetes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Centipawn===
[[Chess]] software frequently uses centipawns internally or externally as a unit measuring how strong each player's situation position is, and hence also by how much one player is beating the other, and how strong a possible move is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-db.com/public/research/qualityofplay.html|title=Chess Play Quality Index|author=|date=|website=chess-db.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 centipawns = [[chess piece relative value|the value of]] 1 pawn - more specifically, something like the average value of the pawns at the start of the game, as the actual value of pawns depends on their position. Loss of a pawn will therefore typically lose that player 100 centipawns. The centipawn is often used for comparing possible moves, as in a given position, chess software will often rate the better of two moves within a few centipawns of each other.

===Garn===
The garn is NASA's unit of measure for symptoms resulting from [[space adaptation syndrome]], the response of the human body to weightlessness in space, named after US Senator [[Jake Garn]], who became exceptionally spacesick during an orbital flight in 1985. If an astronaut is completely incapacitated by space adaptation syndrome, he or she is under the effect of one garn of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_5-13-99.pdf, p. 35, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, interview with Dr. Robert Stevenson]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mother Cow Index===
Formerly used in real estate transactions in the American Southwest, it was the number of pregnant cows an acre of a given plot of land could support. It acted as a proxy for the agricultural quality, natural resource availability, and arability of a parcel of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fw4iAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;dq=pregnant%20cow%20acre%20of%20land&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=pregnant%20cow%20acre%20of%20land&amp;f=false |title=The Country Gentleman - Google Boeken |via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2012-10-19|year=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nines===

[[Image:Four nines fine gold.jpeg|thumb|upright|{{convert|1|ozt|g|lk=in}} of four nines fine gold (999,9)]]
Numbers very close to, but below one are often expressed in "[[nines (engineering)|nines]]" (N &amp;mdash; not to be confused with the unit [[newton (unit)|newton]]), that is in the number of nines following the decimal separator in writing the number in question. For example, "three nines" or "3N" indicates 0.999 or 99.9%, "four nines five" or "4N5" is the expression for the number 0.99995 or 99.995%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vikashazrati.wordpress.com/2008/10/24/truth-about-availabilit/|title=The Truth About Availability: What does 99.99% mean?|website=c0nnexx10n: C0nnect1ng L1fe w1th Techn010gy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Precious Metals |volume=4 |year=1981 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22four+nines+five%22 262]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}&lt;!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as "four-nines-five" while it is actually *five* nines five. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical areas of usage are:
*The [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of computer systems, that is the ratio of [[uptime]] to the sum of [[uptime]] and [[downtime]]. "Five nines" reliability in a continuously operated system means an average [[downtime]] of no more than approximately five minutes per year. (See [[high availability]] for a chart.)
*The [[Nine (purity)|purity]] of materials, such as gases and metals.

===Pain===
[[File:OuchFlintGoodrichShot1941.jpg|thumb|A woman wincing in pain]]
{{See also|Pain scale|Dolorimeter|Pain|Nociception}}
The dol (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for pain, ''dolor'') is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[pain]]. [[James D. Hardy]], [[Herbert G. Wolff]], and [[Helen Goodell]] of [[Cornell University]] proposed the unit based on their studies of pain during the 1940s and 1950s. They defined one dol to equal to "just noticeable differences" ([[jnd]]'s) in pain. The unit never came into widespread use and other methods are now used to assess the level of pain experienced by patients.

The Schmidt sting pain index and Starr sting pain index are [[pain scale]]s rating the relative pain caused by different [[hymenoptera]]n stings. Schmidt has refined his [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] (scaled from 1 to 4) with extensive anecdotal experience, culminating in a paper published in 1990 which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera. The [[Starr sting pain scale]] uses the same 1-to-4 scaling.

===Pepper heat===
====ASTA pungency unit====
The ASTA ([[American Spice Trade Association]]) [[piquance|pungency]] unit is based on a scientific method of measuring chili pepper "heat". The technique utilizes [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] to identify and measure the concentrations of the various compounds that produce a heat sensation. Scoville units are roughly {{frac|1|15}} the size of pungency units while measuring [[capsaicin]], so a rough conversion is to multiply pungency by 15 to obtain Scoville heat units.&lt;ref name="tainter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Tainter |first= Donna R.|author2=Anthony T. Grenis |date= 2001 |title= Spices and Seasonings |publisher= Wiley-IEEE |isbn= 978-0-471-35575-5 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=dfp4b3F0598C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=scoville+units|page=30}} — "Interlab variation [for the original Scoville scale] could be as high as ±50%. However, labs that run these procedures could generate reasonably repeatable results."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scoville heat unit====
[[File:Madame Jeanette and other chillies.jpg|thumb|Chili peppers.]]
The [[Scoville scale]] is a measure of the hotness of a [[chili pepper]]. It is the degree of dilution in sugar water of a specific chili pepper extract when a panel of 5 tasters can no longer detect its "heat".&lt;ref name="what_is_scoville_scale"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-hot-is-that-pepper-how-scientists-measure-spiciness-884380/?no-ist]. Retrieved 2016-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Pure [[capsaicin]] (the chemical responsible for the "heat") has 16&amp;nbsp;million Scoville heat units.

===Proof: alcohol concentration===
[[File:Bacardi 151 bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|A (nearly empty) bottle of 151 proof rum.]]
Up to the 20th century, alcoholic spirits were assessed in the UK by mixing with gunpowder and testing the mixture to see if it would still burn; spirit that just passed the test was said to be at 100° [[alcoholic proof|proof]]. The UK now uses percentage [[alcohol by volume]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F), where spirit at 100° proof is approximately 57.15%&amp;nbsp;[[ABV]]; the US uses a "proof number" of twice the ABV at 60&amp;nbsp;°F (15.5&amp;nbsp;°C).{{sfn|Regan|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Berry|1998|p=}}

===Savart===
The [[Savart]] is an 18th-century unit for measuring the frequency ratio of two sounds, it is equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of a [[decade]]. Still used in some programs, but considered too rough for most purposes. [[Cent (music)|Cent]] is preferred.

===Telecommunications traffic volume===
{{Main article|Erlang (unit)}}
The erlang, named after A. K. Erlang, as a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless unit]] is used in [[telephony]] as a statistical measure of the offered intensity of [[telecommunication]]s [[traffic]] on a group of resources. Traffic of one erlang refers to a single [[resource (project management)|resource]] being in continuous use, or two [[channel (communications)|channel]]s being at fifty percent use, and so on, [[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]. Much telecommunications management and forecasting software uses this.

===Waffle House Index ===
{{Main article|Waffle House Index}}
[[Waffle House Index]] is used by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) to determine the impact of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery. The measure is based on the reputation of the [[Waffle House]] restaurant chain for staying open during extreme weather. This term was coined by FEMA Administrator [[Craig Fugate]].

===X-ray intensity===
{{Main article|Crab (unit)}}
The crab is defined as the intensity of X-rays emitted from the [[Crab Nebula]] at a given photon energy up to 30 kilo[[electronvolts]]. The Crab Nebula is often used for calibration of X-ray telescopes. For measuring the X-ray intensity of a less energetic source, the milliCrab (mCrab) may be used.

One crab is approximately 24 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">In psychology and [[neuroscience]], '''motor planning''' is a set of processes related to the preparation of a movement that occurs during the [[reaction time]] (the time between the presentation of a stimulus to a person and that person's initiation of a motor response). Colloquially, the term applies to any process involved in the preparation of a movement during the reaction time, including perception-related and action-related processes. For example, the identification of a task-relevant stimulus is captured by the usual meaning of the term, “motor planning”, but this identification process is not strictly motor-related. Wong and colleagues (2015) have proposed a narrower definition to include only movement-related processes: "Specification of the movement trajectory for the desired action, a description of how the [[Wikt:end-effector|end-effector]] will produce such an action, and finally a description of the full set of the joint trajectories or muscle activations required to execute the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Aaron L.|last2=Haith|first2=Adrian M.|last3=Krakauer|first3=John W.|date=August 2015|title=Motor Planning|journal=The Neuroscientist: A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry|volume=21|issue=4|pages=385–398|doi=10.1177/1073858414541484|issn=1089-4098|pmid=24981338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Muhlenberg legend''' is an [[urban legend]] in the [[United States]] and [[Germany]].  According to the legend, the single vote of [[Frederick Muhlenberg]], the first ever [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]], prevented [[German language|German]] from becoming an [[Languages_of_the_United_States#Official_language_status|official language of the United States]].

==Basis of legend==

The kernel of truth behind this legend is a vote in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1794, after a group of German immigrants asked for the translation of some laws into German.  This petition was debated by the House of Representatives without a decision made  and a vote to adjourn and consider the recommendation at a later date was defeated by one vote, 42 to 41. There was no vote on an actual bill, merely a vote on whether or not to adjourn. Because the motion to adjourn did not pass, the matter was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from this roll call on adjournment that the “German missed becoming the official language of the USA by one vote” legend sprang. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhlenberg (of German descent himself, who had not voted in the roll call) was later quoted as having said "the faster the Germans become Americans, the better it will be."&lt;ref name="1983art1"&gt;Heath, Shirley Brice &amp; Frederick Mandabach.

The United States has no statutory official language; English has been used on a ''de facto'' basis, owing to its status as the country's predominant language.  At times various states have passed their own official language laws.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp |date=July 9, 2007 |title= The German Vote |publisher= [[Snopes.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:FranzvonLöher.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Löher, whose 1847 German book included an early version of the story.]] 

The legend has a long history, and led to a number of analyses and articles published from the late 1920s into the early 1950s explaining why the story was not true.&lt;ref name="werner1"&gt;(18 February 1943).  [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19430218&amp;id=5wUoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8iIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2550,4435404 A German Language Rumor Traced Down], by W.L.

''German as the Official Language of the United States of America?'', ''Monatshefte'', Vol. 68, No. 2 (Summer, 1976), pp. 129–150 (Arndt's article attempts to trace pre-Loher accounts which may have helped foster the legend, including an 1813 article by [[Justus Christian Henry Helmuth]]; at n. 21, Arndt lists seven accounts published between 1927–52 debunking the myth, starting with the 2nd edition of [[Albert Bernhardt Faust]]'s ''[[The German Element in the United States]]'', at Vol. II, pp. 652–56 (1927))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lohr"&gt;Lohr, Otto. ''Deutsch als 'Landessprache' der Vereinigten Staaten?'', Mitteilungen der Akademie zur wissenschaftlichen Erforschung und zur Pflege des Deutschtums 4 (1931): 283–90 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The story was dubbed the "Muhlenberg legend" by at least the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;Wood, Ralph C. ''The Second Period of the German Society of Pennsylvania and the Muhlenberg Legend'', publication?, cited in ''The German American Review'', 1949&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the legend persists.&lt;ref name="1981article"&gt;(8 August 1981). Zepezauer, Frank S. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19810808&amp;id=OFwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uCkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4509,4232784 When German almost became our language], ''Milwaukee Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watz"&gt;[[Dennis Baron|Baron, Dennis]] (March 1996).

For example, in 1987, a letter from a former election official in Missouri emphasized the importance of voting in an [[Ann Landers]] column.  He included a list of events allegedly decided by one vote from his local election manual, including that “in 1776, one vote gave America the English language instead of German."  (In fact, versions of this error-filled list long predate the 1987 Ann Landers mention.)&lt;ref name="1968list"&gt;(19 March 1968).

[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19961104&amp;id=i9FPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iQcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831,3355790 Debate continues on Internet pros and cons], ''Ocala Star-Banner''&lt;/ref&gt;  A chorus of dismayed responses caused Landers to clear up the matter in a subsequent column.  According to one letter writer, who begged Landers to "stomp out that piece of fiction wherever you encounter it," the myth gained traction in the 1930s due to the work of Nazi propagandists. &lt;ref name="annagain"&gt;(30 December 1996).

Another version of the myth, which puts the vote in 1774 by the [[Continental Congress]], appeared in ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' as early as 1930.&lt;ref name="wasit"&gt;Zagofsky, Al (5 February 2011).

Ripley's version credits the story to an alleged letter by Heinrich Melchior Muhlenberg published in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="bookofchance"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_v9BwIzTjBUC&amp; Ripley's believe it or not! book of chance] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most accounts credit [[Franz von Löher]] as the source of the legend.  Löher was a German visitor to the [[United States]] who published the book ''Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika'' (''History and Achievements of the Germans in America'') in 1847.&lt;ref name="loher1"&gt;Loher, Franz. [https://archive.org/details/geschichteundzus01lh Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika] (1847) (in German) via archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Löher seemingly placed the crucial vote only in Pennsylvania, to make German the official language of that state, not the United States as a whole.  (Philadelphia was where the U.S. Congress sat at the time, but it was also the capital of Pennsylvania.  To further confuse matters, Muhlenburg did serve as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House before serving in that title for the U.S. Congress.)  According to Löher, the vote was tied, and Muhlenberg cast the tie-breaking vote for English.&lt;ref name="menck"&gt;Mencken, Henry L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=n37tIO4KhU8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The American Language: Supplement One], pp. 138–39 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]] and [[probability theory]], two events (or propositions) are '''mutually exclusive''' or '''disjoint''' if they cannot both occur at the same time(be true). A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both.

In the coin-tossing example, both outcomes are, in theory, [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], which means that at least one of the outcomes must happen, so these two possibilities together exhaust all the possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Scott |first2=Donald |last2=Childers |title=Probability and Random Processes |location= |publisher=Academic Press |edition=Second |year=2012 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-12-386981-4 |quote=The sample space is the collection or set of 'all possible' distinct (collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive) outcomes of an experiment. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all mutually exclusive events are collectively exhaustive. For example, the outcomes 1 and 4 of a single roll of a [[six-sided die]] are mutually exclusive (both cannot happen at the same time) but not collectively exhaustive (there are other possible outcomes; 2,3,5,6).

==Logic==
In [[logic]], two mutually exclusive propositions are propositions that [[logical possibility|logically cannot]] be true in the same sense at the same time. To say that more than two propositions are mutually exclusive, depending on context, means that one cannot be true if the other one is true, or at least one of them cannot be true. The term ''pairwise mutually exclusive'' always means that two of them cannot be true simultaneously.

==Probability==
In [[probability theory]], events ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be '''mutually exclusive''' if the occurrence of any one of them implies the non-occurrence of the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 events. Therefore, two mutually exclusive events cannot both occur. Formally said, the intersection of each two of them is empty (the null event): ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∅. In consequence, mutually exclusive events have the property: P(''A'' ∩ ''B'') = 0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intmath.com/Counting-probability/9_Mutually-exclusive-events.php intmath.com]; Mutually Exclusive Events. Interactive Mathematics. December 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it is impossible to draw a card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be drawn. When ''A'' and ''B'' are mutually exclusive, P(''A'' ∪ ''B'') = P(''A'') + P(''B'').&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;[http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch05-rul.html Stats: Probability Rules.]&lt;/ref&gt; To find the probability of drawing a red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of drawing a red card and the probability of drawing a club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.

One would have to draw at least two cards in order to draw both a red card and a club. The probability of doing so in two draws depends on whether the first card drawn were replaced before the second drawing, since without replacement there is one fewer card after the first card was drawn. The probabilities of the individual events (red, and club) are multiplied rather than added. The probability of drawing a red and a club in two drawings without replacement is then 26/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13/51&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 = 676/2652, or 13/51. With replacement, the probability would be 26/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 = 676/2704, or 13/52.

In probability theory, the word ''or'' allows for the possibility of both events happening. The probability of one or both events occurring is denoted P(''A'' ∪ ''B'') and in general it equals P(''A'') + P(''B'') – P(''A'' ∩ ''B'').&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt; Therefore, in the case of drawing a red card or a king, drawing any of a red king, a red non-king, or a black king is considered a success. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and four kings, two of which are red, so the probability of drawing a red or a king is 26/52 + 4/52 – 2/52 = 28/52.

Events are [[collectively exhaustive]] if all the possibilities for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so at least one of those outcomes must occur. The probability that at least one of the events will occur is equal to one.&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720051423/http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM4341/BayesPrimer2.pdf Scott Bierman. A Probability Primer. Carleton College. Pages 3-4.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for flipping a coin. Flipping a head and flipping a tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of flipping either a head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; In the case of flipping a coin, flipping a head and flipping a tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when a coin is flipped only once). The probability of flipping a head and the probability of flipping a tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/CliffsReviewTopic/NonMutually-Exclusive-Outcomes.topicArticleId-25951,articleId-25914.html Non-Mutually Exclusive Outcomes. CliffsNotes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]] and [[regression analysis]], an [[dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] that can take on only two possible values is called a [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. For example, it may take on the value 0 if an observation is of a male subject or 1 if the observation is of a female subject. The two possible categories associated with the two possible values are mutually exclusive, so that no observation falls into more than one category, and the categories are exhaustive, so that every observation falls into some category. Sometimes there are three or more possible categories, which are pairwise mutually exclusive and are collectively exhaustive — for example, under 18 years of age, 18 to 64 years of age, and age 65 or above. In this case a set of dummy variables is constructed, each dummy variable having two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive categories — in this example, one dummy variable (called D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) would equal 1 if age is less than 18, and would equal 0 ''otherwise''; a second dummy variable (called D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would equal 1 if age is in the range 18-64, and 0 otherwise. In this set-up, the dummy variable pairs (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can have the values (1,0) (under 18), (0,1) (between 18 and 64), or (0,0) (65 or older) (but not (1,1), which would nonsensically imply that an observed subject is both under 18 and between 18 and 64). Then the dummy variables can be included as independent (explanatory) variables in a regression. Note that the number of dummy variables is always one less than the number of categories: with the two categories male and female there is a single dummy variable to distinguish them, while with the three age categories two dummy variables are needed to distinguish them.

Such [[qualitative data]] can also be used for [[dependent variable]]s. For example, a researcher might want to predict whether someone goes to college or not, using family income, a gender dummy variable, and so forth as explanatory variables. Here the variable to be explained is a dummy variable that equals 0 if the observed subject does not go to college and equals 1 if the subject does go to college. In such a situation, [[ordinary least squares]] (the basic regression technique) is widely seen as inadequate; instead [[probit regression]] or [[logistic regression]] is used. Further, sometimes there are three or more categories for the dependent variable — for example, no college, community college, and four-year college. In this case, the [[multinomial probit]] or [[multinomial logit]] technique is used.

In mathematics, '''near sets''' are either spatially [[closeness (mathematics)|close]] or descriptively close. Spatially close sets have nonempty [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. In other words, spatially close sets are not [[disjoint sets]], since they always have at least one element in common. Descriptively close sets contain elements that have matching descriptions. Such sets can be either disjoint or non-disjoint sets. Spatially near sets are also descriptively near sets.

[[File:Minimally Descriptive Near Sets.svg|right|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' Descriptively, minimally near sets]]

The underlying assumption with descriptively close sets is that such sets contain elements that have location and measurable features such as colour and frequency of occurrence. The description of the element of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] is defined by a [[feature vector]]. Comparison of feature vectors provides a basis for measuring the closeness of descriptively near sets. Near set theory provides a formal basis for the observation, comparison, and classification of elements in sets based on their closeness, either spatially or descriptively. Near sets offer a framework for solving problems based on [[perception|human perception]] that arise in areas such as [[image processing]], [[computer vision]] as well as engineering and science problems.

Near sets have a variety of applications in areas such as [[topology]]{{cref2|37|1}}, [[pattern recognition|pattern detection]] and [[statistical classification|classification]]{{cref2|50|1}}, [[abstract algebra]]{{cref2|51|1}}, mathematics in computer science{{cref2|38|1}}, and solving a variety of problems based on human perception{{cref2|42|1}}{{cref2|82|1}}{{cref2|47|1}}{{cref2|52|1}}{{cref2|56|1}} that arise in areas such as [[image analysis]]{{cref2|54|1}}{{cref2|14|1}}{{cref2|46|1}}{{cref2|17|1}}{{cref2|18|1}}, image processing{{cref2|40|1}}, [[Facial recognition system|face recognition]]{{cref2|13|1}}, [[ethology]]{{cref2|64|1}}, as well as engineering and science problems{{cref2|55|1}}{{cref2|64|2}}{{cref2|42|2}}{{cref2|19|1}}{{cref2|17|2}}{{cref2|18|2}}. From the beginning, descriptively near sets have proved to be useful in applications of topology{{cref2|37|2}}, and visual pattern recognition {{cref2|50|2}}, spanning a broad spectrum of applications that include [[camouflage]] detection, [[micropaleontology]], handwriting forgery detection, biomedical image analysis, [[content-based image retrieval]], [[population dynamics]], [[quotient space (topology)|quotient topology]], [[textile design]], [[visual merchandising]], and topological psychology.

As an illustration of the degree of descriptive nearness between two sets, consider an example of the Henry colour model for varying degrees of nearness
between sets of picture elements in pictures (see, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|17|3}} §4.3). The two pairs of ovals in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 contain coloured segments. Each segment in the figures corresponds to an equivalence class where all pixels in the class have similar descriptions, ''i.e.'', picture elements with similar colours. The ovals in Fig.1 are closer to each other descriptively than the ovals in Fig. 2.

== History ==
It has been observed that the simple concept of ''nearness'' unifies various concepts of topological structures{{cref2|20|1}} inasmuch as the [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''Near''' of all nearness spaces and nearness preserving maps contains categories '''sTop''' (symmetric topological spaces and continuous maps{{cref2|3|1}}), '''Prox''' ([[proximity space]]s and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-maps{{cref2|8|1}}{{cref2|67|1}}), '''Unif''' ([[uniform space]]s and uniformly continuous maps{{cref2|81|1}}{{cref2|77|1}}) and '''Cont''' (contiguity spaces and contiguity maps{{cref2|24|1}}) as embedded full subcategories{{cref2|20|2}}{{cref2|59|1}}. The categories &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AMer}}&lt;/math&gt; are shown to be full supercategories of various well-known categories, including the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{sTop}&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric topological spaces and continuous maps, and the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of extended metric spaces and nonexpansive maps. The notation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\hookrightarrow\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; reads ''category'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; ''is embedded in category'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The categories &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AMer}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon ANear}&lt;/math&gt; are supercategories for a variety of familiar categories{{cref2|76|1}} shown in Fig. 3. Let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; denote the category of all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach nearness spaces and contractions, and let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AMer}&lt;/math&gt; denote the category of all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach merotopic spaces and contractions.

[[File:EANear and eAMer Supercategories.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Supercats]]

Among these familiar categories is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{sTop}&lt;/math&gt;, the symmetric form of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Top}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[category of topological spaces]]), the category with objects that are topological spaces and morphisms that are continuous maps between them{{cref2|1|1}}{{cref2|32|1}}. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^{\infty}}&lt;/math&gt; with objects that are extended metric spaces is a subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AP}&lt;/math&gt; (having objects &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach spaces and contractions)  (see also{{cref2|57|1}}{{cref2|75|1}}). Let &lt;math&gt;\rho_X,\rho_Y&lt;/math&gt; be extended pseudometrics on nonempty sets &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The map &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\rho_X)\longrightarrow(Y,\rho_Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction if and only if &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\nu_{D_{\rho_X}})\longrightarrow(Y,\nu_{D_{\rho_Y}})&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. For nonempty subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; , the distance function &lt;math&gt;D_{\rho}:2^X\times 2^X\longrightarrow [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\rho}(A,B) =\begin{cases}
\inf{\{\rho(a,b): a\in A, b\in B\}}, &amp;\text{if }A\text{ and }B\text{ are not empty},\\ 
\infty, &amp;\text{if }A\text{ or }B\text{ is empty}. 
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;'''AP''' is embedded as a full subcategory in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; by the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}\longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;F((X,\rho))=(X,\nu_{D_{\rho}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(f)=f&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\rho_X)\longrightarrow(Y,\rho_Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction if and only if &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\nu_{D_{\rho_X}})\longrightarrow(Y,\nu_{D_{\rho_Y}})&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. Thus &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}&lt;/math&gt; is embedded as a full subcategory in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; by the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}\longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;F((X,\rho))=(X,\nu_{D_{\rho}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(f)=f.&lt;/math&gt; Since the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of extended metric spaces and nonexpansive maps is a full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; is also a full supercategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt;. The category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; is a topological construct{{cref2|76|2}}.

[[File:Frigyes Riesz.jpeg|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' [[Frigyes Riesz]], 1880-1956]]

The notions of near and far{{cref2|A|1|group=2}} in mathematics can be traced back to works by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] and [[Felix Hausdorff]]. The related notions of resemblance and similarity can be traced back to [[Henri Poincaré|J.H. Poincaré]], who introduced sets of similar sensations (nascent tolerance classes) to represent the results of G.T. Fechner's sensation sensitivity experiments{{cref2|10|1}} and a framework for the study of resemblance in representative spaces as models of what he termed physical continua{{cref2|63|1}}{{cref2|60|1}}{{cref2|61|1}}. The elements of a physical continuum (pc) are sets of sensations. The notion of a pc and various representative spaces (tactile, visual, motor spaces) were introduced by Poincaré in an 1894 article on the mathematical continuum{{cref2|63|2}}, an 1895 article on space and geometry{{cref2|60|2}} and a compendious 1902 book on science and hypothesis{{cref2|61|2}} followed by a number of elaborations, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|62|1}}. The 1893 and 1895 articles on continua (Pt. 1, ch. II) as well as representative spaces and geometry (Pt. 2, ch IV) are included as chapters in{{cref2|61|3}}. Later, F. Riesz introduced the concept of proximity or nearness of pairs of sets at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1908{{cref2|65|1}}.

During the 1960s, [[Christopher Zeeman|E.C. Zeeman]] introduced tolerance spaces in modelling visual perception{{cref2|83|1}}. A.B. Sossinsky observed in 1986{{cref2|71|1}} that the main idea underlying tolerance space theory comes from Poincaré, especially{{cref2|60|3}}. In 2002, Z. Pawlak and J. Peters{{cref2|B|1|group=2}} considered an informal approach to the perception of the nearness of physical objects such as snowflakes that was not limited to spatial nearness. In 2006, a formal approach to the descriptive nearness of objects was considered by J. Peters, A. Skowron and J. Stepaniuk{{cref2|C|1|group=2}} in the context of proximity spaces{{cref2|39|1}}{{cref2|33|1}}{{cref2|35|1}}{{cref2|21|1}}. In 2007, descriptively near sets were introduced by J. Peters{{cref2|D|1|group=2}}{{cref2|E|1|group=2}} followed by the introduction of tolerance near sets{{cref2|41|1}}{{cref2|45|1}}. Recently, the study of descriptively near sets has led to algebraic{{cref2|22|1}}{{cref2|51|2}}, topological and proximity space{{cref2|37|4}} foundations of such sets.

== Nearness of sets ==
The adjective ''near'' in the context of near sets is used to denote the fact that observed feature value differences of distinct objects are small enough to be
considered indistinguishable, ''i.e.'', within some tolerance.

The exact idea of closeness or 'resemblance' or of 'being within tolerance' is universal enough to appear, quite naturally, in almost any mathematical setting
(see, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|66|1}}). It is especially natural in mathematical applications: practical problems, more often than not, deal with approximate input data and only require viable results with a tolerable level of error{{cref2|71|2}}.

The words ''near'' and ''far'' are used in daily life and it was an incisive suggestion of [[Frigyes Riesz|F. Riesz]]{{cref2|65|2}} that these intuitive concepts be made rigorous. He introduced the concept of nearness of pairs of sets at the ICM in Rome in 1908. This concept is useful in simplifying teaching calculus and advanced calculus. For example, the passage from an intuitive definition of continuity of a function at a point to its rigorous epsilon-delta definition is sometime difficult for teachers to explain and for students to understand. Intuitively, [[continuous function|continuity]] can be explained using nearness language, ''i.e.'', a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at a point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, provided points &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; go into points &lt;math&gt;\{f(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt;. Using Riesz's idea, this definition can be made more precise and its contrapositive is the familiar definition{{cref2|4|1}}{{cref2|36|1}}.

== Generalization of set intersection ==
From a spatial point of view, nearness (a.k.a. proximity) is considered a generalization of set [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. For disjoint sets, a form of nearness set intersection is defined in terms of a set of objects (extracted from disjoint sets) that have similar features within some
tolerance (see, ''e.g.'', §3 in{{cref2|80|1}}). For example, the ovals in Fig. 1 are considered near each other, since these ovals contain pairs of classes that display similar (visually indistinguishable) colours.

== Efremovič proximity space ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote a [[metric space|metric]] [[topological space]] that is endowed with one or more proximity relations and let &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; denote the collection of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  The collection &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

There are many ways to define Efremovič proximities on topological spaces (discrete proximity, standard proximity, metric proximity, Čech proximity, Alexandroff proximity, and Freudenthal proximity),  For details, see § 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–94 in{{cref2|6|1}}.
The focus here is on ''standard proximity'' on a topological space.  For &lt;math&gt;A,B\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is near &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided their closures share a common point.

The ''closure'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;A\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) is the usual [[Kuratowski closure axioms|Kuratowski closure]] of a set{{cref2|F|1|group=2}}, introduced in § 4, p.&amp;nbsp;20{{cref2|27}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mbox{cl}(A) &amp;= \left\{x\in X: D(x,A)=0\right\},\ \mbox{where}\\
D(x,A) &amp;= inf\left\{d(x,a): a\in A\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; is the Hausdorff distance (see § 22, p.&amp;nbsp;128, in{{cref2|15|1}}) between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,a) = \left|x - a \right|&lt;/math&gt; (standard distance)). A ''standard''  proximity relation is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X: \mbox{cl}(A)\ \cap\ \mbox{cl}(B)\neq\emptyset\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no points in common, the sets are ''far''from each other (denoted &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}\ B&lt;/math&gt;).

The following EF-proximity{{cref2|G|1|group=2}} space axioms are given by Jurij Michailov Smirnov{{cref2|67|2}} based on what [[Vadim Arsenyevich Efremovich|Vadim Arsenyevič Efremovič]] introduced during the first half of the 1930s{{cref2|8|2}}. Let &lt;math&gt;A,B,E\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;.

;EF.1 : If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.2 : &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if, at least one of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.3 : Two points are close, if and only if, they are the same point.
;EF.4 : All sets are far from the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.5 : For any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are far from each other, there exists &lt;math&gt;C,D\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C\cup D = X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (''Efremovič-axiom'').

The pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; is called an EF-[[proximity space]].   In this context, a [[space]] is a set with some added structure.  With a proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the structure of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the EF-proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. In a proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the intersection of all closed sets that contain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 1{{cref2|67|3}} : The closure of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Visualization of EF-axiom ==

[[File:Sample EF-space.svg|thumb|'''Figure 5.''' Example of a descriptive EF-proximity relation between sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C^c&lt;/math&gt;]]

Let the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be represented by the points inside the rectangular region in Fig. 5.  Also, let &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; be any two non-intersection subsets (''i.e.'' subsets spatially far from each other) in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in Fig. 5.  Let &lt;math&gt;C^c = X \backslash C&lt;/math&gt; ([[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;). Then from the EF-axiom, observe the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A\ &amp;\underline{\delta}\ B,\\
B &amp;\subset C,\\
D &amp;= C^c,\\
X &amp;= D \cup C,\\
 A &amp;\subset D,\ \mbox{hence, we can write}\\
A\ \underline{\delta}\ B\ &amp;\Rightarrow\ A\ \underline{\delta}\ C\ \mbox{and}\ B\ \underline{\delta}\ D,\ \mbox{for some}\ C,D\ \mbox{in}\ X \mbox{ so that } C\cup D = X. \qquad \blacksquare
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Descriptive proximity space ==
Descriptively near sets were introduced as a means of solving classification and pattern recognition problems arising from disjoint sets that resemble each other{{cref2|44|1}}{{cref2|43|1}}.  Recently, the connections between near sets in EF-spaces and near sets in descriptive EF-proximity spaces have been explored in{{cref2|53|1}}{{cref2|48|1}}.

Again, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric topological space and let &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \left\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\right\}&lt;/math&gt; a set of probe functions that represent features of each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  The assumption made here is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains non-abstract points that have measurable features such as gradient orientation.  A non-abstract point has a location and features that can be measured (see § 3 in {{cref2|26|1}}).

A ''probe function'' &lt;math&gt;\phi:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; represents a feature of a sample point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi:X\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = (\phi_1(x),\dots,\phi_n(x))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an n-dimensional real Euclidean [[vector space]].  &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a feature vector for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which provides a description of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. For example, this leads to a proximal view of sets of picture points in digital images{{cref2|48|2}}.

To obtain a descriptive proximity relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;), one first chooses a set of probe functions.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}: 2^X\longrightarrow 2^{R^n}&lt;/math&gt; be a mapping on a subset of &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; into a subset of &lt;math&gt;2^{R^n}&lt;/math&gt;.   For example, let &lt;math&gt;A,B\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A),\mathcal{Q}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denote sets of descriptions of points in &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{Q}(A) &amp;= \left\{\Phi(a): a\in A\right\},\\
\mathcal{Q}(B) &amp;= \left\{\Phi(b): b\in B\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;A\  \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is descriptively near'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;A\  \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is descriptively far from'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  The descriptive proximity of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))\; \delta \;\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(B)) \neq \emptyset.
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''descriptive intersection'' &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B = \left\{x\in A\cup B:\mathcal{Q}(A)\; \delta \;\mathcal{Q}(B)\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;x\in A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;, provided &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \Phi(a) = \Phi(b)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a\in A, b\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; can be disjoint and yet &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; can be nonempty.
The descriptive proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{\Phi} = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X:
                       \mbox{cl}(A)\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ \mbox{cl}(B)\neq\emptyset\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no points with matching descriptions, the sets are ''descriptively far'' from each other 
(denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;).

The binary relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''descriptive EF-proximity'', provided the following axioms are satisfied for &lt;math&gt;A,B,E\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.

;dEF.1 : If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.2 : &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if, at least one of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.3 : Two points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; are descriptively close, if and only if, the description of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; matches the description of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.4 : All nonempty sets are descriptively far from the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.5 : For any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are descriptively far from each other, there exists &lt;math&gt;C,D\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C\cup D = X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively far from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively far from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (''Descriptive Efremovič axiom'').

The pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta_{\Phi})&lt;/math&gt; is called a descriptive proximity space.

== Proximal relator spaces ==
A ''relator'' is a nonvoid family of relations  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; on a nonempty set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|72|1}}.  The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt; (also denoted &lt;math&gt;X(\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt;) is called a relator space. Relator spaces are natural generalizations of ordered sets and uniform spaces{{cref2|73|1}}{{cref2|74|1}}}. With the introduction of a family of proximity relations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta})&lt;/math&gt;.  For simplicity, we consider only two proximity relations, namely, the Efremovič proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|8|3}} and the descriptive proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; in defining the ''descriptive relator'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|53|2}}{{cref2|48|3}}. The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''proximal relator space ''{{cref2|49|1}}. In this work, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes a metric topological space that is endowed with the relations in a proximal relator. With the introduction of &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt;, the traditional closure of a subset (''e.g.'', {{cref2|9|1}}{{cref2|7|1}}) can be compared with the more recent descriptive closure of a subset.

In a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the ''descriptive closure of a set'' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A) = \left\{x\in X: {\Phi(x)} \delta \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is in the descriptive closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, provided the closure of &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))&lt;/math&gt; have at least one element in common.

;Theorem 2 {{cref2|50|3}} : The descriptive closure of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the descriptive EF-proximity space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that are descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 3 {{cref2|50|4}} : Kuratowski closure of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the descriptive closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in a descriptive EF-proximity space.

;Theorem 4 {{cref2|49|2}} : Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; be a proximal relator space, &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)\subseteq \mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

; Proof : Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\in\mathcal{Q}(X\setminus \mbox{cl}(A))&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \Phi(a)&lt;/math&gt;  for some &lt;math&gt;a\in \mbox{cl}A&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\in\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A))&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)\subseteq \mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;

In a proximal relator space, EF-proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; leads to the following results for descriptive proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 5 {{cref2|49|3}} : Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; be a proximal relator space, &lt;math&gt;A,B,C\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.  Then

;1&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B\ \mbox{implies}\ A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;.
;2&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; (A\cup B)\ \delta\ C\ \mbox{implies}\ (A\cup B)\ \delta_{\Phi}\ C &lt;/math&gt;.
;3&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{cl}A\ \delta\ \mbox{cl}B\ \mbox{implies}\ \mbox{cl}A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ \mbox{cl}B&lt;/math&gt;.

; Proof : 
;1&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B\Leftrightarrow A\cap B\neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;x\in A\cap B, \Phi(x)\in \mathcal{Q}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\in \mathcal{Q}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;1^\circ \Rightarrow\ 2^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
;3&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}A\ \delta\ \mbox{cl}B&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}A&lt;/math&gt; have at least one point in common. Hence, 1&lt;math&gt;^o\Rightarrow\ 3^o&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\qquad \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

== Descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods ==

[[File:Descriptive.svg|thumb|'''Figure 6.''' Example depicting &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods]]

In a pseudometric proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the neighbourhood of a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;N_{x,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;), for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
N_{x,\varepsilon} = \left\{y\in X: d(x,y) &lt; \varepsilon\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The interior of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) and boundary of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{bdy}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) in a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{int}(A) = \left\{x\in X: N_{x,\varepsilon}\subseteq A\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{bdy}(A) = \mbox{cl}(A)\setminus\mbox{int}(A).
&lt;/math&gt;

A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a ''natural strong inclusion'' in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|5|1}}{{cref2|6|2}}} (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \ll_{\delta}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided &lt;math&gt;A\subset\ \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}\ X\setminus \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is far from the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;).  Correspondingly, a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a ''descriptive strong inclusion'' in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A)\subset\ \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{int}B)&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ X\setminus \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is far from the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;).

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; be a descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood relation defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathop{\ll}_{\Phi} = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X: \mathcal{Q}(A)\subset \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{int}B)\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;, provided the description of each &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the set of descriptions of the points &lt;math&gt;b\in \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;.  Now observe that any &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; in the proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; have disjoint &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods,  ''i.e.'',
 
:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B\Leftrightarrow A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ E1, B\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ E2,\ \mbox{for some}\ E1,E2\subset X\ \mbox{(See Fig. 6).}
&lt;/math&gt;

; Theorem 6 {{cref2|50|5}} : Any two sets descriptively far from each other belong to disjoint descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods in a descriptive proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

A consideration of strong containment of a nonempty set in another set leads to the study of hit-and-miss topologies and the Wijsman topology{{cref2|2|1}}.

== Tolerance near sets ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be a real number greater than zero.  In the study of sets that are proximally near within some tolerance, the set of proximity relations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt; is augmented with a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]] tolerance proximity relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;) defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D_{\Phi}(A,B) &amp;= inf\left\{d(\Phi(a),\Phi(a)): \Phi(a)\in\mathcal{Q}(A), \Phi(a)\in \mathcal{Q}(B)\right\},\\
d(\Phi(a),\Phi(a)) &amp;= \mathop{\sum}_{i=1}^n |\phi_i(a)-\phi_i(b)|,\\
\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon} &amp;= \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X:
                       |D(\mbox{cl}(A), \mbox{cl}(B))| &lt; \varepsilon\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}} = \mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}\cup\left\{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, a nonempty set equipped with the proximal relator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt; has underlying [[mathematical structure|structure]] provided by the proximal relator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt; and provides a basis for the study of tolerance near sets in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are near within some tolerance.  Sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; in a descriptive pseudometric proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}})&lt;/math&gt; are tolerance near sets (''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{\Phi}(A,B) &lt; \varepsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Tolerance classes and preclasses ==
Relations with the same formal properties as similarity relations of sensations considered by Poincaré{{cref2|62|2}} are nowadays, after [[Christopher Zeeman|Zeeman]]{{cref2|83|2}}, called ''[[tolerance relation]]s''. A ''tolerance &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;'' is a relation &lt;math&gt;\tau \subseteq O \times O&lt;/math&gt; that is reflexive and symmetric.  In algebra, the term ''tolerance relation'' is also used in a narrow sense to denote reflexive and symmetric relations defined on universes of algebras that are also compatible with operations of a given algebra, ''i.e.'', they are generalizations of congruence relations (see ''e.g.'',{{cref2|12|1}}). In referring to such relations, the term ''algebraic tolerance'' or the term ''algebraic tolerance relation'' is used.
Transitive tolerance relations are equivalence relations. A set &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; together with a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''tolerance space'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;(O, \tau)&lt;/math&gt;). A set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq O&lt;/math&gt; is a ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-preclass'' (or briefly ''preclass'' when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is understood) if and only if for any &lt;math&gt;x,y \in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

The family of all preclasses of a tolerance space is naturally ordered by set inclusion and preclasses that are maximal with respect to set inclusion are called ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-classes'' or just ''classes'', when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is understood. The family of all classes of the space &lt;math&gt;(O, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; is particularly interesting and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau}(O)&lt;/math&gt;. The family &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau}(O)&lt;/math&gt; is a covering of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|58|1}}.

The work on similarity by Poincaré and Zeeman presage the introduction of near sets{{cref2|44|2}}{{cref2|43|1}} and research on similarity relations, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|79|1}}.  In science and engineering, tolerance near sets are a practical application of the study of sets that are near within some tolerance.  A tolerance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\in(0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is directly related to the idea of closeness or resemblance (''i.e.'', being within some tolerance) in comparing objects.
By way of application of Poincaré's approach in defining visual spaces and Zeeman's approach to tolerance relations, the basic idea is to compare objects such as image patches in the interior of digital images.

=== Examples ===

'''Simple Example'''

The following simple example demonstrates the construction of tolerance classes from real data. Consider the 20 objects in the table below with &lt;math&gt;|\Phi| = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"

|}

Let a [[tolerance relation]] be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\cong_{\varepsilon} = \{(x,y)\in O \times O :\; \parallel\Phi(x) - \Phi(y)\parallel_{_2} \leq \varepsilon\} &lt;/math&gt;

Then, setting &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 0.1&lt;/math&gt; gives the following tolerance classes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H_{\cong_{\varepsilon}}(O) = &amp; \{ \{x_1, x_8, x_{10}, x_{11}\},\{x_1, x_9, x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{14}\},\\
&amp; \{x_2, x_7, x_{18}, x_{19}\},\\
&amp; \{x_3, x_{12}, x_{17}\},\\
&amp; \{x_4, x_{13}, x_{20}\},\{x_4, x_{18}\},\\
&amp; \{x_5, x_6, x_{15}, x_{16}\},\{x_5, x_6, x_{15}, x_{20}\},\\
&amp; \{x_6, x_{13}, x_{20}\}\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that each object in a tolerance class satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\parallel\Phi(x) -\Phi(y)\parallel_2\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and that almost all of the objects appear in more than one class. Moreover, there would be twenty classes if the indiscernibility relation was used since there are no two objects with matching descriptions.

'''Image Processing Example'''

[[File:NearImages.svg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 7.''' Example of images that are near each other. (a) and (b) Images from the freely available LeavesDataset (see, ''e.g.'', www.vision.caltech.edu/archive.html).]]

The following example provides an example based on digital images. Let a subimage be defined as a small subset of [[pixel]]s belonging to a digital image such that the pixels contained in the subimage form a square. Then, let the sets &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; respectively represent the subimages obtained from two different images, and let &lt;math&gt;O = \{X \cup Y\}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, let the description of an object be given by the Green component in the [[RGB color model]].  The next step is to find all the tolerance classes using the tolerance relation defined in the previous example. Using this information, tolerance classes can be formed containing objects that have similar (within some small &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) values for the Green component in the RGB colour model. Furthermore, images that are near (similar) to each other should have tolerance classes divided among both images (instead of a tolerance classes contained solely in one of the images). For example, the  figure accompanying this example shows a subset of the tolerance classes obtained from two leaf images. In this figure, each tolerance class is assigned a separate colour. As can be seen, the two leaves share similar tolerance classes. This example highlights a need to measure the degree of nearness of two sets.

== Nearness measure ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(U,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}})&lt;/math&gt; denote a particular descriptive pseudometric EF-proximal relator space equipped with the proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and with nonempty subsets &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in 2^U&lt;/math&gt; and with the tolerance relation &lt;math&gt;\cong_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; defined in terms of a set of probes &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\in (0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, where

[[File:Visulization of nearness measure.jpg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 8.''' Examples of degree of nearness between two sets: (a) High degree of nearness, and (b) Low degree of nearness.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\simeq_{\Phi,\varepsilon} = \{(x, y)\in U\times U\mid\ |\Phi(x) - \Phi(y)| \leq\varepsilon\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Further, assume &lt;math&gt;Z = X\cup Y&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; denote the family of all classes in the space &lt;math&gt;(Z, \simeq_{\Phi,\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X, B\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The distance &lt;math&gt;D_{_{tNM}}:2^U\times 2^U:\longrightarrow [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; D_{_{tNM}}(X,Y) =
\begin{cases}
   1-tNM(A,B), &amp;\mbox{if }X\mbox{ and }Y\mbox{ are not empty},\\
   \infty,&amp;\mbox{if }X\mbox{ or }Y\mbox{ is empty},
	\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
tNM(A, B) = \Biggl(\sum_{C\in H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)} |C|\Biggr)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{C\in H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)} |C| \frac{ \min (|C\cap A |,|[C\cap B|)}{\max (|C\cap A |,|C\cap B|)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The details concerning &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; are given in{{cref2|14|2}}{{cref2|16|1}}{{cref2|17|4}}. The idea behind &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is that sets that are similar should have a similar number of objects in each tolerance class. Thus, for each tolerance class obtained from the covering of &lt;math&gt;Z=X\cup Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of objects that belong to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and takes the ratio (as a proper fraction) of their cardinalities. Furthermore, each ratio is weighted by the total size of the tolerance class (thus giving importance to the larger classes) and the final result is normalized by dividing by the sum of all the cardinalities. The range of &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is in the interval [0,1], where a value of 1 is obtained if the sets are equivalent (based on object descriptions) and a value of 0 is obtained if they have no descriptions in common.

As an example of the degree of nearness between two sets, consider figure below in which each image consists of two sets of objects, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Each colour in the figures corresponds to a set where all the objects in the class share the same description. The idea behind &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is that the nearness of sets in a perceptual system is based on the cardinality of tolerance classes that they share. Thus, the sets in left side of the figure are closer (more near) to each other in terms of their descriptions than the sets in right side of the figure.

== Near set evaluation and recognition (NEAR) system ==

[[File:Near gui.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 9.''' NEAR system GUI.]]

The Near set Evaluation and Recognition (NEAR) system, is a system developed to demonstrate practical applications of near set theory to the problems of image segmentation evaluation and image correspondence. It was motivated by a need for a freely available software tool that can provide results for research and to generate interest in near set theory. The system implements a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) where each separate processing task is performed in its own child frame. The objects (in the near set sense) in this system are subimages of the images being processed and the probe functions (features) are image processing functions defined on the subimages. The system was written in C++ and was designed to facilitate the addition of new processing tasks and probe functions. Currently, the system performs six major tasks, namely, displaying equivalence and tolerance classes for an image, performing segmentation evaluation, measuring the nearness of two images, performing Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), and displaying the output of processing an image using a specific probe function.

== Proximity System ==

[[File:Proximity System.png|thumb|'''Figure 10.''' The Proximity System.]]

The Proximity System is an application developed to demonstrate descriptive-based topological approaches to nearness and proximity within the context of digital image analysis. The Proximity System grew out of the work of S. Naimpally and J. Peters on Topological Spaces. The Proximity System was written in Java and is intended to run in two different operating environments, namely on Android smartphones and tablets, as well as desktop platforms running the Java Virtual Machine. With respect to the desktop environment, the Proximity System is a cross-platform Java application for Windows, OSX, and Linux systems, which has been tested on Windows 7 and Debian Linux using the Sun Java 6 Runtime. In terms of the implementation of the theoretical approaches, both the Android and the desktop based applications use the same back-end libraries to perform the description-based calculations, where the only differences are the user interface and the Android version has less available features due to restrictions on system resources.

{{Cnote2|E|n=1|group=2|A non-spatial view of near sets appears in, C.J. Mozzochi, M.S. Gagrat, and S.A. Naimpally, Symmetric generalized topological structures, Exposition Press, Hicksville, NY, 1976., and, more recently, nearness of disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; based on resemblance between pairs of elements &lt;math&gt;x\in X, y\in Y&lt;/math&gt; (''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have similar feature vectors &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\phi(x)},\boldsymbol{\phi(y)}&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\parallel\boldsymbol{\phi(x)} - \boldsymbol{\phi(y)}\parallel_{_p} &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) See, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|43|3}}{{cref2|42|3}}{{cref2|53|3}}.}}

{{Cnote2|F|n=1|group=2|The basic facts about closure of a set were first pointed out by M. Fréchet in{{cref2|11|1}}, and elaborated by B. Knaster and C. Kuratowski in{{cref2|25|1}}.}}

{{Cnote2|G|n=1|group=2|Observe that up to the 1970s, ''proximity'' meant EF-proximity, since this is the one that was studied intensively. The pre-1970 work on proximity spaces is exemplified by the series of papers by J. M. Smirnov during the first half of the 1950s{{cref2|68|1}}{{cref2|67|4}}{{cref2|69|1}}{{cref2|70|1}}, culminating in the compendious collection of results by S.A. Naimpally and B.D. Warrack{{cref2|34|1}}. But in view of later developments, there is a need to distinguish between various proximities. A ''basic proximity'' or ''Čech-proximity'' was introduced by E. Čech during the late 1930s (see §25 A.1, pp. 439-440 in {{cref2|78|1}}). The conditions for the non-symmetric case for a proximity were introduced by S. Leader{{cref2|28|n=1}} and for the symmetric case by M.W. Lodato{{cref2|29|1}}{{cref2|30|1}}{{cref2|31|1}}.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Negative thermal expansion''' (NTE) is an unusual [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] process in which some materials contract upon heating, rather than expand as most other materials do. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential [[engineering]], [[photonics|photonic]], [[Electronics|electronic]], and [[structural]] applications. For example, if one were to mix a '''negative thermal expansion''' material with a "normal" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to make a zero expansion [[composite material]].

== Origin of negative thermal expansion ==

There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, [[Rigid Unit Modes]] and [[phase transitions]].

Recently, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.07.001|title=Origin of negative thermal expansion phenomenon in solids|year=2011|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shun-Li|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=65|issue=8|pages=664–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in {{chem|Fe|3|Pt}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep07043|pmid=25391631|pmc=4229665|title=Thermal Expansion Anomaly Regulated by Entropy|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=7043|year=2014|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shunli|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E7043L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems ==

Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. [[ice]], [[graphene]], etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. {{Chem|Cu|2|O}}, {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}, beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper,&lt;ref name=Rechtsman&gt;{{Citation
 | title =Negative thermal expansion in single-component systems with isotropic interactions

 | pmid = 17988108| year = 2007

 | pages = 12816–12821
 | volume = 111
 | issue = 49
 | last1 = Rechtsman | first1 = M.C.
 | last2 = Stillinger | first2 = F.H.
 | last3 = Torquato | first3 = S. | bibcode = 2007JPCA..11112816R| arxiv = 0807.3559}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that negative thermal expansion (NTE) is also realized in single-component close-packed lattices with pair central force interactions. The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed:

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a) &gt;  0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt; is pair [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance. This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. ''An approximate'' necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper&lt;ref name=Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Comment on 'Negative Thermal Expansion in Single-Component Systems with Isotropic Interactions'
 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A
 | volume = 118
 | issue = 41
 | pages = 9793–4
 | doi = 10.1021/jp509140n

 | year = 2014
 | last1 = Kuzkin
 | first1 = Vitaly A.
 |bibcode = 2014JPCA..118.9793K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a)a &gt; -(d-1)\Pi''(a),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is cased by anharmonicity of [[interatomic potential]] only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both &lt;math&gt;\Pi''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi'''&lt;/math&gt; are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications for materials with controlled thermal expansion properties, as thermal expansion causes many problems in engineering, and indeed in everyday life. One simple example of a thermal expansion problem is the tendency of [[dental fillings]] to expand by an amount different from the [[teeth]], for example when drinking a hot drink, causing [[toothache]]. If dental fillings were made of a [[composite material]] containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of [[tooth enamel]].

== Materials ==

Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit ''negative thermal expansion'' is '''[[zirconium tungstate]]''' ({{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}). This compound contracts continuously over a temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Negative Thermal Expansion from 0.3 to 1050 Kelvin in {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=272|issue=5258|pages=90–92|doi= 10.1126/science.272.5258.90|bibcode = 1996Sci...272...90M|last1=Mary|first1=T. A.|last2=Evans|first2=J. S. O.|last3=Vogt|first3=T.|last4=Sleight|first4=A. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials that exhibit this behaviour include: other members of the {{chem|A|M|2|O|8}} family of materials (where A = {{chem|Zr}} or {{chem|Hf}}, M = {{chem|Mo}} or {{chem|W}}) and {{chem|Zr|V|2|O|7}}. {{chem|A|2|({{Chem|M|O|4}})|3}} also is an example of controllable ''negative thermal expansion''.

Ordinary ice shows NTE in its hexagonal and cubic phases at very low temperatures (below –200&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=ice_NTE&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108768194004933|title=Lattice constants and thermal expansion of {{Chem|H|2|O}} and {{Chem|D|2|O}} ice Ih between 10 and 265 K|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|year=1994|volume= 50|pages=644–648|issue=6|last1=Röttger|first1=K.|last2=Endriss|first2=A.|last3=Ihringer|first3=J.|last4=Doyle|first4=S.|last5=Kuhs|first5=W. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its liquid form, pure [[water]] also displays negative thermal expansivity below 3.984&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Rubber elasticity]] shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials. Put simply, as the long polymer chains absorb energy, they adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeleyphysicsdemos.net/node/344 |title=Heating a rubber band: negative coefficient of thermal expansion &amp;#124; Lecture Demonstrations |publisher=Berkeleyphysicsdemos.net |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz ({{chem|Si|O|2}}) and a number of zeolites also show NTE over certain temperature ranges.&lt;ref name=zeolite1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b002950p|title=The widespread occurrence of negative thermal expansion in zeolites|journal= Journal of Materials Chemistry|year= 2001|volume= 11|pages=212–216|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Philip|last2=Woodcock|first2=David A.|last3=Maple|first3=Martin J.|last4=Villaescusa|first4=Luis A.|last5=Wright|first5=Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zeolite2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attfield|first1=Martin P.|title=Strong negative thermal expansion in siliceous faujasite|journal= Chemical Communications|year=1998|pages=601–602|doi=10.1039/A707141H|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly pure silicon (Si) has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 K and 120 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = William C. |editor1-last= O'Mara |editor2-first = Robert B. |editor2-last=Herring | editor3-first = Lee P. |editor3-last=Hunt

Cubic [[Scandium trifluoride]] has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-incredible-material-reveal-scandium-trifluoride.html|title=An incredible shrinking material: Engineers reveal how scandium trifluoride contracts with heat|last=Woo|first=Marcus|date=7 November 2011|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|Sc|F|3}} exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="greve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greve|first=Benjamin K.|author2=Kenneth L.

Shape memory alloys such as NiTi are a nascent class of materials that exhibit zero and negative thermal expansion [13].

'''''On Virtue''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ Ἀρετῆς}}; {{lang-la|De Virtute}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Estienne]] (ed.), ''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'', Vol. 3, 1578, [https://archive.org/stream/platonisoperaqua03plat#page/376/mode/2up p. 368].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Socratic dialogue]] attributed to [[Plato]], but which is considered spurious. In the short dialogue, [[Socrates]] discusses with a friend questions about whether virtue can be taught.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;John Madison Cooper, D. S. Hutchinson, (1997), ''Plato, Complete works'', page 1694. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; To answer this question, the author of the dialogue does little more than copy out a few passages from the ''[[Meno]]'' almost word for word.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], (1986), ''A history of Greek philosophy: The later Plato and the Academy'', page 398. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relative hour''' ([[Hebrew]] singular: {{transl|he|shaʿah zǝmanit}} / {{lang|he|שעה זמנית}}; plural: {{transl|he|shaʿot - zǝmaniyot}} / {{lang|he|שעות זמניות}}), sometimes called '''halachic hour''', '''seasonal hour''' and '''variable hour''', is a term used in [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic Jewish]] law that assigns 12 hours to each day and 12 hours to each night, all throughout the year. A relative hour has no fixed radical, but changes with the length of each day - depending on summer (when the days are long and the nights are short), and on winter (when the days are short and the nights are long). Even so, in all seasons a day is always divided into 12 hours, and a night is always divided into 12 hours, which inevitably makes for a longer hour or a shorter hour.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33); ''Questions and Responsa of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Joshua Blau), vol. 1, Rubin Mass publishers: Jerusalem 1989, ''responsum'' # 134 (pp. 251–255);  [[Yaakov de Castro]], ''`Erekh Leḥem'' (''Orach Chaim'' §233:2)&lt;/ref&gt; All of the hours mentioned by the [[Sages of Israel|Sages]] in either the [[Mishnah]] or [[Talmud]], or in other rabbinic writings, refer strictly to relative hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33), who wrote: "Be apprised that all of the hours that are mentioned throughout all the Mishnah are none other than relative hours, and the word ''relative'' has the connotation of those hours wherein there are twelve in the daytime, as also at night."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Questions and Responsa of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Joshua Blau), vol. 1, Rubin Mass publishers: Jerusalem 1989, ''responsum'' # 134 (p. 252)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of this ancient practice is that, unlike the standard modern [[12-hour clock]] that assigns 12 o'clock pm for [[noon]] time, in the ancient Jewish tradition noon time was always the ''sixth hour'' of the day, whereas the ''first hour'' began with the break of [[dawn]], by most exponents of Jewish law,&lt;ref&gt;''Magen Avraham'' §58:1, §433:3 of R. [[Avraham Gombiner]]; [[Maimonides]]' commentary on Mishnah ''Megillah'' 2:4; the Responsa ''Terumat HaDeshen'', ''responsum'' # 1 of R. [[Israel Isserlein]]; the ''Levush'' §267 of R. [[Mordecai Yoffe]]; ''Minchat Kohen'' (Mevoh Shemesh 2:6) of R. [[Abraham Cohen Pimentel]], in the name of Tosefot Ha-Ramban ([[Nachmanides]]) and R. [[Shlomo ben Aderet]] (Rashba); ''Bayit Chadash'' §431 of R. [[Joel Sirkis]]; ''Turei Zahav'' §433 of R. [[David HaLevi Segal]]; ''Pri Chadash'' §433 of R. [[Hezekiah da Silva]]; ''Eliyahu Rabbah'' 58:2 of R. [[Elijah Spira]]; ''Mizbe’ach Adamah'' 4a of R. Mordechai Chaim Meyuchas; ''Mikra'ei Kodesh'' 158b by R. Baruch Gigi; ''Mateh Yehuda'' §433 of R. Yehudah Ayash; the Responsa ''Hayim Sha'al'' 2:38 (70) of R. [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]]; ''Tov Ayin'' 18:38 of R. Alter Yechiel Naiman; ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' 21:3, 27:1 of R. [[Avraham Danzig]]; ''Kitzur Shulhan Arukh'' 17:1 of R. [[Shlomo Ganzfried]], ''Chesed La'alafim'' 58:5 of R. [[Eliezer Papo]]; ''Shiltei ha-Gibborim'' 58:3 of [[Joshua Boaz ben Simon Baruch]]; ''Rav Poalim'' (Orach Chaim 2:2); ''Shalmei Tzibbur'' 93c of R. Yisrael Ya'akov Algazi, among others. Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tukachinsky in ''Sefer Eretz Yisrael'' (p. 18:3) has written that the custom of the Land of Israel is to follow the ''Magen Avraham'' and only under extenuating circumstances may one rely on the Vilna Gaon.&lt;/ref&gt; and with sunrise by the [[Vilna Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bi'urei ha-Gra'' ("Elucidations of the Gra") §459:2&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]. 12:o'clock am (midnight) was also the ''sixth hour'' of the night, whereas the ''first hour'' of the night began when the first three stars appeared in the night sky.

==Jewish tradition==
In old times, the hour was detected by observation of the position of the sun,&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ravid ha-Zahav of Rabbi David Mishreqi (Mizrachi)'', ed. Shimon Giat, Betar-Ilit 2002, Responsa ''Ravid Ha-Zahav'', ''responsum'' # 13, s.v. ונהירנא (p. 182)&lt;/ref&gt; or when the first three stars appeared in the night sky. During the first six hours of the day, the sun is seen in the eastern sky. At the ''sixth hour'', the sun is always at its [[zenith]] in the sky, meaning, it is either directly overhead, or parallel (depending on the [[Hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Pesahim'' 12b; 11b&lt;/ref&gt; Those persons living in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the south, whereas for those living in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the north. From the 6th and a half hour to the 12th hour, the sun inclines towards the west, until it sets. The conclusion of a day at the end of twilight may slightly vary in minutes from place to place, depending on the elevation and the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Meir Kagan]], ''[[Mishnah Berura]]'' on ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orah Hayyim'' 261:2:23), otherwise known as the time it takes to walk "three quarters of a biblical mile."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, nightfall ushers in more quickly in the low-lying valleys, than it does on a high mountaintop.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Shabbat'' 118b) we read: Rabbi Jose has said: “Let my portion be with those who usher in the Sabbath day [at its outset] in [[Tiberias]], and with those who dismiss the Sabbath day [at its recess] in [[Sepphoris]].” This has been explained by Aaron Mordechai Freedman (editor of the 1987 Soncino edition of ''Tractate Shabbath''): "In Tiberias, which was situated in a valley, the Sabbath commenced rather earlier, whilst in Sepphoris, which was on a mountain, it terminated rather later than elsewhere." (v. ''Hebrew-English Edition of the Babylonian Talmud'', Tractate Shabbath, Soncino edition, London 1987, s.v. ''Shabbath'' 118b, note (b)3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freedman's description of twilight being, literally, an oscillating physical reality dependent upon one's location is supported by Rabbi [[Joseph ibn Migash]] (1077–1141) [''Responsa of R. Joseph ibn Migash'', ''responsum'' # 45] and by Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]] (c. 1479–1573) [''Responsa of Rabbi David ben Zimra'', book I, ''responsum'' # 76], as also by Rabbi Hayyim Eliezer, the son of [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] (13th century), who also compiled a book called "Or Zarua" (''responsum'' # 186). Apparently, there is a local phenomenon relating to light emanating from fixed stars in the sky, and their becoming visible once a certain level of darkness has enveloped the land. [[Rashi]], however, differs in view, whose opinion is supported also by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]] (1249–1306) Langa's Edition, p. 460, and Rabbi [[Nissim ben Jacob]] (990–1062), and who all thought that twilight was a fixed time for all, but that the people of Tiberias and Sepphoris were merely stringent in their religious practices, the one group welcoming the Sabbath early, while the other departing from it as late as possible.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The conventional Jewish way of calibrating the time of day is to reckon the "first hour" of the day with the rise of [[dawn]] ({{Lang-he-n|עמוד השחר}}), that is to say, approximately 72 minutes before sunrise,&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33); ''Megillah'' 2:4 (p. 232)&lt;/ref&gt; and the end of the day commencing shortly after sunset when the first three medium-size stars have appeared in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;''Responsa of Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]]'', Book 4, Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), s.v. ''responsum'' # 1353 (282)&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment of sunset when the sun is no longer visible until the appearance of the first three medium-size stars is a unit of time called evening [[twilight]] ({{Lang-he-n|בין השמשות}}). In the Talmud, twilight is estimated at being the time that it takes a person to walk three quarters of a [[biblical mile]] (i.e. 1,500 cubits, insofar that a biblical mile is equal to 2,000 cubits).&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 34b&amp;ndash;35a; [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]], ''Birkei Yosef'' (Orah Hayyim, § 261:1), Levorno 1774, citing the author of ''Ginat Weradim'', who wrote: "The world has it as a practice in all the Diaspora communities of Israel [to follow the opinion of] the ''[[Geonim]]''" (i.e. with respect to the time of ''bayn ha-shemashot'' (twilight; nightfall), so that immediately following sunset begins the time known as ''bayn ha-shemashot'', which is the time it takes to walk three quarters of a biblical mile). The opinion of Rabbi Chaim Azulai comes to counter a variant opinion that is also found in the Talmud (''Pesahim'' 94a), where it states that a man is able to walk four ''mil'' between sunset and nightfall, an opinion rejected by most exponents of Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''Shulhan Arukh'', a man traverses a biblical mile in 18 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Karo, ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''[[Orah Hayyim]]'' § 459:2)&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, one is able to walk three quarters of a mile in 13½ minutes. According to [[Maimonides]], a man walks a biblical mile in 24 minutes, meaning, three quarters of a mile is done in 18 minutes. In Jewish law, the short period of dusk or twilight (from the moment the sun has disappeared over the horizon until the appearance of the first three stars) is a space of time whose designation is doubtful, partly considered day and partly considered night. When the first medium-size star appears in the night sky, it is still considered day; when the second star appears, it is an ambiguous case. When the third star appears, it is the beginning of the ''first hour'' of the night. Between the break of dawn and the first three medium-size stars that appear in the night sky there are always 12 hours.

In the [[Modern Age]] of astral science and of precise astronomical calculations, it is now possible to determine the length of the ever-changing hour by simple mathematics. To determine the length of each relative hour, one needs but simply know two variables: (a) the precise time of sunrise, and (b) the precise time of sunset. Since the actual day begins approximately 72 minutes before sunrise, and ends 13½ minutes after the sun has already set and can no longer be seen over the horizon (according to Maran),&lt;ref&gt;Shulhan Arukh (''Orah Hayyim'' § 261:2)&lt;/ref&gt; or 18 minutes (according to Maimonides), by collecting the total number of minutes in any given day and dividing the total number of minutes by 12, the dividend that one is left with is the number of minutes to each hour. In summer months, when the days are long, the length of each hour during daytime can be as much as 77 minutes or more, whereas the length of each hour during nighttime can be less than 42 minutes.

==Practical bearing==
In Jewish [[Halacha]], the practical bearing of this teaching is reflected in many ''[[halachic]]'' practices. For example, whenever observant Jews refer to the appointed time for reciting the verses of ''[[Kriyat Shema]]'', ideally, this recital must be made from the time of sunrise until the end of the ''third hour'' of the day, a time that actually fluctuates on the standard 12-hour clock, depending on summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt; Its application is also used in determining the time of the [[Shacharit|Morning Prayer]], traditionally said, as a first resort, from sunrise until the end of the ''fourth hour'',&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Karo, ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''[[Orah Hayyim]]''  § 89:1)&lt;/ref&gt; but as a last resort can be said until noon time,&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Berakhot'' 4:1 (Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]], ''Hil. Tefillah'' 3:1) &lt;/ref&gt; and which times will vary if one were to rely solely on the dials of the standard [[12-hour clock]], depending on the Summer months and Winter months.

On the [[eve of Passover]], Jews are only permitted to eat leavened bread-stuffs until the ''fourth-hour'' of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah ([https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Pesachim.1.4?lang=bi ''Pesahim'' 1:4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish tradition, prayers were usually offered at the time of the [[Whole-burnt offering|daily whole-burnt offerings]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rabbeinu Hananel's Commentary on Tractate Berakhot'' (ed. David Metzger),Jerusalem 1990, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 26a (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian, [[Josephus]], writing about the daily whole-burnt offering, says that it was offered twice each day, in the morning and about the ''ninth hour''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (xiv.iv.§ 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]], a compendium of Jewish oral laws compiled in the late 2nd-century CE, says of the morning daily offering that it was offered in the ''fourth hour'',&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Eduyot'' 6:1&lt;/ref&gt; but says of the late afternoon offering: "The daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half after the ''eighth hour'', and offered up at a half after the ''ninth hour''."&lt;ref name=MishnahPesahim&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. ''Pesahim'' 5:1, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, when describing the slaughter of the [[Passover offering]]s on the eve of Passover (the 14th day of the lunar month [[Nisan]]), Josephus writes: "...their feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ''ninth hour'' to the ''eleventh'', etc." (roughly corresponding to 3 o'clock pm to 5 o'clock pm).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Wars of the Jews|Wars]]'' (vi.ix.§ 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Mishnah states that on the eve of Passover the daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half past the ''seventh hour'', and offered up at a half past the ''eighth hour''.&lt;ref name=MishnahPesahim/&gt;

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], a '''risk-seeker''' or '''risk-lover''' is a person who has a [[preference (economics)|preference]] ''for'' [[risk]].  While most [[investment|investors]] are considered [[risk averse|risk ''averse'']], one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking. If offered either $50 or a 50% each chance of either $100 or nothing, a risk-seeking person would prefer the gamble even though the gamble and the sure thing have the same [[expected value]]. 

Risk-seeking behavior can be observed in the negative domain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; for [[prospect theory]] value functions, where the functions are convex for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; but concave for &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Psychology==

===Child personality traits' effect on adulthood – What traits contribute to risk-seeking?===

In a study done by Friedman et al. (1995), they found significant evidence to support that low childhood conscientiousness contributed heavily to adulthood mortality. Those who were high in conscientiousness as a child were 30% less likely to die in their adulthood. Ultimately, their findings solidified that low levels of childhood conscientiousness predict risk seeking, and risk-seeking increases the chance of accidental death. Though risk-seeking deteriorates with age, risky exposure to abusive substances in adolescence can lead to lifetime risk factors due to addiction.  Conscientious individuals are subject to greater internal impulse control which lets them think out risky decisions more carefully, while those low on conscientiousness are more likely to endanger themselves and others by risky, or sometimes even criminal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, S., (2006). Methods by which childhood personality traits influence adult well-being. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', 17, 264-268.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Psychometric paradigm=== 

The psychometric paradigm explores what stable personality traits and risk behaviours have in common with an individualistic approach. Zuckerman's (1994) sensation seeking theory is important in assessing the causative factors of certain risk-seeking behaviours. Many risk-seeking behaviours justify humans need for sensation seeking. Behaviours like adventurous sports, drug use, promiscuous sex, entrepreneurship, gambling, and dangerous driving to name a few both represent sensation seeking, as well as risk seeking.  Impulsivity has been linked to risk-seeking and can be described as the desire to indulge in situations with a potential reward, and little to no planning of the potential punishments of loss or reward. Impulsivity has also been linked to sensation seeking and in recent theories have been combined to form a higher order trait called impulsive sensation seeking.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, M., Kuhlman, D. M., Joireman, J., Teta, P., 8c Kraft, M. (1993). A comparison of three structural models for personality: The big three, the
big five and the alternative five. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 65, 757-768.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychological paradigm=== 

The neuropsychological paradigm looks at why people make the decisions they do, as well as the neuropsychological processes that contribute to the decisions people make. This view looks less at impulsivity, puts more emphasis on cognitive dynamics and assumes people take risks because they have assessed the future outcomes.

===Men vs. women seeking risks===

Demographic differences also play a role in risk-seeking between individuals. Through an analysis done by scientists, they demonstrated that men typically seek risks more than women.&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, P., Miller, C., Schafer, D. (1999). Gender differences in risk
taking: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 125, 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; There are biological differences in men and women that may lead to the drive to seek risks. For example, testosterone plays a large role in risk-seeking in people and women have significantly lower levels of this hormone. This hormone has behavioural effects on aggression, mood and sexual function, all of which can lead to risk-seeking decision making. In their study, they also found that testosterone in excess leads to increased sexual enjoyment, and therefore more of an incentive to engage in risky unprotected sex.&lt;ref&gt;O'connor D., Archer, J., Wu, F. (2004) Effects of testosterone on mood, aggression, and sexual behaviour in young men: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. ''The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism'', 89, 2837-2845. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn, D. (2008) The psychology of risk-taking: toward the integration of psychometric and neuropsychological paradigms. ''The American Journal of psychology,'' 121, 363-376. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk-seeking utility function==
Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]].  Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first [[derivative]].  The utility function whose expected value is maximized is [[convex function|convex]] for a risk-seeker,  [[concave function|concave]] for a risk-averse agent, and linear for a [[risk neutral|risk-neutral]] agent.  Its convexity in the risk-seeking case has the effect of causing a [[mean-preserving spread]] of any [[probability distribution]] of wealth outcomes to be preferred over the unspread distribution.

'''Sin Ik-hui''' ([[Hangul|Chosŏn'gŭl]]: 신익히, [[hanja]]: 申翼熙) (9 June 1892 - 5 May 1956) was a [[Korea]]n independence activist and politician during the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCg786J3nnsC&amp;pg=PT28|title=Korea Focus - August 2012|last=Foundation|first=The Korea|date=2013-03-30|publisher=한국국제교류재단|year=|isbn=9788986090888|location=|pages=28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea|Speaker of the National Assembly]] during President [[Syngman Rhee]]'s first term (4 August 1948 and 30 May 1950) and second term (19 June 1950 and 30 May 1954). His nickname was '''Haegong''' (해공, 海公) or '''Haehu''' (해후; 海候); his [[courtesy name]] was '''Yeogu''' (여구; 如耉).

== Life ==
Sin Ik-hui was a descendant of [[Sin Rip]] and [[Sin Kyung-hee]], [[Sin Saimdang]]. He was born in Samaru country in [[Gwangju, Gyeonggi|Gwangju]], [[Gyeonggi Province]]. He became an orphan and his second elder half-brother Sin Kyu-hee nurtured him. In his early years, he studied abroad in [[Japan]].

In 1918, he was exiled to [[Shanghai]] in [[China]], in April 1919.

==Politician==
He was involved in the creation of the [[Provisional National Assembly of Korea]]s. He was elected as a Congressman of the Provisional National Assembly of Korea. On April 23, he was appointed to Vice minister of Foreign Affairs of [[Provisional Government of Korea]].

In August 1919, Sin became vice Minister of Justice and in September, he was appointed as Justice Minister and in September 1920, Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1930s he became an English professor at a Chinese University.

In May 1940 he was appointed to Provisional Government of Korea, and in 1944 he was reappointed to Interior Minister to the Provisional Government.

In May 1948 he was elected Congressman of [[National Assembly of Korea]]. On August 4, 1948 he was 2nd term head of First Republic and 19 June 1950, he again was Speaker until 30 May 1954.

In 1955 he was involved with the founding of the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 1955)|Democratic Party]] and elected as its fourth leader. In 1956 he ran for president, but died of heart failure and overwork at age 64. He had boarded a train to [[Seoul]] with John Chang to commence campaigning soon after registration of candidates had closed. Minutes after taking their seats however, Sin became violently ill. He rushed to the toilet, but died. When the November election was held three months later, his name was still on the ballot, and he received close to half of the people's votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QUKMAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT243|title=One Happy Old Priest|last=Sullivan|first=Thomas K.|date=2010-03-17|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=|isbn=9781465328823|location=|pages=243|language=en}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sky-3.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The sky above the [[cloud]]s]]

The '''sky''' (or '''celestial dome''') is everything that lies above the surface of the [[Earth]], including the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]].

In the field of [[astronomy]], the sky is also called the [[celestial sphere]]. This is viewed from Earth's surface as an abstract dome on which the [[Sun]], [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and [[Moon]] appear to be [[diurnal motion|traveling]]. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called [[constellation]]s. Usually, the term ''sky'' is used informally as the point of view from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. In some cases, such as in discussing the [[weather]], the sky refers to only the lower, more dense portions of the atmosphere.

During [[daylight]], the sky appears to be [[blue]] because [[air]] [[Rayleigh scattering|scatters]] more blue [[sunlight]] than red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Tyndall | date=December 1868 |title=On the Blue Colour of the Sky, the Polarization of Skylight, and on the Polarization of Light by Cloudy Matter Generally |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |volume=17 |pages=223–233 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1868.0033 |jstor=112380|url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/17/223.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Rayleigh | date=June 1871 |title=On the scattering of light by small particles |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=41, 275 |pages=447–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.G.

During the day, the Sun can be seen in the sky unless obscured by [[cloud]]s. In the [[night sky]] (and to some extent during the day) the Moon, planets and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are [[cloud]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and [[Polar Aurora|aurorae]]. [[Lightning]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can also be seen in the sky during [[storm]]s. [[Bird]]s, [[insect]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[kite flying|kites]] are often considered to [[Flight|fly]] in the sky. Due to human activities, [[smog]] during the day and [[light pollution]] during the night are often seen above large [[city|cities]].

Except for [[sunlight|light]] that comes directly from the sun, most of the light in the day sky is caused by [[diffuse sky radiation|scattering]], which is dominated by a small-particle limit called [[Rayleigh Scattering]]. The scattering due to [[molecule]] sized particles (as in air) is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=For the non-expert, the relationship between "forward and backward directions" and "the lateral direction" and the spectrum should be made clear.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2x4CAQMEKigC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=molecular+scattering+aerosol+in+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WfVGT-LlFMre0gGpyvH5DQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=molecular%20scattering%20aerosol%20in%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Theoretical Fundamentals of Atmospheric Optics|author=Yu Timofeev|author2=A.

The remaining sunlight,{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What's this? Where? And what is the point of mentioning it}} having lost some of its short wavelength components, appears slightly less blue.&lt;ref name="bluesky" /&gt;

Scattering also occurs even more strongly in [[cloud]]s. Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings.  If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What in the world is "a washed-out white color"?}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yi8r4qgMV4C&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=water+droplet+scattering+light+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2f5GT_zMNaiZ0QGX_MiPDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20droplet%20scattering%20light%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric radiation: an introduction with 400 problems|author=Craig F.

The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple and yellow (especially near [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]]) when the light must pass through a much longer path (or [[optical depth]]) through the atmosphere.  Scattering effects also partially [[Polarization (waves)|polarize]] light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun.  Scattered light from the [[horizon]] travels through as much as 38 times the atmosphere as does light from the [[zenith]], causing a blue [[Image gradient|gradient]]: vivid at the zenith, and pale near the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/science/wonderquest/2001-04-11-bluer-sky.htm|title=Bluer on top|work=[[USA Today]]|date=11 April 2001|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because red light also scatters if there is enough air between the source and the observer causing parts of the sky to change color during a sunset. As the amount of atmosphere nears infinity, the scattered light appears whiter and whiter.&lt;ref name="Lynch" /&gt;

The sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in the atmosphere. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops may appear yellowish. The effect is not very obvious on clear days but is very pronounced when clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=distant+clouds+snow+covered+mountains+appear+yellow+book#v=onepage&amp;q=distant%20clouds%20snow%20covered%20mountains%20appear%20yellow%20book&amp;f=false|title=Color and light in nature|author=David K.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause of that intensity differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. [[Green flash]]es and green rays are [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] that occur shortly after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]], when a [[green]] spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes,&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any [[altitude]] (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the [[ocean]], but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the [[Moon]] and bright planets, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|publisher=Harvard|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Earth's shadow]] is the [[shadow]] that the [[Earth]] casts on its [[atmosphere]]. This [[atmospheric phenomenon]] is sometimes seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise.  When the weather conditions and the observer's viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth's shadow is visible in the half of the sky opposite to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen as a dark blue band right above the [[horizon]]. A related phenomenon is the "[[Belt of Venus]]" or "anti-twilight arch", a pink band that is visible above the dark blue band of the Earth's shadow in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus: one colored band shades into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's shadow|publisher = Les Cowley |author =Les Cowley|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=15 February 2012|url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/earshad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=earth-shadow&gt;{{cite book|title=Color and light in nature|author= David K.

Twilight is divided into three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in; it ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun is 6° and 12° below the horizon (heights of between −6° and −12°), after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]], defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/twilight/index.htm|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|author=Dr. Irv Bromberg|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012|title=The Duration of Twilight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]], indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

[[File:Polarlicht 2.jpg|thumb|Aurora borealis over Bear Lake, Alaska]]
[[File:Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a large band across the night sky, and is distorted into an arch in this 360° [[panorama]].]]

The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at [[night]]. The term is usually associated with [[skygazing]] and [[astronomy]], with reference to views of [[celestial bodies]] such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and airglow, depending on location and timing.  The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern [[cultures]].  In the past, for instance, [[farmers]] have used the state of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to plant [[agriculture|crops]].  The [[history of astrology|ancient belief]] in [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on [[Earth]].  The ''scientific'' study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.

Within [[visible-light astronomy]], the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.

Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future.

=== Tropical cyclones ===
[[File:Tropical cyclone eyewall P-3.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of the sky in the eye of a tropical cyclone]]
Within 36&amp;nbsp;hours of the passage of a [[tropical cyclone]]'s center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the [[cyclone]]'s direction.  Within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the [[bar (tropical cyclone)|bar]] of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18&amp;nbsp;hours of the center's approach, [[squall]]y weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36&amp;nbsp;hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.&lt;ref&gt;[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (23 July 2006).

== Significance in mythology ==
{{See also|Astrology|Sky father}}

Many mythologies have deities especially associated with the sky.  In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]], the sky was deified as the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and as the god [[Horus]]. [[Dyeus]] is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], whence [[Zeus]], the god of the sky and [[thunder]] in [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of sky and thunder [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], [[Altjira]] (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In [[Iroquois mythology]], [[Atahensic]] was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deities]].

'''Social sorting''' is understood as the breakdown and categorization of group- or person-related raw data into various categories and segments by data manipulators and [[data broker]]s. Social sorting involves the key task of separating one group from the other. These groups can be based on [[income]], [[education]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], profiling, [[gender]], [[Job|occupation]], [[social status]], derived power (social and political) and geographic residence. Depending on the goals of the manipulator raw data is collected and then further evolves into meaningful data in order to be exploited for a specific purpose. For example, the formulation of [[profiling (information science)|profiling]] and [[predictive policing]] are all derivations of social sorting.

==History==

The concept is accredited to [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]], a sociologist who is best known for his work in surveillance studies. Contemporary times have allowed for the influx and constant growth of [[data collection]] especially in the countries of the global north. A prime example of social terming is [[surveillance]]. This practice was not always as sophisticated as today. Historically, simple tools such as labor-intensive watchers, [[book keeping]] and record keeping acted as the enablers of this form. Surveillance is now done by governments and various organizations. This technological tools that are equipped with surveillance are [[CCTV camera|cameras]], records of transactions done at [[automated teller machine|banking machines]] and [[point of sale]] terminals, [[machine readable passport]]s before boarding, [[cellular phone]] calls along with many other examples. This collection of raw data then enables trends to be found and the fostering of predictions.

In other contextual fashion, social sorting bears much of its resemblance to social stratification. In primitive societies there are evidence of the roots of social sorting where the sexual division of labour was concerned. Women would do most of the gathering where men would concentrate on hunting. It was argued that although this specific task of the woman may point to domestic oppression according to some observers, hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation. The primitive society did show groupings and deployed categorization which perhaps without their own understanding of the understanding of the social construct was still insinuated.

Further confirmation of social sorting was evident through slavery. The [[racial divide]] between whites and blacks manifested for generations. Based on the visual appearance of their skin people of a darker complexion were grouped and made to endure hardships that included beatings, laborious field work, confinement and executions. A prime example of social sorting at work during the African slave era were [[mullato]]s were grouped together to perform household and other domestic work.

==Criticism==

Criticisms are often directed at the laws, implemented rules, educational system, job employment opportunities and at the government. Questions are asked of the integrity of many socially constructed programs led by private and government institutions. Fairness and equity are thought to be at the forefront of the list of frustrations for many people that are aware of social sorting.

There are [[paranoia]]s and indifferences in regards to social sorting. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[war on terror]] have fueled the desire for [[categorizing]] and profiling people. The beneficiaries that are associated with it are evident as it allows for a more transparent viewership. Some researchers such as David Lyon are concerned with the rise of [[big data]] as there are many implication on the daily lives of many.

According to David Lyon, Canadians are still unaware of the fact that surveillance which goes collaboratively with social sorting is now very much integrated into their daily lives. David Lyon discusses that the systematic routines and attention to personal detail which is encompassed into surveillance. The key criticism involves indifferent treatment to individuals based on their profile. Depending on the details of a person it can lead to the determination of whether the person may end up on a [[No Fly List]].

Employers have now begun to engage in these screening methods to determine a person’s suitability for a particular job. Law enforcement bodies and insurance companies have now all began to utilize social sorting to their use in order to determine whether their services should be offered or rescinded. The lives of many are directly affected as they are placed into [[socio-economic]] [[economic niche|niche]]s.

David Lyon insinuates that social sorting through surveillance is a modern [[threat to freedom]]. Byproducts of social sorting are isolation, [[Segregation (disambiguation)|segregation]] and [[marginalization]]. Social sorting has called into account issues that primarily involve equity and fairness. Different societies sort in different ways.

Other societies across the world engage in their own forms of social sorting. Some eastern countries such as China and India place much emphasis on an individual’s level of education. Blue collar jobs which at times may be dirty and laborious are often scorned and met with resentment. Low hourly wages, limited to zero prestige and little respect are directed at individuals who are involved in these occupational roles. Furthermore, the perception and low economic advantages hinder the progression of many people. At times, it acts as a domino effect where when one falls other problems come with it. For example, low education may not contribute to a good paying job; this may in turn lead to low income which may in turn lead to residing in a low class neighbourhood.

Wilson &amp; McBrier (2005) conducted a [[longitudinal study]] based on the theory of minority [[Social vulnerability|vulnerability]] of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sociological Forum|year=2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages= 301–321|title=Race and Loss of Privilege: African American/White Differences in the Determinants of Job Layoffs From Upper-Tier Occupations|author=George Wilson and Debra Branch McBrier|doi=10.1007/s11206-005-4102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constitute to a group of [[African American]]s who work for good financial income in the upper tier for relatively privileged jobs. "The minority vulnerability thesis, accordingly, maintains that African Americans are more likely to experience [[layoff]]s from upper-tier occupations than Whites even when the two groups have similar background socioeconomic statuses, have accumulated similar [[human capital|human-capital]] credentials, such as educational attainment and commitment to work, and have similar job/[[labor market]] characteristics, including union status as well as [[economic sector]] of employment. Findings indicate that, after controlling for seniority, African Americans are susceptible to layoffs on a relatively broad and generalized basis that is unstructured by traditional, stratification-based causal factors, namely, background socioeconomic status, human-capital credentials, and job/labor-market characteristics."

Schools are accredited differing levels of prestige in comparison to other institutions. Social sorting occurs amongst schools where claims are made about learning experiences and which institutions may be the best for learning all of which are left up to subjection. For example, Princeton, and Harvard are all highly rated prestigious universities for various reasons. These perceptions cause employers and students alike to question the credibility and graduate documentation based on the institution that one attends.

In 2015, The Data Broker Accountability and Transparency Act was resurrected by four U.S senators that would allow consumers to see and correct personal information held by data brokers and tell those businesses to stop sharing or selling it for marketing purposes.

'''Steve Hofmeyr''' (born 29 August 1964) is a South African singer, songwriter, political activist, actor and TV presenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mg.co.za/article/2013-10-10-red-october-march-steve-hofmeyr |title=Red October march calls for end to black-on-white violence |date=10 October 2014 |work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |accessdate= 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hofmeyr married actress [[Natasha Sutherland]], whom he had met on the set of ''[[Egoli: Place of Gold]]'' in 1998. They had two sons. Hofmeyr also has three other children by other women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tvsa.co.za/actors/viewactor.aspx?actorid=5487 |title=Steve Hofmeyr|publisher=TVSA|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Steve Hofmeyr|url=http://rollingstone.co.za/opinion/item/903-qaa-steve-hofmeyr|publisher=RollingStone Magazine|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was divorced after reports of numerous affairs dominated Hofmeyr's time in the spotlight in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Philip de Bruin, ''News 24'', [http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,,2-1225-1242_2443465,00.html "Steve 'needs psychiatric help"], 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Hofmeyr allegedly assaulted Esmaré Weideman, editor of ''[[Huisgenoot]]'', a popular Afrikaans magazine, by pouring a cup of cold tea over her at the [[Miss South Africa]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;Philip de Bruin, ''News 24'' (South Africa),[http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,,2-1225-1242_2443046,00.html "Steve gets shir-tea with editor"], 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have blamed her and two other journalists for his divorce from Sutherland. Miss Weideman subsequently dropped her accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=20110411082345874 |title=Hofmeyr and editor end legal stand-off |publisher=Legalbrief |date= |accessdate=26 September 2013|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2013, Hofmeyr was arrested in [[Bronkhorstspruit]] for driving at 169&amp;nbsp;km/h in an 80&amp;nbsp;km/h zone and was released on bail of [[South African rand|R]]500. He was subsequently fined R10,000 in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court on 23 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/News/Local/Steve-Hofmeyr-fined-R10-000-for-speeding-20140123 |title=Steve Hofmeyr fined R10 000 for speeding|date=23 January 2014 |work=Channel24.co.za|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr married Janine van der Vyver on 26 January 2014. In 2008, van der Vyver, a fitness instructor, revealed they had been seeing each other for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/hofmeyr-pays-up-in-time-for-wedding-1.1636171#.U6RvXk3QdaS |title=Hofmeyr pays up in time for wedding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr's grandfather, Steve Hofmeyr Sr., was a leader in the [[Ossewabrandwag]], a South African political and guerrilla organisation which supported Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Phyllis |last1=Green |date=7 March 2014|work=Sarie|title=Steve Hofmeyr gesels oor sy nuwe boek |url= http://www.sarie.com/lewe-liefdes/boeke/steve-hofmeyr-gesels-oor-sy-nuwe-boek/#/|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Piet|last1= Ebersöhn|date=25 July 2012|title=Eerste sportredakteur was Oxford Blue én owerste van Stormjaers |url=http://perskor.blogspot.de/2012/07/eerste-sportredakteur-was-oxford-blue.html|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2007, there were reports that one branch of the [[News Cafe]] restaurant chain would not play Hofmeyr's song ''Pampoen''. The managing director of the company that owns the franchise denies that this is company policy and points out that many Afrikaans acts, such as [[Karen Zoid]] and [[Arno Carstens]] have performed at News Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Eagan Williamson | title = News Cafe begin 'n ander (Afrikaanse) deuntjie sing | url = http://www.news24.com/Beeld/Suid-Afrika/0,,3-975_2051223,00.html | work = Beeld | date = 4 January 2007 | accessdate = 8 January 2007 | language = Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2011, Hofmeyr released the lyrics to his new song called "Ons sal dit oorleef", which means "We will survive this". The song is controversial, because Hofmeyr threatened to include the ethnic slur "[[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]" in the lyrics of the song.&lt;ref name="Steve Hofmeyr Spits venom"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2011/05/13/steve-hofmeyr-spits-venom | title=Steve Hofmeyr spits venom | date=12 May 2011 | accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hofmeyr removed the offensive word in his song, citing that the word would offend his black friends and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sapa|title=K-word will offend my black friends, says Hofmeyr|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-17-kword-will-offend-my-black-friends-says-hofmeyr|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he made public that he supports the Afrikaner advocacy group "Expedition for Afrikaner Self-Determination"  ([[Onafhanklike Afrikaner Selfbeskikkingsekspedisie]], OASE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OASE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTmH5OXGvA|title=Steve Hofmeyr Supports OASE|date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr was heavily criticised after performing the former South African national anthem, ''[[Die Stem]]'', at a cultural festival known as ''Innibos'' in [[Nelspruit]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hofmeyr-sings-die-stem-at-innibos-1.1716416#.VJgh814C8|title=Hofmeyr sings Die Stem at Innibos |date=8 July 2014 |website= |publisher=iol News |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to perform the anthem on international tours, and encouraged white South Africans to continue singing it, stating that it did not contain any form of hate speech.

In October 2014, Hofmeyr wrote and published a tweet stating that he believed that black South Africans were the "architects of apartheid" on his public Twitter account. This prompted a significant public backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hofmeyr faces Twitter backlash after Apartheid post|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Hofmeyr-faces-Twitter-backlash-after-apartheid-post-20141028}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hofmeyr's critics was puppeteer Conrad Koch through his puppet Chester Missing, who launched a campaign calling on companies to stop sponsoring Hofmeyr. On 27 November 2014, Hofmeyr failed to acquire a final protection order against Koch and his puppet in the Randburg Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2014/11/27/steve-hofmeyr-0-chester-missing-1|title=Steve Hofmeyr 0, Chester Missing 1 |date=28 November 2014 |website= |publisher=Business Day |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims about murders of white South Africans===
{{see|Crime in South Africa|White genocide conspiracy theory}}
Hofmeyr has made numerous claims relating to murders of white South Africans. Hofmeyr has claimed that whites, and in particular Afrikaners, are being "killed like flies", posting on [[Facebook]] that "my tribe is dying". Hofmeyr also posted a picture of a "World Cup soccer stadium" which he claimed could be filled by the number of whites murdered by blacks. However, [[Africa Check]], a [[fact-checking]] organisation has found Hofmeyr's claims to be "incorrect and grossly exaggerated" - pointing out that whites are in fact "less likely to be murdered than any other race group". Lizette Lancaster from the [[Institute for Security Studies]] told Africa Check that "Whites are far less likely to be murdered than their black or coloured counterparts." While white South Africans account for nearly 9% of the population they account for just 1.8% of murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;https://africacheck.org/reports/are-white-afrikaners-really-being-killed-like-flies/&lt;/ref&gt;
During May 2018, The minister of Police, Mr [[Bheki Cele]] released farm attack statistics &lt;ref&gt;[[South African farm attacks]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} for the first time in years. &lt;

'''Synergistic gardening''' is a system of [[organic gardening]], developed by [[Emilia Hazelip]]. The system is strongly influenced by [[permaculture]], as well as the work of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] and [[Marc Bonfils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Synergistic Garden |url=http://www.seedballs.com/hazelip.html |work=Excerpt from Permaculture Magazine |series=Issue 19 |date=Spring 1999 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316085845/http://www.seedballs.com/hazelip.html |archivedate=March 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing the [[garden]], there is no further digging, ploughing or tilling, and no use of external inputs such as [[manure]]s and other [[fertilizer]]s, or [[pesticide]]s. [[Soil health]] is maintained by the selection of [[plant]]s, [[mulch]]ing, and recycling of plant residues.&lt;ref name="Emilia emails"/&gt;
