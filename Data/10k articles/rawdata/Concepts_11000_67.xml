In general, aeroacoustic [[analogy|analogies]] are derived from the compressible [[Navier–Stokes equations]] (NSE). The [[compressibility|compressible]] NSE are rearranged into various forms of the inhomogeneous acoustic [[wave equation]]. Within these equations, source terms describe the acoustic sources. They consist of pressure and speed fluctuation as well as [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] and force terms.

[[Approximations]] are introduced to make the source terms independent of the acoustic [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. In this way, linearized equations are derived which describe the propagation of the acoustic waves in a homogeneous, resting medium. The latter is excited by the acoustic source terms, which are determined from the turbulent fluctuations. Since the aeroacoustics are described by the equations of classical acoustics, the methods are called aeroacoustic analogies.

The '''[[Michael James Lighthill|Lighthill]] analogy''' considers a free flow, as for example with an engine jet. The nonstationary fluctuations of the stream are represented by a distribution of [[quadrupole]] sources in the same volume.

The '''Curle analogy''' is a formal solution of the Lighthill analogy, which takes hard surfaces into consideration.

The '''[[John Ffowcs Williams|Ffowcs Williams]]–Hawkings analogy''' is valid for aeroacoustic sources in relative motion with respect to a hard surface, as is the case in many technical applications for example in the automotive industry or in air travel. The calculation involves [[quadrupole]], [[dipole]] and [[monopole (mathematics)|monopole]] terms.

The term '''analogue''' is used in [[literary history]] in two related senses:&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;[https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html Literary Terms and Definitions: A], Analog&lt;/ref&gt;
* a work which resembles another in terms of one or more [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s, [[Fictional character|characters]], scenes, phrases or events.
* an individual motif, character, scene, event or phrase which resembles one found in another work.

Similarities may be fortuitous, in which case the merit of establishing an analogue is that it makes it possible to see how works from different authors (perhaps also in different languages, periods, genres) treat similar characters or motifs. But the term is used  particularly in the study of [[legend]]s, [[Fairy tale|folk tale]]s and [[oral literature]] for works that have features in common either because they derive from a shared tradition or because they both rework material from a specific older text, which may or may not still survive.

For example, some claim the story of Noah and the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] in the [[Bible]] and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] are analogues.&lt;ref name="wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06576.html Encyclopedia Judaica: The Flood]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, where one work draws directly on another, the term ''analogue'' is inappropriate: the earlier work is the ''source'' of the later.

In the literature of earlier periods, it may not be easy to decide whether a particular work is a direct source for another, especially if there are uncertainties of dating. The phrase ''sources and analogues'' is used to cover ''all'' material relevant to the creation of a particular work.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/courses/Sources.html Old English Sources and Analogues]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthropological theories of value''' attempt to expand on the traditional [[Value theory|theories of value]] used by [[economics|economists]] or [[value theory|ethicists]]. They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx]], etc. usually including [[sociological]], [[political]], institutional, and [[historical]] perspectives ([[transdisciplinarity]]).  Some have influenced [[feminist economics]].

The basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of "value" is a [[social construct]], and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics.  [[Anthropological linguistics]] is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within.  Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.

[[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed.  [[Georges Bataille]] wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed.  Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family [[Antique|heirloom]]s).

== Value as meaning-making ==
[[David Graeber]] attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human [[meaning-making]]. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss's idea of "objects that are not consumed" and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|date=2001|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]]|isbn=0-312-24044-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of things that are neither consumption nor production ===
{{synthesis|date=February 2015}}
A list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00141844.1999.9981601 | last1 = Owens | first1 = Bruce McCoy | year = 1999| title = Unruly Readings: Neofetishes, Paradoxical Singularities, and the Violence of Authentic Value, | url = | journal = Ethnos | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–262 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Economists typically use the term consumption in a way that is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time.  Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading.  Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment.  In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption &amp;ndash; for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself.  In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming &amp;ndash; the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation).  Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. [[Gary Becker]]'s [[household production function]]s and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce [[utility]]).

{{italic title}}
'''''Apeiron''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ɒ|n}}; {{lang|grc|ἄπειρον}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "(that which is) unlimited," "boundless", "infinite", or "indefinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/peiros2|ἄπειρον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ''a-'', "without" and {{lang|grc|πεῖραρ}} ''peirar'', "end, limit", "boundary",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pei{{=}}rar|πεῖραρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ionic Greek]] form of {{lang|grc|πέρας}} ''peras'', "end, limit, boundary".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/ras|πέρας|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is akin to [[Persian language|Persian]] ''piramon'', meaning "boundary, circumference, surrounding".

==''Apeiron'' as an origin==
The ''apeiron'' is central to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory created by [[Anaximander]], a 6th-century BC [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] whose work is mostly lost.  From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (''[[arche]]'') is eternal and infinite, or boundless (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b, 23sq.&lt;DK12,A16.&gt;, Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6, 1 sq. &lt;DK 12 A11, B2.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' generated the [[Opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world ([[cf.]] [[Heraclitus]]). Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and then it is destroyed by going back to ''apeiron'', according to necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Phys.'', p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK 12 A9,B1.&gt;, p. 150, 24sq.&lt;DK 12 A9.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that infinite worlds are generated from ''apeiron'' and then they are destroyed there again.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius I 3,3&lt;Pseudo-Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition and by his teacher [[Thales]] (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World Publishing Co. Cleveland and New York. pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word ''nomos'' (law) may originally have meant ''natural law'' and used later to mean man-made law.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeferry  (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700-500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted ''apeiron'' as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing [[mythical]] way of thought to the newer [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek [[city states]] during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernant (1964) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Paris. p. 128; J. P. Vernant (1982) '' The origins of Greek thought''. Ithaca, Cornell University Press. pp. 118, 128. {{ISBN|0-8014-9293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC) the first [[Greek primordial deities|primordial god]] is [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between [[Tartarus]] and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation).&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod''. Transl. H. G. Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744 [http://www.sacred-tests.com/cla/hesiod/theogony/htm online]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'First of all': On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod's Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=ancientphil&amp;id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&amp;onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Ritual Basis for Hesiod's Theogony|last = Cornford|first = Francis|publisher = |year = 1950|isbn = |location = |pages = 95–116|work = The Unwritten Philosophy and other Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can name it also [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] (having no bottom).

Alternately, Greek [[philosopher]] [[Thales]] believed that the origin or first principle was water. [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (6th century BC) probably called the water also ''Chaos'' and this is not placed at the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |page=57| isbn =978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology [[Enuma Elish]] describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521294201}} p 58,59 {{ISBN|0-521-29420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Hindu]] cosmogony which is similar to the [[Vedic]] ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.

Hesiod made an abstraction, because his original ''chaos'' is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechishe Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale. Stuttgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea). A fragment from [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 21 B 28&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; shows the transition from ''chaos'' to ''apeiron'': "The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The world of Parmenides|author=Karl.R.Popper|year=1998|publisher=Rootledge.New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC&amp;pg|isbn=9780415173018}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Either ''apeiron'' meant the "spatial indefinite" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield |year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |pages=10, 110 |isbn=978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas may have been influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]]:{{Quote|[...] for they [the Pythagoreans] plainly say that when the one had been constructed, whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to be drawn in and limited by the limit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philolaus]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making ''apeiron'' the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap  between the existing ''mythical'' and the new ''rational'' way of thought (''rationalism''). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod).&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Mossé]] (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle.'' Edition du Seuil. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b 23sq.&lt;DK 12 A 16.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius,&lt;DK 11 A1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "What is divine? What has no origin, nor end." This probably led his student to his final decision for ''apeiron'', because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83 |isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the world==
The ''apeiron'' has generally been understood as a sort of [[Substance theory|primal chaos]]. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author= Patricia Curd |year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=77|isbn=978-0-691-01182-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Strom.'' 2, fr.179 Sandbach &lt;DK 12 A 10.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first animals were generated in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius V 19,4 &lt;DK 12 A 30.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6,6 &lt;DK 12 A 11.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.

==Interpretations==
In the commentary of [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] on Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:
{{Quote|Whence things have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained [Greek: ''kata to chreon'' means "according to the debt"]. For they give ''justice'' and ''compensation'' to one another for their ''injustice'' according to the ordering of time.}}
This fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms,&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius in Phys. p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK12a9,B1&gt;
{{Quote|Anaximander from Miletus, son of Praxiades student and descendant of Thales, said that the origin and the element of things (beings) is apeiron and he is the first who used this name for the origin (arche). He says that the origin is neither water, nor any other of the so-called elements, but something of different nature, unlimited. From it are generated the skies and the worlds which exist between them. Whence things (beings) have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained. For they give justice and compensation to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time, as he said in poetic terms. Obviously noticing the mutual changes between the four elements, he didn't demand to make one of them a subject, but something else except these. He considers that genesis takes place without any decay of this element, but with the generation of the opposites by his own movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess ''Justice'' ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]), appears to keep the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. Cleveland and New York. p. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word ''dike'' (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[adikia]]'' (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb "law and order" (''[[Eunomia (goddess)|eunomia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeffery (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700–500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' ''eunomia'' is contrasted with ''[[hubris]]'' (arrogance).&lt;ref&gt;''Homer: Odyssey.'' 17.487&lt;/ref&gt; Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a ''city-state''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:
{{Quote|Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and there its destruction happens. Infinite worlds are generated and they are destructed there again. And he says (Anaximander) why this is ''apeiron''. Because only then genesis and decay will never stop.|Aetius I 3,3&lt;Ps.Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;}}
Therefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about ''apeiron'' and this is also noticed by [[Aristotle]]:
{{Quote|The belief that there is something ''apeiron'' stems from the idea that only then genesis and decay will never stop, when that from which is taken what is generated is ''apeiron''.|Aristotle, ''Physics'' 203b 18–20 &lt;DK 12 A 15.&gt;}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche (1962) ''Philosophy in the tragic age of the Greeks.''. Washington DC: Regnery, Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including [[Martin Heidegger]].

[[Werner Heisenberg]], noted for the creation of [[quantum mechanics]], arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same "primordial substance". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague [[Max Born]] called this substance ''apeiron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&amp;pg=PA546|title= A Cultural History of Physics|last=Simonyi|first=Károly|author-link=Károly Simonyi|date=April 7, 2012|website=Chapter 5.5.10 ''Back to the Apeiron?''|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn= 9781568813295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in other fields, e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1946) ''History of Western Philosophy'' NY. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Bowra]],&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and N. York. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term ''apeiron'', but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.

There are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. ''Apeiron'' is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant "nothingless". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from ''apeiron'' must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechische Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale Stutgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The idea that the fact of existence by itself carries along an incurable guilt is Greek (''Theognis'' 327) and anybody claims that surpasses it, commits arrogance and therefore he becomes guilty. The first half of the 6th century is a period of great social instability in Miletus, the city state where Anaximander lives. Any attempt of excess leads to exaggerations and each exaggeration must be corrected. All these have to be paid according to the debt. The things give justice to one another with the process of time.}}
Justice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la Grece 1. D'Homere a Heracklite. Seminaires 1982-1983. La creation humain II''. Edition du Seuil. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Greek and Western thought==
We may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with ''apeiron'' is metaphysical (and can lead to [[monism]]), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical.&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Sullivan (1985) ''The four seasons of Greek philosophy''. Efstathiadis group. Athens. pp. 28–31 (Edition in English)&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[paradox]] existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (''hubris'' or ''adikia'') could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (''[[Dike (mythology)|dike]]'') would destroy him to reestablish the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) The Greek experience. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. pp. 63, 89&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la grece 1. D'Homere a Heraclite. Seminaires 1982–1983. La creation Humain II''. Editions du Seuil. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philolaus]] (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ({{lang-grc|ἄπειρα}} ''apeira'', plural of ''apeiron'') and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (''apeiron'') and the limited.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK B1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Something similar is mentioned by [[Plato]]: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Philebus]] 16c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: "God ordained that all men shall die", "Death is a common debt". The Greek word ''adikia'' (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits [[hubris]]. The relative English word ''arrogance'' (claim as one's own without justification; {{lang-la|arrogare}}), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: "Nothing in excess."

==Other pre-Socratic philosophers' ideas about ''apeiron''==
Other [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers had different theories of the ''apeiron''. For the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular, [[Philolaus]]), the universe had begun as an ''apeiron'', but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts.  For [[Anaxagoras]], the initial ''apeiron'' had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same ''apeiron'', all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.

==Early life==
Baroni was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. [[Catholic Charities]] arranged for him to be adopted by William Sr. and Geraldine Baroni of [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey]] a few days later.

He attended [[wikipedia:Steinert_High_School#Notable_alumni|Steinert High School]] in Hamilton, New Jersey.

He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[George Washington University]] in history and was awarded a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]].&lt;ref name=NJLEG&gt;[http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/BIO.asp?Leg=298 Senator Baroni's legislative web page], [[New Jersey Legislature]]. Accessed April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Baroni became interested in politics as a teenager, working on the campaign of his hometown congressman, [[Christopher H. Smith]] (R), who was seeking re-election to his fourth term.  He was also a driver for Assembly Speaker [[Chuck Haytaian]] in his campaign for U.S. Senator against [[Frank Lautenberg]] in 1994 and worked on the advance staff for the 1996 presidential campaign of [[Steve Forbes]].

He served on the [[Mercer County Community College]] Board of Trustees from 1998 to 2003. He was a member of the [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton Township]] Planning Board from 1998 to 2000.

In 2003, Baroni mounted an aggressive campaign for the General Assembly, knocking on over 10,000 doors to defeat the Democratic incumbent Gary Guear.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Diane C.

===Legal career===
Baroni was an associate at DeCotiis, Fitzpatrick &amp; Cole, and then at Blank Rome.  He was [[of counsel]] at Fornaro Francioso, a Hamilton firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fornarofrancioso.com/index.htm |title=Firm website |publisher=Fornaro Francioso |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as chief counsel to Congressman [[Bob Franks]] in his 2000 U.S. Senate race.  In 2002, when U.S. Senator [[Robert Torricelli]] withdrew his candidacy for re-election five weeks before Election Day after the Senate admonished him on ethics charges, Baroni argued for the Republicans in the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] against a last-minute switch of candidates to Frank Lautenberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/07/elec02.nj.s.race/ Supreme Court won't intervene in N.J. case: 'Let the campaign begin'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716121808/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/07/elec02.nj.s.race/ |date=July 16, 2006 }}, [[CNN]], October 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, Baroni has been an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[Seton Hall University School of Law]], where he teaches classes on Professional Responsibility, voting rights, legislation, and [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref name=NJLEG/&gt; Baroni served on the Foundation Board of both [[The College of New Jersey]] and [[Mercer County Community College]]. Baroni is also chairman of the board of trustees of the Greater Trenton Symphony Orchestra and on the Board of Trustees of the [[New Jersey Symphony Orchestra]] and on the board of trustees for Visitation Home, which builds homes for New Jersey residents with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/leadership.html |title=PANYNJ - Governance website |publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528051009/http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/leadership.html |archivedate=May 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroni is also a special advisor to the New Jersey [[Boys' State]] Foundation, and is a former delegate at Jersey Boys' State.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Boys' State Foundation Board of Trustees {{cite web|url=http://www.njbsf.org/php/who/trustees.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027221453/http://njbsf.org/php/who/trustees.php |archivedate=October 27, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie===
On February 19, 2010, the [[Governor of New Jersey]], [[Chris Christie]], announced that he was appointing Baroni to the position of Deputy Executive Director of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the new post on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Port Authority executive Bill Baroni starts powerful job, learns how to 'tweet' |url=http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2010/03/06/news/doc4b91d73416254754550304.txt |work=[[The Trentonian]] |date=March 6, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Goodwin (New Jersey politician)|Tom Goodwin]] was selected to fill the vacant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamilton councilman wins N.J.

On December 12, 2013, Christie announced that Baroni had resigned as Deputy Executive Director of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. This occurred after the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|scandal over lane closures at the George Washington Bridge]], perhaps to punish Democratic Fort Lee Mayor [[Mark Sokolich]] for not supporting Christie.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/state/Top_Christie_apointee_resigns_amid_escalating_probe_into_George_Washington_Bridge_lane_closuers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later email disclosures indicate that Baroni attempted to squelch press that the lane closures were improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soltis |first=Andy |date=January 10, 2014 | title=Christie appointee ordered officials’ silence on Bridgegate |url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/10/traffic-study-done-during-bridgegate-showed-chaos-it-caused/ |publisher=New York Post|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2014, Baroni was named as a defendant in a federal [[class action]] [[lawsuit]]s in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey]] which cited a [[Conspiracy (civil)|civil conspiracy]] and "willful, wanton, arbitrary, and egregious [[official misconduct]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|last=Markos |first=Kirbet |date=January 9, 2014 | url=http://www.northjersey.com/fortlee/Six_Bergen_County_residents_file_class-action_lawsuits_against_Christie.html| title=Six Bergen County residents file class-action lawsuits over GWB scandal|work=The Record |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2015 he was indicted on nine federal counts of conspiracy, fraud and related charges.&lt;ref name=NJ.indicted/&gt; to which he pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/bridgegate_kelly_baroni_in_federal_court.html&lt;/ref&gt; He is contesting the District Attorney's decision not to release certain documents in the discovery process to mount his defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-scandal-baroni-lawyers-say-prosecutors-request-aimed-at-protecting-christie-inner-circle-1.1354255&lt;/ref&gt; A continuance for the trial was granted in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/bridgegate_corruption_trial_delayed_until_next_yea.html&lt;/ref&gt; Baroni was also a FBI informant, Baroni's secret life as an FBI informant came out in opening statements of his trial. He provided detail saying he met about every other month with an FBI agent to give him information and "context" about what was going on in Trenton for about 6 years starting in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/highlights_of_bill_baronis_bridgegate_testimony.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Fat Kid Got Fit'' ==

Along with a childhood friend, Baroni co-authored ''Fat Kid Got Fit, and So Can You'', a 2012 book chronicling Baroni's early struggles with obesity and his successful efforts to overcome the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2012/02/21/life/doc4f443281f14da358517433.txt "NY/NJ Port Authority boss and ex-fatso Bill Baroni pens book 'Fat Kid Got Fit, and So Can You'", Trentonian, Published 21 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Baroni wrote the book because he wants others to know that his successful weight loss came from “being healthy and working out” and that other people could share similar success.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">{{About|bounded quantification in type theory|bounded quantification in mathematical logic|Bounded quantifier}}

In [[type theory]], '''bounded quantification''' (also '''bounded polymorphism''' or '''constrained genericity''') refers to [[universally quantified|universal]] or [[existential type|existential quantifier]]s which are restricted ("bounded") to range only over the subtypes of a particular type. Bounded quantification is an interaction of [[parametric polymorphism]] with [[subtyping]]. Bounded quantification has traditionally been studied in the [[functional programming|functional]] setting of [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]], but is available in modern [[object-oriented language]]s supporting [[parametric polymorphism]] ([[Generic programming|generics]]) such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]].

== Overview ==
The purpose of bounded quantification is to allow for [[polymorphic function]]s to depend on some specific behaviour of objects instead of [[type inheritance]]. It assumes a record-based model for object classes, where every class member is a record element and all class members are named functions. Object attributes are represented as functions that take no argument and return an object. The specific behaviour is then some function name along with the types of the arguments and the return type. Bounded quantification allows to considers all objects with such a function. An example would be a polymorphic &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; function that considers all objects that are comparable to each other.

=== F-bounded quantification ===
'''''F''-bounded quantification''' or '''recursively bounded quantification''', introduced in 1989, allows for more precise typing of functions that are applied on recursive types. A recursive type is one that includes a function that uses it as a type for some argument or its return value.&lt;ref&gt;''F''-bounded polymorphism for object-oriented programming. Canning, [[William Cook (computer scientist)|Cook]], Hill, Olthof and [[John C. Mitchell|Mitchell]]. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99392&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
This kind of type constraint can be expressed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with a generic interface. The following example demonstrates how to describe types that can be compared to each other and use this as typing information in [[polymorphic function]]s. The &lt;code&gt;Test.min&lt;/code&gt; function uses simple bounded quantification and does not preserve the type of the assigned types, in contrast with the &lt;code&gt;Test.Fmin&lt;/code&gt; function which uses F-bounded quantification.

In mathematical notation, the types of the two functions are

:min: ∀ T, ∀ S ⊆ {compareTo: T → int}. S → S → S
:Fmin: ∀ T ⊆ Comparable[T]. T → T → T

where

:Comparable[T] = {compareTo: T → int}

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
interface Comparable&lt;T&gt; {
  public int compareTo(T other);
}

class Integer implements Comparable&lt;Integer&gt; {
  @Override
  public int compareTo(Integer other) {
    //...
  }
}

class String implements Comparable&lt;String&gt; {
  @Override
  public int compareTo(String other) {
    //...
  }
}

class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Comparable&lt;String&gt; a = min("cat", "dog");
    Comparable&lt;Integer&gt; b = min(new Integer(10), new Integer(3));
    String str = Fmin("cat", "dog");
    Integer i = Fmin(new Integer(10), new Integer(3));
  }
  public static &lt;S extends Comparable&gt; S min(S a, S b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0)
      return a;
    else
      return b;
  }
  public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T Fmin(T a, T b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0)
      return a;
    else
      return b;
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Four '''cardinal virtues ''' were recognized in [[classical antiquity]] and in traditional [[Christian theology]]:
*[[Prudence]] ({{lang|grc|φρόνησις}}, ''phronēsis''; {{lang-la|prudentia}}; also [[Wisdom]], ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'', ''sapientia''), the to ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a given situation at the appropriate time.
*[[Courage]] ({{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}}, ''andreia''; {{lang-la|fortitudo}}): also termed fortitude, forbearance, strength, endurance, and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation
*[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] ({{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}}, ''sōphrosynē''; {{lang-la|temperantia}}): also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion, and moderation tempering the [[appetition]]. ''Sōphrosynē'' can also be translated as sound-mindedness. 
*[[Justice (virtue)|Justice]] ({{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}}, ''dikaiosynē''; {{lang-la|iustitia}}): also considered as fairness, the most extensive and most important virtue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm|title=Cardinal Virtues of Plato, Augustine and Confucius|work=theplatonist.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074259/http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek word also having the meaning righteousness
These [[virtue]]s derive initially from [[Plato]]'s scheme, discussed in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Book IV, 426–435  (and see ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 330b, which also includes [[piety]] (''hosiotes'')). [[Cicero]] expanded on them, and [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' II(I).61&lt;/ref&gt; adapted them while adding a set of [[theological virtues]].

The term ''cardinal'' comes from the Latin {{lang|la|cardo}} (hinge);&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|cardinal}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. They also relate to the [[Quadrivium]].

==In classical antiquity==

The four cardinal virtues appear as a group (sometimes included in larger lists) long before they are later given this title.

Plato identified the four cardinal virtues with the classes of the city described in  ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', and with the faculties of man. Plato narrates a discussion of the character of a good city where the following is agreed upon.  “Clearly, then, it will be wise, brave, temperate [literally: healthy-minded], and just.”  (427e; see also 435b) '''[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]''' was common to all classes, but primarily associated with the producing classes, the farmers and craftsmen, and with the animal appetites, to whom no special virtue was assigned; '''[[courage|fortitude]]''' was assigned to the warrior class and to the spirited element in man; '''[[prudence]]''' to the rulers and to reason.  '''[[Justice]]''' stands outside the class system and divisions of man, and rules the proper relationship among the three of them.

Plato sometimes (e.g., ''[[Protagoras_(dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 349b; cf. 324e, 329c, 330b, 331a-c) lists [[wikt:Special:Search/holiness|holiness]] (''hosiotes'', ''eusebeia'', ''aidos'') amongst the cardinal virtues. He especially associates holiness with justice, but leaves their precise relationship unexplained.

In Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' we read: “The forms of Virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, wisdom.”  (''Rhetoric'' 1366b1)

The Roman philosopher and statesman [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC), like Plato, limits the list to four virtues: {{quote|“Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind (''animi'') in harmony with reason and the order of nature.  It has four parts: wisdom (''prudentiam''), justice, courage, temperance.” (''De Inventione'', II, LIII) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/inventione2.shtml#159|title=Cicero: de Inventione II|work=thelatinlibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero discusses these further in ''[[De Officiis]]'' (I, V and following).

The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] discusses these in Book V:12 of ''[[Meditations]]'' and views them as the "goods" that a person should identify in one's own mind, as opposed to "wealth or things which conduce to luxury or prestige."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Aurelius|title=Meditations|date=1976|publisher=Penguin Classics trans. by Maxwell Staniforth|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinal virtues are listed in the Bible.  The deuterocanonical book [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]] 8:7 reads, "She [Wisdom] teaches temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life."

They are also found in the Biblical [[apocrypha]]. [[4 Maccabees]] 1:18–19 relates: “Now the kinds of wisdom are right judgment, justice, courage, and self-control.  Right judgment is supreme over all of these since by means of it reason rules over the emotions.”

[[Catholic moral theology|Catholic moral philosophy]] drew from all of these sources when developing its thought on the virtues.

==In Christian tradition==
{{Thomism}}
[[Ambrose]] (AD&amp;nbsp;330s–397) was the first to use the expression “cardinal virtues.”  “And we know that there are four cardinal virtues temperance, justice, prudence, fortitude.”   (''Commentary on Luke'', V, 62)

[[Augustine of Hippo]], discussing the morals of the church, described them:
{{quote|For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. (''De moribus eccl.,'' Chap. xv)}}

The "cardinal" virtues are not the same as the [[Theological virtues|three theological virtues]]: Faith, Hope and Charity ([[Agape|Love]]), named in [[1 Corinthians 13]]. 
''And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.''
Because of this reference, a group of seven attributes is sometimes listed by adding the four cardinal virtues (prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice) and three theological virtues (faith, hope, charity).
Together, they comprise what is known as the [[seven virtues]].  While the first four date back to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers and were applicable to all people seeking to live moral lives, the ''theological virtues'' appear to be specific to [[Christian]]s as written by Paul in [[The New Testament]].

Efforts to relate the cardinal and theological virtues differ. Augustine sees faith as coming under justice.  Beginning with a wry comment about the moral mischief of pagan deities, he writes:
{{quote|They [the pagans] have made Virtue also a goddess, which, indeed, if it could be a goddess, had been preferable to many.  And now, because it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, let it be obtained by prayer from Him, by whom alone it can be given, and the whole crowd of false gods vanishes.  For as much as they have thought proper to distribute virtue into four divisions – prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance – and as each of these divisions has its own virtues, faith is among the parts of justice, and has the chief place with as many of us as know what that saying means, ‘The just shall live by faith.’ ([[City of God (book)|''City of God'']], IV, 20)}}

Later, in the High Middle Ages, some authors opposed the seven virtues (cardinal plus theological) to the seven capital sins.  However, “treatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Bejczy |first1= István P. |title= The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century |date=2011|publisher= Brill |location=Boston|pages=228, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And there are problems with this parallelism.
{{quote|The opposition between the virtues and the vices to which these works allude despite the frequent inclusion of other schemes may seem unproblematic at first sight.  The virtues and the vices seem to mirror each other as positive and negative moral attitudes, so that medieval authors, with their keen predilection for parallels and oppositions, could conveniently set them against each other. . . . Yet artistic representations such as Conrad’s trees are misleading in that they establish oppositions between the principal virtues and the capital vices which are based on mere juxtaposition.  As to content, the two schemes do not match each other.  The capital vices of lust and avarice, for instance, contrast with the remedial virtues of chastity and generosity, respectively, rather than with any theological or cardinal virtue; conversely, the virtues of hope and prudence are opposed to despair and foolishness rather than to any deadly sin.  Medieval moral authors were well aware of the fact.  Actually, the capital vices are more often contrasted with the remedial or contrary virtues in medieval moral literature than with the principal virtues, while the principal virtues are frequently accompanied by a set of mirroring vices rather than by the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;Bejczy, 2011, pp. 232-33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary Thought==
Jesuit scholars Daniel Harrington and James Keenan in their ''Paul and Virtue Ethics'' (2010) argue for seven "new virtues" to replace the classical cardinal virtues in complementing the three theological virtues, listed as "be humble, be hospitable, be merciful, be faithful, reconcile, be vigilant, and be reliable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=Daniel|last2=Keenan|first2=James|title=Paul and Virtue Ethics|date=2010|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|pages=125–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they don't explain why it has to be an either/or matter of replacing the cardinal virtues rather than supplementing them.

==Allegory==

[[File:John Hotham Tomb South Dalton.jpg|right|thumb|The Tomb of [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]], supported by figures of the cardinal virtues.]]
[[File:Vertus cardinales par Germain Pilon (Louvre).jpg|thumbnail|Four cardinal virtues; Louvre, Paris. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]

The Cardinal Virtues are often depicted as female [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]] and were a popular subject for funerary sculpture. The attributes and names of these figures may vary according to local tradition.

In many churches and artwork the Cardinal Virtues are depicted with symbolic items:

* '''Justice''' – sword, balance and scales, and a crown
* '''Temperance''' – wheel, bridle and reins, vegetables and fish, cup, water and wine in two jugs
* '''Fortitude''' – armor, club, with a lion, palm, tower, yoke, broken column
* '''Prudence''' – book, scroll, mirror (occasionally attacked by a serpent)

Notable depictions include sculptures on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] and the tomb of [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]]. They were also depicted in the garden at [[Edzell Castle]].

A humorous depiction of the four cardinal virtues appears in the children's book "Masterpiece" written by [[Elise Broach]] and illustrated by [[Kelly Murphy]].

The consensus among mainstream autism researchers is that genetic factors predominate.

==Genetics==
{{main article|Heritability of autism}}

Genetic factors may be the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins had estimated [[heritability]] to be over 90%, meaning that genetics explains over 90% of whether a child will develop autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freitag|first1=C M|title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=10 October 2006|volume=12|issue=1|pages=2–22|doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896|pmid=17033636}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be an overestimation, as new twin studies estimate the heritability at between 60–90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hallmayer|first1=Joachim|title=Genetic Heritability and Shared Environmental Factors Among Twin Pairs With Autism|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=1 November 2011|volume=68|issue=11|pages=1095|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.76|pmc=4440679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronald|first1=Angelica|last2=Hoekstra|first2=Rosa A.|title=Autism spectrum disorders and autistic traits: A decade of new twin studies|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B|date=April 2011|volume=156|issue=3|pages=255–274|doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.31159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the non-autistic co-twins had learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings the risk for having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B|title=Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder|journal=Nat Rev Genet|year=2001|volume=2|issue=12|pages=943–955|doi=10.1038/35103559|pmid=11733747|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in spite of the strong heritability, most cases of ASD occur sporadically with no recent evidence of family history. It has been hypothesized that spontaneous [[Mutation#By inheritance|''de novo'' mutation]]s in the father's sperm or mother's egg contribute to the likelihood of developing autism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sebat|first1=J.|last2=Lakshmi|first2=B.|last3=Malhotra|first3=D.|last4=Troge|first4=J.|last5=Lese-Martin|first5=C.|last6=Walsh|first6=T.|last7=Yamrom|first7=B.|last8=Yoon|first8=S.|last9=Krasnitz|first9=A.|last10=Kendall|first10=J.|last11=Leotta|first11=A.|last12=Pai|first12=D.|last13=Zhang|first13=R.|last14=Lee|first14=Y.-H.|last15=Hicks|first15=J.|last16=Spence|first16=S.

The first genes to be definitively shown to contribute to risk for autism were found in the early 1990s by researchers looking at gender-specific forms of autism caused by mutations on the X chromosome.
An expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] of the gene ''[[FMR1]]'' in boys causes [[fragile X syndrome]], and at least 20% of boys with this mutation have behaviors consistent with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatton|first1=Deborah D.|last2=Sideris|first2=John|last3=Skinner|first3=Martie|last4=Mankowski|first4=Jean|last5=Bailey|first5=Donald B.|last6=Roberts|first6=Jane|last7=Mirrett|first7=Penny|title=Autistic behavior in children with fragile X syndrome: Prevalence, stability, and the impact of FMRP|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|date=1 September 2006|volume=140A|issue=17|pages=1804–1813|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31286|pmid=16700053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations that inactivate the gene ''[[MECP2]]'' cause [[Rett syndrome]], which is associated with autistic behaviors in girls, and in boys the mutation is embryonic lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoghbi|first1=Huda Y.|last2=Amir|first2=Ruthie E.|last3=Van den Veyver|first3=Ignatia B.|last4=Wan|first4=Mimi|last5=Tran|first5=Charles Q.|last6=Francke|first6=Uta|journal=Nature Genetics|date=1 October 1999|volume=23|issue=2|pages=185–188|doi=10.1038/13810|pmid=10508514|title=Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these early examples, the role of ''de novo'' mutations in ASD first became evident when [[DNA microarray]] technologies reached sufficient resolution to allow the detection of [[copy number variation]] (CNV) in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sebat|first1=J.|title=Large-Scale Copy Number Polymorphism in the Human Genome|journal=Science|date=23 July 2004|volume=305|issue=5683|pages=525–528|doi=10.1126/science.1098918|pmid=15273396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iafrate|first1=A John|last2=Feuk|first2=Lars|last3=Rivera|first3=Miguel N|last4=Listewnik|first4=Marc L|last5=Donahoe|first5=Patricia K|last6=Qi|first6=Ying|last7=Scherer|first7=Stephen W|last8=Lee|first8=Charles|title=Detection of large-scale variation in the human genome|journal=Nature Genetics|date=1 August 2004|volume=36|issue=9|pages=949–951|doi=10.1038/ng1416|pmid=15286789}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNVs are the most common type of [[structural variation]] in the genome, consisting of deletions and duplications of DNA that range in size from a [[kilobase]] to a few [[megabase]]s. Microarray analysis has shown that ''de novo'' CNVs occur at a significantly higher rate in sporadic cases of autism as compared to the rate in their typically developing siblings and unrelated controls. A series of studies have shown that gene disrupting ''de novo'' CNVs occur approximately four times more frequently in ASD than in controls and contribute to approximately 5–10% of cases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinto|first1=Dalila|last2=Delaby|first2=Elsa|last3=Merico|first3=Daniele|last4=Barbosa|first4=Mafalda|last5=Merikangas|first5=Alison|last6=Klei|first6=Lambertus|last7=Thiruvahindrapuram|first7=Bhooma|last8=Xu|first8=Xiao|last9=Ziman|first9=Robert|last10=Wang|first10=Zhuozhi|last11=Vorstman|first11=Jacob A.S.|last12=Thompson|first12=Ann|last13=Regan|first13=Regina|last14=Pilorge|first14=Marion|last15=Pellecchia|first15=Giovanna|last16=Pagnamenta|first16=Alistair T.|last17=Oliveira|first17=Bárbara|last18=Marshall|first18=Christian R.|last19=Magalhaes|first19=Tiago R.|last20=Lowe|first20=Jennifer K.|last21=Howe|first21=Jennifer L.|last22=Griswold|first22=Anthony J.|last23=Gilbert|first23=John|last24=Duketis|first24=Eftichia|last25=Dombroski|first25=Beth A.|last26=De Jonge|first26=Maretha V.|last27=Cuccaro|first27=Michael|last28=Crawford|first28=Emily L.|last29=Correia|first29=Catarina T.|last30=Conroy|first30=Judith|last31=Conceição|first31=Inês C.|last32=Chiocchetti|first32=Andreas G.|last33=Casey|first33=Jillian P.|last34=Cai|first34=Guiqing|last35=Cabrol|first35=Christelle|last36=Bolshakova|first36=Nadia|last37=Bacchelli|first37=Elena|last38=Anney|first38=Richard|last39=Gallinger|first39=Steven|last40=Cotterchio|first40=Michelle|last41=Casey|first41=Graham|last42=Zwaigenbaum|first42=Lonnie|last43=Wittemeyer|first43=Kerstin|last44=Wing|first44=Kirsty|last45=Wallace|first45=Simon|last46=van Engeland|first46=Herman|last47=Tryfon|first47=Ana|last48=Thomson|first48=Susanne|last49=Soorya|first49=Latha|last50=Rogé|first50=Bernadette|last51=Roberts|first51=Wendy|last52=Poustka|first52=Fritz|last53=Mouga|first53=Susana|last54=Minshew|first54=Nancy|last55=McInnes|first55=L.

The conclusion of these recent studies of ''de novo'' mutation is that the spectrum of autism is breaking up into quanta of individual disorders defined by genetics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Epigenetics==
{{Main article|Epigenetics of autism}}
[[Epigenetic]] mechanisms may increase the risk of autism. Epigenetic changes occur as a result not of DNA sequence changes but of chromosomal histone modification or modification of the DNA bases. Such modifications are known to be affected by environmental factors, including nutrition, drugs, and mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Miyake K, Hirasawa T, Koide T, Kubota T |title=Epigenetics in autism and other neurodevelopmental diseases |journal=Adv.

==Prenatal environment==
The risk of autism is associated with several [[prenatal]] risk factors, including advanced age in either parent, diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Gardener"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL |title=Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2009 |pmid=19567888 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 |pmc=3712619 |type=Review, meta-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism has been linked to birth defect agents acting during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], though these cases are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Roullet FI, Lai JK, Foster JA |title=In utero exposure to valproic acid and autism--a current review of clinical and animal studies |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=36 |issue= |pages=47–56 |year=2013 |pmid=23395807 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2013.01.004 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious processes===
Prenatal viral infection has been called the principal non-genetic cause of autism. Prenatal exposure to [[rubella]] or [[cytomegalovirus]] activates the mother's [[immune response]] and may greatly increases the risk for autism in mice.&lt;ref name="Libbey" /&gt; [[Congenital rubella syndrome]] is the most convincing environmental cause of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Semin Pediatr Neurol |year=2008 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–31 |title= Genetic evaluation of autism |author= Mendelsohn NJ, Schaefer GB |doi=10.1016/j.spen.2008.01.005 |pmid=18342258|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection-associated immunological events in early pregnancy may affect neural development more than infections in late pregnancy, not only for autism, but also for psychiatric disorders of presumed neurodevelopmental origin, notably [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Neuroscientist |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=241–56|title= The neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal infections at different times of pregnancy: the earlier the worse? |author= Meyer U, Yee BK, Feldon J |pmid=17519367 |doi=10.1177/1073858406296401|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental agents===
[[Teratogen]]s are environmental agents that cause [[birth defect]]s. Some agents that are theorized to cause birth defects have also been suggested as potential autism risk factors, although there is little to no scientific evidence to back such claims. These include exposure of the embryo to [[valproic acid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Chomiak T, Turner N, Hu B |title=What We Have Learned about Autism Spectrum Disorder from Valproic Acid |journal=Patholog Res Int |volume=2013 |issue= |pages=712758 |year=2013 |pmid=24381784 |pmc=3871912 |doi=10.1155/2013/712758 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[paracetamol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Avella-Garcia CB, Julvez J, Fortuny J, Rebordosa C, García-Esteban R, Galán IR, Tardón A, Rodríguez-Bernal CL, Iñiguez C, Andiarena A, Santa-Marina L, Sunyer J |title=Acetaminophen use in pregnancy and neurodevelopment: attention function and autism spectrum symptoms |journal=Int J Epidemiol |pmid=27353198 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyw115}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thalidomide]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref name="Dufour2011" /&gt; These cases are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Miller MT, Strömland K, Ventura L, Johansson M, Bandim JM, Gillberg C |title=Autism associated with conditions characterized by developmental errors in early embryogenesis: a mini review |journal=Int.

===Other maternal conditions===
[[Thyroid]] problems that lead to [[thyroxine]] deficiency in the mother in weeks 8–12 of pregnancy have been postulated to produce changes in the fetal brain leading to autism. Thyroxine deficiencies can be caused by inadequate [[iodine]] in the diet, and by environmental agents that [[Goitrogen|interfere with iodine uptake]] or [[Antithyroid agent|act against thyroid hormones]]. Possible environmental agents include [[flavonoid]]s in food, [[tobacco smoke]], and most [[herbicide]]s. This hypothesis has not been tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Román GC |title=Autism: transient ''in utero'' hypothyroxinemia related to maternal flavonoid ingestion during pregnancy and to other environmental antithyroid agents |journal= J Neurol Sci |volume=262 |issue=1–2 |pages=15–26 |year=2007 |pmid=17651757 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.023|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetes in the mother during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for autism; a 2009 meta-analysis found that [[gestational diabetes]] was associated with a twofold increased risk. A 2014 review also found that maternal diabetes was significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Xu, Guifeng|title=Maternal Diabetes and the Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the Offspring: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=22 September 2013|volume=44|issue=4|pages=766–775|doi=10.1007/s10803-013-1928-2|pmid=24057131|pmc=4181720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although diabetes causes metabolic and hormonal abnormalities and [[oxidative stress]], no biological mechanism is known for the association between gestational diabetes and autism risk.&lt;ref name="Gardener" /&gt;

Maternal obesity during pregnancy may also increase the risk of autism, although further study is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Li YM et al.|title=Association Between Maternal Obesity and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Offspring: A Meta-analysis|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|year=2015|doi=10.1007/s10803-015-2549-8|pmid=26254893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ''in utero''===
It has been hypothesized that [[folic acid]] taken during pregnancy could play a role in reducing cases of autism by modulating [[gene expression]] through an [[epigenetic]] mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by multiple studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Lyall K, Schimdt RJ, Hertz-Picciotto I|title=Maternal lifestyle and environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorders|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=11 February 2014|volume=43|issue=2|pages=443–464|doi=10.1093/ije/dyt282|pmid=24518932|pmc=3997376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prenatal stress]], consisting of exposure to life events or environmental factors that distress an expectant mother, has been hypothesized to contribute to autism, possibly as part of a gene-environment interaction. Autism has been reported to be associated with prenatal stress both with retrospective studies that examined stressors such as job loss and family discord, and with natural experiments involving prenatal exposure to storms; animal studies have reported that prenatal stress can disrupt brain development and produce behaviors resembling symptoms of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |year=2008 |title= Prenatal stress and risk for autism |author= Kinney DK, Munir KM, Crowley DJ, Miller AM |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.06.004 |pmid=18598714 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1519–32 |pmc= 2632594|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have cast doubts on this association, notably population based studies in England and Sweden finding no link between stressful life events and ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038893| pmid=22719977| pmc=3374800|title = Prenatal and Early Life Exposure to Stressful Life Events and Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Population-Based Studies in Sweden and England| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=7| issue=6| pages=e38893|year = 2012|last1 = Rai|first1 = Dheeraj| last2=Golding| first2=Jean| last3=Magnusson| first3=Cecilia| last4=Steer| first4=Colin| last5=Lewis| first5=Glyn| last6=Dalman| first6=Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fetal testosterone theory hypothesizes that higher levels of [[testosterone]] in the [[amniotic fluid]] of mothers pushes brain development towards improved ability to see patterns and analyze complex systems while diminishing communication and empathy, emphasizing "male" traits over "female", or in [[E-S theory]] terminology, emphasizing "systemizing" over "empathizing". One project has published several reports suggesting that high levels of fetal testosterone could produce behaviors relevant to those seen in autism.&lt;ref&gt;Fetal testosterone and autistic traits:

Based in part on animal studies, diagnostic [[ultrasound]]s administered during pregnancy have been hypothesized to increase the child's risk of autism. This hypothesis is not supported by independently published research, and examination of children whose mothers received an ultrasound has failed to find evidence of harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Abramowicz JS |title=Ultrasound and autism: association, link, or coincidence? |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=1261–9 |year=2012 |month=August |pmid=22837291  |url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/content/31/8/1261.long |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that maternal exposure to [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism, but it remains unclear whether there is a causal link between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Man KK, Tong HH, Wong LY, Chan EW, Simonoff E, Wong IC|title=Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=9 December 2014|volume=49C|pages=82–89|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.11.020|pmid=25498856}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence, for example, that this association may be an artifact of confounding by maternal mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Brown HK, Hussain-Shamsy N, Lunsky Y, Dennis CE, Vigod SN|title=The Association Between Antenatal Exposure to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Autism: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=January 2017|volume=78|issue=1|pages=e48–e58|doi=10.4088/JCP.15r10194|pmid=28129495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perinatal environment==
Autism is associated with some [[perinatal]] and [[obstetric]] conditions. A 2007 review of [[risk factors]] found associated obstetric conditions that included [[low birth weight]] and [[gestation]] duration, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during [[childbirth]]. This association does not demonstrate a causal relationship. As a result, an underlying cause could explain both autism and these associated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Kolevzon A, Gross R, Reichenberg A |title= Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism |journal= Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=161 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=326–333 |pmid=17404128 |doi= 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.326|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing evidence that perinatal exposure to [[air pollution]] may be a risk factor for autism,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |

==Postnatal environment==
A wide variety of postnatal contributors to autism have been proposed, including gastrointestinal or immune system abnormalities, allergies, and exposure of children to drugs, vaccines, infection, certain foods, or heavy metals. The evidence for these risk factors is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies.&lt;ref name="Rutter"&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Rutter M|title=Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning|journal=Acta Paediatr|volume=94|issue=1|year=2005|pages=2–15|pmid=15858952|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x|authorlink=Michael Rutter|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amygdala neurons===
This theory hypothesizes that an early developmental failure involving the [[amygdala]] cascades on the development of cortical areas that mediate social perception in the visual domain. The [[fusiform face area]] of the [[ventral stream]] is implicated. The idea is that it is involved in social knowledge and social cognition, and that the deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=Int J Dev Neurosci|year=2005|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=125–41|title=Developmental deficits in social perception in autism: the role of the amygdala and fusiform face area|author=Schultz RT|doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.12.012|pmid=15749240|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autoimmune disease===
This theory hypothesizes that autoantibodies that target the brain or elements of brain metabolism may cause or exacerbate autism. It is related to the [[#Maternal infection|maternal infection]] theory, except that it postulates that the effect is caused by the individual's own antibodies, possibly due to an environmental trigger after birth. It is also related to several other hypothesized causes; for example, [[#Viral infection|viral infection]] has been hypothesized to cause autism via an autoimmune mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Autoimmun Rev |year=2004 |volume=3 |issue=7–8 |pages=557–562 |title= Is autism an autoimmune disease? |title.= |author= Ashwood P, Van de Water J |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2004.07.036 |pmid=15546805 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the nervous system begin early during [[embryogenesis]], and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Leukoc Biol |year=2006 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |title=The immune response in autism: a new frontier for autism research |author=[[Paul Ashwood|Ashwood P]], Wills S, Van de Water J |doi=10.1189/jlb.1205707 |pmid=16698940 |url=http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1 |type=Review |accessdate=2008-02-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005180253/http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1# |archivedate=2006-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of autism cases are associated with infection, usually before birth. Results from immune studies have been contradictory. Some abnormalities have been found in specific subgroups, and some of these have been replicated.

===Endogenous opiate precursor theory===
{{Main article|Opioid excess theory}}
In 1979, [[Jaak Panksepp]] proposed a connection between autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Panksepp J | year = 1979 | title = A neurochemical theory of autism | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 174–177 | doi=10.1016/0166-2236(79)90071-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opiate theory hypothesizes that autism is caused by a digestive disorder present from birth which causes gluten (present in wheat-derived foods) and casein (present in dairy products) to be converted to the opioid peptides [[gliadorphin]] (aka gluteomorphin) and [[casomorphin]]. 
	 	
According to the theory, exposure to these opiate compounds in young children interferes with normal neurological development by dulling sensory input. Lacking sufficient sensory input, the developing brain attempts to artificially generate the auditory, vestibular, visual, and tactile input on its own. This attempt at generating input manifests itself as behaviors common to autism, such as grunting or screaming (auditory), spinning or rocking back and forth (vestibular), preoccupation with spinning objects or waving of the fingers in front of the eyes (visual), and hand flapping or self-injury (tactile).

The theory further states that removing opiate precursors from a child's diet may allow time for these behaviors to cease, and neurological development in very young children to resume normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |year=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl 2 |pages=S162–171 |title= Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |author= Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid=16685183 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a relationship between autism and the consumption of gluten and casein was first articulated by [[Kalle Reichelt]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Reichelt KL, Knivsberg A-M, Lind G, Nødland M | year = 1991 | title = Probable etiology and possible treatment of childhood autism | url = | journal = Brain Dysfunct | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 308–319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific evidence is not yet adequate to make treatment recommendations regarding diets, such as the [[Gluten-free, casein-free diet|GFCF diet]], which exclude these substances.&lt;ref&gt;Shattock P, Whiteley P.

===Gastrointestinal connection===
Parents have reported [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) disturbances in autistic children, and several studies have investigated possible associations between autism and the gut,&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Top Clin Nutr |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=212–225 |year=2006 |author= Johnson TW |title= Dietary considerations in autism: identifying a reasonable approach |doi=10.1097/00008486-200607000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the results so far are inconclusive.

After a preliminary 1998 study of three children with ASD treated with [[secretin]] infusion reported improved GI function and dramatic improvement in behavior, many parents sought secretin treatment and a black market for the hormone developed quickly.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Later studies found secretin clearly ineffective in treating autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Krishnaswami S, McPheeters ML, Veenstra-Vanderweele J |title=A systematic review of secretin for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Pediatrics |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=e1322–1325 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21464196 |pmc=3387870 |doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0428 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of vitamin D===
The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency has a role in autism is biologically plausible, but not researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kočovská E, Fernell E, Billstedt E, Minnis H, Gillberg C |title=Vitamin D and autism: clinical review |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1541–1550 |year=2012 |pmid=22522213 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.015 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lead===
[[Lead poisoning]] has been suggested as a possible risk factor for autism, as the [[lead]] blood levels of autistic children has been reported to be significantly higher than typical.&lt;ref name="Zafeiriou2006"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Brain Dev |year=2007 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=257–272 |title= Childhood autism and associated comorbidities |author= Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 |pmid=17084999|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The atypical eating  behaviors of autistic children, along with habitual mouthing and [[pica (disorder)|pica]], make it hard to determine whether increased lead levels are a cause or a consequence of autism.&lt;ref name="Zafeiriou2006" /&gt;

===Locus coeruleus–noradrenergic system===
This theory hypothesizes that autistic behaviors depend at least in part on a developmental dysregulation that results in impaired function of the [[locus coeruleus]]–[[noradrenergic]] (LC-NA) system. The LC-NA system is heavily involved in arousal and attention; for example, it is related to the brain's acquisition and use of environmental cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Mehler MF, Purpura DP |title= Autism, fever, epigenetics and the locus coeruleus |journal= Brain Res Rev |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=388–392 |year=2009 |pmid=19059284 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.11.001 |laysummary=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1889436,00.html |laysource=TIME |laydate=2009-04-07 |pmc= 2668953|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercury===
This theory hypothesizes that autism is associated with [[mercury poisoning]], based on perceived similarity of symptoms and reports of mercury or its biomarkers in some autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Int J Risk Saf Med |year=2008 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=135–142 |title=An epidemiological analysis of the 'autism as mercury poisoning' hypothesis |author= Austin D |doi=10.3233/JRS-2008-0436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has gained little traction in the scientific community as the [[Mercury toxicity#Signs and symptoms|typical symptoms of mercury toxicity]] are significantly different from [[Autism#Characteristics|symptoms seen in autism]].&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Nelson KB, Bauman ML |title= Thimerosal and autism? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=674–679 |year=2003 |pmid=12612255 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.3.674 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/111/3/674|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal source of human exposure to organic mercury is via fish consumption and for inorganic mercury is [[dental amalgam]]s. The evidence so far is indirect for the association between autism and mercury exposure after birth, as no direct test has been reported, and there is no evidence of an association between autism and postnatal exposure to any neurotoxicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2004 |volume=113 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=1023–1029 |title=Mercury exposure and child development outcomes |author=Davidson PW, Myers GJ, Weiss B |pmid=15060195 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_3/1023.long|doi=10.1542/peds.113.4.S1.1023|type=Review, historical article}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis published in 2007 concluded that there was no link between mercury and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=Pediatr Int|year=2007|volume=49|issue=1|pages=80–87|title=Low-level chronic mercury exposure in children and adolescents: meta-analysis|author=Ng DK, Chan CH, Soo MT, Lee RS|doi=10.1111/j.1442-200X.2007.02303.x|pmid=17250511 |type=Meta-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidative stress===
This theory hypothesizes that toxicity and [[oxidative stress]] may cause autism in some cases. Evidence includes genetic effects on metabolic pathways, reduced antioxidant capacity, enzyme changes, and enhanced biomarkers for oxidative stress; however, the overall evidence is weaker than it is for involvement oxidative stress with disorders such as [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Int J Neuropsychopharmacol |year=2008 |title= Oxidative stress in psychiatric disorders: evidence base and therapeutic implications |author= Ng F, Berk M, Dean O, Bush AI |doi=10.1017/S1461145707008401 |pmid=18205981 |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=851–876|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that stress damages [[Purkinje cell]]s in the [[cerebellum]] after birth, and it is possible that [[glutathione]] is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev|year=2006 |volume=9|issue=6|pages=485–499|title=Evidence of toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal insult in autism|author=Kern JK, Jones AM|doi=10.1080/10937400600882079|pmid=17090484|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Autistic children have lower levels of total glutathione, and higher levels of oxidized glutathione.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Ghanizadeh A, Akhondzadeh S, Hormozi M, Makarem A, Abotorabi-Zarchi M, Firoozabadi A |title=Glutathione-related factors and oxidative stress in autism, a review |journal=Curr.

=== Refrigerator mother ===
{{main article|Refrigerator mother}}

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to early childhood trauma, and his work was highly influential for decades both in the medical and popular spheres.

Parents, especially mothers, of individuals with autism were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author= Bettelheim B |title= The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self |year=1967 |publisher= Free Press |isbn=0-02-903140-0 |authorlink= Bruno Bettelheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Kanner L |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943 |authorlink= Leo Kanner}} Reprinted in {{vcite journal |year=1968 |journal=Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–136 |pmid=4880460 |author=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that parental coldness might contribute to autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= [[Am J Orthopsychiatry]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=416–426 |year=1949 |author=Kanner L |title= Problems of nosology and psychodynamics in early childhood autism |pmid=18146742 |doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kanner eventually renounced the theory, Bettelheim put an almost exclusive emphasis on it in both his medical and his popular books. Treatments based on these theories failed to help children with autism, and after Bettelheim's death, it came out that his reported rates of cure (around 85%) were found to be fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=12–14 |year=2000 |title= The brutality of Dr. Bettelheim |author=Gardner M |authorlink= Martin Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viral infection===
Many studies have presented evidence for and against association of autism with viral infection after birth. Laboratory rats infected with [[Borna disease virus]] show some symptoms similar to those of autism but blood studies of autistic children show no evidence of infection by this virus. Members of the [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus family]] may have a role in autism, but the evidence so far is anecdotal. Viruses have long been suspected as triggers for immune-mediated diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] but showing a direct role for viral causation is difficult in those diseases, and mechanisms whereby viral infections could lead to autism are speculative.&lt;ref name="Libbey"&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=J Neurovirol|year=2005|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–10|title=Autistic disorder and viral infections|author=Libbey JE, Sweeten TL, McMahon WM, Fujinami RS|doi=10.1080/13550280590900553|pmid=15804954|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social construct===
The [[social construct]] theory says that the boundary between normal and abnormal is subjective and arbitrary, so autism does not exist as an objective entity, but only as a social construct. It further argues that autistic individuals themselves have a way of being that is partly socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book|isbn=0-674-00412-4|author=Hacking I|title=The Social Construction of What?|title.= |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|pages=114–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asperger syndrome]] and [[high-functioning autism]] are particular targets of the theory that social factors determine what it means to be autistic. The theory hypothesizes that individuals with these diagnoses inhabit the identities that have been ascribed to them, and promote their sense of well-being by resisting or appropriating autistic ascriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter= The dialectics of autism: theorizing autism, performing autism, remediating autism, and resisting autism |title= Constructing Autism: Unravelling the 'Truth' and Understanding the Social |author= Nadesan MH |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-32181-6 |year=2005 |pages=179–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MMR vaccine====
{{main article|MMR vaccine controversy}}

The [[MMR vaccine]] as a cause of autism is one of the most extensively debated hypotheses regarding the origins of autism. [[Andrew Wakefield]] ''et al.'' reported a study of 12 children who had autism and bowel symptoms, in some cases reportedly with onset after MMR.&lt;ref name="Retraction" /&gt;  Although the paper, which was later retracted by the journal,&lt;ref name="Retraction" /&gt; concluded "We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described,"&lt;ref name="Wakefield1998"&gt;{{vcite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A ''et al.''  |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–641 |year=1998 | note = doi was 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 and URL was http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|pmid=9500320 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0}}{{Retracted paper|{{DOI|10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-7}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield nevertheless suggested during a 1998 press conference that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single dose.

In 2004, the interpretation of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism was formally retracted by ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH ''et al.'' |author.= |title= Retraction of an interpretation |year=2004 |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |pages=750 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 |pmid=15016483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraction followed an investigation by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', which stated that Wakefield "acted dishonestly and irresponsibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm |title= The MMR-autism crisis – our story so far |accessdate=2008-12-06 |author= Deer B |date=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]],&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/mmr_vaccine.htm |title= Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref name="IOM2004"&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/20155.aspx |title=Immunization safety review: vaccines and autism |publisher=Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623134938/http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/20155.aspx |archivedate=2007-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.K. [[National Health Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/ |accessdate=2007-06-13 |title=MMR the facts |publisher=National Health Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615000359/http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/ |archivedate=2007-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

====Thiomersal (thimerosal)====
{{main article|Thiomersal controversy}}

Perhaps the best-known hypothesis involving mercury and autism involves the use of the mercury-based compound [[thiomersal]], a preservative that has been phased out from most childhood [[vaccination]]s in developed countries including US and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm096228.htm#thi| title= Vaccines, blood and biologics:  thimerosal in vaccines |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |year=2012 |accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. There is no scientific evidence for a causal connection between thiomersal and autism, but parental concern about the [[thiomersal controversy]] has led to decreasing rates of [[childhood immunizations]]&lt;ref name="Doja" /&gt; and increasing likelihood of disease outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Eaton L |title=Measles cases in England and Wales rise sharply in 2008 |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b533 |year=2009 |pmid=19208716 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.b533|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19208716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Choi YH, Gay N, Fraser G, Ramsay M |title=The potential for measles transmission in England |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |issue= |pages=338 |year=2008 |pmid=18822142 |pmc=2563003 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-338 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, due to concern about the dose of  mercury infants were being exposed to, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that thiomersal be removed from childhood vaccines, and by 2002 the flu vaccine was the only childhood vaccine containing more than trace amounts of thimerosal.

From the end of the [[Second World War]] to the beginning of the [[McCarthy era]] (1945–1950), the American professional theatre produced twenty shows on civil rights, nine of them on Broadway. 

Off-Broadway and out of town shows displayed a wider array of moral stances, ranging from gentle persuasion of ''Florence'' (1949) by [[Alice Childress]] and the religious fervor of ''[[Trial by Fire (play)|Trial by Fire]]'' (1947) by [[George Dunne (priest)|George Dunne]] to the activism of ''Earth and Stars'' (1946) by [[Randolph Edmonds]].

While musicals dominated commercial theatre in the 1940s, four dramas about the African Americans addressed the nations racial dilemma. The first, [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s, ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941), opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on 24 March 1941. Wright's novel had firmly laid the responsibility for Bigger’s brutality on the doorstep of white America, but in adapting the novel to the stage, [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]], a southern folk dramatist, had insisted that Bigger take some responsibility for the murders he had committed.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Houseman]] and [[Orson Welles]] preferred Wright’s original concepts and discarded the modifications made by Green, which had softened Bigger’s character. When Green saw the play he was angered and later published his own version. [[Canada Lee]] created the role of Bigger Thomas, receiving near unanimous praise from the critics. The production ran for 114 straight performances before touring major US cities and returning to New York to run for an additional eighty-four performances before closing, in part because of America’s declared war on 7 December 1941, which had refocused the nation’s attention. 

The second civil rights drama, ''Strange Fruit'' (1945), set in a small Georgia town, had been adapted from Lilian Smith’s controversial novel. Staged by José Ferrer, the play featured 23-year-old [[Jane White]] as Nonnie, a black girl made pregnant by a white boy played by [[Mel Ferrer]]. Other Blacks in the cast were [[Juano Hernandez]], Edna Thomas, [[Alonzo Bosan]], [[Ken Renard]], and [[Dorothy Carter]]. [[Robert Earl Jones]] played the lynch victim. The play lasted for sixty performances, in part because [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] wrote enthusiastically about it in her syndicated column, “My Day.” 

After the Allies defeated Germany and Japan in 1945, black soldiers returned home to segregated housing. On Whitman Avenue (1946), a civil rights drama on discrimination in the renting and sale of housing, starred Canada Lee, this time playing a decorated war hero trying to move his family into a white neighborhood. [[Abbie Mitchell]], [[Augustus Smith (actor)|Augustus Smith]], and [[Peter Morell]] played the members of Lee’s family. [[Margo Jones]], from Dallas, Texas, directed the drama, which was written by [[Maxine Wood]]. In response to unenthusiastic reviews, Eleanor Roosevelt observed in her weekly column that the American people were in a period of retrogression and did not want to be reminded of their shortcomings. With Roosevelt’s help and that of [[Langston Hughes]], the play remained alive for 148 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conquest of the Desert''' ({{lang-es|Conquista del desierto}}) was a military campaign directed mainly by General [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in the 1870s with the intent to establish [[Argentina|Argentine]] dominance over [[Patagonia]], which was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous peoples]]. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of [[Chile]]an expansion there.

Argentine troops killed more than a thousand enemy combatants and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. [[White people|Ethnic European]] settlers developed the lands for agriculture, turning it into a [[breadbasket]] that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="fifteenthousand"&gt;''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902,'' George V. Rauch, p. 47, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roca&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/13/argentinian-founding-father-genocide-row |title=Argentinian founding father recast as genocidal murderer |first=Rory |last=Carroll |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest was paralleled by a similar campaign in Chile called the [[Occupation of Araucanía]].

The Conquest is highly controversial. Apologists have described the Conquest as bringing civilisation, while revisionists have labelled it a [[genocide]].

==Background==
The arrival of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] on the shores of the [[Río de la Plata]] and the foundation of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the [[Spain|Spanish]] and the local Indian tribes, mainly the [[Querandí]] (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for [[cattle]] raising. This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing or driving off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.

[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Mapuches during a [[malón]] raid]]
The [[frontier]] dividing the colonial farms and the Indian territories gradually moved outwards from Buenos Aires; at the end of the 18th century, the [[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|Salado River]] was the boundary between the civilizations. Many Indians were forced &lt;!--?Explain--&gt; to abandon their tribes to work on the farms. Some assimilated or intermarried with the white population. The group known as [[gaucho]]s developed from working on the ranches.

After Argentina achieved independence in 1816, the provinces had numerous conflicts as they struggled over how to organize. Once these were settled, the government wanted to quickly occupy the lands claimed by the young republic (in part to prevent Chile from encroaching on it). It also wanted to increase the national agricultural production and offer new lands to prospective immigrants.

In 1833 [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Buenos Aires Province and other military leaders in the [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]] region coordinated offensives to try to exterminate the resistant indigenous tribes, but only Rosas' expedition achieved some success. By this time [[Chile]] had founded [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Magellan Strait]] in 1845, which threatened the Argentine claims in [[Patagonia]]. Later in 1861 Chile began the [[occupation of the Araucanía]], which alarmed Argentine authorities because of its rival's growing influence in the zone. Chile had defeated the [[Mapuche]] in their central region. This indigenous tribe had [[araucanization|strong language and cultural ties]] to the nomadic tribes on the east side of the [[Andes]], with whom they share the [[araucanization|same language]].

In 1872 the indigenous leader [[Cufulcurá|Calfucurá]] and his 6,000 followers attacked the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]] and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]]. They killed 300 settlers and drove off 200,000 head of cattle. These events were a catalyst for the government to mount the Conquest of the Desert.

The Indians drove the stolen cattle from the incursions (''[[malón|malones]]'') to Chile through the [[Camino de los chilenos|Rastrillada de los chilenos]] and traded them for goods. The historian George V. Rauch notes evidence that Chilean authorities knew about the origin of the cattle and consented to the trading in order to strengthen their influence over Patagonian territories. They expected eventually to occupy those lands in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch (1999), ''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alsina's campaign==
[[Image:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|200px|right|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of  [[zanja de Alsina]]]]
In 1875 [[Adolfo Alsina]], Minister of War under [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], presented the government with a plan which he later described as having the goal "to populate the desert, and not to destroy the Indians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuquen.gov.ar/org/cultura/historiadeneuquen.htm "Reseña sobre la historia de Neuquén"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501154410/http://www.neuquen.gov.ar/org/cultura/historiadeneuquen.htm |date=2006-05-01 }}, Government of the [[Neuquén Province]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step was to connect Buenos Aires and the ''Fortines'' (fortresses) with telegraph lines. The government signed a peace treaty with [[lonco|chieftain]] [[Juan José Catriel]]. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain ''[[Namuncurá]]'' and 3,500 warriors, he attacked [[Tres Arroyos]], [[Tandil]], [[Azul, Buenos Aires|Azul]], and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch )1999), ''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Alsina attacked the Indians, forcing them to fall back, and leaving ''fortines'' on his way south to protect the conquered territories. He also constructed the 374&amp;nbsp;km long trench named [[zanja de Alsina]] ("Alsina's trench"). It was supposed to be a fortified border to the unconquered territories.  Three metres wide and two metres deep, it served as an obstacle to cattle drives by the Indians.

The Indians continued taking cattle from farms in the Buenos Aires Province and the south of the [[Mendoza Province]], but found it difficult to escape as the animals slowed their march. They had to confront the patrolling units that followed them. As the war went on, some Indians eventually signed peace treaties and settled among the "Christians" behind the lines of forts. Some tribes allied with the Argentine government, standing neutral or, less often, fighting for the Argentine army. In return, they were granted periodical shipments of cattle and food. After Alsina died in 1877, Julio Argentino Roca was appointed Minister of War, and decided to change the strategy.

==Roca's campaign==
[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|190px|The changing state of Argentina]] 
[[Julio Argentino Roca]], in contrast to Alsina, believed that the only solution against the Indian threat was to extinguish, subdue or expel them.

{{Quote|Our self-respect as a virile people obliges us to put down as soon as possible, by reason or by force, this handful of savages who destroy our wealth and prevent us from definitely occupying, in the name of law, progress and our own security, the richest and most fertile lands of the Republic.|Julio Argentino Roca|&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: Kenneth M. Roth. ''Annihilating Difference: The Anthropology of Genocide''. University of California Press, 2002. Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of 1878 he started the first sweep to "clean" the area between the Alsina trench and the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Negro river]] by continuous and systematic attacks on the Indian settlements. On 6 December 1878, elements of the Puán Division under Colonel Teodoro García clashed with a war party at the Lihué Calel heights. In a brief but hard fought battle, 50 Indians were killed, 270 captured, and 33 settlers were freed.&lt;ref name="Boundary Dispute With Chile 1902, p. 45"&gt;The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902, George V. Rauch, p. 45, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous armed encounters would follow, until by December 1878, over 4,000 Indians had been captured and 400 killed, 150 settlers freed and 15,000 head of cattle recovered.&lt;ref name="Boundary Dispute With Chile 1902, p. 45"/&gt;

With 6,000 soldiers armed with new [[Remington Rolling Block rifle|breech-loading Remington rifles]], in 1879 he began the second sweep reaching [[Choele Choel]] in two months, after killing 1,313 Indians and capturing over 15,000.&lt;ref name="fifteenthousand"/&gt; From other points, southbound companies made their way down to the Negro River and the [[Neuquén River]], a northern tributary of the Negro River. Together, both rivers marked the natural frontier from the [[Andes]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mce.lapampa.gov.ar/archivohistorico/PAGES/m_ind_frontera.htm "Poblamiento Pampeano"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227080911/http://www.mce.lapampa.gov.ar/archivohistorico/PAGES/m_ind_frontera.htm |date=2005-12-27 }} – Ministry of Culture of the [[la Pampa Province]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack led to a large migration of Mapuches into the zone around [[Curarrehue]] and [[Pucón]], Chile.

Many settlements were built on the basin of these two rivers, as well as a number on the [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado River]]. By sea, some settlements were erected on the southern basin of the [[Chubut River]] mainly by [[Welsh people|Welsh colonists]] in [[y Wladfa]].

==The final campaign==
Roca followed Nicolás Avellaneda as [[President of Argentina|president]]. He thought it was imperative to conquer the territory south of the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Negro River]] as soon as possible, and ordered the 1881 campaign under the control of Colonel [[Conrado Villegas]].

Within a year Villegas conquered the [[Neuquén Province]] (he reached the [[Limay River]]). The campaign continued to push the Indian resistance further south, to fight the last battle on October 18, 1884. The last rebel group of over 3,000 members under the command of chieftains Inacayal and Foyel surrendered two months later in present [[Chubut Province]].

==Border clashes==
To counteract the Argentine conquest of Patagonia, the Chileans supplied arms, ammunition and horses to their Indian Mapuche allies.&lt;ref&gt;5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.29, Leo Cooper, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1883, a 10-man section of a platoon of the Argentine Army in pursuit of a large Indian war party, ran into an ambush in the Pulmarí Valley set up by Chilean soldiers, and in the engagement that followed Captain Emilio Crouzeilles along with Lieutenant Nicolas Lazcano and several privates were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Historia de las misiones salesianas en La Pampa, República Argentina
, Volume 1, Lorenzo Massa, p. 169, Editorial Don Bosco, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 1883, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Díaz, at the head of a 16-man Argentine infantry detachment, was trailing a war party of 100 to 150 Indians. Upon reaching Pulmarí Valley, they were surrounded by the Indians and around 50 Chilean soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the Argentine soldiers skillfully outfought their attackers, including a bayonet charge mounted by the Chilean detachment.&lt;ref&gt;The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902, George V. Rauch, p. 49, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 1883, according to Argentine Army Major Manuel Prado, 150-200 Indians armed with Winchesters and [[Martini–Henry]] rifles attacked an Argentine Army detachment operating on the Argentine-Chilean border, and in a four-hour engagement killed or wounded 22 Argentine soldiers at a cost of some 100 warriors.

==Historical controversy==
{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}
Historian Jens Andermann has noted that contemporary sources on the campaign indicate that the Conquest was intended by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government to exterminate the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Argentina|indigenous tribes]], and thus attempt genocide.&lt;ref name="genocide"&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/llc/subjects/span_lat_amer/span_lat_amer_staff/ja Andermann, Jens].  [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ibamuseum/texts/Andermann02.htm ''Argentine Literature and the 'Conquest of the Desert', 1872-1896''], [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. Quote: "It is this sudden acceleration, this abrupt change from the discourse of 'defensive warfare' and 'merciful civilization' to that of 'offensive warfare' and of genocide, which is perhaps the most distinctive mark of the literature of the Argentine frontier."&lt;/ref&gt; First-hand accounts state that Argentine troops killed prisoners and committed "mass executions".&lt;ref name=genocide /&gt; The 15,000 Indians taken captive "became servants or prisoners and were prevented from having children."&lt;ref name=fifteenthousand /&gt;&lt;ref name=roca /&gt;

Apologists perceive the campaign as intending to conquer specifically those groups of Indians that refused to submit to Argentine law and frequently carried out brutal attacks on frontier civilian settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, David. ''State Building and Political Movements in Argentina, 1860-1916''. Stanford University Press, 2002, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; In these attacks, Indians stole many horses and cattle, killed men defending their livestock and captured women and children to become the [[slaves]] and/or forced brides of Indian warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentina: Countries of the World,'' Erika Wittekind, p. 67, ABDO, 01/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Captive Women: Oblivion And Memory In Argentina,'' [[Susana Rotker]], p.32, University of Minnesota Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' alleged in 2011 that two education officials lost their jobs due to the controversy over the Conquest of the Desert: It alleged that Juan José Cresto was forced to resign as a director of the Argentine National Historical Museum because he "said the Indians were violent parasites who attacked farms and kidnapped women"&lt;ref name=roca /&gt; and Beatriz Horn, a history teacher in [[La Pampa Province]], was fired for "telling a radio station that Roca deserved praise for putting Indians to flight and opening Argentina's frontier to European settlers."&lt;ref name=roca /&gt; Argentine news sources, however, report Juan José Cresto lost his job for being abusive and violent towards employees&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/03/25/s-03201.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the firing of Beatriz Horn was primarily due to her praise for the military dictator [[Leopoldo Galtieri]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/380889/argentina/Actualidad_nacional.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">In [[commutative algebra]], the '''constructible topology''' on the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a [[commutative ring]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topology]] where each [[closed set]] is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} (B)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] ''B'' over ''A''. An important feature of this construction is that the map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed map]] with respect to the constructible topology.

With respect to this topology, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact set#Definition|compact]],&lt;ref&gt;Some authors prefer the term ''quasicompact'' here.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] [[topological space]]. In general the constructible topology is a [[finer topology]] than the [[Zariski topology]], but the two topologies will coincide if and only if &lt;math&gt;A / \operatorname{nil}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[von Neumann regular ring]], where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nil}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[nilradical of a ring|nilradical]]  of ''A''.

Despite the terminology being similar, the constructible topology is not the same as the set of all [[Constructible set (topology)|constructible sets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1337968/reconciling-two-different-definitions-of-constructible-sets/1964351#1964351|title=Reconciling two different definitions of constructible sets|website=math.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
In [[medicine]], '''decompensation''' is the functional deterioration of a structure or system that had been previously working with the help of [[allostasis|allostatic]] compensation. Decompensation may occur due to [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], illness, or old age. When a system is "compensated", it is able to function despite stressors or defects. Decompensation describes an inability to compensate for these deficiencies. It is a general term commonly used in medicine to describe a variety of situations.

== Physiology ==
For example, ''cardiac decompensation'' may refer to the failure of the heart to maintain adequate blood [[Circulation (physiology)|circulation]], after long-standing (previously compensated) [[vascular disease]] (see [[heart failure]]). Short-term treatment of cardiac decompensation can be achieved through administration of [[dobutamine]], resulting in an increase in heart contractility via an [[inotropic]] effect.&lt;ref name=acute&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acute Decompensated Heart Failure|pmc=2801958 |year=2009|journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal|last1=Joseph|display-authors=etal|pmid=20069075|volume=36|pages=510–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kidney failure]] can also occur following a slow degradation of kidney function due to an underlying untreated illness; the symptoms of the latter can then become much more severe due to the lack of efficient compensation by the kidney.

== Psychology ==

{{See also|Disinhibition}}
In [[psychology]], the term refers to the inability to maintain [[defense mechanism]]s in response to stress, resulting in personality disturbance or psychological imbalance.&lt;ref name=Tamporo2011&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carol D Tamparo |author2=Marcia A Lewis |title=Diseases of the Human Body|publisher=[[F.A.

'''Fatos Lubonja''' (born 1951) is an [[Albania]]n writer, analyst and dissident.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite encyclopedia | author=Bernard A. Cook | editor=Bernard A. Cook | title=Lubonja, Fatos | encyclopedia=Europe since 1945: An Encyclopedia | volume=2 | pages=797 | publisher=Garland Publishing | year=2001 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/108806540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Fatos, son of Todi Lubonja, who was a close associate of [[Enver Hoxha]] and head of Albanian national television until the early 1970s, is an Albanian political analyst. In the course of Hoxha's split with the USSR in 1960, Todi Lubonja was arrested for voicing opposition. Fatos, who had been studying physics in Tirana, was also arrested due to the discovery of his diary, which was very critical of Hoxha.

Fatos Lubonja was initially sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He was accused of belonging to a pro-Soviet circle in the prison and was sentenced to twenty more years. After having spent thirteen years at hard labor, he was moved to solitary confinement. There he wrote a diary and a novel on cigarette paper, which was concealed in the spine of a dictionary. His novel ''The Last Massacre'' is a take on communism under Hoxha.

Fatos Lubonja was released in 1991, after having spent seventeen years in prison and having suffered a nervous breakdown, while serving his sentence. He is an outspoken critic of the Albanian socio-political factors, i.e. [[right-wing]] leader [[Sali Berisha]], [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]] leader [[Edi Rama]], former [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] leader [[Ramush Haradinaj]], [[Red and Black Alliance]], and poet and novelist [[Ismail Kadare]]. He edits and publishes the literary magazine ''[[Përpjekja]]'' (Endeavour) in Tirana, which was founded by him in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts and Culture Program|url=http://www.soros.al/en/legacy/art.htm#1|work=Open Society Foundation|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatos Lubonja|url=http://wordswithoutborders.org/contributor/fatos-lubonja|work=Words without Borders|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubonja is the recipient of the SEEMO Award for Mutual Cooperation in South East Europe in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Award 2004|url=http://seemo.org/awards/human/human04.html|work=SEEMO|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Floodgate_clamshell.JPG|thumb|right|275px|"Floodgate" is a visual metaphor suggesting a potential torrent of claims.]]
{{English tort law}}
The '''floodgates principle''', or the '''floodgates argument''', is a [[legal principle]] which is sometimes applied by judges to restrict or limit the right to make claims for [[Damages (law)|damages]] because of a concern that permitting a claimant to recover in such situations might open the metaphorical "[[floodgate]]s" to large numbers of claims and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/law/fear-of-opening-the-floodgates-law-general-essay.php |title=Fear Of Opening The Floodgates |publisher=UAC |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle is most frequently cited in [[common law jurisdictions]], and in [[English tort law]] in particular.

Most of the situations in which the courts have employed the floodgates argument have revolved around liability in tort, and in particular in relation to the liability for nervous shock or for pure economic loss. The rationale in which the floodgates principle has been applied may vary. In some cases it is expressed to be a constraint upon when a defendant will owe a [[duty of care]], in others it is expressed to be a limitation upon the [[Remoteness in English law|remoteness of damage]] for which a defendant should be held responsible for.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd]]'' [1973] 1 QB 27 [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]] recognised this explicitly: "At bottom I think the question of recovering economic loss is one of policy. Whenever the courts draw a line to mark out the bounds of duty, they do it as matter of policy so as to limit the responsibility of the defendant. Whenever the courts set bounds to the damages recoverable - saying that they are, or are not, too remote - they do it as matter of policy so as to limit the liability of the defendant. In many of the cases where economic loss has been held not to be recoverable, it has been put on the ground that the defendant was under no duty to the plaintiff. ... In other cases, however, the defendant seems clearly to have been under a duty to the plaintiff, but the economic loss has not been recovered because it is too remote."&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases it is simply stated as a principle of [[public policy]].

The floodgates principle is arguably the antithesis of the legal maxim: ''[[fiat justitia ruat caelum]]'' ("let justice be done though the heavens fall").

==Rationale==

The core of the principle was enunciated by the then-Chief Justice of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (later [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Supreme Court Justice]]) [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in ''[[Ultramares Corp. v. Touche]]'' (1932) 174 N.E. 441 as the risk of exposing defendants to liability for "indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class".

In ''[[Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1973] 1 QB 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]] put the same point in more expansive terms:

{{cquote|[I]f claims for economic loss were permitted for this particular hazard, there would be no end of claims. Some might be genuine, but many might be inflated, or even false. A machine might not have been in use anyway, but it would be easy to put it down to the cut in supply. It would be well-nigh impossible to check the claims. If there was economic loss on one day, did the claimant do his best to mitigate it by working harder next day? and so forth. Rather than expose claimants to such temptation and defendants to such hard labour - on comparatively small claims - it is better to disallow economic loss altogether, at any rate when it stands alone, independent of any physical damage.}}

If a party by their negligence causes physical injury to one other person, then the pool of claimants for that physical injury is just that person.  However, if each person who suffers [[pure economic loss|resultant economic loss]] as a result of the injury to the person is also able to make a claim, then potentially the negligent party (and the courts) could be opened up to a vast array of claims.  Similarly, where a party publishes a negligent in a document, if that document is published widely, if every person who read that statement was entitled to rely upon it and claim for any loss caused by relying upon it, there would similarly be an extremely wide-ranging liability for [[negligent misstatement]]. The last, and probably most difficult area where the floodates principle has been evoked relates to psychiatric injury, or "[[Nervous shock in English law|nervous shock]]". How far should a person be liable if they injure someone negligently, and then other persons see the accident and suffer psychiatric injury (but no physical harm) just from witnessing the accident?  In trying to answer these questions the courts have sometimes fallen back on the floodgates principle to try and limit the potential range of claims.

==Nervous shock cases==

In [[English law]] the first recorded reference to the floodgates principle was in 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixthformlaw.info/01_modules/other_material/tort/1_duty/5_duty_fair_just.htm|title=Tort, negligence, duty of care - policy - fair just and reasonable |publisher=Sixth Form Law |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas|court=UKPC |division= |year=1888 |num=3 |parallelcite=(1888) 13 App Cas 222 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That case involved a pregnant woman (the claimant) whose husband had driven onto train tracks at a level crossing, and due to the negligence of the gate keeper, were nearly struck by a high speed train. The plaintiff, Mrs Coultas, suffered from serious shock, leading to impaired memory and eyesight, and the loss of her unborn child. Nonetheless, the Privy Council held that she had no sustainable claim for damages, holding that:

{{cquote|Damages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot under such circumstances, their Lordships think, be considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of things, would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper. ... damages must be the natural and reasonable result of the defendant's act; such a consequence as in the ordinary course of things would flow from that act.}}

The leading authority on nervous shock cases under English law is now ''[[Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police|court=UKHL |division= |year=1991 |num=5 |parallelcite=[1992] 1 AC 310 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a case which draws heavily upon the floodates principle. In limiting the right to recover to those who saw the accident or its immediate aftermath [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Oliver]] held:

{{cquote|It would be inaccurate and hurtful to suggest that grief is made any the less real or deprivation more tolerable by a more gradual realisation, but to extend liability to cover injury in such cases would be to extend the law in a direction for which there is no pressing policy need and in which there is no logical stopping point.}}

==="Worried well" cases===

As an adjunct to the nervous shock cases, the courts have also had to consider claims by persons who are loosely classified as the "worried well", i.e. persons who are not actually ill, but have suffered an exposure and therefore are greatly concerned they may become gravely ill.  These claims often relate to [[asbestos]] exposure, as [[mesothelioma]] can take [[Mesothelioma#Signs and symptoms|20 to 50 years, or longer]], to manifest after an exposure. To date, the courts have appeared unwilling to consider claims from the "worried well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/57144/Healthcare/English+House+Of+Lords+Slams+Door+On+Worried+Well+Claims |title=English House Of Lords Slams Door On "Worried Well" Claims |publisher=Mondaq |date=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pure economic loss cases==

[[Pure economic loss in English Law|Pure economic loss]] cases have also felt the strong influence of the concerns of the courts in relation to the floodgates principle. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] in the decision of ''[[Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1973] 1 QB 27&lt;/ref&gt; made extensive reference to risks of such claims, and sought to limit economic loss to claims which are proximate to physical damage.

==Negligent misstatement==

Judicial concern has also been expressed about potential liability for negligent misstatements. Unlike physical acts, a negligent statement may be relied upon by a great many people leading to a wide class of potential claims. Accordingly, in ''[[Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1964] AC 465&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords imposed the requirement that there would need to be a "special relationship" in order to justify a duty of care under which a person making a negligent statement could be held liable to a person who relied upon it.

==Other cases==

In ''[[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1989] AC 53&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords had to consider a claim by Jacqueline Hill, the last victim of [[Peter Sutcliffe]] (a serial killer known as the "Yorkshire Ripper"), against the police. The case argued that police had been sloppy and careless in their investigation, and if they had not been so the killer would have caught long before he murdered his last few victims. The claim was struck out on a number of grounds, one of which was the risk that every victim of crime might have an action against the police arguing that they should have caught the perpetrators at an earlier stage of their criminal careers.

The decision was upheld in ''[[Kent v Griffiths]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 2 All ER 474&lt;/ref&gt; and rationalised on a different basis, viz., that the emergency services to do not owe general duties to the public on grounds of public policy.
 
However, by contrast in ''[[Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office|court=UKHL |division= |year=1970 |num=2 |parallelcite= [1970] AC 1004 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords were fully prepared to hold the Home Office responsible for the acts of young offenders whom it failed to supervise, and who subsequently caused damage to the property of various members of the general public.

==Examples of opening the floodgates==

The floodgates principle is by no means a principle of universal application.

The courts have, on occasion, been prepared to uphold claims notwithstanding that they recognise that the effect of a decision will most likely result in a large amount of subsequent litigation. In the case of ''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 2 AC 1&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] upheld a claim that [[interest rate swaps]] entered into with local authorities in the United Kingdom were [[void (law)|void]] although they knew that large numbers of such contracts had been entered into, and that [[Local authorities swaps litigation|unwinding the swaps would result in a large amount of litigation]]. In the event, over 200 separate sets of legal proceedings were launched,&lt;ref name=Hirst&gt;In his judgment in ''[http://www.ucc.ie/law/restitution/archive/englcases/interest.htm Re Interest Rate Swap Litigation]'' (unreported, 28 November 1991) [[David Hirst (judge)|Hirst J]] recorded that "As at 30th October, 1991 there were 203 extant swap actions, 18 had been settled after the issue of proceedings, 2 had been discontinued and 4 are in progress in the Chancery Division. Although in the vast majority of cases the banks are plaintiffs, there are 10 actions involving 8 local authorities in which a local authority is plaintiff because they are net losers under their swap transactions. The number of plaintiff banks in these actions totals in all 42 and the number of local authority defendants 62. These figures may need up-dating, but give a substantially accurate picture."&lt;/ref&gt; several of which were litigated to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and three of which reached the House of Lords.

A '''gift shop''' or '''souvenir gift shop''' is a store primarily selling [[souvenir]]s relating to a particular topic or theme. The items sold often include [[mug|coffee mug]]s, [[stuffed animal]]s, [[t-shirt]]s, [[postcard]]s, handmade collections and other souvenirs.
Gift shops are normally found in areas visited by many [[tourist]]s. [[Hotels]] and [[motels]] in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] often feature a gift shop near their entrance. Venues such as [[zoo]]s, [[aquarium]]s, [[national park]]s, [[theme park]]s, and [[museum]]s have their own gift shops; in some cases these shops sell items of higher value than gift shops not associated with a venue, as well as trinkets. These stores are sometimes a source of financial support for educational institutions.

== Definition ==
{{main|Gift}}
A gift shop can be defined as a shop which has the primary purpose of selling items that will be given to others for no material gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Gift shop|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gift%20shop|publisher=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainstream gift shop businesses==
There are many 'mainstream' shop businesses that target gift-buyers as their primary customer base. These retailers can vary in size from small independent [[boutiques]], to [[chain stores]], to large [[department stores]]. Each will have different business strategies and will typically sell various product ranges that appeal to different customer groups, with gender, age, celebration or personal interest differentiation.
 
Many shops that are not primarily gift shops become gift shops during typical gift-giving periods such as [[Christmas]] and [[Valentine's Day]], offering ranges of gift products for a limited time period in the build-up to these celebrations.

==Online gift shops==
Online gift shops are websites which have the primary objective of selling products online that will be given to others. These [[online retailers]] may or may not be associated to a physical shop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12714">'''Green Dot Bystander Intervention''' is a [[bystander education]] approach that aims to prevent violence with the help of bystanders. It is built on the premise that violence can be measurably and systematically reduced within a community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bystander intervention as a way of [[violence]] prevention programs are becoming popular within society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its mission is to reduce [[Violence against women|power based-violence]] by being a proactive bystander and a reactive bystander.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;"Title IX."

Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program was founded by Dr. Dorothy Edwards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The program trains people about [[sexual assault]] and [[domestic violence]] on college campuses, primary and secondary schools, and communities. It develops and offers training for sexual assault and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The method teaches students to intervene by using the 3 D's: Direct, Delegating the responsibility to others, and creating a Distraction to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As described by Green Dot an example of this is in a situation at a party, intervening could mean that instead of calling out an inebriated student, an individual can create a distraction by "accidentally" spilling their drink on a potential aggressor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dr. Dorothy Edwards is the founder of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program. Prior to creating the program Dorothy Edwards worked as the [[University of Kentucky student life|University of Kentucky's]] Violence Intervention and Prevention Director where she discovered that individuals were not sure how to respond when witnessing a potential [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In her first year of running the program she trained 10 individuals, but by the time she left the [[University of Kentucky]] she was training 3,500 students and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The initiative led by Dr. Edwards was supported by a new focus on [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault|bystanders in The White House]]. Green Dot, Bringing in the Bystander, and [[Futures Without Violence|Coaching Boys Into Men]] are preventative bystander programs that have begun to make cultural changes.

=== Title IX ===
[[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972|1972 Education Amendment]] is a tool meant to combat campus violence.

=== Sexual assault in education ===
[[Sexual violence]] in schools and on campuses is a pressing civil rights issue.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; According to the National Women's Law Center students who suffer from [[sexual assault]] and [[harassment]] are deprived the liberty of equal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A majority of sexual assaults involving college students also involve drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  A female or male who is incapacitated due to drugs and alcohol is legally incapable of giving consent and someone who has sex with an incapacitated person can be prosecuted for [[rape]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Training  ==
Green Dot develops programs, strategies, curriculum, and training courses designed to address power-based personal violence across environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Training strategies include: strategic planning, bystander mobilization, communication, and [[Coalition|coalition building]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;"Green Dot Faculty &amp; Staff Toolkit." ''University of Portland''. Office on Violence Against Women.

''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot bystander program uses four training modules to educate bystanders on their impact. 
# The first module provides bystanders with an overview of the strategy, where key definitions and strategies are discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"An Overview of the Green Dot Strategy." ''California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA)''. California Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Web. http://www.calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Curriculum-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# The second module  reviews the observable behaviors associated with the major forms of power-based violence and educates about how to recognize potential dangerous or harmful situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# Module three educates bystanders on obstacles within themselves that stop them from intervening. 
#* There are three major categories of influence it uses:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
#** The categories are personal, relationship, and general issues, which impact the way in which individuals intervene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Personal characteristics may include being shy, fearful, or uncertain and not wanting to risk embarrassment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Relationship characteristics involve not wanting to upset friends or a party policer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; General issues include the belief that someone else will intervene, the risk of embarrassment, or creating a scene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Module four focuses on building skills and generating confidence in the performance of the program. 
#* There are two types of Green Dots: proactive and reactive. The goal of proactive Green Dots is to set the two norms that are communicated: violence will not be tolerated and everyone is expected to do his or her part to contribute to fostering a safe community. Reactive Green Dots are done in reaction to seeing concerning behavior or potential dangers, either to stop them from happening or decrease the likelihood they will get worse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The heart of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program are the 3 D's: direct,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; distract,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and delegate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Direct interaction with the potential perpetrator or victim can be used to address concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Through Distraction a [[wikt:bystander|bystander]] can create a diversion to diffuse the potentially problematic  situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Lastly, through delegation a bystander can ask for someone else to help intervene in the situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The 3 D's work in situations of high risk to act as reactive Green Dots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Examples of proactive Green Dots are creating social media campaigns, checking-in with friends, promoting awareness, and hosting green dot sports games.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Examples of reactive Green Dots include: ''directly'' confronting a situation, ''distracting'' by changing the conversation and the energy of the interaction or by distracting the individuals, or ''delegating'' by finding someone who will be more successful in fixing the problem (bar tender, other friends, police offer, etc.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Case studies ===

Ann Coker at the [[University of Kentucky|University of Kentucky's Center for Research on Violence Against Women]] (CRVAW) led a study pertaining to the effectiveness at Green Dots' reduction of sexual violence. In the study, CRVAW found a greater than 50% reduction in the self-reported frequency of [[Sexual violence|sexual violence perpetration]] by students at schools that received Green Dot training.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hautala, Keith. "'Green Dot' Effective at Reducing Sexual Violence." ''University of Kentucky News: UKNOW''. College of Arts and Sciences, 10 Sept. 2014. Web. http://uknow.uky.edu/content/green-dot-effective-reducing-sexual-violence&lt;/ref&gt; The CRVAW study also found a 40% reduction in self-reported frequency of total violence perpetration including [[sexual violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[stalking]], and [[dating violence]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Ann Coker, and the CRVAW team identify violence prevention as a public health priority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A recent study of 2,504 college undergraduate students between 18 and 24 looked at the impact of bystander intervention on college campuses. The study found that 46% of the students surveyed had heard a Green Dot speech on their college campus. Out of the sample size surveyed, only 14% had received active bystander training in the past two years. Students trained in Green Dot bystander intervention reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self-reported active bystander behaviors compared to non-trained students. Those receiving bystander intervention training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than non-exposed students.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, A. L., P. G. Cook-Craig, C. M. Williams, B. S. Fisher, E. R. Clear, L. S. Garcia, and L. M. Hegge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1375">In [[continuum mechanics]], and in particular in [[finite element analysis]], the '''Hu-Washizu principle''' is a [[variational principle]] which says that the action

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18902">'''International Archives for the Women's Movement''' ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}) was founded in Amsterdam in 1935, as a repository to collect and preserve the cultural heritage of women and make the documents of the movement available for study. The entire [[archive|collection]] was stolen by the Nazis in 1940 and only small portions were recovered after the war. In 1988, the part of the archival collection which had not been [[Nazi plunder|looted by the Nazis]] became the foundational collection of the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement. A substantial portion of the archive was discovered in Moscow in 1992 and returned to Amsterdam in 2003. In 2013, the institution which houses the collection was renamed as the [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history|Atria Institute on Gender Equality and Women's History]]

==History==
[[File:RosaManus.jpg|thumb|Rosa Manus]]
The International Archives for the Women's Movement was founded in 1935 by three Dutch feminists, [[Rosa Manus]], [[Johanna Naber]] and [[Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]].{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} Manus was a conference organizer for the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA), a secretary of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) and was involved with many of the leading feminists of her day, including [[Aletta Jacobs]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]. When Jacobs died in 1929, her books and papers were bequeathed to Manus.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=150-151}} Naber was one of the founders of the IWSA and a historian dedicated to writing about the history of the women's movement, including writing biographies of prominent women. As a member of the [[Dutch Women's Council|National Dutch Women's Council]] {{lang-nl|Nationale Vrouwenraad van Nederland (NVN)}}, Naber had begun to collect publications on feminism and create an archive for the NVN and by 1921, had urged creation of a resource for other women to study.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=149}} Posthumus-van der Goot was an economist and after she attended a 1934 conference arranged by the Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship (DAWIEC) to study government policies on paid employment for women, she realized that there was inadequate information on the history of women working.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=151}}

The three women's different skill-sets and ages, which constituted three-generations of the Dutch women's movement, combined to persuade the founders of the newly established [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISH) (which included Posthumus-van der Goot's husband) to give them two rooms in their building at [[Keizersgracht]] 264 for their project. On 3 December 1935, the International Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}) was founded with Manus as president and Posthumus-van der Goot as the secretary.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=152}} Within a year, the official opening of the IAV was held and by 1937 they had established a multi-lingual Yearbook to confirm the international nature of collecting and studying documents about women. The international advisory board, included such members as [[Margery Corbett Ashby]], British feminist and IWSA president from 1926-1946; [[Cécile Brunschvicg]], French feminist, [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) member and IWSA delegate; [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], American founder of the IWSA; [[Dorothy Heneker]], Canadian feminist, lawyer and Secretary of the Women's International Organizations' Peace and Disarmament Committee; [[Bertha Lutz]], Brazilian feminist and IWSA board member; [[Marthe de Kerchove de Denterghem|Baroness Marthe Boël]], Belgian feminist and president of ICW between 1936 and 1947; and [[Elsie Zimmern]], British feminist and ICW general secretary from 1925.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=153}}[[File:Johanna Naber omstreeks 1898 8105.tif|thumb|Johanna Naber]]

The women corresponded with women's groups in English, French and German, encouraging them to forward articles, books, brochures, periodicals and the like for inclusion in the archive. They also had reciprocity agreements with other women's facilities, like the [[Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand]] in [[Paris]] and [[Fawcett library|The Fawcett Library]] of [[London]].{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=154-155}} By the end of the 1930s, the archive contained approximately 4500 books and brochures, as well as a collection of around 150 periodicals from twenty countries. Most of these journals were contemporary publications, though there was a complete collection of the ''Tribunes des femmes'' from 1833. Several [[first edition]] books were part of the archive, including ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest'' (1694) by [[Mary Astell]] and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. There were original documents by [[Jane Austen]] and a manuscript copy of {{ill|Cécile de Jong van Beek en Donk|nl}}'s novel, ''Hilda van Suylenburg'' (1897).{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=156}}

==Nazi intervention==
[[File:WillemijnPosthumusvanderGoot.jpg|thumb|Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] the situation in Europe curtailed the sharing of items from the archive. The uncertainty also propelled Manus to merge her private library and documents into the IAV holdings for safety. This proved to be a costly miscalculation, as when the [[Netherlands in World War II|Nazis invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940, the archive became a target. By June, German officials had inspected IAV twice and on 12 July 1940 the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]] confiscated forty boxes of materials, as well as the furnishings and fixtures. The only item which was not taken was the safe, which contained money, other valuables and some of Jacob's papers.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=156}} The reasons the documents were taken has been obscured. The Germans claimed that the Berlin women's movement wanted them, which the German women later denied, though [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], head of the [[National Socialist Women's League]] did admit to having received around 500 books from IAV in 1942.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=157}} [[Francisca de Haan]] a professor of [[gender studies]] at [[Budapest]]'s [[Central European University]],{{sfn|Polak|2010}} believes that the actual reason the archives were taken had more to do with the facts that Manus, the president was [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish]], both an international feminist and [[pacifist]], and suspected of [[Communist]] leanings because of her left-leaning views and activities;{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=157-158}}{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}} Manus would later be executed at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] in 1943.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}}

The confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin,{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=31}} and then later were moved to [[Sudetenland]] for security reasons. At the end of the war, the [[Red Army]] took the documents from [[Prague Offensive|German-occupied Czechoslovakia]]{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=41}} and in 1945-46, stored them in the [[KGB]]'s {{ill|Osobyi Archive|de|Sonderarchiv Moskau}} ({{lang-ru|Особый архив}}), meaning special archive, which was housed in [[Moscow]].{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}} In 1947, Posthumus-van der Goot, the only one of the founders who survived the war, became president of the IAV and reopened the archive.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}} She immediately began making inquiries as to what had happened to their stolen collection, following the lead that women's groups in Berlin had wanted them. {{ill|Gerda Walther|de}}, a German philosopher living in [[Munich]] wrote her that it was unlikely that any German women, except possibly Scholtz-Klink had any interest in obtaining the materials.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=157}} In 1947, Dirk Graswinckel, a member of the committee to recover and repatriate [[Nazi plunder]], returned a few boxes, representing about 1/10th of IAV's pre-war holdings. Then in 1966, a librarian from [[Hradec Králové]], [[Czechoslovakia]] found four books stamped by the IAV and returned them.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}}{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}} In the 1960s, the organization filed for reparations under the [[Wiedergutmachung]] program and assumed its remaining holdings were lost.{{sfn|Mevis|2012}}

==Second-wave feminism rejuvenation==
The period of actively acquiring materials ceased effectively in 1939 and through the 1970s no efforts were made to expand the collection beyond what had been retrieved, unless an individual or organization donated materials.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}} Though some minor works were published in the 1950s and 1960s by IAV, and they moved several times, little effort was made to reach those beyond Posthumus-van der Goot's circle.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=159-160}} In the 1970s during the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave of feminism]] institutions and organizations began to flourish again. Women's history groups at several Dutch universities began seeking out records on women and re-discovered IAV.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}}{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}} Growing interest in preserving women's records and specifically evaluating the history of ordinary women, led to the decision to begin acquiring documents again in the early 1980s, with the specific focus of obtaining journals, letters and diaries from working class women, instead of just women's movement elites.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}} The Dutch government began to subsidize the collection efforts, causing the archive to exponentially expand.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}

Wanting better access to the materials, the first professional [[inventory]] was completed in 1980{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}} and the following year, having outgrown their space, IAV moved to Keizersgracht 10 in Amsterdam, sharing offices with three other women's organizations: the Documentation Centre for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Informatie en Documentatie Centrum (IDC)}}), the journal ''Lover'', and the Foundation of Women in the Visual Arts ({{lang-nl|Stichting Vrouwen in de Beeldende Kunst (SVBK)}}). In 1988, the IAV, IDC and ''Lover'' organizations were merged to form the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Informatiecentrum en Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IIAV)}}) with the IAV archival collection underpinning the new institution's holdings.{{sfn|Mevis|2012}}

==Subsequent recoveries==
In 1992, a report which appeared in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', a major Dutch newspaper, written by historian Marc Jansen, noted that some of IAV's materials had been located in Russia. He reported that the Russians were willing to return more than thirty collections, including those of the IAV.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|Bosch|2003|p=2}} Almost immediately the state archivists of both countries met in Moscow and signed an agreement to return the twenty-five boxes of IAV's documents found in Russia, but there were delays{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} because the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian Parliament]] refused to ratify the agreement. In 1993, Heleen Massee of the photograph division of IIAV was allowed to go to Moscow and take notes on the content of six boxes.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}

In the spirit of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] policy reforms, historian Mineke Bosch and a colleague, Myriam Everard, went to Moscow in 1994 to try to discover what records were held in the Osobyi Archive. Bosch discovered a leather bound volume of newspaper clippings, photographs and translations which had been prepared by Hungarian women for a visit by Carrie Chapman Catt and Aletta Jacobs, following the [[Third Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|1906 Copenhagen Conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]]. The Hungarians had invited Catt to visit in October, and advised her to bring a German-speaking companion, who was not German to assist her. To commemorate the visit, [[Rosika Schwimmer]] had helped them bind the volume marked with the inscription "1906 October 12–14". Upon finding the booklet, Bosch brought it to Everard and they approached the director and asked if they could return it to Amsterdam. Though sympathetic, the director denied their request, claiming that all items had to be counted before they could be returned.{{sfn|Bosch|2003|pp=1-3}}

Bosch and Everard spent four days in Moscow and inventoried 203 dossiers containing 28,051 documents,{{sfn|Bosch|2003|p=3}}{{sfn|Everard|Bosch|1994|p=194}} discovering hundreds of pictures dated to the 1890s. They found a large portion of Manus' documents but also noted that the collection did not represent the entirety of the stolen artifacts,{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=161}} as most of the 150 periodicals and all of the 4,500 books of the pre-war IAV were absent.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=162}} When the delays caused concern that the IAV archives might not be returned quickly, the International Institute for Social History microfilmed 14 reels of 33,663 individual images, making the documents accessible once again.{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} Though officials continued to press for the return of the documents bureaucracy delayed any action until an announced 2001 visit by [[Queen Beatrix]] to Russia. Finally in January 2002, twenty-two boxes of materials were returned to the Netherlands. Nine boxes, including some of the IAV records were retained because they had not been properly processed. In March 2003, the final nine boxes were sent, and rejoined the archival collection in May.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=161}}

In December 2015, nine books, including ''Beroepsarbeid der gehuwde vrouw'' (Occupational work of the married woman, 1921) by Betsy Bakker-Nort were returned from the [[Berlin Central and Regional Library]], bearing the stamp of IAV or Rosa Manus.{{sfn|Atria|2015}}

In [[knowledge representation]], [[object-oriented programming]] and [[Object-oriented design|design]] (see [[object-oriented]] [[program architecture]]), '''is-a''' ('''is_a''' or '''is a''') is a [[wikt:subsume|subsumption]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Liskov substitution principle]].&lt;/ref&gt; relationship between [[abstractions]] (e.g. [[type (disambiguation)|types]], [[class (disambiguation)|classes]]), wherein one [[Class (computer programming)|class]] ''A'' is a [[subclass (disambiguation)|subclass]] &lt;!-- This deliberately links to the disambiguation page --&gt; of another class ''B'' (and so ''B'' is a [[superclass (disambiguation)|superclass]] &lt;!--This deliberately links to the disambiguation page--&gt; of ''A'').
In other words, type A is a subtype of type B when A’s [[Formal specification|specification]] implies B’s specification. That is, any object (or class) that satisfies A’s specification also satisfies B’s specification, because B’s specification is weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subtypes and Subclasses|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-170-laboratory-in-software-engineering-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lec14.pdf|publisher=MIT OCW|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''is-a'' relationship is to be contrasted with the ''[[has-a]]'' (''has_a'' or ''has a'') relationship between types (classes); confusing the relations ''has-a'' and ''is-a'' is a common error when designing a model (e.g., a [[computer program]]) of the real-world relationship between an object and its subordinate. The ''is-a'' relationship may also be contrasted with the ''[[Typeof|instance-of]]'' relationship between objects (instances) and types (classes): see "[[type-token distinction]]" and "[[type-token relations]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Type–token relations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarize the relations, we have

* [[hyperonym]]–[[hyponym]] (supertype–subtype) relations between types (classes) defining a taxonomic hierarchy, where
** for a [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|subsumption]] relation: a hyponym (subtype, subclass) has a ''type-of'' (''is-a'') relationship with its hyperonym (supertype, superclass);
* [[holonym]]–[[meronym]] (whole/entity/container-part/constituent/member) relations between types (classes) defining a possessive hierarchy, where
** for an [[Aggregation (object-oriented programming)|aggregation]] (i.e. without ownership) relation:
*** a holonym (whole) has a ''has-a'' relationship with its meronym (part),
** for a [[Composition (object-oriented programming)|composition]] (i.e. with ownership) relation:
*** a meronym (constituent) has a ''[[part-of]]'' relationship with its holonym (entity),
** for a [[Object composition#Containment|containment]]&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Containment (computer programming)]].&lt;/ref&gt; relation:
*** a meronym (member) has a ''[[member-of]]'' relationship with its holonym ([[Container (abstract data type)|container]]);
* concept-object (type-token) relations between types (classes) and objects (instances), where
** a token (object) has an ''[[Instance (computer science)|instance-of]]'' relationship with its type (class).

==Examples of subtyping==

[[Subtype polymorphism|Subtyping]] enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction. Subtyping is said to establish an '''is-a''' relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support. The relationship can be expressed explicitly via inheritance in languages that support inheritance as a subtyping mechanism.

===C++===
The following C++ code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes '''B''' and '''A''', where '''B''' is both a subclass and a subtype of '''A''', and can be used as an '''A''' wherever a '''B''' is specified (via a reference, a pointer or the object itself).

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;class A
{ public:
   void DoSomethingALike() const {}
};

class B : public A
{ public:
   void DoSomethingBLike() const {}
};

void UseAnA(A const&amp; some_A)
{
   some_A.DoSomethingALike();
}

void SomeFunc()
{
   B b;
   UseAnA(b); // b can be substituted for an A.
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell2002"&gt;
{{cite book

 | location=Cambridge, UK
 | isbn=0-521-78098-5
 | page=287
 | chapter=10 "Concepts in object-oriented languages"}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Python===
The following python code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes '''B''' and '''A''', where '''B''' is both a subclass and a subtype of '''A''', and can be used as an '''A''' wherever a '''B''' is required.

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;class A:
    def doSomethingALike(self):
        pass

class B(A):
    def doSomethingBLike(self):
        pass

def useAnA(some_A):
    some_A.doSomethingALike()

def someFunc():
    b = B()
    useAnA(b)  # b can be substituted for an A.
&lt;/source&gt;

The following example, type(a) is a "regular" type, and type(type(a)) is a metatype. While as distributed all types have the same metatype (PyType_Type, which is also its own metatype), this is not a requirement. The type of classic classes, known as types.ClassType, can also be considered a distinct metatype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guido van Rossum|title=Subtyping Built-in Types|url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0253/|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type(a))
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type(type(a)))
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type(type(type(a))))
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===

In Java, '''is-a''' relation between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and [[Interface (Java)|implements]] clauses.

Using the Collections classes, ArrayList&lt;E&gt; implements List&lt;E&gt;, and List&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt;. So ArrayList&lt;String&gt; is a subtype of List&lt;String&gt;, which is a subtype of Collection&lt;String&gt;. The subtyping relationship is preserved between the types automatically. When we define an interface, PayloadList, that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element. Its declaration might look like:

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
interface PayloadList&lt;E, P&gt; extends List&lt;E&gt; {
    void setPayload(int index, P val);
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List&lt;String&gt;:

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, String&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, Integer&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, Exception&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Liskov substitution principle==
{{main|Liskov substitution principle}}
Liskov substitution principle explains a property, ''"If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T,"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liskov|first=Barbara|title=Data Abstraction and Hierarchy|date=May 1988|publisher=SIGPLAN Notices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following example shows a violation of LSP.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;void DrawShape(const Shape&amp; s)
{
  if (typeid(s) == typeid(Square))
    DrawSquare(static_cast&lt;Square&amp;&gt;(s));
  else if (typeid(s) == typeid(Circle))
    DrawCircle(static_cast&lt;Circle&amp;&gt;(s));
}&lt;/source&gt;
Obviously, the DrawShape function is badly formatted. It has to know about every derivative classes of Shape class. Also, it should be changed whenever new subclass of Shape are created. In [[object-oriented design]], many{{who|date=April 2017}} view the structure of this as anathema.

Here is a more subtle example of violation of LSP:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Rectangle
{
  public:
    void   SetWidth(double w)  { itsWidth = w; }
    void   SetHeight(double h) { itsHeight = h; }
    double GetHeight() const   { return itsHeight; }
    double GetWidth() const    { return itsWidth; }
  private:
    double itsWidth;
    double itsHeight;
};
&lt;/source&gt;
This works well but when it comes to Square class, which inherits Rectangle class, it violates LSP even though the '''is-a''' relationship holds between Rectangle and Square. Because square is rectangular. The following example overrides two functions, Setwidth and SetHeight, to fix the problem. But fixing the code implies that the design is faulty.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
public class Square : Rectangle
{
  public:
    virtual void SetWidth(double w);
    virtual void SetHeight(double h);
};
void Square::SetWidth(double w)
{
    Rectangle::SetWidth(w);
    Rectangle::SetHeight(w);
}
void Square::SetHeight(double h)
{
    Rectangle::SetHeight(h);
    Rectangle::SetWidth(h);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The following example, function g just works for Rectangle class but not for Square, and so the open-closed principle has been violated.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void g(Rectangle&amp; r)
{
  r.SetWidth(5);
  r.SetHeight(4);
  assert(r.GetWidth() * r.GetHeight()) == 20);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''John chapter 18, verse 38''' of the [[Gospel of John]], is often referred to as "jesting [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]" or "''What is truth?''", of [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Quid est veritas?'' In it, [[Pontius Pilate]] questions [[Jesus]]' claim that he is "witness to the truth" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:37|John 18:37]]).&lt;ref name=W303 &gt;''The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete New Testament'' by Warren W. Wiersbe 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7814-4539-9}} page 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Augustine &gt;''Ask Augustine'' by Paul A. Tambrino 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-894-1}} pages 192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this statement, Pilate proclaims to the masses (lit., "the Jews" referring to the Jewish authorities&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.org/netbible/joh18_notes.htm#18109 NET Bible notes on John 18:38] '''Textual note:''' Or “the Jewish authorities”; Grk “the Jews.” Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders, especially members of the Sanhedrin. See the note on the phrase “Jewish leaders” in v. 12. The term also occurs in v. 31, where it is clear the Jewish leaders are in view, because they state that they cannot legally carry out an execution. Although it is likely (in view of the synoptic parallels) that the crowd here in 18:38 was made up not just of the Jewish leaders, but of ordinary residents of Jerusalem and pilgrims who were in Jerusalem for the Passover, nevertheless in John’s Gospel Pilate is primarily in dialogue with the leadership of the nation, who are expressly mentioned in 18:35 and 19:6.&lt;/ref&gt;) that he does not consider Jesus guilty of any crime.

==Analysis==
[[File:P52 verso.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]], an ancient papyrus inscribed with John 18:37-38]]
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Nikolai Ge]] "[[Jesus|Christ]] and [[Pontius Pilate|Pilatus]]" (What is truth?), 1890.]]

The exact intention of Pilate has been subject to debate among scholars, with no firm conclusion.&lt;ref name=W303 /&gt; His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have actually intended to reflect on the philosophical position that [[truth]] is hard to ascertain.&lt;ref name=W303 /&gt; The Greek word rendered as "truth" in English translations is "[[aletheia]]", which literally means "unconcealed" and connotes sincerity in addition to factuality and reality. 

This verse reflects the Christian tradition of the "guiltlessness of Jesus" in [[Pilate's Court]].&lt;ref name=Harrington488 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington 1998 {{ISBN|0-8146-5806-7}} pages 488-489 &lt;/ref&gt; The innocence of Jesus is important in the Gospel of John, given that it emphasizes Jesus as the [[Lamb of God]].

Note that Jesus, although he does not respond to Pilate's question (perhaps because Pilate "went out again" before giving him a chance to) knows the answer. During his prayer in [[Gethsemane]], Jesus tells [[God the Father|God]], "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." (John 17:17)

In addition to the guiltlessness of Jesus this verse also reflects the rejection of the truth of God: Jesus, the witness to truth was [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected]], ignored and condemned.&lt;ref name=Harrington488 /&gt;

==Literary references==
This verse has been widely quoted and alluded to in culture and literature, particularly in that of [[philosophy|philosophical]] nature. While Pilate's question -- whether intended philosophically, jestfully, rhetorically, or born of frustration at the lack of a plain answer -- is by no means the only incident of someone questioning the nature of truth, it has been drawn upon many times as a significant occurrence thereof. 

[[Francis Bacon]] uses this musing to open his essay ''Of Truth'', saying that Pilate "would not stay for an answer". He uses this to introduce his theme of truth as an affirmation of [[faith]].{{cn|date=November 2013}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote of the line and extended praise to Pilate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only ''one'' solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor.  To take a Jewish affair ''seriously'' - he cannot persuade himself to do that.  One Jew more or less - what does it matter ?... The noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on has  enriched the New Testament with the only expression ''which'' ''possesses'' ''value'' - which is its criticism, its ''annihilation'' even: 'What is truth?..." (Nietzsche, writing in ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', §46)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mikhail Bulgakov]] fictionally expands on the relationship between Pilate and Jesus in his novel ''[[Master and Margarita]]''. Specific reference to John 18:38 comes in Chapter 2 of the novel entitled "Pontius Pilate", in which he asks the very question "What is truth?" to Jesus ("Jeshua Ha-Notsri" - "Jesus of Nazareth" in Hebrew).

[[J. L. Austin]], the ordinary-language philosopher, in a symposium on truth, comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Pilate was in advance of his time. For 'truth' itself is an abstract noun, a camel, that is, of a logical construction, which cannot get past the eye even of a grammarian. We approach it cap and categories in hand : we ask ourselves whether Truth is a substance (the Truth, the Body of Knowledge), or a quality (something like the colour red, inhering in truths), or a relation ('correspondence'). But philosophers should take something more nearly their own size to strain at. What needs discussing rather is the use, or certain uses, of the word 'true.' In vino, possibly, 'veritas,' but in a sober symposium
'verum.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Austin|first1=John Langshaw|title=Truth|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|date=1950|volume=Supplementary Volume XXIV|url=http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/pdf/austin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his novella (and play) ''Home Truths'', David Lodge lets the writer Adrian Ludlow quote "What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer" when he is interviewed by the journalist Fanny Tarrant, known for her vicious and perhaps not entirely truthful interviews.

'''Just-in-time''' ('''JIT''') '''manufacturing''', also known as '''just-in-time production''' or the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), is a methodology aimed primarily at reducing times within production system as well as response times from suppliers and to customers. Its origin and development was in Japan, largely in the 1960s and 1970s and particularly at Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ohno|first1=Taiichi|title=Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production|date=1988|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-915299-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}{{Disputed inline|The origins of JIT: in the 1960s and 1970s, or in the 1980s as stated by Holweg (2006)?|date=August 2017}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Shingo"&gt;Shingo, Shigeo. 1985.

Alternative terms for JIT manufacturing have been used. [[Motorola]]'s choice was short-cycle manufacturing (SCM).&lt;ref&gt;Heard, Ed. 1987. Short cycle manufacturing: the route to JIT. ''Target''. 2 (3) (fall) 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;High, W. 1987. Short cycle manufacturing (SCM) implementation: an approach taken at Motorola. ''Target'', 3 (4) (Winter), 19–24.&lt;/ref&gt; IBM's was continuous-flow manufacturing (CFM),&lt;ref&gt;Barkman, William E. 1989. ''In-Process Quality Control for Manufacturing''. Boca Raton, Fl.: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, G.H., Jr. 1991. Continuous flow manufacturing. ''Proc. SPIE1496, 10th Annual Symposium on Microlithography''. (March 1, 1991), 239–246.&lt;/ref&gt; and demand-flow manufacturing (DFM), a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Roebuck, Kevin. 2011. ''Business Process Modeling: High-impact Emerging Technology - What You Need to Know: Definitions, Adoptions, Impact, Benefits, Maturity, Vendors''. Tebbo, p 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Still another alternative was mentioned by Goddard, who said that "Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the 'Kanban System'", and pointed out that [[kanban]] is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production.&lt;ref name="Goddard 1986"&gt;Goddard, Walter E. 1986. ''Just-in-Time: Surviving by Breaking Tradition''. Essex Junction, Vt." Oliver Wight Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

But the wide use of the term ''JIT manufacturing'' throughout the 1980s faded fast in the 1990s, as the new term ''lean manufacturing'' became established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Womack|first1=James P.|last2=Jones|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Roos|first3=Daniel|title=The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production|date=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416554523|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=9NHmNCmDUUoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=J.

As with JIT, lean manufacturing is deeply rooted in the automotive industry and focuses mostly on repetitive manufacturing situations."}}&lt;/ref&gt; As just one testament to the commonality of the two terms, ''Toyota production system (TPS)'' has been and is widely used as a synonym for both JIT and lean manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Monden, Yasuhiro, ed. 1986.

==History==
===Evolution in Japan===
The exact reasons for adoption of JIT in Japan are unclear. Plenert offers four reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post-World War II rebuilding of industry: 1) Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. 2) Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. 3) The Japanese islands were (and are) lacking in natural resources with which to build products. 4) Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus the Japanese "leaned out" their processes. "They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased." Plenart goes on to explain Toyota's key role in developing this lean or JIT production methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Plenert, G. 2007.''Reinventing Lean: Introducing Lean Management into the Supply Chain''. Oxford, U.K.: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to the West===
News about JIT/TPS reached western shores in 1977 in two English-language articles: one referred to the methodology as the "Ohno system", after [[Taiichi Ohno]], who was instrumental in its development within Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;Ashburn, A., 1977. Toyota's "famous Ohno system", ''American Machinist'', July, 120–123.&lt;/ref&gt; The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugimori|first1=Y.|last2=Kusunoki|first2=K.|last3=Cho|first3=F.|last4=Uchikawa|first4=S.|title=Toyota Production System and Kanban System: Materialization of Just-in-time and Respect-for-human System|journal=2016 Impact Factor 2.325 International Journal of Production Research|date=1977|volume=15|issue=6|pages=553-564|doi=10.1080/00207547708943149|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207547708943149#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8wMDIwNzU0NzcwODk0MzE0OT9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw|issn=0020-7543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout industry in the United States and other developed countries. A seminal 1980 event was a conference in Detroit at Ford World Headquarters co-sponsored by the Repetitive Manufacturing Group (RMG), which had been founded 1979 within the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) to seek advances in manufacturing. The principle speaker, Fujio Cho (later, president of Toyota Motor Corp.), in explaining the Toyota system, stirred up the audience, and led to the RMG's shifting gears from things like automation to JIT/TPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hall. R.W. 2001. The founding of the Association for Manufacturing Excellence. Unpublished summary of Hall's presentation at a meeting of AME's founders on February 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least some of audience's stirring had to do with a perceived clash between the new JIT regime and [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II), a computer software-based system of manufacturing planning and control which had become prominent in industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Debates in professional meetings on JIT vs. MRP II were followed by published articles, one of them titled, "The Rise and Fall of Just-in-Time".&lt;ref&gt;Landvater, Darryl. 1984. "The rise and fall of just-in-time". ''Infosystems''. November, p 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Less confrontational was Walt Goddard's, "Kanban Versus MRP II—Which Is Best for You?" in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, W. 1982. "Kanban versus MRP II—which is best for you?" ''Modern Materials Handling''. Nov 5, p 40-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Goddard had answered his own question with a book advocating JIT.&lt;ref name="Goddard 1986"/&gt; Among the best known of MRP II's advocates was George Plossl, who authored two articles questioning JIT's kanban planning method&lt;ref&gt;Plossl, G.W. 1981. Japanese productivity: myth vs. reality. ''P&amp;IM Review and APICS News'', September, pp 59–62.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "japanning of America".&lt;ref&gt;Plossl, G.W. 1984. The redirection of U.S. manufacturing. ''P&amp;IM Review and APICS News''. November, pp 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt; But, as with Goddard, Plossl later wrote that "JIT is a concept whose time has come".&lt;ref&gt;Plossl. G.W. 1986. "J.I.T. – fad or fact of life?" ''P&amp;IM Review and APICS News'', February 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

JIT/TPS implementations may be found in many case-study articles from the 1980s and beyond. An article in a 1984 issue of ''Inc''. magazine&lt;ref&gt;Walters, C.R. 1984. Why everybody's talking about "just-in-time." Inc. (March 1) 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; relates how [[Omark Industries]] (chain saws, ammunition, log loaders, etc.) emerged as an extensive JIT implementer under its US home-grown name ZIPS (zero inventory production system). At Omark's mother plant in [[Portland, Oregon]], after the work force had received 40 hours of ZIPS training, they were "turned loose" and things began to happen. A first step was to "arbitrarily eliminate a week's lead time [after which] things ran smoother. 'People asked that we try taking another week's worth out.' After that, ZIPS spread throughout the plant's operations 'like an amoeba.'" The article also notes that Omark's 20 other plants were similarly engaged in ZIPS, beginning with pilot projects. For example, at one of Omark's smaller plants making drill bits in [[Mesabi|Mesabi, Minnesota]], "large-size drill inventory was cut by 92%, productivity increased by 30%, scrap and rework ... dropped 20%, and lead time ... from order to finished product was slashed from three weeks to three days." The ''Inc''. article states that companies using JIT the most extensively include "the Big Four, [[Hewlett-Packard]], Motorola, [[Westinghouse Electric]], [[General Electric]], [[Deere]], and [[Black and Decker]]".

By 1986, a case-study book on JIT in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Sepehri&gt;Sepehri, Mehran. 1986. ''Just-in-Time: Not Just in Japan: Case Studies of American Pioneers in JIT Implementation''. Falls Church, Va.: American Production and Inventory Control Society&lt;/ref&gt; was able to devote a full chapter to ZIPS at Omark, along with two chapters on JIT at several Hewlett-Packard plants, and single chapters for Harley-Davidson, John Deere, IBM-Raleigh, North Carolina, and California-based Apple Computers, a Toyota truck-bed plant, and New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture between Toyota and General Motors.

Two similarly-inclined books emergent in the U.K. in the same years are more international in scope.&lt;ref name="Mortimer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mortimer |first=J. |year=1986 |title=Just-in-Time: An Executive Briefing |location=Kempston, Bedford, UK |publisher=IFS Ltd. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the books, with both conceptual articles and case studies, includes three sections on JIT practices: in Japan (e.g., at Toyota, Mazda, and Tokagawa Electric); in Europe (jmg Bostrom, Lucas Electric, Cummins Engine, IBM, 3M, Datasolve Ltd., Renault, Massey-Ferguson); and in the USA and Australia (Repco Manufacturing-Australia, Xerox Computer, and two on Hewlett-Packard). The second book, reporting on what was billed as the First International Conference on just-in-time manufacturing,&lt;ref name="Ingersoll"&gt;Ingersoll Engineers. 1986. ''Just in Time Manufacturing: Proceedings of the First International Conference''. London, UK. April 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; includes case studies in three companies: Repco-Australia, IBM-UK, and 3M-UK. In addition, a day-2 keynote discussed JIT as applied "across all disciplines, ... from accounting and systems to design and production".&lt;ref name="Ingersoll"/&gt;{{rp|J1–J9}}

===Middle era and to the present===
Three more books which include JIT implementations were published in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Schniederjans, M.J. 1993. ''Topics in Just-in-Time Management''. Needham Heights, Mass.: Allyn &amp; Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; 1995,&lt;ref name=Jasinowski&gt;Jasinowski, Jerry, and Robert Hamrin. 1995. ''Making It in America: Proven Paths to Success from 50 Top Companies''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Kinni, T.B. 1996. ''America's Best Plants: Industry Week's Guide to World-Class Manufacturing Plants''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; which are start-up years of the lean manufacturing/lean management movement that was launched in 1990 with publication of the book, ''The Machine That Changed the World''.&lt;ref name="Womack_Jones_Roos"&gt;Womack, James P., Jones, Daniel T., and Roos, Daniel. 1990. ''The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production''. New York: Rawson Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; That one, along with other books, articles, and case studies on lean, were supplanting JIT terminology in the 1990s and beyond. The same period, saw the rise of books and articles with similar concepts and methodologies but with alternative names, including ''cycle time management'',&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, P.R. 1991. ''Getting Competitive: Middle Managers and the Cycle Time Ethic''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; ''time-based competition'',&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Blackburn, Joseph T. 1991. ''Time-based Competition: The Next Battleground in American Manufacturing''. Homewood, Ill.; Business One  Irwin, p 28.&lt;/ref&gt; ''quick-response manufacturing'',&lt;ref&gt;Suri, R. 1998. Quick Response Manufacturing: A Companywide Approach to Reducing Lead Times. Portland, Ore.: Productivity Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  flow,&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki. and Makota Furuya. 2006. JIT Is Flow: ''Practice and Principles of Lean Manufacturing''. Vancouver, Wash.: PCS Press,&lt;/ref&gt; and ''pull-based production systems''.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersen, Jan-Arne. 2010. "Pull Based Production Systems: Performance, Modeling and Analysis," doctoral thesis. Lulea, Sweden: Lulea University of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more to JIT than its usual manufacturing-centered explication. Inasmuch as manufacturing ends with order-fulfillment to distributors, retailers, and end users, and also includes remanufacturing, repair, and warranty claims, JIT's concepts and methods have application downstream from manufacturing itself. A 1993 book on "world-class distribution logistics" discusses kanban links from factories onward.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, R.L. 1993. ''Reinventing the Warehouse: World Class Distribution Logistics.'' New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; And a manufacturer-to-retailer model developed in the U.S. in the 1980s, referred to as ''quick response'',&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, B., R. King, and A. Hunter. 1999. Quick Response – Managing the Supply Chain to Meet Consumer Demand. Chichester, UK: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; has morphed over time to what is called ''fast fashion''.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, T. 2001. "From analogue to digital supply chains: Implications for fashion marketing ," in ''Fashion Marketing: Contemporary Issues''. eds, T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 26–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hines, T. 2004. Supply Chain Strategies: Customer Driven and Customer Focused. Oxford, UK: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Sepheri provides a list of methodologies of JIT manufacturing that "are important but not exhaustive":&lt;ref&gt;Sepheri, M., p. 277.{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Housekeeping – physical organization and discipline.
* Make it right the first time – elimination of defects.
* Setup reduction – flexible changeover approaches.
* Lot sizes of one – the ultimate lot size and flexibility.
* Uniform plant load – leveling as a control mechanism.
* Balanced flow – organizing flow scheduling throughput.
* Skill diversification – multi-functional workers.
* Control by visibility – communication media for activity.
* Preventive maintenance – flawless running, no defects.
* Fitness for use – producibility, design for process.
* Compact plant layout – product-oriented design.
* Streamlining movements – smoothing materials handling.
* Supplier networks – extensions of the factory.
* Worker involvement – small group improvement activities.
* Cellular manufacturing – production methods for flow.
* Pull system – signal [kanban] replenishment/resupply systems.

==Objectives and benefits==
Objectives and benefits of JIT manufacturing may be stated in two primary ways: first, in specific and quantitative terms, via published case studies; second, general listings and discussion.

A case-study summary from Daman Products in 1999 lists the following benefits: reduced cycle times 97%, setup times 50%, lead times from 4 to 8 weeks to 5 to 10 days, flow distance 90% – achieved via four focused (cellular) factories, pull scheduling, kanban, visual management, and employee empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Grahovec, D. and Bernie Ducan, Jerry Stevenson, Colin Noone. 1999. How lean focused factories enabled Daman to regain responsiveness and become more agile. ''Target''. 4th quarter, pp 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from NCR (Dundee Scotland) in 1998, a producer of make-to-order automated teller machines, includes some of the same benefits while also focusing on JIT purchasing: In switching to JIT over a weekend in 1998, eliminated buffer inventories, reducing inventory from 47 days to 5 days, flow time from 15 days to 2 days, with 60% of purchased parts arriving JIT and 77% going dock to line, and suppliers reduced from 480 to 165.&lt;ref&gt;Caulkin, Simon. 1990. Britain's best factories. ''Management Today''. November 60–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewlett-Packard, one of western industry's earliest JIT implementers, provides a set of four case studies from four H-P divisions during the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Alex. Effective just-in-time manufacture at Hewlett-Packard. In {{harvp|Mortimer|1986|pp=123–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The four divisions, Greeley, Fort Collins, Computer Systems, and Vancouver, employed some but not all of the same measures. At the time about half of H-P's 52 divisions had adopted JIT.

== Potential risks ==
According to Williams, it becomes necessary to find suppliers that are close by or can supply materials quickly with limited advance notice. When ordering small quantities of materials, suppliers’ minimum order policies may pose a problem, though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=John T.|title=Pros &amp; Cons of the JIT Inventory System|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-jit-inventory-system-3195.html|publisher=Houston Chronicle|quote=Supply-chain relationships require retooling that involves multiple suppliers, closer locations, or companies that can supply materials with little advance notice. Companies ordering smaller amounts of goods may encounter difficulty meeting minimum orders, requiring a different contract or a way to break up a large order over time or among several smaller manufacturers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees are at risk of [[precarious work]] when employed by factories that utilize just-in-time and flexible production techniques. A longitudinal study of US workers since 1970 indicates employers seeking to easily adjust their&amp;nbsp;workforce in response to supply and demand&amp;nbsp;conditions respond by creating more nonstandard work arrangements, such as contracting and temporary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L.|first=Kalleberg, A.|title=Precarious Work, Insecure Workers: Employment Relations in Transition|url=https://www.academia.edu/2673815/Precarious_work_insecure_workers_employment_relations_in_transition|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=74|issn=0003-1224|doi=10.1177/000312240907400101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">[[Image:KeynesianCross 3.png|thumb|250px|Keynesian cross diagram]]
The '''Keynesian cross diagram''' demonstrates the relationship between [[aggregate demand]] (shown on the vertical axis) and [[real GDP]] (shown on the horizontal axis, measured by output).

In the Keynesian cross diagram (or ''45-degree line diagram''), a ''desired total spending'' (or ''aggregate expenditure'', or "[[aggregate demand]]") curve (shown in blue) is drawn as a rising line since consumers will have a larger demand with a rise in [[disposable income]], which increases with total [[national output]]. This increase is due to the positive relationship between [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and consumers' disposable income in the [[consumption function]]. Aggregate demand may also rise due to increases in investment (due to the [[accelerator effect]]), while this rise is reduced if imports and tax revenues rise with income. Equilibrium in this diagram occurs where total demand, ''AD'', equals the total amount of national output, ''Y'', (which corresponds to total national income or production). Here, total demand equals [[Aggregate supply|total supply]]. 

In the diagram, the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] level of output and demand is determined where this desired spending curve intersects a [[identity line|line that represents the equality]] of total income and output (''AD=Y''). The intersection gives the equilibrium output, ''Y'''.

The movement toward equilibrium is mostly via changes in inventories inducing changes in production and income. If current output exceeds the equilibrium, inventories accumulate, encouraging businesses to cut back on production, moving the economy toward equilibrium. Similarly, if the level of production is below the equilibrium, then inventories run down, encouraging an increase in production and thus a move toward equilibrium. This equilibration process occurs when the equilibrium is stable, i.e., when the ''AD'' line is less steep than the ''AD=Y'' line.

The equilibrium level of output determines the equilibrium level of employment in the model. (In a dynamic view, these are connected by [[Okun's law]].) There is no reason within the model why the equilibrium level of employment should correspond to [[full employment]]. Bringing in other considerations may imply this correspondence, though.{{fact|date=October 2012}}

If any of the components of aggregate demand (''C + I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + G + NX'') rises at each level of income, for example because business becomes more optimistic about future profitability, that shifts the entire ''AD'' line ''upward''. This raises equilibrium income and output. Similarly, if the elements of ''AD'' fall, that shifts the line downward and lowers equilibrium output. (The ''AD=Y'' line does not shift under the definition used here).

==Assumptions==
The Keynesian cross produces an equilibrium under several assumptions.  First, the ''AD'' (blue) curve is positive. The ''AD'' curve is assumed to be positive because an increase in national output should lead to an increase in disposable income and, thus, an increase in consumption, which makes up a portion of aggregate demand.&lt;ref name="Suranovic"&gt;Suranovic, Steven M. "Chapter 50-7: The Keynesian Cross Diagram." ''International Finance Theory and Policy''. Last Updated on 1/20/05 http://internationalecon.com/Finance/Fch50/F50-7.php&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the ''AD'' curve is assumed to have a positive, vertical intercept.  The ''AD'' curve must have a positive, vertical intercept to cross the ''AD=Y'' curve.  If the curves do not cross, there is no equilibrium and no equilibrium output can be determined.  The ''AD'' curve will have a positive, vertical intercept as long as there is some aggregated demand—from consumer spending, investment, net exports, or government spending—even if there is no national output.&lt;ref name="Suranovic" /&gt; The slope of the ''AD'' curve is steeper given a high [[fiscal multiplier|multiplier]] value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snowdon |first=Brian |last2=Vane |first2=Howard R. |title=Modern Macroeconomics : Its Origins, Development and Current State |location=Cheltenham, UK |publisher=Edward Elgar |edition= |year=2005 |isbn=1-84542-467-0 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-c4AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">{{Platonism}}
'''Metaxy''' ({{lang-el|μεταξύ}}) is defined in [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' via the character of the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] as the "in-between" or "middle ground".

==In Plato==
Diotima, tutoring [[Socrates]], uses the term to show how [[oral tradition]] can be perceived by different people in different ways. In the poem by Socrates she depicts [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] as not an extreme or purity;  rather, as a ''daemon'', Eros is in between the divine Gods and mankind.   Diotima thus exposes the flaws of oral tradition;  it uses strong contrasts to express truth, thus revealing vulnerability to [[sophism|sophistry]]. This portion of the dialogue points to the idea that reality is perceptible only through one's character (which includes one's desires and prejudices and one's limited understanding of logic). Man moves through the world of Becoming, the ever changing world of sensory perception, into the world of Being—the world of forms, absolutes and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Man transcends his place in Becoming by [[Eros]], where man reaches the Highest Good, an intuitive and mystical state of consciousness. [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] like [[Plotinus]] later used the concept to express an [[ontological]] placement of Man between the Gods and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rise and Decline of the Roman World By Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase
pg 706 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0SynnxdVlYC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;lpg=PA705&amp;dq=plotinus+and+the+metaxy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qFpZgwgrkV&amp;sig=M1XzvmdPVR2kVYXJ4M9Ok1msOiQ Text] Enneads 3, Verse 8 line 4 "But humanity, in reality, is poised midway between gods and beasts, and inclines now to the one order, now to the other; some men grow like to the divine, others to the brute, the greater number stand neutral."&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Diotima did in expressing that Eros as a ''daemon'' was in between the Gods and mankind. Love (''Eros'') is the thing in between or child of Poverty (''Penia'') and Possession (''Poros'').&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'' 203b-c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary use==
Contemporary [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Eric Voegelin]] used the term to mean the permanent place where man is in-between two poles of existence. Such as the infinite ([[Apeiron (cosmology)|Apeiron]]) and the finite (the divine mind or [[Nous]]) reality of existence or between the beginning of existence (Apeiron) and the Beyond existence (ἐπέκεινα ''[[Transcendence (philosophy)|epekeina]]''). As a technical usage Voegelin defined Metaxy as the connection of the mind or [[nous]] to the material world and the reverse of the material world's connection to the mind as "consciousness of being". Under Voegelin it can also be interpreted to mean a form of perception in contrast to [[consciousness]] a template of the mind (or nous) in contrast to the dynamic and unordered flow of experiential consciousness. As a form of reflectiveness in-between two poles of experience (finite and the infinite or [[immanence|immanent]] and transcendent). The whole of existence being expressed as the [[cosmos]]. The Metaxy being man's connection to the material world this as the ground of being.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, “Reason: The Classic Experience,” in Voegelin, Published Essays, 1966-1985, vol. 12 of The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, ed. [[Ellis Sandoz]] (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1990), 289-90; Order and History, Volume IV: The Ecumenic Age, vol. 17 of The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, ed. Michael Franz (Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 2000), 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Voegelin taught that those who sought political power for its own end were [[sophism|sophists]] and those who were seeking meaning and truth in life or union with the knowable and true, were [[philosophers]]. Each of these positions manifests a different view regarding Plato's becoming and being;  again the place in between each of these poles of experience is metaxy.

The concept is also used by [[Simone Weil]]. She believed that compassion must act in the area of metaxy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athanasios Moulakis]], ''Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-denial'', University of Missouri Press, 1998, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM)''' was an antiwar and GI rights organization during the Vietnam War. Initially formed in late 1969 as a merger of sailors from San Diego and marines from the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton Marine Base]] in Oceanside, CA, it rapidly spread to a number of other cities and bases in California and the mid-West, including San Francisco, Long Beach Naval Station, El Toro Marine Air Station, Fort Ord, Fort Carson and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party and the Black militancy of the times.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Alexander |editor-first=Leslie |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History |url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1640C |access-date=2017-08-16 |year=2010 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-769-2 |pages=1080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers: GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-new-winter-soldiers/9780813522425 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=88 |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became one of the more radical GI organizations during that era and was investigated in 1971 by the [[United States House Committee on Internal Security|House Committee on Internal Security]] (formally HUAC). As with much of the GI movement during this era, chapters had a high turnover as members were transferred, discharged and disciplined by the military. By late 1970 several chapters had splintered or disbanded, but the group's name and demands proved popular within the GI resistance movement overall.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=David L. |date=2017 |title=Dangerous Grounds: Antiwar Coffeehouses and Military Dissent in the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469632018/dangerous-grounds/ |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=74 &amp; 98 |isbn=978-1-4696-3201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cortright |first=David |date=2005 |title=Soldiers In Revolt |url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Haymarket Books |pages=64, 108 &amp; 116 |isbn=1931859272 |author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chapters continued through 1971 and 1972 and one until 1975.

==Founding==

MDM started at the civilian supported ''Green Machine'' antiwar coffeehouse in Vista, CA not far from Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Oceanside"&gt;[https://www.oceansidechamber.com/oceanside-blog/history-of-oceanside-1963-1987 Oceanside Chamber of Commerce History of Oceanside]&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a merger of a small group of sailors in San Diego called [[GI's Against Fascism]] and a larger group of marines at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |date=1972 |title=Pawns: The Plight of the Citizen-Soldier |location=New York, NY |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |pages=128–9 |isbn=0-394-43616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Diego group already had a newspaper called ''Duck Power'' and the marines began by publishing a newspaper called ''Attitude Check'' whose first issue, dated November 1, 1969, announced that it was "written by marines and ex-marines for the benefit of the common snuffy, grunt, and em." The organization seemed to hit a nerve among local marines and sailors and on December 14 in nearby Oceanside an estimated 1,000 Black, White and Chicano GIs were among 4,000 who participated in an antiwar march and rally with speeches by [[Donald W. Duncan]], [[Captain Howard Levy]], [[Angela Davis]] and a number of active duty GIs.&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Attitude"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/39085/rec/2, Wisconsin Historical Society GI Press Collection: Attitude Check]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;

==Preamble and 12 Demands==

At this rally, MDM's spokespeople presented and explained the organization's Preamble and 12 Demands, which had also been published simultaneously in the December 1, 1970 issues of ''Duck Power'' and ''Attitude Check''. The Preamble stated "that ending the suppression of the American serviceman is an important part of a larger struggle for basic human rights" and pledged "support for the self-determination of all peoples." It ended, "We have been silent for a long time. We will be silent no longer."

The 12 demands included: An immediate end to the Vietnam War, collective bargaining for GIs, "human and constitutional rights [for] military men and women," the ending of censorship and intimidation within the military, the abolition of "mental and physical cruelty in military brigs, correctional custodies, and basic training", doing away with the "court-martial and non-judicial punishment systems," "wages equal to the federal minimum wage," "the abolition of the class structure of the military," an end to "all racism everywhere," the freeing of all political prisoners, including Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton," an end to "the glorification of war," and the abolition of the draft.&lt;ref name="Tishler"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tischler |first1=Barbara L. |date=1990 |title=Breaking Ranks: GI Antiwar Newspapers and the Culture of Protest |url=http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol2/iss1/ |journal=Vietnam Generation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=30–31 |issn=1042-7597 |access-date=2017-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/80964/rec/14, MDM Preamble and 12 Demands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==

===San Diego===

The pre-existing group of sailors in San Diego called ''GI's Against Fascism'' merged with the group at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; They all agreed to use the MDM name while publishing two newspapers, ''Duck Power'' in San Diego and ''Attitude Check'' at Pendleton. In mid-1970 the San Diego chapter changed the name of their newspaper to ''Dare to Struggle'' which they continued to publish until mid-1971. ''Attitude Check's'' last issue was in June 1970. The Camp Pendleton and San Diego areas were very pro-military and the MDM members located there experienced significant hostility and harassment.&lt;ref name="Oceanside" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; The San Diego area MDM had close ties with the [[San Diego Free Press]] which helped them put out their newspapers.

===Great Lakes Naval Station===

By early 1970 MDM had spread to several other cities and military bases. In January, a chapter formed at the [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] naval base, located north of Chicago, IL, the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. Aided by activists with the Wisconsin Draft Resistance and the Chicago Area Military Project, a counseling service and coffeehouse, this chapter was one of the most active and included a considerable number of black sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortright |first1=David |date=1990 |title=Black GI Resistance During the Vietnam War |url=http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol2/iss1/ |journal=Vietnam Generation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59 |issn=1042-7597 |access-date=2017-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They began publishing ''The Navy Times Are Changing'' which continued until the end of 1972. On Armed Forces Day in May 1970 they sponsored a rally near the base which attracted 50 sailors and nearly 500 civilians. Another rally in September of that same year "drew a crowd of over five hundred sailors and civilians." When four Black WAVES were illegally arrested by base commanders in July 1970, more than 100 sailors marched to where the women were being held and surrounded the building, refusing to move until the women were released. Within weeks of this incident, over 900 enlisted men and women were discharged or transferred to other bases by the navy. On Armed Forces Day in 1972, MDM and the Chicago Area Military Project organized a large demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;

===San Francisco Bay Area===

Tom Csekey, one of the sailors who founded ''GI's Against Fascism'' in San Diego traveled to San Francisco and helped form two chapters of MDM in the Bay Area. There was a short-lived chapter at [[Fort Ord]] near Monterey, CA which published the ''Right-On Post'' from May to August 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2832/rec/43, Right-on Post]&lt;/ref&gt; And a San Francisco Bay Area chapter with members from the [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Alameda Naval Air Station]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco]] and other military bases, which published their newspaper ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' regularly from 1970 to 1972 and then sporadically until to 1975. The ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' paper and staff played an important role in helping sailors from the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)#1971: Crewmen petition against the Vietnam War|USS Coral Sea]] organize a November 6, 1971 antiwar demonstration in San Francisco involving over 300 men from the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/history/1961-1973-gi-resistance-in-the-vietnam-war 1961-1973: GI resistance in the Vietnam War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Up_Against_the_Bulkhead Statement from Peter Wiley, Up Against the Bulkhead Staff member]&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter was the longest lasting MDM organization and their newspaper was one of the more professional and widely distributed.&lt;ref name="Tishler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/89923/rec/72, Up Against the Bulkhead]&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Toro Marine Air Base===

In July 1970 another chapter formed at the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro Marine air base]] in Orange County, CA. They published a newspaper called ''Pay Back'' consistently until the end of 1970 and then sporadically for another year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2481/rec/91, Pay Back]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fort Carson===

In mid-1970 a group of GI from the [[Fort Carson]] army base near Colorado Springs, CO began to meet and publish a newspaper called ''Counter Attack''. They were supported by the ''Homefront'' GI coffeehouse. As with all the other chapters, they experienced a high turnover rate and disbanded by mid-1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/86054/rec/18, Counter Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

MDM was more disciplined than most other GI resistance organizations of the period. At a June 1970 regional conference involving chapters from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, the Bay Area, Fort Ord, Long Beach, and El Toro the members approved 16 strict ''Rules for MDM Members''. These included no narcotics or marijuana, no racism, no male chauvinism or sexism, no criminal activity or stealing from the people, putting the interests and needs of the people before personal pleasure, mandatory participation in political education classes, no misuse of funds, and instructions that if arrested members were to give only name, rank, and serial number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/59671/rec/136 Rules for MDM Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Some critics of MDM have argued that their 12 demands, if implemented "would have rendered the U.S. military totally ineffective as a fighting force."&lt;ref name="Rothrock"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothrock |first=James |date=2006 |title=Divided We Fall: How Disunity Leads to Defeat |location=Bloomington, IN |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=228–30 |isbn=1-4259-1107-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in January 1971 in The Marine Corps Gazette, Marine commandant general [[Leonard F. Chapman Jr.]] said MDM was "a serious threat to the defense of this country."&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;

===House Internal Security Committee===

The House Committee on Internal Security investigated MDM and the broader GI movement. They concluded that the GI Movement "is the organized efforts by relatively small numbers of GIs and pseudo pacifist civilians to enlist and engage the participation by United States armed services personnel in the so-called peace movement." A witness before the committee described MDM's efforts at Fort Ord as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general purpose of the MDM was to recruit soldiers, to propagandize them, to encourage them to file for conscientious objector status, to hold demonstrations enlisting their sympathy against the Army and the establishment, to conduct…certain operations aimed at distributing propaganda literature upon the military reservation illegally, and to disrupt in general and neutralize the effectiveness of Fort Ord as a military training base.&lt;ref name="Rothrock" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other Views===

Other observers agreed that MDM was on the more radical end of the GI movement but were more favorable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; One scholar observed that MDM viewed "the war in a much broader context of military and social oppression that MDM hoped to eradicate. For many groups on the Left, ending the Vietnam conflict was a liberal issue in comparison to the more revolutionary goal of transforming American society. For members of the armed forces facing the prospect of combat in Southeast Asia, ending the war was a critical issue. The MDM demands, framed as they were in broad social and political terms, reflect a strong Left political influence on at least some of the GI antiwar groups."&lt;ref name="Tishler" /&gt; The ''Stanford Daily'' viewed MDM as a lifeline to the GIs: "These men have already suffered the dehumanization process of boot camp and many of them are being prepared for Viet Nam. They were living a nightmare of which there was little relief until MDM developed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hill |first=Penny |date=1970-02-12 |title=Movement for a Democratic Military |work=Stanford Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radicalism===

MDM itself was quite upfront with its radicalism. As the August 1970 ''Right-on Post'' newspaper published at Fort Ord put it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal of MDM as an organization is to educate GIs to the real causes of their oppression, and to help them move to put an end to the problem. Through a black-brown-white coalition, we will educate one another, struggle together and defend one another. Rising as one, with clenched fists, we will break the man's chains. We are not afraid of the man's stockades; we've been there. The Vietnamese freedom fighters have shown us the way: a united force of brothers and sisters determined to free themselves can defeat the U.S. military monster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2832/rec/43, Right-on Post August 1970 p.12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Harassment and Attacks==

Several of the MDM chapters and their affiliated GI coffeehouses experienced legal and non-legal harassment from the pro-military towns where they were located and even violent attacks from right-wing organizations. In one instance, the ''Green Machine'' coffeehouse near Camp Pendleton was shot up on April 29, 1970 with 45 caliber machine gun fire, wounding one of the marines inside in the shoulder. A clandestine paramilitary right-wing group called the Secret Army Organization was suspected.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oceanside" /&gt; Another involved the San Diego Chapter on February 8, 1970. According to the lawyer and author Mark Lane, the San Diego Police and Navy Shore Patrol

&lt;blockquote&gt;"smashed down the door of a San Diego store front…to break up a peaceful meeting of Marines, Sailors and civilians." This was preceded by "several hours of terror on the streets in the vicinity by the local and military police during which civilians were threatened and detained by the cops and GI's were taken into custody, physically pushed around and finally arrested on non-existent charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Mark |date=1970-02-13 |title=Cops Attack Anti-war GIs |work=Los Angeles Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/28124/rec/77, MDM Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==

MDM may have been the most radical of the GI antiwar and military resistance organizations of significant size during the Vietnam War. It has been estimated that they had between five thousand and ten thousand members and they had viable chapters in over half-a-dozen military bases and cities.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; Their stand against the Vietnam War, their call for self-determination of all peoples and their opposition to discrimination and racism proved popular with a segment of GI, particularly minority GIs, as was the idea of democratizing the military. The military considered them a serious threat. With the transfer and discharge of many of its most active members, chapters were hard to sustain and by the end of the Vietnam War, MDM's last remaining chapter dissolved.

==Avoidance of muri in Toyota manufacturing==
Muri is one of three types of waste ([[muda (Japanese term)|muda]], [[mura (Japanese term)|mura]], muri) identified in the [[Toyota Production System]]. Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability.

Muri can be avoided through ''standardized work''.  To achieve this a ''standard condition'' or output must be defined to assure effective judgment of quality.  Then every process and function must be reduced to its simplest elements for examination and later recombination.
The process must then be standardized to achieve the standard condition. This is done by taking simple work elements and combining them, one-by-one into standardized work sequences.  In manufacturing, this includes:
* Work flow, or logical directions to be taken,
* Repeatable process steps and machine processes, or rational methods to get there, and
* [[Takt time]] (combined with production/demand leveling to provide for reasonable lengths of time and endurance allowed for a process e.g. if the takt is 10 minutes while there is no realistic way for a process to do its work in less than 20 minutes, Muri is the natural outcome).

When everyone knows the standard condition, and the standardized work sequences, the results observed include:
* Heightened employee morale (due to close examination of ergonomics and safety)
* Higher quality
* Improved productivity
* Reduced costs

== Implementation ==

In fact{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} the big contribution of [[Henry Ford]] and his manufacturing techniques was the reduction of Muri and not so much the [[production line]] itself. In order for the production line to function each station on the line had to achieve standard work because the next station was only equipped to work on standard condition components.

The Ford production line approximates to an implementation of [[Takt time]] which gives enough time to perform the standard work...

The '''National Bureau of Classification''' ('''NBC'''), previously the '''Film Censor Board of Maldives''', is a government office founded on 21 May 1956 with the objective of presenting and promoting [[Film industry|cinema]] and theatrical performances for the benefit of the Maldivian people.

==History and overview==
The Government of [[Maldives]] first formed a Film Censor Board on 21 May 1956 under the President’s Office. This Board was formed with the objective of presenting and promoting cinema and theatrical performances for the benefit of the Maldivian people.
On 15 May 1983 the Film Censor Board was transferred under the mandate of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Housing. The mission of the five-member Board was to check films and theatrical dramas to see if they had issues that conflicted:

1. The tenets of Islam.
2. The Constitution, Laws and Regulations of the Maldives.
3. The Maldivian Culture.

On 1 April 1998 the Film Censor Board became a [[subsidiary]] of the Ministry of Information, Arts and Culture and on 29 December 2005, the Film Censor Board was re-branded as the National Bureau of Classification, NBC. This change was brought as the government believed that classification and education was the key to manage and regulate different content so as to protect values of artistic productions and safeguard consumer interests at the same time. Presently, the National Bureau of Classification is under the Ministry of Youth and Sports.

==Film ratings==
Classification Certificates issued by NBC are based on the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classification Ratings |publisher=National Bureau of Classification |location=Maldives |url=http://nbc.gov.mv/services/classification-ratings |accessdate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220024616/http://www.nbc.gov.mv/services/classification-ratings |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">In [[modal logic]], the '''necessity of identity''' is the thesis that for every object x and object y, if x and y are the same object, it is [[necessary proposition|necessary]] that x and y are the same object.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, J., ‘On a derivation of the necessity of identity’, Synthese May 2014, Volume 191, Issue 7,  pp 1567–1585, p 1567&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis is best known for its association with [[Saul Kripke]], who published it in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, S. ‘Identity and Necessity’, in Milton K. Munitz (ed.), ''Identity and Individuation''. New York University Press. pp. 135-164 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; although it was first derived by the logician [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Ruth Barcan, ‘[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/marcus/Barcan_Identity.pdf Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order]’, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' 1947 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, in simplified form, by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] in 1953&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W.V.O., ‘Three Grades of Modal Involvement’ ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' 1953, 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kripke's derivation==
The derivation in Kripke's 'Identity and Necessity' is in three steps:
 
:(1) ∀x nec(x = x)
:(2) ∀x∀y(x = y → (nec(x = x) → nec(x = y))) 
:(3) ∀x∀y(x = y → nec(x = y))

The first premiss is simply postulated: every object is identical to itself. The second is an application of the [[Identity of indiscernibles#Indiscernibility of identicals|principle of substitutivity]]: if a = b, then a has all the properties b has, thus from Fa, infer Fb, where F is 'nec(a = --)'. The third follows by elementary predicate logic.

===Rigid designation===
{{see|Rigid designator}}
In the later ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', Kripke suggested that the principle could be derived directly, assuming what he called [[Rigid designator|rigid designation]]. A term is a rigid designator when it designates the same object in every [[possible world]] in which that object exists. When a name’s referent is fixed by the original act of naming, it becomes a rigid designator. Some examples of rigid designators include proper names (i.e. ‘Richard Nixon’), natural kind terms ( i.e. ‘gold’ or ‘H2O’) and some descriptions.

Proper names are typically rigid designators, but [[definite description]]s are typically not. So we can speak of "Richard Nixon" referring to the same person in all possible worlds, but the description “the man who won the 1968 election” could refer to many different people. According to Kripke, the proper name “Richard Nixon” can only be used rigidly, but the description “the man who won the 1968 election” can be used non-rigidly.  Kripke argues,&lt;ref&gt;‘Identity and Necessity’ p. 154, there is a similar argument in ''Naming and Necessity'' p.104)&lt;/ref&gt; that if names are rigid designators, then identity must be necessary, because the names ‘a’ and ‘b’ will be rigid designators of an object x if a is identical to b, and so in every possible world, ‘a’ and ‘b’ will both refer to this same object x, and no other, and there could be no situation in which a might not have been b, otherwise x would not have been identical with itself.

:Waiving fussy considerations deriving from the fact that x need not have necessary existence, it was clear from (x) nec (x = x) and Leibniz’s law that identity is an ‘internal’ relation: (x) (y) (x = y -&gt; nec (x = y)). (What pairs (x, y) could be counterexamples? Not pairs of distinct objects, for then the antecedent is false; nor any pair of an object and itself, for then the consequent is true.) If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are rigid designators, it follows that ‘a = b’, if true, is a necessary truth. If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are not rigid designators, no such conclusion follows about the statement ‘a = b’ (though the objects designated by ‘a’ and ‘b’ will be necessarily identical).&lt;ref&gt;Naming and Necessity p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not mean that we have knowledge of this necessity. Before the discovery that Hesperus (the evening star) and Phosphorus (the morning star) were the same planet, this fact was not known, and could not have been inferred from [[A priori and a posteriori|first principles]]. Thus there can be [[a posteriori necessity]].

The principle can also be applied to [[natural kind]]s. If [[water]] is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then water is ''necessarily'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but ''conditionally'', ''if'' water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6927">{{about|a concept for conflict resolution|information on international military peace-making missions|Peacebuilding}}

{{Refimprove|date=February 2015}}

'''Peacemaking''' is practical [[conflict transformation]] focused upon establishing equitable power relationships robust enough to forestall future conflict, often including the establishment of means of agreeing on [[ethical decision]]s within a community, or among parties, that had previously engaged in inappropriate (i.e. violent) responses to conflict. Peacemaking seeks to achieve full reconciliation among adversaries and new mutual understanding among parties and stakeholders. When applied in [[criminal justice]] matters, peacemaking is usually called [[restorative justice]], but sometimes also [[transformative justice]], a term coined by the late Canadian justice theorist and activist [[Ruth Morris]].  One popular example of peacemaking is the several types of [[mediation]], usually between two parties and involving a third, a [[facilitator]] or mediator.

==Methods==
{{See also|Peacebuilding#Approaches to peacebuilding}}

Some geopolitical entities, such as nation-states and international organizations, attempt to relegate the term peacemaking to large, systemic, often factional conflicts in which no member of the community can avoid involvement, and in which no faction or segment can claim to be completely innocent of the problems, citing as instances post-[[genocide]] situations, or extreme situations of oppression such as [[apartheid]]. However peacemaking is a universal and age-old approach to conflict at all levels and among any and all parties, and its principles may be generalized and used in many different kinds of conflicts.
In contemporary international affairs, especially after the end of the [[Cold War]], the concept of peacemaking has often been associated to the imposition upon warring parties of a peace settlement, usually under the auspices of an international organization.
Peacemaking in smaller, traditional societies has often involved rituals. For example, [[Alula Pankhurst]] has produced films about peacemaking among Ethiopian communities.

The process of peacemaking is distinct from the rationale of [[pacifism]] or the use of [[non-violent protest]] or [[civil disobedience]] techniques, though they are often practiced by the same people.  Indeed, those who master using nonviolent techniques under extreme violent pressure, and those who lead others in such resistance, have usually demonstrated the capacity not to react to violent provocation in kind, and thus may be more highly skilled at working with groups of people that may have suffered through violence and oppression, keeping them coordinated and in good order through the necessary, often difficult phases of [[rapprochement]].
Given that, and a track record of not advocating violent responses, it is these leaders who are usually most qualified for peacemaking when future conflict breaks out between the previously warring sides.

==Gandhi==
[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] is widely recognized as an important theorist of peacemaking strategies.  He noted in particular that leaders who had been successful at violent strategies were counter-productive in peace time, simply because these strategies now had to be abandoned.  But if a movement had adulated and emulated these people, it was unlikely ever to be able to make permanent peace even with those factions it had conquered or dominated, simply because the leaders lacked the skills and had become leaders in part for their suppression of the other side.  Accordingly, even if a movement were to benefit from violent action, and even if such action was extremely effective in ending some other oppression, no movement that sought long-term peace could safely hold up these acts or persons as a [[moral example]] or advise emulating either.  Gandhi's views have influenced modern [[ethicist]]s in forming a critique of [[terrorism]], in which even those who support the goals must decry the methods and avoid making, for instance, a [[suicide bomber]] into a hero.

==Christianity==
The Catholic Church has changed its view on peacemaking over the centuries. Some early Christians refused to join Rome’s Imperial army. A doctrine of a [[Just War theory]] originated with St. Augustine of Hippo in the 5th century. Versions of Just War doctrines have claimed that countries and people should keep peace at all cost.  The right of a ruler to go to war must meet the criteria of just cause, comparative justice, competent authority, right intention, probability of success, last resort, and proportionality. The [[Colombian conflict]] is the present day, prime Catholic example.

The tradition of Christianity continues to be taken up by those who seek peace. Jesus taught, "[...] all who take the sword will perish by the sword." (Matthew 26:52, NAB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PVZ.HTM|title=The New American Bible|last=|first=|date=11/11/2|website=www.vatican.va|via=Androids must manually "Request desktop site".|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Twenty years after the cessation of the [[Reichskonkordat]]'','' Pope Paul VI proclaimed “No more war, war never again!” (Address to United Nations General Assembly, October 4, 1965 retweeted by Pope Francis Sept.2, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Pontifex|author=Pope Francis|number=374466943312330753|date=2 September 2013|title=War never again!

Cross Currents, 60, 328-331,476-477&lt;/ref&gt; Christians teach that a great (false) peace will soon be made.

== Environmental aspect ==
Electricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of [[Wood fuel|wood]] for [[cooking]], [[heating]] and [[light]]ing, consequently reducing [[deforestation]] which is a huge problem in the [[Deforestation by region|region]]. The hydro schemes also cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of [[kerosene]] [[Kerosene lamp|lighting]], cutting the use of [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Diesel generator|generators]], and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of [[Fossil fuel|fuels]] replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per MWh. This suggests a substantial greenhouse gas saving of around 88,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashden.org/files/case_studies/SRSP%20Pakistan.pdf|title=Winner case study summary: Sarhad Rural Support Programme, Pakistan.|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Ashden Award for Increasing Energy Access, supported by the IKEA Foundation Award|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ashden.org/winners/SRSP15|title=The power of water brings new life to mountain villages|last=|first=|date=2015-06-05|work=|newspaper=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webwidemedia.net/rspn/index.php/about-us/awards-recognition|title=Awards &amp; Recognitions {{!}} RSPN|last=|first=|date=|website=Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN)|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/804936/what-the-smart-villages-of-pakistan-can-teach-us-about-energy|title=What the ‘smart villages’ of Pakistan can teach us about energy|last=Cheema|first=Abdur Rehman|date=12 March 2016|newspaper=Scroll.in|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19199">{{Other uses|Rationalization (economics)|Rationalization (psychology)}}
In [[sociology]], '''rationalization''' (or '''rationalisation''') is the replacement of traditions, values, and emotions as motivators for behavior in society with concepts based on [[rationality]] and [[reason]]. For example, the implementation of bureaucracies in government is a kind of rationalization, as is the construction of high-efficiency living spaces in architecture and urban planning. A potential reason as to why rationalization of a culture may take place in the modern era is the process of [[globalization]]. Countries are becoming increasingly interlinked, and with the rise of technology, it is easier for countries to influence each other through [[social networking]], the [[News media|media]] and [[politics]]. An example of rationalization in place would be the case of witch doctors in certain parts of Africa. Whilst many locals view them as an important part of their culture and traditions, development initiatives and aid workers have tried to rationalize the practice in order to educate the local people in modern medicine and practice (Giddens, 2013).

Many sociologists, [[critical theorists]] and contemporary [[philosophers]] have argued that rationalization, falsely assumed as progress, has had a negative and [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]] effect on society, moving [[modernity]] away from the central tenets of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1985 p2"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'', Polity Press (1985), {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, p2&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of sociology had critical reaction to rationalization:

{{Quotation|Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with [[industrialization]] and the new social division of labour which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation').|John Harriss ''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' 1992|&lt;ref&gt;Harriss, John. ''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' in Allen, T. and Thomas, Alan (eds) ''Poverty and Development in the 21st Century'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. p325.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Capitalism==
Rationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed – by contrast with [[anthropology]] – on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German [[antipositivist]] [[Max Weber]], though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of [[dialectism]] and [[sociocultural evolution]] informs the concept.

Weber demonstrated rationalization in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which the aims of certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Theologies, particularly [[Calvinism]], are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on [[bureaucracy]] and on the classifications of [[authority]]. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber believed that a move towards [[rational-legal authority]] was inevitable. In [[charismatic authority]], the death of a leader effectively ends the power of that authority, and only through a rationalized and bureaucratic base can this authority be passed on. [[Traditional authority|Traditional authorities]] in rationalized societies also tend to develop a rational-legal base to better ensure a stable accession. (See also: [[Tripartite classification of authority]])

{{Quotation|What Weber depicted was not only the [[secularization]] of Western ''culture'', but also and especially the development of modern ''societies'' from the viewpoint of rationalization. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organizational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalization of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalization, traditional forms of life - which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade - were dissolved.|[[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''Modernity's Consciousness of Time''|&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1985 p2"/&gt;}}

Whereas in [[Traditional society|traditional societies]] such as [[feudalism]] governing is managed under the [[traditional authority|traditional leadership]] of, for example, a [[queen regnant|queen]] or [[tribal chief]], modern societies operate under [[rational-legal authority|rational-legal systems]]. For example, [[democracy|democratic systems]] attempt to remedy qualitative concerns (such as [[racism|racial discrimination]]) with rationalized, quantitative means (for example, [[civil rights]] [[Statutory law|legislation]]). Weber described the eventual effects of rationalization in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in an "[[iron cage]]" (or "steel-hard casing") of rule-based, [[rationality|rational]] control.

[[Jürgen Habermas]] has argued that understanding rationalization properly requires going beyond Weber's notion of rationalization. It requires distinguishing between ''instrumental rationality'', which involves calculation and efficiency (in other words, reducing all relationships to those of means and ends), and ''communicative rationality'', which involves expanding the scope of mutual understanding in communication, the ability to expand this understanding  through reflective discourse about communication, and making social and political life subject to this expanded understanding.

{{Quotation|It is clear that in ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]'' Weber is playing something like the role that Hegel played for Marx. Weber, for Habermas, must be not so much stood on his head (or put back the right way up) as persuaded to stand on two legs rather than one, to support his theory of modernity with more systematic and structural analyses than those of the (purposive-rational) rationalization of action ... Weber 'parts company with a theory of communicative action' when he defines action in terms of the actor attaching a subjective meaning to it. He does not elucidate "meaning" in connection with the model of speech; he does not relate it to the linguistic medium of possible understanding, but to the beliefs and intentions of an acting subject, taken to being with in isolation. This leads him to his familiar distinction between value-rational, purposive-rational, traditional and affectual action. What Weber should have done instead was to concentrate not on orientations of action but on the general structures of the lifeworld to which acting subjects belong. |[[William Outhwaite]] ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 1988|&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Holocaust, modernity and ambivalence===
[[File:Rail leading to Auschwitz II (Birkenau).jpg|thumb|The railway line leading to the death camp at Auschwitz II (Birkenau).]]
For [[Zygmunt Bauman]], rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be closely associated with the events of the [[Holocaust]]. In ''Modernity and Ambivalence'', Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar.

Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.

For this reason, Bauman argues that modern societies have not fully taken on board the lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' ''par excellence'' in Europe;&lt;ref&gt;''Modernity and the Holocaust'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Final Solution]] was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]], contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.

===Adorno and Horkheimer's definition of "enlightenment"===
In their analysis of contemporary western society, ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944, revised 1947), [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] developed a wide and pessimistic concept of enlightenment. In their analysis, enlightenment had its dark side: while trying to abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of [[reason]]. In their view, the enlightenment itself should be enlightened and not posed as a 'myth-free' view of the world. For [[Marxist]] philosophy in general, rationalization is closely associated with the concept of "[[commodity fetishism]]", for the reason that not only are products designed to fulfill certain tasks, but employees are hired to fulfill specific tasks as well.

==Consumption==
[[File:Harlem Micky Dz.jpg|thumb|The sign at a [[McDonald's]] '[[drive-thru]]'. The "over 99 billion served" statement illustrates Ritzer's idea of calculability.]]
Modern food consumption typifies the process of rationalization. Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. [[Fast-food restaurant]]s, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals and the addition of [[drive-through]] windows.

Rationalization is also observable in the replacement of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case of [[Wal-Mart]] is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted [[Criticism of Wal-Mart|considerable criticism]] for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, David.

The sociologist [[George Ritzer]] has used the term [[McDonaldization]] to refer, not just to the actions of the fast food restaurant, but to the general process of rationalization. Ritzer distinguishes four primary components of McDonaldization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* Efficiency – the optimal method for accomplishing a task; the fastest method to get from point A to point B. Efficiency in McDonaldization means that every aspect of the organization is geared toward the minimization of time.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Calculability]] – goals are quantifiable (i.e., sales, money) rather than subjective (i.e., taste, labour). McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product. "They run their organization in such a way that a person can walk into any McDonald's and receive the same sandwiches prepared in precisely the same way. This results in a highly rational system that specifies every action and leaves nothing to chance".&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Predictability]] – [[standardization|standardized]] and uniform services.  "Predictability" means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product at every interaction with the corporation. This also applies to the workers in those organizations; their tasks are highly repetitive and predictable routines.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Social control|Control]] – standardized and uniform employees, replacement of human by non-human technologies.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

==Commercialization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
As [[capitalism]] itself is a rationalized economic policy, so is the process of [[commercialization]] it utilizes in order to increase sales. Most holidays, for instance, were created out of a religious context or in celebration of some past event. However, in rationalized societies these traditional values are increasingly diminished and the aim shifts from the qualitative aim of a meaningful celebration to the more quantitative aim of increasing sales.

In the [[United States]], for example, most major holidays now are represented by rationalized, [[secularism|secularized]] figures which serve as a corporate [[totem]]. In more traditional environments, [[gift]]s are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present they are interested in receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift is more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).

==Further objects of rationalization==

===Human body===
One rational tendency is towards increasing the efficiency and output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular [[exercise]], [[dieting]], increased [[hygiene]], [[medication|drugs]], and an emphasis on optimal [[nutrition]]. As well as increasing [[Longevity#Longevity and lifestyle|lifespans]], these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''The History of Sexuality'' (subtitle: ''The Care of the Self, vol. 3''), which identifies this rationalization as emerging from capitalist ideologies  vis &amp;agrave; vis control of workers (i.e., in this case, specifically, their bodies) for the rigors of commerce and the marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another aspect of this is maintaining a certain level of [[Physical attractiveness|physical attraction]]. Processes such as the [[comb]]ing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate [[haircut]], and wearing certain [[Clothing|clothes]] receive [[calculation|calculated]] use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.

Another trend is in the [[bureaucratization]] of processes that formerly might have been done through the home. This includes the use of [[hospital]]s for childbirth and the use of [[Physician|doctor]]s to identify symptoms of an illness and to prescribe treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Education===
Rationalized education tends to focus less on subjects based around the use of critical discourse (for instance, [[religion]]) and more on matters of a calculated importance (such as [[business administration]]). This is reflected also in the move towards [[standardized testing|standardized]] and [[multiple choice]] testing, which measures students on the basis of numbered answers and against a uniform standard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Sir Edwin Ray Lankester''' {{post-nominals|GBR|KCB|FRS}} (15 May 1847 – 13 August 1929) was a [[British Isles|British]] [[zoologist]].&lt;ref name="NIE"&gt;New International Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Osborn, Henry Fairfield|authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborne|title=Obituary: Sir E.

== Life ==
Ray Lankester was born on 15 May 1847 on Burlington Street&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[London]], the son of [[Edwin Lankester]], a coroner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lankester, Edwin Ray|journal=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1019|author1=Addison|first1=Henry Robert|last2=Oakes|first2=Charles Henry|last3=Lawson|first3=William John|last4=Sladen|first4=Douglas Brooke Wheelton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doctor-naturalist who helped eradicate [[cholera]] in London, and his wife, the botanist and author [[Phebe Lankester]]. Ray Lankester was probably named after the naturalist [[John Ray]]: his father had just edited the memorials of John Ray for the [[Ray Society]].

In 1855 Ray went to boarding school at [[Leatherhead]], and in 1858 to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]]. His university education was at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and [[Christ Church, Oxford]];&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=LNKR864ER|name=Lankester, Edwin Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt; he transferred from Downing, after five terms, at his parents' behest because Christ Church had better teaching in the form of the newly appointed [[George Rolleston]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lester|Lester]], pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Lankester achieved first-class honours in 1868. His education was rounded off by study visits to [[Vienna]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Jena]], and he did some work at the [[Stazione Zoologica]] at [[Naples]]. He took the examination to become a [[Fellow]] of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], and studied under [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas H. Huxley]] before taking his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]].

Lankester therefore had a far better education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as [[T.H. Huxley|Huxley]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Henry Walter Bates|Bates]]. Even so, it could be argued that the influence of his father Edwin and his friends were just as important. Huxley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scientific Memoirs of Thomas Henry Huxley|year=1898|volume=vol. I|location=London|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4MAAAAAMAAJ}} Upon Huxley's death, as a memorial tribute, Lankester and [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Sir Michael Foster]] edited his collected works in four volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], [[Arthur Henfrey (botanist)|Henfrey]], [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]], [[Philip Henry Gosse|Gosse]], [[Richard Owen|Owen]], [[Edward Forbes|Forbes]], [[William Benjamin Carpenter|Carpenter]], [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]], [[Roderick Murchison|Murchison]], [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lester|Lester]], pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a large man with a large presence, of warm human sympathies and in his childhood a great admirer of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. His interventions, responses and advocacies were often colourful and forceful, as befitted an admirer of Huxley, for whom he worked as a demonstrator when a young man. In his personal manner he was not so adept as Huxley, and he made enemies by his rudeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Huxley|first=Julian|title=Memories|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1970|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; This undoubtedly damaged and limited the second half of his career.

Lankester appears, thinly disguised, in several novels. He is the model for Sir Roderick Dover in [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[Marriage (novel)|Marriage]]'' (Wells had been one of his students), and in [[Robert Briffault]]'s ''Europa'', which contains a brilliant portrait of Lankester, including his friendship with [[Karl Marx]]. (Lankester was one of the eight people at Marx's funeral.)&lt;ref name="kmfuneral"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/death/dersoz1.htm |title=Karl Marx's Funeral |last=Engels |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Engels |publisher=[[marxists.org]] |date=22 March 1883 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been suggested as the model for [[Professor Challenger]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lester|Lester]], pp. 60, 187–8, 199–202&lt;/ref&gt; but Doyle himself said that Challenger was based on a professor of physiology at the University of Edinburgh named [[William Rutherford (physiologist)|William Rutherford]].&lt;ref&gt;pxxiii in the Oxford ed of ''The Lost World''. William Rutherford (1839–1899), holder of the Edinburgh Chair of Physiology from 1874.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle 1930. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Memories_and_Adventures.html?id=LKusgEu5uvUC ''Memories and adventures'']. Murray, London. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Lankester never married. In 1895, he was arrested and acquitted over sexual offences with young men.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, Neil "The Secret Life Of Oscar Wilde", Century, 2003, p250&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[London]] on 15 August 1929.

A finely decorated memorial plaque to him can be seen at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]], Hoop Lane, London.

== Career ==
Lankester became a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellow]] of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], in 1873. He co-edited the ''[[Journal of Cell Science|Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science]]'' which his father had founded. From 1869 until his death he edited this journal (jointly with his father, 1869–71).&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt; He worked as one of Huxley's team at the new buildings in [[South Kensington]], and after the death of [[Francis Maitland Balfour|Francis Balfour]] became Huxley's intended successor.

Lankester was appointed Jodrell Professor of Zoology and curator of what is now the [[Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy|Grant Museum of Zoology]] at University College London from 1874 to 1890, [[Linacre Chair of Zoology|Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]], from 1891 to 1898, and director of the Natural History Museum from 1898 to 1907. He was a founder in 1884 of the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|Marine Biological Association]] and served as its second President between 1890 and 1929. Influential as teacher and writer on biological theories, comparative anatomy, and evolution, Lankester studied the [[protozoa]], [[mollusca]], and [[arthropoda]]. He was [[British honours system|knighted]] in 1907, awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1913, and the [[Linnean Society of London]]'s [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lester|Lester]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At University College London (the 'Godless Institute of Gower Street') Lankester taught [[W.F.R. Weldon]] (1860–1906), who went on to succeed him in the chair at UCL. Another interesting student was [[Alfred Gibbs Bourne]], who went on to hold senior positions in biology and education in the [[Indian Empire]]. When Lankester left to take up the Linacre chair at Oxford in 1891, the [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant Museum]] at UCL continued to grow under Weldon who added a number of extremely rare specimens. Weldon is perhaps best known for founding the science of [[biometry]] with [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911) and [[Karl Pearson]] (1857–1936). He followed Lankester to Oxford in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/zoology/collections/history History of the Grant Museum 1827 – present]. ucl.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ray Lankester.png|thumb|Ray Lankester by [[Leslie Ward]], ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'' 1905.]]
After Huxley the most important influence on his thought was [[August Weismann]], the German zoologist who rejected [[Lamarckism]], and wholeheartedly advocated [[natural selection]] as the key force in evolution at a time when other biologists had doubts. Weismann's separation of [[germplasm]] (genetic material) from soma ([[somatic cells]]) was an idea which took many years before its significance was generally appreciated. Lankester was one of the first to see its importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann's essays, some of which he translated into English.

Lankester was hugely influential, though perhaps more as a teacher than as a researcher. [[Ernst Mayr]] said "It was Lankester who founded a school of selectionism at Oxford".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|year=1982|title=The growth of biological thought|isbn=0674364465|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those he influenced (in addition to Weldon) included [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]] (Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford 1921–46) and (indirectly) [[Julian Huxley]] (the evolutionary synthesis). In turn their disciples, such as [[E.B. Ford]] (ecological genetics), [[Gavin de Beer]] (embryology and evolution), [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] (ecology) and [[Alister Hardy]] (marine biology) held sway during the middle years of the 20th century.

As a zoologist Lankester was a comparative anatomist of the [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] school, working mostly on [[invertebrates]]. He was the first to show the relationship of the [[horseshoe crab]] or ''Limulus'' to the [[Arachnida]]. His ''[[Limulus]]'' specimens can still be seen in the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL today. He was also a voluminous writer on biology for the general readership; in this he followed the example of his old mentor, Huxley.

=== Invertebrates and degeneration ===
Lankester's books ''Developmental history of the Mollusca'' (1875) and ''Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism'' (1880) established him as a leader in the study of invertebrate life histories. In ''Degeneration'' he adapted some ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Anton Dohrn]] (the founder and first director of the [[Stazione Zoologica]], [[Naples]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dohrn, Anton 1875. ''Der Ursprung der Wirbelthiere und das Principe des Functionswechsels''. Engelmann, Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting Dohrn's work with [[Darwinism]], Lankester held that degeneration was one of three general avenues that evolution might take (the others being balance and elaboration). Degeneration was a suppression of form, "Any new set of conditions which render [a species'] food and safety very easily obtained, seem to lead to degeneration".&lt;ref&gt;Lankester, E. Ray (1880) ''Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Degeneration was well known in parasites, and Lankester gave several examples. In ''[[Sacculina]]'', a genus of [[barnacles]] which is a parasite of [[crab]]s, the female is little more than "a sac of eggs, and absorbed nourishment from the juices of its host by root-like processes" (+ [[Wood engraving|wood-engraved]] illustration). He called this degenerative evolutionary process in parasites ''retrogressive metamorphosis''.

Lankester pointed out that retrograde metamorphosis could be seen in many species that were not, strictly speaking, degenerate. "Were it not for the recapitulative phases of the [[barnacle]], we may doubt whether naturalists would ''ever'' have guessed it was a [[crustacean]]." The lizard ''[[Tetradactylus|Seps]]'' has limbs which are "ridiculously small", and ''[[Bipes (lizard)|Bipes]]'', a burrowing lizard, has no front limbs, and rear limbs reduced to stumps. The [[Dibamidae]] are legless lizards of tropical forests who also adopt the burrowing habit. [[Snakes#Evolution|Snakes]], which have evolved unique forms of [[Snakes#Locomotion|locomotion]], and are probably derived from lizards. Thus degeneration or retrogressive metamorphosis sometimes occurs as species [[Adaptation|adapt]] to changes in [[Habit (biology)|habit]] or way of life.

As evidence of degeneration, Lankester identifies the recapitulative development of the individual. This is the idea propagated by [[Ernst Haeckel]] as a source of evolutionary evidence ([[recapitulation theory]]). As antecedents of degeneration, Lankester lists:&lt;ref&gt;Lankester, E. Ray (1880) ''Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism''. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. [[Parasitism]]
:2. Fixity or immobility ([[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] habit)
:3. Vegetative nutrition
:4. Excessive reduction in size
He also considered the [[axolotl]], a [[mole salamander]], which can breed whilst still in its gilled larval form without maturing into a terrestrial adult. Lankester noted that this process could take the subsequent evolution of the race into a totally different and otherwise improbable direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lester|Lester]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea, which Lankester called ''super-larvation'', is now called [[neoteny]].

Lankester extended the idea of degeneration to human societies, which carries little significance today, but it is a good example of a biological concept invading social science. Lankester and [[H.G. Wells]] used the idea as a basis for propaganda in favour of social and educational reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Trouble at the Museum ===
In Lankester's time the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] had its own building in [[South Kensington]], but in financial and administrative matters it was subordinate to the [[British Museum]]. Moreover, the Superintendent (= Director) of the NHM was the subordinate of the Principal Librarian of the BM, a fact which was bound to cause trouble since that august person was not a scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Günther|Günther, Albert]] (1975) ''A century of zoology at the British Museum through the lives of two Keepers, 1815–1914''. London. {{ISBN|0712906185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Günther, Albert (1981) ''The founders of science at the British Museum'', 1753–1900. Halesworth, London. {{ISBN|0950727601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William T. Stearn|Stearn, William T.]] (1981) ''The Natural History Museum at South Kensington''. London. {{ISBN|9780565090302}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can see that the conflict which took place was one aspect of the struggle undertaken, in their different ways, by [[Richard Owen|Owen]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] and [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]] to emancipate science from enslavement by traditional forces.

There was trouble from the moment Lankester put forward his candidature for the office vacated by Sir [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]], who was on the point of death. The Principal Librarian, Sir [[Edward Maunde Thompson]], the [[palaeographer]], was also the Secretary to the Trustees, and hence in a strong position to get his own way. There is good evidence that Thompson, an efficient and authoritarian figure, intended to take control of the whole Museum, including the Natural History departments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Chalmers Mitchell|Mitchell, P. Chalmers]] (1937) ''My fill of days''. London. p. 170 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] to Lankester, Lankester family papers; reported in [[#Lester|Lester]], pp. 128–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of Huxley, who had led most of the battles for over thirty years, it was left to the younger generation to struggle for the independence of science, [[Peter Chalmers Mitchell|Mitchell]], [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton]], and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Weldon]] were his main supporters, and together they lobbied the Trustees, the Government and in the press to get their point over. Finally Lankester was appointed instead of Lazarus Fletcher (a relative nonentity).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lester|Lester]], Chapter 11, p. 127 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Lankester was appointed in 1898, and the outcome was inevitable. Eight years of conflict with Maunde Thompson followed, with Thompson constantly interfering in the affairs of the museum and obstructing Lankester's attempt to improve the museum. Lankester resigned in 1907, at the direction of Thompson, who had discovered a clause in the regulations which allowed him to call for the resignation of officials at the age of 60. [[Lazarus Fletcher]] was appointed in his stead. There was a vast clamour in the press, and from foreign zoologists protesting at the treatment of Lankester. That Lankester had some friends in high places was shown by the Archbishop of Canterbury offering him an enhanced pension, and the knighthood that was bestowed on him the next year.

The issues raised by this affair did not end there. Eventually the NHM gained, first, its administrative freedom, then finally there was a complete separation from the BM. Today the [[British Library]], the British Museum and the Natural History Museum all occupy separate buildings, and have complete legal, administrative and financial independence from each other.

=== Rationalism ===
[[File:Sir Edwin Ray Lankester 1918.jpg|thumb|240px|Sir Edwin Ray Lankester in 1918]]

Lankester had close family connections with [[Suffolk]] (the [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] and [[Felixstowe]] area), and was an active member of the [[Rationalist]] group associated with the circle of [[Thomas Huxley]], [[Samuel Laing (science writer)|Samuel Laing]] and others. He was a friend of the Rationalist [[Edward Clodd]] of [[Aldeburgh]]. From 1901 to his death in 1929 he was Honorary President of the [[Ipswich Museum]]. He became convinced of the human workmanship of the (now unfavoured) 'Pre-palaeolithic' implements and rostro-carinates, and championed their cause at the Royal Society in 1910–1912. Through correspondence he became the scientific mentor of the Suffolk prehistorian James Reid Moir (1879–1944). He was a friend of [[Karl Marx]] in the latter's later years and was among the few persons present at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The friendship of Edwin Ray Lankester and Karl Marx: the last episode in Marx's intellectual evolution|first=Lewis S.|last=Feuer|authorlink=Lewis Samuel Feuer|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=40|issue=4|year=1979|pages=633–648|doi=10.2307/2709363|jstor=2709363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lankester was active in attempting to expose the frauds of [[Spiritualist]] mediums during the 1920s. He was an important writer of popular science, his weekly newspaper columns over many years being assembled and reprinted in a series of books entitled ''Science from an Easy Chair'' (first series, 1910; second series, 1912).

Reason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as [[rationality]].

'''Reasoning''' is associated with [[Thought|thinking]], [[cognition]], and [[intellect]]. The philosophical field of [[logic]] studies ways in which humans reason [[Logical form|formal]]ly through [[argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Hintikka|first=J.|title=Philosophy of logic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346240/philosophy-of-logic|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=12 November 2013|authorlink=Jaako Hintikka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of [[logical reasoning]] (forms associated with the strict sense): [[deductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[abductive reasoning]]; and other modes of reasoning considered more informal, such as [[intuitive reasoning]] and [[verbal reasoning]].  Along these lines, a distinction is often drawn between logical, discursive  reasoning (reason proper), and [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive reasoning]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/hoffmann/courses/102_1111/Aristotle_8_EN_6.pdf Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 6 – The Intellectual Virtues]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque.  In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in [[mathematics]], intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a [[formal proof]], arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.

Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as [[cause]] and [[Causality|effect]], [[truth]] and [[False (logic)|falsehood]], or ideas regarding notions of [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of [[goal]]s, [[belief]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[tradition]]s, and [[institution]]s, and therefore with the capacity for [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]]. &lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment?" in ''The Essential Foucault'', eds. Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose, New York: The New Press, 2003, 43-57. See also Nikolas Kompridis, "The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom," in ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 32–59; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 "So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean"], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8: 3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to the use of "reason" as an [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun]], [[Reason (argument)|a reason]] is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=mw&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of reason&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.  

Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt;—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref&gt; Rachels, James. The Elements of Moral Philosophy, 4th ed. McGraw Hill, 2002 &lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have attempted to study and explain [[psychology of reasoning|how people reason]], e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of [[automated reasoning]] studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. [[comparative psychology|Animal psychology]] considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

==Etymology and related words==
In the [[English language]] and other modern [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], "reason", and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.
*The original [[Greek language|Greek]] term was {{lang|grc|"λόγος"}} ''[[wikt:logos#Greek|logos]]'', the root of the modern English word "[[logic]]" but also a word which could mean for example "speech" or "explanation" or an "account" (of money handled).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell| first2=Robert |last2=Scott|title=A Greek–English Lexicon|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos|chapter=logos}}. For etymology of English "logic" see any dictionary such as [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic?show=0&amp;t=1296722456 the Merriam Webster entry for logic].&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a philosophical term ''logos'' was translated in its non-linguistic senses in [[Latin]] as ''[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]''. This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy, but was also commonly a translation for ''logos'' in the sense of an account of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dratio|chapter=ratio|first1=Charlton |last1=Lewis|first2= Charles |last2=Short|title=A Latin Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:raison|raison]]'' is derived directly from Latin, and this is the direct source of the English word "reason".&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

The earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], and [[John Locke]] also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words "''logos''", "''ratio''", "''raison''" and "reason" as interchangeable. The meaning of the word "reason" in senses such as "human reason" also overlaps to a large extent with "[[rationality]]" and the adjective of "reason" in philosophical contexts is normally "[[Rationality|rational]]", rather than "reasoned" or "reasonable".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational Merriam Webster "rational"] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reasonable Merriam Webster "reasonable"].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers, [[Thomas Hobbes]] for example, also used the word ''ratiocination'' as a synonym for "reasoning".

==Philosophical history==
[[File:Goya Caprichos3.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Goya]], ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (''El sueño de la razón produce monstruos''), c. 1797]]
The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western [[philosophy]] and later western [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]], starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], or "self-correcting", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Habermas 1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Habermas |first1=Jürgen |authorlink=Jürgen Habermas |title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.

===Classical philosophy===
For many classical [[philosophers]], nature was understood [[teleology|teleologically]], meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with [[Pythagoras]] or [[Heraclitus]], the cosmos is even said to have reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''), reason was described by [[Plato]] as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (''[[thumos]]'') and the passions. [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, defined human beings as [[rational animal]]s, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of [[human nature]]. He ''defined'' the highest human happiness or well being (''[[eudaimonia]]'') as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean Ethics#Defining Happiness and the aim of the Ethics|Book 1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with [[monotheism]] and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the [[Neoplatonism|neo-platonist]] account of [[Plotinus]], the [[cosmos]] has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via [[Averroes]], came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the [[renaissance]], and they remain important in [[Iranian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;

===Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophy===

The [[early modern era]] was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in [[Europe]]. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hubert |last=Dreyfus |title=Telepistemology: Descartes' Last Stand |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/rtf/Limits_of_Telepresence_6_99.rtf |publisher= socrates.berkeley.edu |accessdate= February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same "[[natural law|laws of nature]]" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous [[world view]] that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|200px|René Descartes]]
Accordingly, in the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as "rational animals", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than "thinking things" along the lines of other "things" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.

In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt ''all'' knowledge – ''except'' that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, "Second Meditation".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This eventually became known as [[epistemological]] or "subject-centred" reason, because it is based on the ''knowing subject'', who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.

A contemporary of Descartes, [[Thomas Hobbes]] described reason as a broader version of "addition and subtraction" which is not limited to numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=De Corpore|url=https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|editor-last=Molesworth}}: "We must not therefore think that computation, that is, ratiocination, has place only in numbers, as if man were distinguished from other living creatures (which is said to have been the opinion of ''[[Pythagoras]]'') by nothing but the faculty of numbering; for ''magnitude, body, motion, time, degrees of quality, action, conception, proportion, speech and names'' (in which all the kinds of philosophy consist) are capable of addition and substraction {{sic}}. Now such things as we add or substract, that is, which we put into an account, we are said to ''consider'', in Greek λογίζεσθαι [''logizesthai''], in which language also συλλογίζεσθι [''syllogizesthai''] signifies to ''compute'', ''reason'', or ''reckon''."&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of reason is sometimes termed "calculative" reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that "No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come" but that "sense and memory" is absolute knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=VII. Of the ends, or resolutions of discourse|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;chapter=89830&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27}} and {{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan)|chapter=IX.

In the late 17th century, through the 18th century, [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]] developed Descartes' line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially [[skepticism|skeptical]] direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|chapter=XXVII On Identity and Diversity|origyear=1689|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=761&amp;chapter=80770&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|edition=12th|year=1824|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 1|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.IV.VI.

Hume famously remarked that, "We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=II.III.III.

Of the reason of animals|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.

In the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a "[[transcendental arguments|transcendental]]" self, or "I", was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge ([[epistemology]]), and understanding.

===Substantive and formal reason===

In the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason ({{lang-de|Vernunft}}) is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on "universal" laws.

Here [[practical reason]]ing is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s, and [[theory|theoretical]] reasoning the way humans posit universal [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason''; ''Critique of Practical Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under practical reason, the moral [[autonomy]] or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on [[religion|religious understanding]] and interpretation, or [[nature]] for their substance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the "[[categorical imperative]]", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|author2=translated by James W. Ellington [1785]|title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to Hume then, Kant insists that reason itself (German ''[[wikt:Vernunft|Vernunft]]'') has natural ends itself, the solution to the metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his "[[transcendental logic]]" which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002| chapter=On Kant's Socratism|title=Being After Rousseau|publisher=University of Chicago Press}} and Kant's own first preface to ''[[The Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], the "substantive unity" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question "How should I live?" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or "procedural." He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):

#'''Cognitive–instrumental reason''' is the kind of reason employed by the sciences. It is used to observe events, to predict and control outcomes, and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses;
#'''Moral–practical reason''' is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm, according to universalizable procedures (similar to Kant's categorical imperative); and
#'''Aesthetic reason''' is typically found in works of art and literature, and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody.

For Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the "[[lifeworld]]" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The critique of reason===

[[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]], and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of [[intersubjectivity]], or "spirit" in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.

Some thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other ''forms'' of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Habermas 1990"/&gt;

In the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to "re-orient" this critique of reason, or to recognize the "other voices" or "new departments" of reason:

For example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of [[communicative rationality|communicative reason]] that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', translated by Thomas McCarthy. Boston: Beacon Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as "that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness" in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006. See also Nikolas Kompridis, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 "So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean"], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8:3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], influenced by the 20th century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new "department" of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), 12; 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay "What is Enlightenment?", Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant's distinction between "private" and "public" uses of reason. This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:

*'''Private reason''' is the reason that is used when an individual is "a cog in a machine" or when one "has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, to have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant."
*'''Public reason''' is the reason used "when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a cog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity." In these circumstances, "the use of reason must be free and public."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment?", ''The Essential Foucault'', New York: The New Press, 2003, 43–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason compared to related concepts==

===Compared to logic===
{{Main article|Logic}}
The terms "logic" or "logical" are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term "reason" or with the concept of being "rational", or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern [[economics]], [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]] is assumed to equate to logically [[Consistency|consistent]] choice.

Reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct, although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hofstadter, ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', Vintage, 1979, {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reason is a type of [[thought]], and the word "[[logic]]" involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates, so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], especially ''Prior Analysis'' and ''Posterior Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Complete Works'' (2 volumes), Princeton, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-09950-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's [[neologism|newly coined word]] "[[syllogism]]" (''syllogismos'') identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to "the logical" (''hē logikē''), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?all_words=logiko/s&amp;all_words_expand=yes&amp;la=greek See this Perseus search, and compare English translations.] and see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph.jsp?l=logikw%3Ds&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=le/getai&amp;d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0049:book=1:section=1217b&amp;i=1#lexicon LSJ dictionary entry for λογικός, section II.2.b.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking, and symbolic thinking===
{{Main article|Causality|Symbols}}
As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of "[[association (psychology)|associative thinking]]", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Treatise of Human Nature]] of [[David Hume]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Book I, Part III, Sect. XVI].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|chapter=XVII Of Reason|origyear=1689|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80842|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of [[symbol]]s, as well as [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|indices and icons]], according to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Deacon, ''The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1998, {{ISBN|0-393-31754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is [[language]].

The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. [[Thomas Hobbes]] described the creation of "Markes, or Notes of remembrance" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Ch.4) as ''speech''. He used the word ''speech'' as an English version of the Greek word ''[[logos]]'' so that speech did not need to be communicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html#CHAPTERIV Leviathan Chapter IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html |date=2006-06-15 }}: "The Greeks have but one word, logos, for both speech and reason; not that they thought there was no speech without reason, but no reasoning without speech"&lt;/ref&gt; When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called "[[Sign (linguistics)|Signes]]" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (''logos''), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and ''[[nous]]'', and even uses the word "logos" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason, imagination, mimesis, and memory===
{{Main article|Imagination|Mimesis|Memory|Recollection}}
Reason and [[imagination]] rely on similar [[mental processes]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that ''phantasia'' (imagination: that which can hold images or ''phantasmata'') and ''phronein'' (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Anima]]'' III.i–iii; ''On Memory and Recollection'', ''On Dreams''&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or ''logos''. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.

The recent modern writings of [[Terrence Deacon]] and [[Merlin Donald]], writing about the [[origin of language]], also connect reason connected to not only [[language]], but also [[mimesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Mimesis in modern academic writing, starting with [[Erich Auerbach]], is a technical word, which is not necessarily exactly the same in meaning as the original Greek. See [[Mimesis]].&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically they describe the ability to create [[language]] as part of an internal modeling of [[reality]] specific to humankind. Other results are [[consciousness]], and [[imagination]] or [[fantasy]]. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]], to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.

As reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of "icons" or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p.172&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A dog might perceive the "meaning" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is ''eikasia'', in the philosophy of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the [[Meno]]'' Ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as ''dianoetic eikasia'' is the ''eikasia'' concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, ''signes'', and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible "objects of thought" as "foundations" (''hypothēses'' in Ancient Greek). This thinking (''dianoia'') is "...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' ''noēta''."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of ''mimesis'', often translated as ''imitation'' or ''representation''. Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p.169&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Mimēsis'' is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the ''Poetics''. In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to the translation of ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by Davis and [[Seth Benardete]] p. xvii, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...&lt;ref&gt;Davis is here using "poetic" in an unusual sense, questioning the contrast in Aristotle between action (''praxis'', the ''praktikē'') and making (''poēsis'', the ''poētikē''): "Human [peculiarly human] action is imitation of action because thinking is always rethinking. Aristotle can define human beings as at once rational animals, political animals, and imitative animals because in the end the three are the same."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in ''On Memory and Recollection''), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek ''anamnēsis'', normally translated as "recollection" was opposed to ''mneme'' or ''memory''. Memory, shared with some animals,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [[On Memory]] 450a 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also ''that'' something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of ''eikasia''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p.109&lt;/ref&gt; "...but nothing except man is able to recollect."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Hist. Anim. I.1.488b.25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, "To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Donald calls the same thing ''autocueing'', which he explains as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Modern Mind'' p.173 see also ''A Mind So Rare'' p.140–141&lt;/ref&gt; "Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational ''thinking''."

In a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in his essay "On Fairy Stories" that the terms "fantasy" and "enchantment" are connected to not only "....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires...." but also "...the origin of language and of the mind."

===Logical reasoning methods and argumentation===
Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inductive reasoning]]. [[Logic|Formal logic]] has been described as ''the science of deduction''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Richard. 1991. ''Formal logic: its scope and limits'', (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill:1.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as [[informal logic]] or [[critical thinking]].

====Deductive reasoning====
{{Main article|Deductive reasoning}}
A subdivision of [[Philosophy]] is [[Logic]].  Logic is the study of reasoning.  Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process.  One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in [[syllogism]]s like the following:

*Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
*Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
*Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

The reasoning in this argument is valid, because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.

====Inductive reasoning====
{{Main article|Inductive reasoning}}
Induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe [[category of being|properties or relations]] to objects or [[type (metaphysics)|types]] based on [[event (philosophy)|previous observations or experiences]], or to formulate general statements or [[law (principle)|law]]s based on limited observations of recurring [[phenomena]]l patterns.

Inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of [[probability]]. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.

A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the [[empiricist]] [[David Hume]]:
*Premise: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.
*Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.

====Abductive reasoning====
{{Main article|Abductive reasoning}}
Abductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of inductive reasoning, since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.

====Analogical reasoning====
{{Main article|Analogical reasoning}}
Analogical reasoning is reasoning from the particular to the particular. It is often used in [[case-based reasoning]], especially legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |authorlink=Doug Walton |date=2014 |chapter=Argumentation schemes for argument from analogy |editor-last=Ribeiro |editor-first=Henrique Jales |title=Systematic approaches to argument by analogy |series=Argumentation library |volume=25 |location=Cham; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=23–40 |isbn=9783319063331 |oclc=884441074 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-06334-8_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example follows:

*Premise 1: Socrates is human and mortal.
*Premise 2: Plato is human.
*Conclusion: Plato is mortal.

Analogical reasoning can be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning from a single example, but if it is intended as inductive reasoning it is a bad example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vickers |first=John |title=The Problem of Induction |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:

*Premise 1: Socrates is human and male.
*Premise 2: [[Ada Lovelace]] is human.
*Conclusion: Therefore Ada Lovelace is male.

====Fallacious reasoning====
{{Main article|Fallacy|Formal fallacy|Informal fallacy}}
Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as [[fallacy|fallacious reasoning]]. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a [[formal fallacy]] or an [[informal fallacy]].

Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word "formal" refers to this link to the ''form'' of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.

An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the ''content'', rather than mere ''structure'', of the argument.

==Traditional problems raised concerning reason==
Philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve [[knowledge]] of [[truth]] better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a [[eudaimonia|happy life]] more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).

===Reason versus truth, and "first principles"===
{{See also|Truth|First principle|Nous}}
Since [[classical antiquity|classical]] times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]]) concerning the role of reason in confirming [[truth]]. People use logic, [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], and [[inductive reasoning|induction]], to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Example: Aristotle ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b 981b]: τὴν ὀνομαζομένην σοφίαν περὶ τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς ὑπολαμβάνουσι πάντες: ὥστε, καθάπερ εἴρηται πρότερον, ὁ μὲν ἔμπειρος τῶν ὁποιανοῦν ἐχόντων αἴσθησιν εἶναι δοκεῖ σοφώτερος, ὁ δὲ τεχνίτης τῶν ἐμπείρων, χειροτέχνου δὲ ἀρχιτέκτων, αἱ δὲ θεωρητικαὶ τῶν ποιητικῶν μᾶλλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b English]: "...what is called Wisdom is concerned with the primary causes and principles, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman than the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than the productive."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b 1009b] ποῖα οὖν τούτων ἀληθῆ ἢ ψευδῆ, ἄδηλον: οὐθὲν γὰρ μᾶλλον τάδε ἢ τάδε ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ᾽ ὁμοίως. διὸ Δημόκριτός γέ φησιν ἤτοι οὐθὲν εἶναι ἀληθὲς ἢ ἡμῖν γ᾽ ἄδηλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b English] "Thus it is uncertain which of these impressions are true or false; for one kind is no more true than another, but equally so. And hence Democritus says that either there is no truth or we cannot discover it."&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to the question of what types of [[first principles]], or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, "[[first principles]]" are ''[[Arche|archai]]'', "starting points",&lt;ref&gt;For example Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a 983a]: ἐπεὶ δὲ φανερὸν ὅτι τῶν ἐξ '''ἀρχῆς''' αἰτίων δεῖ λαβεῖν '''ἐπιστήμην''' （τότε γὰρ εἰδέναι φαμὲν ἕκαστον, ὅταν τὴν '''πρώτην''' αἰτίαν οἰώμεθα '''γνωρίζειν'''） [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a English] "It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the '''primary''' causes, because it is when we think that we understand its '''primary''' cause that we claim to '''know''' each particular thing."&lt;/ref&gt; and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Example: ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0053%3Abekker+page%3D1139a 1139b]: ἀμφοτέρων δὴ τῶν '''νοητικῶν''' μορίων ἀλήθεια τὸ ἔργον. καθ᾽ ἃς οὖν μάλιστα ἕξεις ἀληθεύσει ἑκάτερον, αὗται ἀρεταὶ ἀμφοῖν. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1139a English] The attainment of truth is then the function of both the '''intellectual''' parts of the soul. Therefore their respective virtues are those dispositions that will best qualify them to attain truth.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plato&lt;ref&gt;Example: Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0167%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b 490b]: μιγεὶς τῷ ὄντι ὄντως, γεννήσας νοῦν καὶ ἀλήθειαν, γνοίη [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0094%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b English]: "Consorting with reality really, he would beget intelligence and truth, attain to knowledge"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''[[nous]]'' which was close in meaning to ''awareness'' or ''[[consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call ''noesis'', which is literally translated by "understanding" or intellect," and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by "awareness," an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness." "Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empiricism]] (sometimes associated with Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;However, the empiricism of Aristotle must certainly be doubted. For example in ''Metaphysics'' 1009b, cited above, he criticizes people who think knowledge might not be possible because, "They say that the impression given through sense-perception is necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both [[Empedocles]] and Democritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such opinions as these."&lt;/ref&gt; but more correctly associated with [[Great Britain|British]] philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], as well as their ancient equivalents such as [[Democritus]]) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that [[absolute knowledge]] is not attainable. [[Idealism]], (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a "higher" reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.

Philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Maimonides]], [[Aquinas]] and [[Hegel]] are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Étienne Gilson]] to try to show that reason and [[revelation]] are compatible. According to Hegel, "...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of [[History]], is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process."&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel [[Lectures on the Philosophy of History|''The Philosophy of History'']], p. 9, Dover Publications Inc., {{ISBN|0-486-20112-0}}; 1st ed. 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 17th century [[rationalist]]s, reason has often been taken to be a [[subjectivity|subjective faculty]], or rather the unaided ability ([[pure reason]]) to form concepts.  For [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], this was associated with [[mathematics]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts ([[time]] and [[space]]) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.

===Reason versus emotion or passion===
{{See also|Emotion|Passion (emotion)}}
After Plato and Aristotle,  [[western literature]] often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Stoic philosophy]] by contrast considered all passions undesirable.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason, as in the maxim "follow your heart".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Reason has been seen as a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably  in the work of [[David Hume]], and more recently  of [[Freud]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called ''[[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Rousseau]] first proposed, in his second ''[[Discourse on Inequality|Discourse]]'', that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Speech. Imagination, Origins: Rousseau and the Political Animal|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, "best suits his constitution"? Rousseau saw "two principles prior to reason" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rousseau|chapter=Preface|title=Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men or Second Discourse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Gourevitch|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, "Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the ''[[The Social Contract|Contrat Social]]'' and the moral education in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]''. All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity."

This quandary presented by Rousseau led to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways,  [[German Idealism]] after Kant, and major later figures such [[Nietzsche]], [[Bergson]], [[Husserl]], [[Max Scheler|Scheler]], and [[Heidegger]], remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or ''urges'' of ''reason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Freedom, Teleology, and Justification of Reason|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern [[nationalism]] comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist [[cosmopolitanism]] brings man ever further from his natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Rousseau and the Origins of Nationalism|last=Plattner|first=Marc|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=The Legacy of Rousseau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled ''[[Descartes' Error]]'' by [[Antonio Damasio]]. In it, Damasio presents the "[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic Marker Hypothesis]]" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as "gut feelings") are "intuitive signals" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.

===Reason versus faith or tradition===
{{Main article|Faith|Religion|Tradition}}
There are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly [[Fideism|fideist]] and others of which claim varying degrees of [[rationalism]]. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality, since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0618918248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459966578&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=god+delusion|title=The God Delusion|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|date=2008-01-16|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=9780618918249|edition=Reprint|language=English|quote="Scientists... see the fight for evolution as only one battle in a larger war: a looming war between supernaturalism on the one side and rationality on the other. "}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the [[theology|theologies]] and [[religion]]s such as [[Monotheism|classical monotheism]] typically do not claim to be [[irrationality|irrational]], there is often a perceived conflict or tension between [[faith]] and [[tradition]] on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of [[wisdom]], [[law]] and [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Strauss|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy|chapter=Progress or Return|first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|issue=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings |chapter=XVIII Of Faith and Reason, and their distinct Provinces.|origyear=1689|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80844|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism: 
* '''Reconciliation:''' Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains (among other things) why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Where-Conflict-Really-Lies-Naturalism/dp/0199812098/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459964688&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=where+the+conflict+really+lies|title=Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2011-12-09|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199812097|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Signs-Knowledge-God-Arguments/dp/0199661073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459966642&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stephen+evans+signs|title=Natural Signs and Knowledge of God: A New Look at Theistic Arguments|date=2012-12-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199661077|edition=Reprint|location=Oxford|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Non-overlapping magisteria:''' Evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain (or "magisterium").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html|title=Stephen Jay Gould, "Nonoverlapping Magisteria," 1997|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-04-06|quote="To say it for all my colleagues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature.

God could clinch the matter in his favour at any moment by staging a spectacular demonstration of his powers, one that would satisfy the exacting standards of science. Even the infamous Templeton Foundation recognized that God is a scientific hypothesis — by funding double-blind trials to test whether remote prayer would speed the recovery of heart patients. It didn't, of course, although a control group who knew they had been prayed for tended to get worse (how about a class action suit against the Templeton Foundation?)

*'''Unification:''' Theologian Joseph Ratzinger, later [[Benedict XVI]], asserted that "Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos, as the religion according to reason," referring to John 1:Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, usually translated as "In the beginning was the Word (Logos)." Thus, he said that the Christian faith is "open to all that is truly rational", and that the rationality of Western Enlightenment "is of Christian origin".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/cardinal-ratzinger-on-europe-s-crisis-of-culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Some commentators have claimed that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between "unaided" reason and [[faith]] in "[[revelation|revealed]]" truths—figuratively summarized as [[Athens]] and [[Jerusalem]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/When-Athens-Met-Jerusalem-Introduction/dp/0830829237/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459965696&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=athens+and+jerusalem|title=When Athens Met Jerusalem: An Introduction to Classical and Christian Thought|date=2009-05-21|publisher=IVP Academic|isbn=9780830829231|edition=58760th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Athens-Jerusalem-Lev-Shestov/dp/B0007FM164/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459965696&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=athens+and+jerusalem|title=Athens and Jerusalem|last=Shestov|first=Lev|date=1968|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Strauss]] spoke of a "Greater [[Western world|West]]" that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and [[Abrahamic]] revelation, including the [[Muslim]] lands. He was particularly influenced by the great [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosopher]] [[Farabi|Al-Farabi]]. To consider to what extent [[Eastern philosophy]] might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether [[dharma]] or [[tao]] may be equivalent to [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] (by which we mean ''[[physis]]'' in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the "discovery or invention of nature" and the "pre-philosophical equivalent of nature" was supplied by "such notions as 'custom' or 'ways{{' "}}, which appear to be ''really universal in all times and places''. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding ''archai'' (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions, the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature, such as [[Hinduism]], because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita'', [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]: "Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that can not be defined but is only to be experienced."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason in particular fields of study==

===Reason in political philosophy and ethics===
{{Main article|Political Philosophy|Ethics|The Good}}
[[Aristotle]] famously described reason (with language) as a part of [[human nature]], which means that it is best for humans to live "politically" meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small [[city state]] (''polis'' in Greek). For example...
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''] animal [''zōion''] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [''logos'']. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [''logos''] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [''polis'']. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the ''polis''], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. ([[Aristotle's Politics]] 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly [[Rousseau]]'s Second Discourse, and secondly, the [[Theory of Evolution]]. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the ''polis'' had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Politics I.2.1252b15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Friendship]] [''philia''] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to [[nature]] [''kata phusin'']; for people are by nature [''tēi phusei''] pairing [''sunduastikon''] more than political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''], inasmuch as the household [''oikos''] is prior [''proteron'' = earlier] and more necessary than the ''polis'' and making children is more common [''koinoteron''] with the animals. In the other animals, community [''koinōnia''] goes no further than this, but people live together [''sumoikousin''] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [''erga''] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [''eis to koinon'']. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [''chrēsimon''] and pleasure [''hēdu''] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. ([[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rousseau]] in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.

In other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of Evolution]].

The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by [[Karl Marx]], a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.

However, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as [[Geneva]], and [[Arcadia (utopia)|rural living]].

===Psychology===
{{Main article|Psychology of reasoning}}
Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.

Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is [[Rationality|rational]] or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the [[psychology of reasoning]]. [[Rationality]] is often divided into its respective [[Rationality#Theoretical and practical rationality|theoretical and practical counterparts]].

====Behavioral experiments on human reasoning====
Experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as [[Intelligence tests|intelligence]] or [[IQ]] tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the [[Wason test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Manktelow, K.I. 1999. ''Reasoning and Thinking (Cognitive Psychology: Modular Course.)''. Hove, Sussex:Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., ''If A then B'' and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., ''A or else B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., ''A is to the left of B'', or ''A happens after B'', and about quantified assertions, e.g., ''All the A are B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2006). ''How we reason''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developmental studies of children's reasoning====
Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's [[theory of cognitive development]] was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), Life-span developmental psychology (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuroscience of reasoning====
The biological functioning of the brain is studied by [[neurophysiologist]]s and [[neuropsychologist]]s. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists, for example, [[clinical psychologist]]s and [[psychotherapists]] work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.

===Computer science===

====Automated reasoning====
{{Main article|Automated reasoning|Computational logic}}
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], scientists study and use [[automated reasoning]] for diverse applications including [[automated theorem proving]] the [[formal semantics of programming languages]], and [[formal specification]] in [[software engineering]].

====Meta-reasoning====

Meta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning.  In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Meta-reasoning: A Survey |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2002|volume=2408/2002|issue=65|first=Stefania |last=Costantini |doi=10.1007/3-540-45632-5_11 |pages=253–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires a programming language capable of [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]], the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.

===Evolution of reason===

[[File:Capuchin monkeys sharing.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Dan Sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness.]]
A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists [[Dan Sperber]] and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs ([[confirmation bias]]). Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like [[science]]. They suggest that there are not just individual, but [[group selection]] pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0140525X10000968 |url = https://repository.upenn.edu/goldstone/15/| volume = 34| issue = 2| pages = 57–74| last1 = Mercier| first1 = Hugo| last2 = Sperber| first2 = Dan| title = Why Do Humans Reason?

[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|right|French historian [[Ernest Renan]] defended the right to exist in "[[What is a Nation?]]" (1882).]]

The '''right to exist''' is said to be an attribute of [[nation]]s. According to an [[What is a Nation?|essay]] by the nineteenth century French philosopher [[Ernest Renan]], a state has the right to exist when individuals are willing to sacrifice their own interests for the community it represents. Unlike [[self-determination]], the right to exist is an attribute of states rather than of peoples. It is not a right recognized in international law. The phrase has featured prominently in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] since the 1950s.

The right to exist of a ''de facto'' state may be balanced against another state's right to [[territorial integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagerwall, Anne. "[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/6/5/8/p236585_index.html The Paradoxical Protection of State's Territorial Integrity by the United Nations: Law versus Power?]", Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Law and Society Association, Hilton Bonaventure, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the right to exist trace it back to the "right of existence", said to be a fundamental right of states recognized by writers on international law for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;Oppenheim, Lassa and Ronald Roxburgh, (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vxJ1Jwmyw0EC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=#PPA192,M1 International Law]'', p. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
[[Thomas Paine]] used the phrase "right to exist" to refer to forms of government, arguing that representative government has a right to exist, but that hereditary government does not.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas, "Dissertation on the First Principles of Government" (1795), ''The Life and Works of Thomas Paine,'' 5:221--25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Sir [[Walter Scott]] argued for the "right to exist in the Greek people".&lt;ref name="google249"&gt;Scott, Walter, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=nA9uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq= The Greek Revolution]", ''Edinburgh Annual Register of 1823'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Greeks were then revolting against Turkish rule.) According to Renan's "[[What is a Nation?]]" (1882), "So long as this moral
consciousness [called a nation] gives proof of its strength by the sacrifices which demand the abdication of the individual to
the advantage of the community, it is legitimate and has the right to exist. If doubts arise regarding its
frontiers, consult the populations in the areas under dispute."&lt;ref name="Renan"&gt;[[Ernest Renan|Renan, Ernest]], "[http://ig.cs.tu-berlin.de/oldstatic/w2001/eu1/dokumente/Basistexte/Renan1882EN-Nation.pdf What is a Nation?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319081440/http://ig.cs.tu-berlin.de/oldstatic/w2001/eu1/dokumente/Basistexte/Renan1882EN-Nation.pdf |date=2013-03-19 }}", 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; Existence is not a historical right, but "a daily [[wikt:plebiscite|plebiscite]], just as an individual's existence is a perpetual affirmation of life," Renan said.&lt;ref name="Renan"/&gt; The phrase gained enormous usage in reference to the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918. "If Turkey has a right to exist – and the Powers are very prompt to assert that she has – she possesses an equally good right to defend herself against all attempts to imperil her political existence," wrote Eliakim and Robert Littell in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Littell, Eliakim and Robert S. Littell, "The Reign of Terror in Macedonia", ''The Living Age,'' April–June 1903, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, a nation's right to exist is not questioned, and is therefore not asserted.

==Examples==
===[[Armenia]]===
The right to exist of Armenia became known as the [[Armenian Question]] during the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, and would again be asked during the [[Armenian Genocide]] in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Riddell|title=To the Masses: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the Communist International, 1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFLoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WnYtVcLYC8KENo7IgcAK&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2014|publisher=Brill Academic|isbn= 978-90-04-28803-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque nation]]===
According to [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalists, "[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Euzkadi]] (the name of our country in our own language) is the country of the Basques with as such right to exist independently as a nation as [[Poland]] or [[Ireland]]. The Basques are a very ancient people..."&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism, Naunihal Singh, Mittal Publications, 2006, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Chechnya]]===
The phrase, "right to exist" has also been used in reference to the right of [[Chechens]] (in the eyes of supporters) to establish a state independent from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya, the Case for Independence''. Page 6. Quote: "The second basis for dismissing Chechnya's right to existence is that the country had its chance at independence from 1996 to 1999..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000003-000130&amp;lang=1 |title=Prague Watchdog - Crisis in Chechnya - An empire on the verge of collapse |publisher=Watchdog.cz |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21|quote=Russia’s numerous separatist movements quickly shrank to nothing, but they will once again return to life if their '''''right to exist''''', even if only in the distant future, is confirmed by the precedents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And here the example of Chechnya may prove to be formative.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Israel]]===
{{further|Legitimacy of Israel|Jewish question}}
In 1947, a United Nations General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an "Arab State" and a "Jewish State" to exist within [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. This has been described by Prof. Joseph Massad as "a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title='The rights of Israel'|author= Prof. Joseph Massad |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115684218533873.html |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 12 Sep 2012| quote= "In international law, countries are recognised as existing de facto and de jure, but there is no notion that any country has a 'right to exist', let alone that other countries should recognise such a right. Nonetheless, the modification by Israel of its claim that others had to recognise its 'right to exist' to their having to recognise 'its right to exist as Jewish state' is pushed most forcefully at present, as it goes to the heart of the matter of what the Zionist project has been all about since its inception, and addresses itself to the extant discrepancy between Israel's own understanding of its rights to realise these Zionist aims and the international community's differing understanding of them. This is a crucial matter, as all these rights that Israel claims to possess, but which are not recognised internationally, translate into its rights to colonise Palestinian land, to occupy it, and to discriminate against the non-Jewish Palestinian people."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]], precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral declaration of independence, support from neighboring Arab states escalated the 1947–48 Civil War in [[Mandatory Palestine]] into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The legal and territorial status of [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.

According to [[Ilan Pappé]], Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist was part of [[Folke Bernadotte]]'s 1948 peace plan.&lt;ref name=pappe&gt;Ilan Pappé, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAJZCKAwtPMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Making of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1947-1951]'', I.B.Tauris, 1994, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states gave this as their reason to reject the plan.&lt;ref name=pappe/&gt; In the 1950s UK MP [[Herbert Morrison]] cited then Egyptian leader [[Abdel Nasser]] as saying "Israel is an artificial State which must disappear." .&lt;ref&gt;*"Foreign Affairs; A Time to Find a Solution for Palestine", ''New York Times'' Aug 2, 1958. "Most Arab leaders do not even dare admit Israel's right to exist. They fear assassination by fanatics."&lt;br/&gt;*''Parliamentary debates: Official report:'' Volume 547 (1956), Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons: "I will give two short quotations, one from Colonel Nasser, the Prime Minister of Egypt, on 8th May, 1954. It is an extremist point of view based on the belief and the assertion that Israel has no right to exist at all."&lt;br/&gt;*"Arms and the Middle East", ''Toledo Blade'', Sep 30, 1955. "the Arabs still refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist."&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was described as the central one between Israel and the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;"And underlying all of the questions dividing Israel and its Arab neighbors, one issue is central: Does Israel have a right to exist?" (Farrell, James Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AnI9AAAAMAAJ&amp;q= It has come to pass]'', 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the June 1967 war, Egyptian spokesman Mohammed H. el-Zayyat stated that Cairo had accepted Israel's right to exist since the signing of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Egyptian-Israeli armistice]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Whetten"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whetten |first=Lawrence L.|title=The Canal War: Four-Power Conflict in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AY9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= |publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1974|isbn=0-262-23069-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that this did not imply [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]] of Israel.&lt;ref name="Whetten"/&gt; In September, the Arab leaders adopted a hardline "three nos" position in the [[Khartoum Resolution]]: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khartoum Resolution|url=http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/khartoum-resolution/p14841?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=7 June 2012|quote=The Khartoum Resolution passed by the Arab League in the wake of the 1967 war is famous for the "Three Nos" articulated in the third paragraph: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520124345/http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/khartoum-resolution/p14841?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|archivedate=20 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in November, Egypt accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]], which implied acceptance of Israel's right to exist. At the same time, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] urged [[Yasser Arafat]] and other Palestinian leaders to reject the resolution. "You must be our irresponsible arm," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Anne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CRbNAZFfggwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq= Nasser]'', p. 150. {{ISBN|1-904341-83-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; King Hussein of Jordan also acknowledged that Israel had a right to exist at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Dennon, Leon, "Key to Peace in Mideast", ''Owosso Argus-Press'', Nov 25, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Syria rejected Resolution 242, saying that it, "refers to Israel's right to exist and it ignores the right of the [Palestinian] refugees to return to their homes."&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, Yehuda, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv8R-o_b0acC&amp;dq= Israel, Jordan, and the Peace Process]'', 1999. Syracuse University Press, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon assuming the [[Prime Minister of Israel|premier]]ship in 1977, [[Menachem Begin]] spoke as follows:
Our right to exist—have you ever heard of such a thing? Would it enter the mind of any Briton or Frenchman, Belgian or Dutchman, Hungarian or Bulgarian, Russian or American, to request for its people recognition of its right to exist? ..... Mr. Speaker: From the Knesset of Israel, I say to the world, our very existence per se is our right to exist!&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1977-1979/1%20Statement%20to%20the%20%20Knesset%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begi Statement to the Knesset by Prime Minister Begin upon the presentation of his government, June 20, 1977]", Volumes 4–5: 1977–1979, Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', in 1988 [[Yasser Arafat]] declared that the Palestinians had accepted Israel's right to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a6fc921c-3386-11d9-b6c3-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1TIo4nrB7 |title=After Arafat, a chance for change |publisher=FT.com |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that "the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/backgrounders/revision_of_plo_covenant.html#.WGSFAHpo-G8|title=You are being redirected...|website=archive.adl.org|access-date=2017-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501153721/http://archive.adl.org/backgrounders/revision_of_plo_covenant.html#.WGSFAHpo-G8|archive-date=2017-05-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] demanded the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], which the Palestinian Authority rejected.&lt;ref name="Ronen, Gil, "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/124218|title=Olmert to Demand PA Accept Israel as Jewish State|website=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalising the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], with a penalty of up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;Shragai, Nadav, "[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1088712.html Knesset okays initial bill to outlaw denial of 'Jewish state']", ''Haaretz'', May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the PA Ambassador to India, Adli Sadeq, wrote in the official PA daily: "They [Israelis] have a common mistake or misconception by which they fool themselves, assuming that Fatah accepts them and recognizes the right of their state to exist, and that it is Hamas alone that loathes them and does not recognize the right of this state to exist. They ignore the fact that this state, based on a fabricated [Zionist] enterprise, never had any shred of a right to exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In a different part of the article the PA ambassador explained this explicitly: "There are no two Palestinians who disagree over the fact that Israel exists, and recognition of it is restating the obvious. But recognition of its right to exist is something else, different from recognition of its [physical] existence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2011 Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in a speech to the Dutch Parliament that the Palestinian people recognise Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by "recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967." 
&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/We-recognize-Israel-they-should-recognize-Palestine 'We recognize Israel, they should recognize Palestine']. ''[[JPost]]'', June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Hamas Prime Minister [[Ismail Haniyeh]] reiterated that the Palestinian Arabs as a whole will never recognize Israel: "We had two wars...but Palestinians did not and will not recognize Israel".&lt;ref&gt;"Hamas: Palestinians will never recognize Israel", Friday, June 28, 2013 |  Israel Today Staff.&lt;/ref&gt;

John V. Whitbeck argued that Israel's insistence on a right to exist forces Palestinians to provide a moral justification for their own suffering.&lt;ref name="Whitbeck"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html |title=What 'Israel's right to exist' means to Palestinians |last=Whitbeck |first=John V. |date=February 2, 2007 |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that no state has the right to exist, that the concept was invented in the 1970s, and that Israel's right to exist can not be accepted by the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/200506__/ On the Future of Democracy Noam Chomsky interviewed by John P. Titlow], Dragonfire, June, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

International law scholar [[Anthony Carty]] observed in 2013 that “the question whether Israel has a legal right to exist might appear to be one of the most emotively charged in the vocabulary of international law and politics. It evokes immediately the ‘exterminationist’ rhetoric of numerous Arab and Islamic politicians and ideologues, not least the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|present President of Iran]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carty|first1=Anthony|journal=The Modern Law Review|date=January 2013|volume=76|issue=1|pages=158–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novorossiya===
Supporters of an [[Novorossiya (confederation)|autonomous Novorossiya]] in eastern [[Ukraine]] equally argue for a Novorossiyan right to exist. Due to ongoing media controversy around the driving forces behind the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|unrest in Ukraine]], however, the term carries significant weight. [[RT News]] reported in December 2014 that Soika, a self-professed 23-year old Slovak volunteer who had then been in [[Donbass]] for two months, told them: "Novorossiya has the right to exist. Although Europe declares the rights of peoples, it recognizes them in a selective manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rt.com/op-edge/211703-donbass-west-war-europe-clashes/ What brings prosperous Westerners to join E.

===North Korea===
In the context of [[South Korea]]'s and the [[United States]] non-recognition of the North Korean state and what the North views as a 'hostile policy' pursued by the US, the North's government frequently accuses the US of denying the 'right of existence' of North Korea. For instance, a 2017 Foreign Ministry statement declared, "The DPRK will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence." North Korea itself does not recognise the right of existence of the Republic of Korea in the south. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-us-to-ashes/news-story/d735f25866cc4b089fad03865908dc91|title=Just what is North Korea up to now?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Nations]] formally awarded Britain a mandate over [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1922, when Jews made up 11% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecf.org.il/issues/issue/1087|title=1922 Census of Palestine|first=ECF|last=Database|website=ecf.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land west of the Jordan River was under direct British administration until 1948, while the land east of the Jordan was a semi-autonomous region known as Transjordan Emirate, and gained independence in 1946. 
In 1936-39 there was a [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|nationalist uprising]] by Palestinian Arabs against British colonial rule and [[Chronology of Aliyah in modern times|mass Jewish immigration into Palestine]].

In 1947, a [[United Nations]] General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an "Arab State" and a "Jewish State" to exist within Palestine in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. This has been described by Prof. [[Joseph Massad]] as "a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]], precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected this and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral [[Israeli declaration of independence|declaration of independence]], support from neighboring Arab states escalated the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] into the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The legal and territorial status of Israel and Palestine is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.

In June 2009 [[Barack Obama]] said "Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's."&lt;ref name="bbc- obama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8083107.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Obama on Israeli-Palestinian 'stalemate' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'', in 1988 [[Yasser Arafat]] declared that the Palestinians accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]], which would guarantee ''"the right to exist in peace and security for all".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PAUL LEWIS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/14/world/arafat-in-geneva-calls-on-israelis-to-join-in-talks.html?src=pm |title=ARAFAT, IN GENEVA, CALLS ON ISRAELIS TO JOIN IN TALKS |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-12-14 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that "the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid."&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"/&gt;However, the actual wording of the revision only stated the provision would be removed at a future date; the non-recognition of Israel remains in the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iris.org.il/pncvote.htm|title=Peace Watch: PLO Charter Wasn't Changed|website=www.iris.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Israel-PLO%20Recognition%20-%20Exchange%20of%20Letters%20betwe|title=Israel-PLO Recognition: Exchange of Letters between PM Rabin and Chairman Arafat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] demanded the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], which the Palestinian Authority rejected.&lt;ref name="Ronen, Gil, "/&gt; The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalizing the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], with a penalty of up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

In 2011, [[Palestinian Authority President]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in a speech to the [[Dutch parliament]] in [[the Hague]] that the Palestinian people recognize Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by "recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the [[Israeli-occupied territories|land occupied in 1967]]."

Israeli government ministers [[Naftali Bennett]] and [[Danny Danon]] have repeatedly rejected the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|creation of a Palestinian state]], with Bennett stating "I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state."&lt;ref&gt;David Remnick (21 January 2013), [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/21/130121fa_fact_remnick The settlers move to annex the West Bank—and Israeli politics.] ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4446604,00.html|title=Bennett: Palestinian state a mistake, will work against it|date=28 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett stated that "relinquishing control of the West Bank would expose Israel's home front to infiltration tunnels leading into the heartland of Israel," citing the case of Gaza as a scenario that could repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Bennett-If-Israel-leaves-West-Bank-well-have-terror-tunnels-leading-into-our-heartland-370222|title=Bennett: If Israel leaves West Bank, we'll have terror tunnels leading into our heartland|work=Jerusalem Post|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2011 interview with Teymoor Nabili on Al Jazeera English, [[Danny Danon]] said "There is place only for one state on the land of Israel....

Abbas said he sought [[United Nations]] recognition of a Palestinian state only after the Israeli government refused "the terms of reference of the peace process and the cessation of [[Israeli settlements|settlement building]]" in the [[occupied territories]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Modelframework.JPG|thumb|420px|Illustration of the SEQUAL framework]] --&gt;
The '''SEQUAL framework''' is [[systems modelling]] [[reference model]] for evaluating the quality of models. The SEQUAL framework, which stands for "semiotic quality framework" is developed by [[John Krogstie]] and others since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Kro06"&gt;[[John Krogstie]] et al. (2006). [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ejis/journal/v15/n1/pdf/3000598a.pdf "Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework"]. In: ''European Journal of Information Systems'' (2006) 15, pp.91–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEQUAL framework is a so-called "top-down quality framework", which is based on [[semiotics|semiotic]] theory, such as the works of [[Charles W. Morris]]. Building on these theory it "defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling".&lt;ref name="Men06"&gt;Jan Mendling et al. (2006) [http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV83Mendling.pdf "On the Correlation between Process Model Metrics and Errors"] Conference paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usefulness, according to Mendling et al. (2006), was confirmed in a 2002 experiment by Moody et al.&lt;ref&gt;D.L. Moody, et al. (2002). "Evaluating the quality of process models: Empirical testing of a quality framework". In: Stefano Spaccapietra et al. (ed.) ''Conceptual Modeling - ER 2002, Proceedings, LNCS 2503'', pp. 380-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that "[[conceptual model]]s can be considered as sets of
statements in a [[language]], and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms". A first semiotic
framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling".&lt;ref&gt;O.I. Lindland, G. Sindre and [[Arne Sølvberg]] (1994) "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling". In: ''IEEE Software'' 11(2), 42–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: 
* syntactic,
* semantic, and
* pragmatic quality

The framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models".&lt;ref&gt;KROGSTIE J, LINDLAND OI and SINDRE G (1995) "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models". In:  ''Proceedings of the IFIP8.1 Working Conference on Information Systems Concepts (ISCO3): Towards a Consolidation of Views, 28–30 March, Marburg, Germany'' (FALKENBERG E, HESS W and OLIVE E, Eds), Chapman &amp; Hall: London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2002 article "Quality of interactive models"&lt;ref&gt;KROGSTIE J and JøRGENSEN HD (2002) "Quality of interactive models". In: ''First International Workshop on Conceptual Modelling Quality (IWCMQ’02), 11 October 2002''. (OLIVE A, YOSHIKAWA M and YU E, Eds), Springer Verlag: Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Krogstie &amp; Jørgensen extended the initial framework adding
more levels of Stamper’s semiotic ladder.&lt;ref&gt;STAMPER R (1996) "Signs, norms, and information systems". In: ''Signs at Work''. B. Holmqvist et al. (Eds). Walter de Gruyter: Berlin, Germany. pp 349–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

== SEQUAL framework topics ==
[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] is an integral part of many technical fields, including [[engineering]], [[economics]], and [[software]] engineering. In this context, a model is a formal representation of an organizational system, such as a [[business model]] or a formal description of software in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]].

=== Model activation ===
Model activation, according to [[John Krogstie]] (2006),&lt;ref name="Kro06"/&gt; is the process by which a model affects [[reality]]. Model activation involves actors interpreting the model and to some extent adjusting their behaviour accordingly. This process can be:
* ''automated'', where a software component interprets the model,
* ''manual'', where the model guides the actions of human actors, or
* ''interactive'', where prescribed aspects of the model are automatically interpreted and ambiguous parts are left to the users to resolve.

=== Sets in the Quality Framework ===
The Quality Framework works with a set of eight items:
* A: Actors that develop or have to relate to (parts of) the model. Can be persons or tools.
* L: What can be expressed in the modeling language
* M: What is expressed in the model
* D: What can be expressed about the domain (area of interest)
* K: The explicit knowledge of the participating persons
* I: What the persons in the audience interpret the model to say
* T: What relevant tools interpret the model to say
* G: The goals of the modeling

=== Physical quality ===
The three main aspects of physical quality are: 
* ''Externalization'' or the question "Is it possible to externalize knowledge by using the model language?",
* ''Internalizability'' about model persistence and availability, and
* ''Basically'' or the question "Is the model language able to express the model domain?"

''Externalization'' is presenting the modeller's concept in some model form for others to make sense of it. Other people can have look on it and can discuss. How other people perceives the model is a matter of internalization. After perceiving the model in their own way they can discuss and change their mind accordingly. To make sense others, it is better to have some model  language in common. Physical quality refers to the possibility of externalizing models by using model language that should be available and of course in persistence manner to be  internalized by audiences.

''How available is the model to audience?'' Availability depends on distributability, especially when members of the audience are geographically dispersed. Then, a model which is an electronically distributable format will be more easily distributed than one which must be printed on paper and sent by ordinary mail or fax. It may also matter exactly what is distributed, e.g. the model in an editable form or merely in an output format.

How persistent is the model, how protected is it against loss or damage? This also includes previous versions of the model, if these are relevant. E.g. for a model on disk, the physical quality will be higher if there is a backup copy, or even higher if this backup is on another disk whose failure is independent of the originals. Similarly, for models on paper, the amount and security of backup copies will be essential.

===Empirical quality===
To evaluate empirical quality, the model should be well externalized. Main aspects are: 
* Ergonomics,
* readability,
* layout, and
* information theory.

Basically empirical quality is about the question "Is the model easily readable?". Empirical quality deals with the variety of elements distinguished, error frequencies when being written or read, coding (shapes of boxes) and ergonomics for Computer-Human Interaction for documentation and modeling-tools. Ergonomics is the study of workplace design and the physical and psychological impact it has on workers. This quality is related to readability and layout. There are different factors that have an important impact on visual emphasis  like size, solidity, foreground/background differences, colour (red attracts the eye more than other colours),change(blinking or moving symbols attract attention), position and so on.

For graph aesthetics there may be different consideration(Battista, 1994, [[Roberto Tamassia|Tamassia]], 1988) like angles between edges not be too small, minimize the number of bends along edges, minimize the number of crossings between edges, place nodes with high degree in the centre of the drawing, have symmetry of sons in hierarchies, have uniform density of nodes in the drawing, have verticality of hierarchical structures and so on.

===Syntactical quality===
Syntactic quality is the correspondence between the model M and the language extension L of the language in which the model is written. Three aspects here are:
* ''Error detection'': During a modeling session, some syntactical errors--- syntactic incompleteness --- should be allowed on a temporary basis. For instance, although the DFD language requires that all processes are linked to a flow, it is difficult to draw a process and a flow simultaneously. Syntactical completeness has to be checked upon user's request. So, in contrast to implicit checks where the tool is ``forcing'' the user to follow the language syntax, explicit check can only detect and report on existing errors. The user has to make the corrections.
* ''Error correction'': to replace a detected error with a correct statement

===Semantic quality===
What is expressed in the model?
The semantic goals of this framework are: 
* Validity; if all the statements in the model are correct and related to the problem. M\D = Ø
* Completeness; if the model contains all relevant and correct statements to solve this problem. D\M = Ø

===Perceived semantic quality===
Perceived semantic quality is the relation between an actor's interpretation of a model and his/her knowledge of the domain.
* Perceived validity I\K = Ø
* Perceived completeness K\I = Ø

===Pragmatic quality===
Pragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and people's interpretation of it. Comprehension is the only pragmatic goal in the framework. It is very important that people that read the model, understand it. No solution is good if no-one understands it. Pragmatic quality relates to the effect the model have on the participants and the world. Four aspects is treated specifically, that: 
* the human interpretation of the model is correct relative to what is meant.
* the tool interpretation is correct relative to what is meant to be expressed in the model.
* the participants learn based on the model.
* the domain is changed (preferably in a positive direction relative to the goal of modeling).

=== Social quality ===
The goal for the social quality is agreement. Agreement about knowledge, interpretation and model. Agreement is achieved if perceived semantic quality and comprehension are achieved. There is relative agreement and absolute agreement. For the three agreement parts (knowledge, interpretation and model) we can define:
* Relative agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are consistent.
* Absolute agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are equal.

=== Knowledge quality ===
Degree of internalization of existing organizational reality.
* Knowledge in domain is "complete": D\K = Ø.
* Knowledge in domain is "valid": K\D = Ø.

Activities for improvement:
* Stakeholder identification
* Knowledge source identification
* Research and investigation
* Participant selection
* Participant training
* Problem definition

===Language quality===
To receive good language quality it is important that:
* The language is appropriate to the domain.
* The language is appropriate to the participants' knowledge of modeling languages
* The language appropriate to express the knowledge of the participants

If the language quality is good, it will improve the participants' interpretation and other technical actors' interpretation.  
For additional detail, see [[the quality of modelling languages]]

===Organizational quality===
The organizational quality of the model relates to:
* That all statements in the model contribute to fulfilling the goals of modeling, or ''Organizational goal validity''.
* That all the goals of modeling are addressed through the model, or ''Organizational goal completeness''.

== Alternative quality framework ==
An alternative quality framework is the ''Guidelines of Modeling'' (GoM) based on general [[accounting]] principles. The framework "include the six principles of correctness, clarity, relevance, comparability, economic efficiency, and systematic design".&lt;ref name="Men06"/&gt; It was operationalized for [[Event-driven Process Chains]] and also tested in experiments &lt;ref&gt;J. Becker, M. Rosemann, and C. von Uthmann. (2000). "Guidelines of Business Process Modeling". In: [[W.M.P. van der Aalst]] et al. editors, ''Business Process Management. Models, Techniques, and Empirical Studies'', Springer, Berlin et al. Pp. 30-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

An other alternative modelling process quality framework actually based on SEQUAL is the "Quality of Modelling" framework (QoMo). QoMo is still a "preliminary modelling process oriented, based on knowledge state transitions, cost of the activities bringing such transitions about, and a goal structure for activities-for-modelling. Such goals are directly linked to concepts of SEQUAL".&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick van Bommel]] et al. (2007).

The '''Scheveningen system''' is a method of organizing a [[chess]] match between two teams.  Each player on one team plays each player on the other team {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|p=308}}.  The team with the highest number of games won is the winner.  This system is a popular way to create [[Grandmaster norm|title norm]] opportunities {{harvcol|Karpov|Roshal|1980|p=22}}.

The system was first used in a tournament in [[Scheveningen]] in 1923.  The idea behind it was that a team of ten Dutch players could face ten foreign [[chess master|masters]].  This has the intention of giving the players on the team experience against strong competition {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''sequence space''' is a [[vector space]] whose elements are infinite [[sequence]]s of [[real number|real]] or [[complex numbers]]. Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''' of real or complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally  identified with the set of all possible [[infinite sequence]]s with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].

The most important sequence spaces in analysis are the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like [[convergent sequence]]s or [[Sequence space#c, c0 and c00|null sequences]] form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with the [[Supremum norm|sup norm]]. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fréchet space]] called [[FK-space]].

==Definition==

Let '''K''' denote the field either of real or complex numbers.  Denote by '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; the set of all sequences of scalars
:&lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}},\quad x_n\in\mathbf{K}.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be turned into a [[vector space]] by defining [[vector addition]] as
:&lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} + (y_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} \stackrel{\rm{def}}{=} (x_n + y_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[scalar multiplication]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} := (\alpha x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;
A '''sequence space''' is any linear subspace of '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces===
{{see also|Lp space{{!}}L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; space|L-infinity}}
For 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is the subspace of '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of all sequences ''x'' = ('''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n |x_n|^p &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''p'' ≥ 1, then the real-valued operation &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_p&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p = \left(\sum_n|x_n|^p\right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;
defines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In fact, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[complete metric space]] with respect to this norm, and therefore is a [[Banach space]].

If 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, then ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; does not carry a norm, but rather a [[metric space|metric]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \sum_n |x_n-y_n|^p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p'' = ∞, then ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is defined to be the space of all bounded sequences.  With respect to the norm
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_\infty = \sup_n |x_n|,&lt;/math&gt;
ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is also a Banach space.

===''c'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''c''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;===
The space of [[Limit of a sequence|convergent sequence]]s ''c'' is a sequence space.  This consists of all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; such that lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''→∞&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; exists.  Since every convergent sequence is bounded, ''c'' is a linear subspace of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is, moreover, a closed subspace with respect to the infinity norm, and so a Banach space in its own right.

The subspace of null sequences ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all sequences whose limit is zero.  This is a closed subspace of ''c'', and so again a Banach space.

The subspace of eventually zero sequences ''c''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all sequences which have only finitely many nonzero elements. This is not a closed subspace and therefore is not a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. For example, the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; has 1/k for the first n entries and is zero everywhere else (i.e. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 1/2, ..., 1/n, 0, ...)) is Cauchy w.r.t. infinity norm but not convergent (to a sequence in ''c''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Other sequence spaces===
The space of bounded [[series (mathematics)|series]], denote by [[Bs_space|bs]], is the space of sequences ''x'' for which
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_n \left\vert \sum_{i=0}^n x_i \right\vert &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
This space, when equipped with the norm
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_{bs} = \sup_n \left\vert \sum_{i=0}^n x_i \right\vert,&lt;/math&gt;
is a Banach space isometrically isomorphic to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, via the linear mapping
:&lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} \mapsto \left(\sum_{i=0}^n x_i\right)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The subspace ''cs'' consisting of all convergent series is a subspace that goes over to the space ''c'' under this isomorphism.

The space Φ or &lt;math&gt;c_{00}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the space of all infinite sequences with only a finite number of non-zero terms (sequences with [[finite support]]).  This set is [[dense set|dense]] in many sequence spaces.

== Properties of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces and the space ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ==
{{see also|c space}}
The space ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the only ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space that is a [[Hilbert space]], since any norm that is induced by an inner product should satisfy the [[parallelogram law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\|x+y\|_p^2 + \|x-y\|_p^2= 2\|x\|_p^2 + 2\|y\|_p^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting two distinct unit vectors for ''x'' and ''y'' directly shows that the identity is not true unless ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

Each ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is distinct, in that ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is a strict subset of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; whenever ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''; furthermore, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is not linearly [[isomorphic]] to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; when&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''s''.  In fact, by Pitt's theorem {{harv|Pitt|1936}}, every bounded linear operator from ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Compact operator|compact]] when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''.  No such operator can be an isomorphism; and further, it cannot be an isomorphism on any infinite-dimensional subspace of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;, and is thus said to be [[strictly singular]].

If 1&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, then the [[dual space|(continuous) dual space]] of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is isometrically isomorphic to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''q'' is the [[Hölder conjugate]] of ''p'': 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+ 1/''q''&amp;nbsp;= 1.  The specific isomorphism associates to an element ''x'' of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; the functional
:&lt;math&gt;L_x(y) = \sum_n x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;
for ''y'' in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.  [[Hölder's inequality]] implies that ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a bounded linear functional on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, and in fact
:&lt;math&gt;|L_x(y)| \le \|x\|_q\,\|y\|_p&lt;/math&gt;
so that the operator norm satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\|L_x\|_{(\ell^p)^*} \stackrel{\rm{def}}{=}\sup_{y\in\ell^p, y\not=0} \frac{|L_x(y)|}{\|y\|_p} \le \|x\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, taking ''y'' to be the element of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;y_n = \begin{cases}0&amp;\rm{if}\ x_n=0\\
x_n^{-1}|x_n|^q &amp;\rm{if}\ x_n\not=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
gives ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that in fact
:&lt;math&gt;\|L_x\|_{(\ell^p)^*} = \|x\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, given a bounded linear functional ''L'' on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, the sequence defined by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''L''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the mapping &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto L_x&lt;/math&gt; gives an isometry
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_q : \ell^q \to (\ell^p)^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The map
:&lt;math&gt;\ell^q\xrightarrow{\kappa_q}(\ell^p)^*\xrightarrow{(\kappa_q^*)^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
obtained by composing κ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; with the inverse of its [[Dual space#Transpose of a continuous linear map|transpose]] coincides with the [[Reflexive space#Definitions|canonical injection]] of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; into its [[double dual]].  As a consequence ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[reflexive space]]. By [[abuse of notation]], it is typical to identify ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; with the dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;: (ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then reflexivity is understood by the sequence of identifications (ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The space ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the space of all sequences converging to zero, with norm identical to  ||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a closed subspace of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, hence a Banach space. The [[dual space|dual]] of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; the dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;. For the case of natural numbers index set, the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are [[separable space|separable]], with the sole exception of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.  The dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[ba space]].

The spaces ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; (for 1&amp;nbsp;≤ ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞) have a canonical unconditional [[Schauder basis]] {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;| ''i''&amp;nbsp;= 1, 2,…}, where ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sequence which is zero but for a 1 in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; entry.

The space ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt; has the [[Schur's property|Schur property]]: In ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt;, any sequence that is [[weak convergence (Hilbert space)|weakly convergent]] is also [[Weak convergence (Hilbert space)|strongly convergent]] {{harv|Schur|1921}}.  However, since the [[weak topology]] on infinite-dimensional spaces is strictly weaker than the [[strong topology]], there are [[net (mathematics)|nets]] in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt; that are weak convergent but not strong convergent.

The ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces can be [[embedding|embedded]] into many [[Banach space]]s. The question of whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains an isomorph of some ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; or of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, was answered negatively by [[Boris Tsirelson|B. S. Tsirelson]]'s construction of [[Tsirelson space]] in 1974.  The dual statement, that every separable Banach space is linearly isometric to a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, was answered in the affirmative by {{harvtxt|Banach|Mazur|1933}}. That is, for every separable Banach space ''X'', there exists a quotient map &lt;math&gt;Q:\ell^1 \to X&lt;/math&gt;, so that ''X'' is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\ell^1 / \ker Q&lt;/math&gt;.  In general, ker ''Q'' is not complemented in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, there does not exist a subspace ''Y'' of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\ell^1 = Y \oplus \ker Q&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has uncountably many uncomplemented subspaces that are not isomorphic to one another (for example, take &lt;math&gt;X=\ell^p&lt;/math&gt;; since there are uncountably many such ''X'' 's, and since no ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is isomorphic to any other, there are thus uncountably many ker ''Q'' 's).

Except for the trivial finite-dimensional case, an unusual feature of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is that it is not [[polynomially reflexive space|polynomially reflexive]].

=== ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces are increasing in ''p'' ===
For &lt;math&gt;p\in[1,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, the spaces &lt;math&gt;\ell^p&lt;/math&gt; are increasing in &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, with the inclusion operator being continuous: for &lt;math&gt;1\le p&lt;q\le+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_q\le\|f\|_p&lt;/math&gt;.  

This follows from defining &lt;math&gt;F:=\frac{f}{\|f\|_p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f\in\ell^p&lt;/math&gt;, and noting that &lt;math&gt;|F(m)|\le1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;m\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to imply &lt;math&gt;\|F\|_q^q\le1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5710">The '''simulated growth of plants''' is a significant task in of [[systems biology]] and  [[mathematical biology]], which seeks to reproduce [[plant morphology]] with computer software.
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html|title=Simulating plant growth|accessdate=2009-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html|archivedate=2009-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree-generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]
[[Image:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|300px|'Weeds', generated using an [[L-system]] in 3D.]]
The realistic modeling of plant growth is of high value to biology, but also for computer games.

==Theory + Algorithms==
A biologist, [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria [[Anabaena|''Anabaena catenula'']]. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.
Central to L-systems, is the notion of rewriting, where the basic idea is to define complex objects by successively replacing parts of a simple object using a set of rewriting rules or productions. The rewriting can be carried out recursively. L-Systems are also closely related to [[Koch curves]].

===Environmental interaction===
A challenge for plant simulations is to consistently integrate environmental factors, such as surrounding plants, obstructions, water and mineral availability, and lighting conditions. 
is to build virtual/environments with as many parameters as computationally feasible, thereby, not only simulating the growth of the plant, but also the environment it is growing within, and, in fact, whole ecosystems.
Changes in resource availability influence plant growth, which in turn results in a change of resource availability. Powerful models and powerful hardware will be necessary to effectively simulate these [[Recursion|recursive]] interactions of recursive structures.

'''State collapse''', '''breakdown''', or '''downfall''' is the complete failure of a mode of [[government]] within a [[sovereign state]]. Sometimes this brings about a [[failed state]], as in Somalia and the [[Yugoslav Wars|final decade]] of [[Yugoslavia]].  More often, there is an immediate process of transition to a new administration, and basic services such as tax collection, defence, police, civil service, and courts are maintained throughout, as in [[South Africa]] following the failure of the [[Apartheid|apartheid system]].

State collapse may coincide with [[economic collapse]].  State collapse is not always synonymous with [[societal collapse]], which often is a more prolonged process, as in the fall of the western Roman Empire. 

Not all attempts at [[regime change]] succeed in bringing about state collapse.  The 16th-century [[Babington plot]] to assassinate [[Queen Elizabeth I]] of England, the 19th-century [[Decembrist revolt]] in Russia, and the 20th-century [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba failed.

==History of the concept==
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), the inherent dangers of democracy were, first, that conflict between the aristocracy and the poor was inevitable; and second, that it would usher in "mischief and corruption". Both processes would lead to collapse unless independent controls and [[separation of powers]] were enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Przebowski, ''The Rise and Fall of the United States'', Ex Libris Corporation, 2009, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Polybius]] (c.200 – c.118 BC) asserted that all nations follow a cycle of; democracy, oligarchy, dictatorship, tyranny and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Przebowski]], ''The rise and fall of the United States, ExLibris Corporation'', 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332 – 1406) also produced a general theory of state collapse. A "theological rationalist", he transformed the study of history into a "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], [[History and Theory]] vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; In his eyes, dynasties repeatedly become "sedentary, senile, coercive, pompous, subservient to desire ... liable to divisions in the dynasty." Group feeling ([[asabiyyah]], [[groupthink]]) disappears as the dynasty grows senile. Ibn Khaldun was fatalistic; "This senility is a chronic disease which cannot be cured because it is something natural".&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''[[The Muqaddimah]]'' Routledge, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that dynasties last for three generations before a new invading clique, "restless, alert and courageous", will cause the old to collapse &lt;ref&gt;''The [[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge, 1978, pp. 244-255.&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the principle in the [[Book of Exodus]], chapter 20, verse four: God "visits the sins of the fathers onto their children, even unto the third and fourth generation of those that hate Him". Professor [[Geoff Mulgan]] discusses Ibn Khaldun in detail and agrees on the timescale: "There are obvious parallels between the lifespans of individuals and those of ruling groups."&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and bad power'', Penguin, 2007, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.J. Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], "[[History and Theory]]" vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming in 1966 that "our age, like his, is one of misery", regrets that Ibn Khaldun had "no predecessors and no successors ... not until four centuries after his death did he rise from his long sleep." In 1868 French Arabists translated the Muqaddimah; "the world was amazed, but he remained a lonely pioneer without followers ... the world has yet to prove that history can exist independently of the theological setting that gives it meaning".&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese philosopher [[Hajime Tanabe]] points to the quasi-religious role of the state to mediate between mortal individuals and the eternal universe, so that states regularly collapse; like religious figures, they must undergo a process of death and [[resurrection]]. In his view this may account for the perennial popularity of states because they regularly demonstrate their ability to transcend death.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mcgreal, ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Harper Collins, 1995, p, 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] it is possible for an entire nation, if they all share the same vices and errors, to become insane—a ''"folie a millions"''. Inhuman treatment by the rulers inevitably leads to collapse; &lt;blockquote&gt; Despots and ruling cliques can succeed in dominating and exploiting their fellow man ... but their subjects react ... with apathy, impairment of intelligence, initiative and skills ... or they react by the accumulation of such hate and destructiveness as to bring about an end to themselves, their rulers and their system. ... if man lives under conditions contrary to his nature and to human growth and sanity, he cannot help reacting.'&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Mark Blyth]] alleges that a democracy can also collapse "if voters don't get what they want and merely affirm the status quo." In these circumstances, voters deprived of real choice may opt for the least democratic option.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Blyth]], "When Does Democracy Fail?", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 15 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Ottaway]]&lt;ref&gt;Marina Ottaway, "Rebuilding State Institutions in Collapsed States", ''[[Development and Change]]'', 33 (5), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918, [[British India]] in 1947, [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the collapse of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|South Africa's white supremacist government]] in 1993, of [[Czechoslovakia]] the following year, and of [[Yugoslavia]]. [[Harold Perkin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Perkin]], "The Rise and Fall of Empires", ''[[History Today]]'', 4 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; sees "an acceleration of the process of collapse ... the [20th century] saw the collapse of seven great empires: [[Imperial China]], Germany, Austria-Hungary, [[Ottoman Turkey]], the [[Japanese empire]], the British Empire, and Russia, twice". Furthermore, the 20th Century saw the collapse of the French and Portuguese Empires.

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] regrets the "very slight" amount of research on political power in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Power regularly passes to those who "assert the unknown with the greatest conviction... not necessarily related to intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  What we call "power" is, "in practice, the illusion of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing how the "powerless" [[Mahatma Gandhi]] brought about the collapse of militarily "powerful" [[British India]], Galbraith reflects that power, mostly seen as a possession of states and their leaders, would be better viewed as a flow, into and away from "those instruments that enforce it".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few political scientists credibly predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union or agreed on its causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua S Goldstein]] and Jon C Pevehouse, ''International Relations'', Longman, 2007, p. 43; Richard K Hermann, ''Ending the Cold War'', Palgrave, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  No one predicted the [[Arab spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Doyle, "The Arab Spring Didn't Fail", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many writings study particular cases of state collapse in isolation,&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Mandarin, 1960; [[Edward Crankshaw]], ''Fall of the House of Habsburg'', Cardinal, 1970; [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be no contemporary text which compares events on a global historical basis and identifies common features.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Ludger Helms, ''Comparative Political Leadership'', Palgrave, 2012, which contains many references to present-day western leaders, but only passing or no mentions of Hitler, Saddam, Mussolini, South Africa, Iraq, Yugoslavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Wight]], like Saunders, deplored the "demonic concentrations of power" of the defeated countries in the two world wars. A devout Christian, he saw their "triumphant self-destruction" as "Antichrist moments".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked the modern secular tendency to view politics as a succession of questions (the [[Eastern question]], the [[two-state solution]]) with "solutions" which are devoid of moral content,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; because &lt;blockquote&gt; The members of international society are, on the whole, immortals. States do die or disappear occasionally, but mostly they outlive the span of human life. They are partnerships of the living with posterity ... A society of immortals will be looser than one of mortals ... there are moral difficulties about indicting a whole nation, because (to do so) would make the passive majority suffer for the acts of the criminal minority, and future generations for the sins of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], ''[[Power Politics (Wight book)|Power Politics]]'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the idea of a state being immortal, the [[nation]] called [[Russia]] has survived the collapse of two different political systems:  [[Imperial Russia]], a monarchy, in 1917; and the [[Soviet Union]], a communist totalitarianism, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire]]'', Harper Collins, 1998, chapters one and seven.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, though Germany, ruled by the [[Nazi Party]], was defeated in 1945 and the nation, Germany, was dismembered, it was [[German reunification|resurrected in 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, quoting Martin Wight, ''The International thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of state collapse through [[civil war]] include: the [[War of the Roses]] in 15th-century England; the [[Thirty years war]] (1618–48); the [[Irish Civil War]] (1916-22); the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] (1949); and the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1958).  State collapses through revolutions, not featuring civil war, took place in [[Xinhai Revolution|Imperial China]] (1911), in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (1917), and in [[Iranian Revolution|Iran]] (1979). Collapse through ''[[Coup d'etat|Coups d'etat]]'' occurred in [[History of the Republic of Egypt|Egypt]] (1952), in [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Iraq]] (1958), and in [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] (1969). Negotiated surrenders of power took place in the [[English Commonwealth]] (1660); and in the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), when it fragmented into fifteen independent states.

Mediaeval England was the scene of several violent dynastic collapses:  the fall of the West Saxon kings, when [[William the Conqueror]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 382-3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[civil war]] known as [[The Anarchy]] from 1139-1153 between [[Stephen]] and [[Empress Matilda]], a time when 'Christ and his saints were asleep', which ended the Norman line of kings;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''[[Stephen and Matilda: the Civil War of 1139-53]]'', Stroud, 2009, p 215&lt;/ref&gt; the reign of the last [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]], [[John, King of England]], known as 'Lackland' for his military incompetence in losing Anjou;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tyranny]] of the last [[Plantagenet]] monarch, [[Richard II]], who was defeated by Henry, duke of Lancaster, later [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]];&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 696&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] dynasty during the [[Wars of the Roses]], and especially at the [[battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 498, 875&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[battle of Bosworth]], which saw the end of [[Richard III]] and the [[Yorkist]] line &lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 115, 966&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850-1864) was a civil war in [[China]] between the established [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] and the Christian [[millenarian]] movement of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Heavenly Kingdom of Peace]]. It was the second-worst conflict in history; 20-30 millions died over 15 years. In 1858-60 the [[Qing dynasty]] effectively collapsed as France and the UK invaded and imposed [[unequal treaties]]. In 1864 the Taiping regime also collapsed and the dynasty was reshaped in the [[Tongzhi Restoration]].

The [[partition of India]] in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Partition (n), 7. b |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=2005 |quote=The division of British India into India and Pakistan, achieved in 1947.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partition displaced between 10 and 12 million Sikhs, Hindus and Moslems, creating overwhelming refugee crises; there was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|"The death toll remains disputed with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million."{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Failed attempts at reform in the Soviet Union, a standstill economy, and defeat in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;WorldBook online&lt;/ref&gt; Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] encouraged open criticism of the [[Communist state|communist regime]]. The dramatic drop of the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil in 1985 and 1986]] profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name='AEI-Gaidar-Grain and Oil'&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaidar |first=Yegor |authorlink=Yegor Gaidar |title=The Soviet Collapse: Grain and Oil |work=On the Issues: AEI online |publisher=American Enterprise Institute |date=****-**-** |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722091512/http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }} (Edited version of a speech given November **, **** at the American Enterprise Institute.)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reagan]] administration in the 1980s placed [[Pershing II]] missiles in western Europe in order to escalate the [[Cold War]], overstretch the USSR economy and bring about its downfall because 'they can't sustain military spending the way we can'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, Harper Collins, 1997, p488&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple Gorbachev.

The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] collapsed in the 1990s, when its six socialist republics broke apart to become separate countries; though [[Slovenia]] seceded peacefully, civil wars broke out in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]], then part of [[Serbia]]. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] erupted, including the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and [[Bosnian genocide]].

The apartheid system in [[South Africa]] ended through [[negotiation]]s between the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], the [[African National Congress]], and other political organizations, resulting in South Africa's first non-racial [[South African general election, 1994|election]], which was won by the [[African National Congress]].
Concerns were raised about the future of its nuclear weapons but they were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Sampson]], ''Mandela'', QPD, 1999, p 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential for instability==
In a [[totalitarian]] state or an [[ideocracy]], individuals may develop a [[closed mind]] and an [[authoritarian personality]], making them more likely to resist threats to the incumbent regime.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Alter]], "The Masada complex", ''[[Commentary magazine]]'', 1 July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerrold M. Post]], editor, ''The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of a "[[Masada]] complex" that may drive fanatics to a suicidal, violent last-ditch stand. Former [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] has commented that  "History teaches that dangers are never greater than when empires break up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Thatcher]], ''The Downing Street Years'', Harper Collins, 1993, p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime gains power, not through the truth of its doctrines and promises, but through its ability to organize and absorb the frustrated masses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; As Pope Francis warned in 2017, "in times of crisis, we lack judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Osborne]], ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 22 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The timidity of the old regime contrasts with the boldness of those in rebellion against it;  "Where power is not joined with faith in the future, it is used mainly to ward off the new and preserve the status quo. On the other hand, extravagant hope, even when not backed by actual power, is likely to generate reckless daring."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "The frustrated see in a general downfall an approach to the brotherhood of all. Chaos, like the grave, is a haven of equality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientists, in an [[ideocracy]] there must be a ruthless charismatic leader: "the leader is the movement",&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''Politics of Ideocracy'', State University of New York, 1995, p133&lt;/ref&gt; and all individuals are required to submit to, and worship him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; "Followers who lead barren, insecure, frustrated lives obey the leader, not through faith in his vision of a '[[Promised land]]', but because he leads them away from their unwanted selves".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'', Harper Perennial 2010, p 100, 119&lt;/ref&gt; When collapse threatens he may insist on a "fight to the finish".

Hitler, according to [[Walter Langer]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan, 1972, p 33, 55&lt;/ref&gt; had a [[Messiah complex]] and saw himself as the "Saviour of Germany" who performed "miracles" with the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix 2002, p 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; He was unnaturally fond of his mother, to the extent that Germany became a "mother symbol".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 155.&lt;/ref&gt; His drive to destroy (the Jews, communism, Europe) was an unconscious attempt to resolve his [[Oedipus complex]] and the injustices of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 157&lt;/ref&gt; He "dismantled the German state ... and replaced it with a war machine".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''[[The Meaning of Hitler]]'', Pelican 2002, p. 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He was swept along by a tide of events.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave 2006, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mussolini]], according to [[Denis Mack Smith]], "was an actor, playing the part that Italians wanted him to be".&lt;ref&gt;''Mussolini'', Phoenix, 1993, p112-15&lt;/ref&gt; He was vindictive, sadistic, impulsive, proud and cruel, full of "demonic wilfulness" and did not know right from wrong. When in 1944 he led a [[puppet state]] in northern Italy, he "divided Italy in two and initiated 18 months of terrible civil war."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', Phoenix 1993, p 300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Livingstone]] has compared [[Slobodan Milosevic]] to Hitler for his racism and expansionist goals.&lt;ref&gt;'Why we are not wrong to compare Milosevic to Hitler', ''Independent'', 20/4/1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saddam Hussein]], who also suffered from a Messiah complex,&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold M Post, ''The psychological assessment of political leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p 354&lt;/ref&gt; was similar: "Hitler was not one of a kind. As long as millions of people passionately long for his return, it is only a matter of time until their wish is fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Enzensburger, "Perspective on Saddam Hussein", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 14 February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] "went mad" as early as 1971 according to [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]], when, "blind to his own Messianism", he attempted to recreate [[North Korea]]n [[totalitarianism]] in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p99&lt;/ref&gt; He "played the king" and the role of "chosen one" and "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czar Nicholas II]] by contrast was deferential. Acceding at an early age, 26, he was untrained in governance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]], ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p154&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Duke Vladimir's son Cyril was a rival candidate for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;John Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 175&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals and revolutionaries challenged his autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 176&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 he had become apathetic, dominated by the Czarina and [[Rasputin]],&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 187&lt;/ref&gt; a "Christ in the image of the rejected and agonizing monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''The history of the Russian Revolution'', translated  by Max Eastman, Pluto Press 1977, p 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the USSR, a Marxist [[Revolutionary wave]] had formed in which several subordinate regimes in Eastern Europe and Africa collapsed almost simultaneously with the central power.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St martin's Press, 1997, pp 83-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] saw the USSR as "on the way to civil war" and tried to conciliate both reformers and hardliners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Rosenberg]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38289333 BBC online interview with Gorbachev], 2016-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[F.W. De Klerk]] in South Africa focused on acknowledging and managing decline, rather than "heroically" attempting to deny it. They have enjoyed better reputations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Dejevsky|title=Two new faces of democracy; both Gorbachev and de Klerk tried to dismantle untenable regimes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/two-new-faces-of-democracy-both-gorbachev-and-de-klerk-tried-to-dismantle-untenable-regimes-history-1434677.html|work=Independent|date=1994-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in China, Gorbachev is seen as a dismal failure who capitulated to the West.&lt;ref&gt;James Palmer, 'What China didn't learn from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Foreign Policy, 2016-12-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of events==

===Buildup to collapse===
State collapse is often a gradual process of slow, imperceptible, generational change.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Patten]], ''What next?'', Penguin, 2009, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the courageous are prepared for [[speaking truth to power]]; the majority 'go with the flow', as with Jewish passivity in the face of the creeping corruption of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See the Diary of [[Victor Klemperer]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Collapse is often preceded externally by war, and internally by overpopulation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'' Routledge 1978, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Paul Kennedy]] points out, 'Nations in decline instinctively spend more on "security" and thus compound their long-term dilemma.'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The rise and fall of the Great Powers'', 1985, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a revolution the crisis is reached when 'the old regime is no longer able to mobilise force'.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regeneration===
Either the incumbent regime itself, or an extremist [[reactionary]] group dissatisfied with its performance, may attempt to postpone or avoid collapse by regenerating popular support; 'At the end of a dynasty there often appears some show of power giving the impression that the dynasty's senility has been made to disappear. It lights up brilliantly just before it is extinguished, like a candle which leaps up brilliantly just before it is put out.' &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', Routledge 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To do so they may have to take 'heroic' measures; 'Throughout history there have always been in the event of defeat two paths of action; the one aims at saving enough of the substance as possible. the other at leaving behind a stirring legend.'&lt;ref&gt;Sebastain Haffner, ''The meaning of Hitler'', Pelican, 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, they may rethink or adapt the ideology, or replace it by a completely new set of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Poland, according to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, communist ideocracy failed in 1980; the recognition of [[Lech Walesa]]'s [[Solidarity]] Trade Union led to a military coup and authoritarian military rule.

According to [[Sabrina Ramet]], regenerative changes occurred in Yugoslavia in the 1980s when the communist ideology was replaced by a nationalist drive for a [[Greater Serbia]] and by an [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] in support of [[Slobodan Milosevic]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Sabrina Ramet]], ''The three Yugoslavias'', Indiana UP, 2006, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Young Turk]] coup of 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Shattering Empires'' by Michael Reynolds, ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt]],&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Volkogonov, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997, pp. 485-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the financial/industrial reforms of [[Sergei Witte]] in Imperial Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Tales of Imperial Russia'' by [[Francis Wcislo]] (sic), ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were all aimed at regenerating causes which were nearing collapse.

===Crisis point===

When collapse - whether through civil war, revolution, [[coup d'état]], or military defeat and/or invasion - becomes unavoidable and immediate, law and order may break down. There may be [[Ethnic cleansing]] or [[Genocide]]. Hitler ordered the killing of invalids, Gypsies, Russians and Jews in the [[Final solution]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Pelican 2002, chapter on 'Crimes'&lt;/ref&gt; In Ottoman Turkey, estimates for the death toll in the [[Armenian genocide]] vary between 300,000 and 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', Financial Times, 4/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacific theatre of [[World War II]], [[Occupation of Japan|Japan's collapse]] was hastened by nuclear destruction of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].
 
When [[Ottoman Turkey]] collapsed at the end of [[World War I]], it lost territory, including what became [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]; the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire gave rise to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and the Austrian Republic, while [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] became part of Yugoslavia]]. Nazi Germany in 1945 fragmented into East and West Germany, while [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] became part of Poland

===Post-collapse===

In 1946, the Diet ratified a new [[Constitution of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese military through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=86|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The political project drew much of its inspiration from the [[US Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]], [[New Deal]] social legislation, the [[liberal constitution]]s of several European states and even the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from collapse is often improved by formal or informal efforts at justice, such as the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]]. [[Slobodan Milosevic]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] were also tried in court, but [[Mussolini]] and [[Colonel Gaddafi]] were murdered by mobs.

The collapse of the Ottomans in 1918 had long-term consequences, 'triggering most of the problems that plague the Middle East today.' &lt;ref&gt;[[Ali A. Allawi]], 'The Ottoman Empire: the last great casualty of the first world war', [[The Spectator]], 2/5/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Hegemony in the Middle East has been subject to quarrels between British, French,&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim]], 'The Balfour Declaration: A Study in British Duplicity', [[Middle East Eye]], 25/8/2017&lt;/ref&gt; Zionist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Shahak]], 'Greater Israel: the Zionist Plan for the Middle East', [[Global Research Council|Global Research]], November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; American,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Green, 'Why Western Democracy can never work in the Middle East', [[The Daily Telegraph]],16/8/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Arab nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adeed Dawisha]], 'Requiem for Arab Nationalism', [[Middle East Quarterly]], Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi and Iranian interests &lt;ref&gt;Syed Mansur Hashim, 'Who will rule the Middle East?', The Daily Star, 12/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt; ever since.

Hitler, says [[Sebastian Haffner]], 'whether we like it or not', created many features of the postwar world, including the state of Israel, the end of European empires, the division of Germany, and the joint hegemony of the US and USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix, 2000, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==States allegedly at risk of collapse==

Paul Stares and Helia Aghani suggest that [[Saudi Arabia]] could lapse into a succession crisis and civil war if [[Mohammed bin Salman]]'s accession is contested after the death of his aging father, [[king Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stares and Helia Aghani, "How Stable is Saudi Arabia?", [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 15 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] could collapse following the influx of refugees from [[Syria]] and the resultant burden on infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Azeem Ibrahim]], 'Lebanon and Jordan may collapse under a new wave of refugees', [[Al Arabiya English]], 2016-06-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Colonel Gaddafi]] of Libya agreed to dismantle his nuclear and chemical weapons programme. In 2011 he was deposed and murdered. This is the reason, according to [[Forbes magazine]], for North Korea to seek to guarantee its security and invulnerability through continuing its nuclear weapons programme.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan and Rodger Baker, 'Why North Korea needs nukes', Forbes, 2013-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Embury-Dennis claims that [[North Korea]] could collapse "within a year" as new US sanctions take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Embury-Dennis, "North Korea Could Collapse within a Year", ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Venezuela]], protests and riots against the authoritarian rule of [[Nicolas Maduro]] have steadily increased since 2014, while the economy and social infrastructure have worsened.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gillespie et al, 'Venezuela; how a rich country collapsed'. CNN, July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Todd]], one of the first to predict the fall of the USSR, now predicts the collapse of the US in his book ''[[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]]''. According to Iranian general Reza Naqdi, the US will collapse by 2035 and the Trump presidency is hastening that process.&lt;ref&gt;anon, 'Israel will collapse within ten years', Israel Today, 2016-11-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret McMillan]] has compared [[President Trump]] to [[Mussolini]], on the grounds that President Trump similarly seeks attention, makes grand gestures, plays the 'strong man' and seeks out enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Gordon]], quoting [[Margaret McMillan]] in 'Trump is no Hitler - he's a Mussolini', [[Oxford Today]], 2017-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Lawson]] predicts that the [[European Union]] will become a federal superstate;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Lawson, '[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/02/the-eu-exists-only-to-become-a-superstate-britain-has-no-place-i/ The EU exists only to become a superstate]', Telegraph, 2016-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; also likely to collapse, according to the Polish president, [[Andrzej Duda]],&lt;ref&gt;James Shorter, '[https://www.ft.com/content/d18b8b56-9240-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c Polish president warns multispeed EU will collapse]', Financial Times, 2017-09-05&lt;/ref&gt; journalist [[Stephen Pollard]],&lt;ref&gt;'the EU will collapse within ten years', The Express, 2017-09-23&lt;/ref&gt; German economist [[Thorsten Polleit]],&lt;ref&gt;Nick Gutteridge, 'German economist predicts EU will collapse', Express, 2017-08-25&lt;/ref&gt; and a leaked German Government contingency plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Mason]], '[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/06/the-germans-are-making-contingency-plans-for-the-collapse-of-europe-lets-hope-we-are-too The Germans are making contingency plans for the collapse of Europe. Let's hope we are too.]' [[The Guardian]], 2017-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

S Daniel Abraham anticipates the collapse of [[Israel]], where Palestinians will soon outnumber Jews, if the [[History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Palestinian problem]] is not resolved;&lt;ref&gt;S Daniel Abraham, 'How Israel will be destroyed without one shot being fired', [[Haaretz]], 2013-01-16&lt;/ref&gt; Iqbal Jassat compares the situation  to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Jassat, 'Israel faces inevitable collapse of its apartheid system', Middle East Monitor 2017-03-27&lt;/ref&gt; A secret CIA report sees the end of Israel by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jones, ''Israel today'', 'CIA sees end of Israel by 2022', 1st July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], Islamic militants are allegedly infiltrating the military and nuclear weapons systems. There are fears of collapse into nuclear war with India, or of chaos enabling extremists to seize [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]], "Wikileaks Cables Expose Pakistan Nuclear Fears", [[The Guardian]], 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon G. Chang]], in editions of ''[[The Coming Collapse of China]]'', has made several predictions of collapse, none of which have materialised. [[Bruce Gilley]] sees a largely peaceful process unfolding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Gilley]], ''China's Democratic Future'', Columbia University Press, 2004, chapter six: "The democratic breakthrough, extrication or overthrow?".&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Shambaugh]] says China must either liberalise to become a developed economy–as Taiwan and South Korea have–or else remain authoritarian and endure a stagnating economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson , "Q and A David Shambaugh",  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; "We cannot predict when Chinese communism will collapse, but it is hard not to conclude that we are seeing its final phases."&lt;ref&gt;Xie Tao, quoting Shambaugh in "Why Do People Keep Predicting China's Collapse?', ''[[The Diplomat]]'', March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Katz&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p107-112&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the [[Islamic fundamentalist]] [[revolutionary wave]] led by [[Iran]] could collapse, but "must first expand significantly" and then experience a "crisis of confidence".

[[Geoff Mulgan]]&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and Bad Power'', Penguin 2007, p321&lt;/ref&gt; has called for; "new structures of [[government]] above the nation-state... this task is essential for Human survival".

==In popular culture==
There are many semi-fictional books and films, which dramatically demonstrate the turbulent effects of collapse upon innocent or naive individuals. [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film, ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', showed the collapse of both Imperial China and [[Manchukuo]], as well as the post-collapse trial and rehabilitation of [[Pu Yi]]. [[Bruno Ganz]] played Hitler in ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'', which depicts the final days of Germany's [[Third Reich]]. Events from the period,
as seen by prisoners at [[Auschwitz]], are shown in [[Primo Levi]]'s memoir, ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', and in the [[graphic novel]]s ''[[Maus]]'' and ''[[Maus II]]''. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] witnessed the [[bombing of Dresden]] and fictionalized the experience in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.

[[Robert K. Massie]]'s book about the last Russian tsar, ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'', was also filmed. ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'' and ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (filmed as ''War and Revolution'') relate stories of families caught up in the collapse of [[Russia]].  ''[[The House of the Mosque]]'' and ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]]'' depict the collapse of [[Iran]].

The ''[[Left Behind]]'' series of novels by ''[[Tim LaHaye]]'' and ''[[Jerry B. Jenkins]]'' features the supposed role of [[Israel]] in the [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[End Times]]. In the spy novel, ''[[The Mask of Dimitrios (novel)|The Mask of Dimitrios]]'' (1939), [[Eric Ambler]] comments:  "In a dying civilization, political prestige goes not to the man with the shrewdest diagnosis, but to the one with the best bedside manner."

'''''The Bully: A Discussion and Activity Story''''' is a 40-page children's story and activity book by Rita Y. Toews published in 2003.  The story focuses on giving children a voice as to how [[bullying]] makes them feel, and educates parents on how to handle a bully situation in a positive manner. The book can be used in a classroom, one-on-one with a counsellor or with a parent/caregiver.

== Plot summary ==
Jason is bullied at school by a child who demands his lunch every day.  His mother is informed by the school that he is often hungry and realizes he is being bullied.  She advises Jason they will have to take the problem to the school for help.  Jason resists.  His mother reminds Jason that if the bully isn't stopped he will continue to bully.

== Book layout ==
The story is followed by a question and answer section for children.  The questions help children express their feelings about bullies, and the answers provide practical ways to deal with the problem.  The illustrations for the story can be used as a colouring book while the subject of bullying is discussed.  
 
The adult's section of ''The Bully'' contains a question and answer portion that informs parents and caregivers about [[bullying]].  It also gives effective information for dealing with a bully in a manner that provides a positive role model for children, as well as providing additional resources.

'''The Royal Caledonian Hunt''' is a Scottish [[Horseracing in Scotland|racing]] club dating back to 1777.

==Background==
The Club was officially instituted on 2 August 1777 in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] as 'the Hunters Club'. The following year the club took the name 'The Caledonian Hunt Club'.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyoflinlith00ruth/historyoflinlith00ruth_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|title=Full text of "The history of the Linlithgow and Stirlingshire hunt, 1775-1910"|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dukes of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] was to be the President of the Club and the [[Earl of Eglinton|Countess Eglinton]] was to be the Patron. As the name implied the club was originally constituted to [[Fox hunting|hunt]], with the first fortnight long meeting set to take place at Haddington on 12 October 1778. However, it seemed that the club was also concerned from the beginning with horse racing. One year after it was instituted the club held races at [[Musselburgh Racecourse|Musselburgh]]. Two years after it was instituted the Caledonian Hunt club sponsored its first race at the [[Kelso Racecourse|Racecourse in Kelso]].&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/horse-racing/fortune-likely-to-smile-on-lucky-nellerie-as-ferdy-appears-ready-for-kelso-1-1423872|title=Fortune likely to smile on Lucky Nellerie as Ferdy appears ready for Kelso|website=The Scotsman|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; So it was, that the club met twice a year at Kelso, using the Cross Keys Hotel as their meeting point.&lt;ref name="cross-keys-hotel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cross-keys-hotel.co.uk/history.asp|title=History of the Hotel - Cross Keys Hotel - Hotel Accommodation in Kelso, Scotland|website=cross-keys-hotel.co.uk|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the frequency of their meets increased, in both Edinburgh and elsewhere. A Hunt Ball was held, a notable example of which was the ball of 1787, for which the [[Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh)|Edinburgh Assembly Rooms]] were opened for the first time. In 1786 a Yorkshire Colonel visited the club and remarked:

The company is composed of gentlemen of the Turf on both sides of the Tweed with families and friends and also members of the Caledonian Hunt. Foxhounds and harriers hunt alternately in the mornings. There is also a concert and races and next night the gentlemen of the Hunt give a handsome ball. After the ladies retired therefrom, the gentlemen formed a party to drink their healths and when I got up at 8 they were still drinking and meant to sit till hounds went out.

Although the club became based in Edinburgh, the location of its race meetings varied each year, with Kelso playing host most often.&lt;ref name="euppublishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/shr.2013.0176|title=Landowners and Urban Society in Eighteenth-Century Scotland &amp;#124; The Scottish Historical Review|website=euppublishing.com|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the club had a choice of 8 different courses in Scotland, they only chose Aberdeen once.&lt;ref name="f2s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcjazz.f2s.com/QueensLinksRaces.htm|website=mcjazz.f2s.com|title=Queen&amp;#39;s Links|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robbie Burns==
Around 1787 [[Robbie Burns]] met with members of the Caledonia Hunt Club, having befriended a number of members around Edinburgh. Burns dedicated the first Edinburgh Edition of his Poems to the Hunt. To return the favour the treasurer of the Caledonia Hunt Club was instructed to "subscribe for one hundred copies in their name, for which he should pay Mr Burns £25, upon the publication of his book."&lt;ref name="robertburns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/CaledonianHuntthe.175.shtml|website=robertburns.org|title=Robert Burns Country: The Burns Encyclopedia: Caledonian Hunt, the|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1792 Burns was himself a member of the Caledonia Hunt Club. A portrait of Robbie Burns was given to the club by the famous engraver [[William Walker (engraver born 1791)|William Walker]]. The print is now property of the British museum.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3559538&amp;partId=1&amp;people=113489&amp;peoA=113489-2-23&amp;view=list&amp;page=1|title=British Museum - Robert Burns|website=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Patronage==
In 1822 as part of his [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|visit to Edinburgh]] King George IV attended the Caledonian Hunt Club's annual ball. He was so struck with the meeting that he agreed to be the patron of the club, permitting them to use the title 'Royal'.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; [[Nathaniel Gow]] provided the music for the event, but refused to charge the club, having been so pleased by the response of the King to his music.&lt;ref name="tunearch"/&gt;

Since the patronage of 1822, several other monarchs and royals have been involved with the club, including [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and [[Edward VII]].

==Inspired Art==
In addition to Robbie Burns, the Royal Caledonia Hunt Club seems to have inspired the works of other artists. For example, The Caledonian Hunt, by Sir Alexander Don in 1780 and the Royal Caledonian Hunt's Delight, written by Mr James Miller in 1792 (later given words by Robbie Burns); and North's (Milles Macphail) Farewell to the Caledonian Hunt published as part of the Gow collection.&lt;ref name="tunearch2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunearch.org/wiki/Annotation:Caledonian_Hunt%27s_Delight_(The)|title=Caledonian Hunt's Delight (The) - The Traditional Tune Archive|website=tunearch.org|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time marketing''' is the [[research]] of timing in releasing a new product to the market.

==Introduction==
In [[marketing]], there are different approaches to the introduction of a (new) product into the market. Marketers always try to create a [[Market segment|segmentation]] of the market in order to focus their product offering. Segmentation can be done on [[demographic]], [[behavior]]al, or other bases. According to this segmentation, different options of differentiation vis-à-vis the competition get evaluated and implemented. This is called positioning of the product. [[Product marketing|McCarthy’s 4 marketing P’s]], product, placement, promotion, and pricing are repeatedly used to create good combination of product features at the right price, distributed via preferred [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] channels, and combined with an appealing [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]].

One aspect tends to be forgotten: purchase timing behaviour or simply, timing aspect. Time marketing researches and gives guidelines on when to position a product in the market. Not only competition, but also absolute time frames in a consumer’s life are considered.

==Examples==
An obvious example, known for years before any research was conducted on this matter, illustrates the importance of timing aspects in marketing. A [[hand fan|fan]] is a typical example of a product that goes on sale according to laws of nature and therefore timing. In summer, [[department store]]s have promotions on fans, as higher temperatures urge consumers to purchase.

Research has found that products are bought by [[customer]]s at different moments of the day and different days of the week. Approximately 80% of diaries are sold in the month of November. However, 75% of the [[diary|diaries]] not sold in November (15% of the total market) are sold on a Monday.

[[File:Reynard-the-fox.jpg|thumb|The trickster figure [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] as depicted in an 1869 children's book by [[Michel Rodange]]]]
In [[mythology]], and in the study of [[folklore]] and [[religion]], a '''trickster''' is a character in a story ([[God (male deity)|god]], [[goddess]], [[spiritual being|spirit]], [[man]], [[woman]], or [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]]), which exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge, and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behaviour.

==Mythology==
Tricksters are [[archetype|archetypal]] characters who appear in the myths of many different cultures. [[Lewis Hyde]] describes the trickster as a "boundary-crosser".&lt;ref name=Hyde&gt;Hyde, Lewis. ''Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules. Tricksters "...violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis."&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/reviews/980215.15mattict.html|last=Mattick|first=Paul|title=Hotfoots of the Gods|work=New York Times|date=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the bending/breaking of rules takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be [[wikt:cunning|cunning]] or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions and mocks authority. They are usually male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods.

All cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty creature who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths [[Hermes]] plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to [[Autolycus]], who in turn passed it on to [[Odysseus]].&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;  In [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] folktales, the trickster and the [[culture hero]] are often combined.

[[File:How loki wrought mischief in Asgard by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|[[Loki]] cuts the hair of the goddess [[Sif]].]]

Frequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and [[shapeshifting|form]] variability. In [[Norse mythology]] the mischief-maker is [[Loki]], who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He [[Loki#Gylfaginning|becomes a mare]] who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].

British scholar Evan Brown suggested that [[Jacob]] in the Bible has many of the characteristics of the trickster:&lt;blockquote&gt;The tricks Jacob plays on his twin brother [[Esau]], his father [[Isaac]] and his father-in-law [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] are immoral by conventional standards, designed to cheat other people and gain material and social advantages he is not entitled to. Nevertheless, the Biblical narrative clearly takes Jacob's side and the reader is invited to laugh and admire Jacob's ingenuity–as is the case with the tricksters of other cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Evan. ''The Bible in the Context of World Culture'', Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider ([[Anansi]]) is often the trickster.

==Archetype==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Remember11]] --&gt;
{{Further|List of fictional tricksters}}
The trickster or clown is an example of a [[Jungian archetype]].  In modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a [[stock character]].  Often too, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst, in that his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched.  A once-famous example of this was the character [[Froggy the Gremlin]] on the early children's television show "Andy's Gang".  A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R. L. "[http://home.earthlink.net/~christmascamel/id5.html Remembering Andy Devine]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In later folklore, the trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and deceit as a defense.  He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. For example, many typical [[fairy tale]]s have the king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials.  No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes.  With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners.  Therefore, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward.  More modern and obvious examples of that type include [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Pippi Longstocking]].

==Role in African American literature==
Modern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, [[African American literature]] was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural "other." The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As [[Audre Lorde]] explained, the problem was that "the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|chapter=Age, Race, Class, and Sex|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology|editor1-first=Julie|editor1-last=Rivkin|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Ryan|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|page=859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings of the late 1980s, [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] presents the concept of [[Signifyin']]. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the "master's house" can be "dismantled" using his "tools" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, [[the Signifying Monkey]], and his oppressor, the Lion.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} According to Gates, the "Signifying Monkey" is the "New World figuration" and "functional equivalent" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|pp=988–989}} The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of "King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, "[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourse…The monkey speaks figuratively, in a symbolic code; the lion interprets or reads literally and suffers the consequences of his folly..."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's "trounc[ing]" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} The net effect of all of this is "the reversal of [the Lion's] status as the King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the "master's house" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him.

[[File:Br'er Rabbit and Tar-Baby.jpg|thumb|left|[[Br'er Rabbit]] is a trickster character who succeeds through his wits rather than through strength.]]
Following in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, [[Br'er Rabbit]] (a contraction of "Brother Rabbit"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the "creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} The figurative representative of this slave community, Brer Rabbit is the hero with a "fragile body but a deceptively strong mind" that allows him to "create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the "personification of the ethic of self-preservation" for the slave community, but also "an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=158}} Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform.

Before Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] engaged in an epistolary correspondence.&lt;ref name=North77&gt;North, Michael, ''The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the [[Uncle Remus]] tales; Eliot was "[[Virginia opossum|Possum]];" Pound was "[[Tar Baby]]." Pound and Eliot wrote in the same "African slave" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from "the Queen's English, the language of public propriety."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; This rebellion against proper language came as part of "collaboration" between Pound and Eliot "against the London literary establishment and the language that it used."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the [[Uncle Remus]] trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy.

African American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system. In ''When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote'', the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and [[Native American mythology]], thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to "Indian captivity narratives" and the rabbit trickster found in [[Cherokee mythology]].&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=Jonathan|chapter=Introduction: Recognition of the African-Native American Literary Tradition|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: African–Native American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baringer|first=Sandra K.|chapter=Brer Rabbit and His Cherokee Cousin: Moving Beyond the Appropriation Paradigm|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: African–Native American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing for a merged "African–Native American folklore", the idea is forwarded that certain shared "cultural affinities" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups "through the trickster tales…survive[d] European American cultural and political domination."&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

==In Native American tradition==
While the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many native traditions held [[clown]]s and tricksters as essential to any contact with the [[sacred]]. People could not pray until they had laughed, because [[laughter]] opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred [[ceremonies]] for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd Gibbens, Professor of English at [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]; quoted [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in ''[[Napalm and Silly Putty]]'' by George Carlin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Native American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional [[picaro]].  One of the most important distinctions is that "we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition".{{sfnp|Ballinger|1991|p=21}} In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next.

In many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote spirit]] ([[Southwestern United States]]) or [[Raven (mythology)|Raven spirit]] ([[Pacific Northwest]]) stole fire from the gods ([[star]]s, [[moon]], and/or [[sun]]). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches.&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;

Wakdjunga in [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] mythology is an example of the trickster archetype.

===Coyote===
{{Main article|Coyote (mythology)}}
[[File:Coyoteinacanoe.png|thumb|left|upright|Coyote often has the role of trickster as well as a clown in traditional stories.]]
The Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among [[indigenous peoples of California]] and [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|the Great Basin]].

According to [[Crow religion|Crow]] (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: "Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumca.org/goldrush/fever04-ci.html "Gold Fever California on the Eve- California Indians", Oakland Museum of California]&lt;/ref&gt; He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Chelan (tribe)|Chelan]] myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time "a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures." while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices of the Winds: Native American Legends|last1=Edmonds|last2=Clark|first1=Margot|first2=Ella E.|publisher=Castle Books|year=2003|isbn=0785817166|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power.

As the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and "medicine". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven.

More often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: "Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water." In others, he is malicious: "Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==In Internet and multimedia studies==
In online environments there has been a link between the trickster and [[Internet trolling]]. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. &amp; Greenhill, A. (2002). "Tribalism, Conflict and Shape-shifting Identities in Online Communities." In the Proceedings of the 13th Australasia Conference on Information Systems, Melbourne Australia, 7–9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. and Greenhill, A. (2009). "[http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2235/ Conflict and Identity Shape Shifting in an Online Financial Community]", ''Information Systems Journal'', (19:5), pp. 461–478. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2008.00301.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6875">In [[computing]], a '''Unicode symbol''' is a [[Unicode]] character which is not part of a script used to write a natural language, but is nonetheless available for use as part of a text.

Many of the symbols are drawn from existing character sets or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or other national and international standards. The Unicode Standard states that "The universe of symbols is rich and open-ended."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch22.pdf#G14025 | date=June 2018 | title=Section 22: Symbols | work=The Unicode Standard | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the issue of what symbols to encode and how symbols should be encoded more complicated than the issues surrounding writing systems. Unicode focuses on symbols that make sense in a one-dimensional plain-text context. For example, the typical two-dimensional arrangement of electronic diagram symbols justifies their exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch22.pdf#G12269 | date=June 2018 | title=Section 22: Miscellaneous Technical | work=The Unicode Standard | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Box-drawing character]]s are a partial exception, for legacy purposes, and a number of electronic diagram symbols are indeed encoded in Unicode's [[Miscellaneous Technical]] block.) For adequate treatment in plain text, symbols must also be displayable in a [[monochromatic]] setting. Even with these limitations{{snd}} monochromatic, one-dimensional and standards-based{{snd}} the domain of potential Unicode symbols is extensive. (However, [[emoji]]s{{snd}} [[ideogram]]s, [[graphic]] [[symbol]]s{{snd}} that were admitted into Unicode, allow colors although the colors are not standardized.)

'''Vibhu''' ([[Sanskrit]]:विभु) means – 'mighty', 'powerful', 'eminent', 'supreme', 'able to', 'capable of', 'self-subdued', 'firm' or 'self-controlled'; in [[Nyaya]] philosophy, it means – 'eternal', 'existing everywhere', 'all-pervading', 'pervading all material things'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=1455|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.5:125.apte}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word also refers to ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]'' or mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Origin and Development of Yoga from Vedic times|author=Suresh chander Banerjee|publisher=Punthi Pustak|page=469|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fKfWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vibhu+vedas&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtGsVKiVCojmuQT9t4CwDA&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word has its root in the term, '''bhū''' ( भू), meaning – 'become', 'arise', 'come into existence'; thus ''vibhu'' means – 'expand', 'become manifest', 'appear', 'pervade'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Artful Universe|author=William K. Mahoney|publisher=SUNY Press|page=242|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=B1KR_kE5ZYoC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic significance==

From [[Atharvaveda]] it is learnt that Sudhanvan Angirasa had three sons, Ribhu, Vibhu and Vaja, collectively known as [[Ribhus]] who were intelligent sages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Mythology|author=Nagendra Kumar Singh|publisher=APH Publications|page=196|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jXw7-PdwZ7oC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried the luminous power of knowledge to this world, which knowledge pervaded the world as nectar. Ribhu or Ribhukshan was skillful at handling knowledge; Vibhu or Vibhawa was skillful in pervading and diffusing, and Vaja handled embodied plenitude with similar skill; all three dwelled in the solar-region and are considered to be the rays of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mertowney Mountain Interviews|author=Richard Leviton|publisher=iUniverse|page=383|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IhhOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the three leaders of rites and the possessors of opulence, and the three deities of several Rig Vedic hymns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Samhita|publisher=N.Trubner|page=115|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6tf0xYQRrsgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mantra of the [[Rig Veda]] reads as follows:-

:एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजो या नु दधृष्वान् कृणवै मनीषा |
:अहं ह्युग्रो मरुतो विदानो यानि चयवमिन्द्र इदीश एषाम् || ([[Rig Veda]] I.165.10)

In the Rig Veda, the word, ''vibhu'', means – 'all-pervading unified entity that permeates or extends throughout a spatial expanse', as is in the afore-cited mantra wherein the phrase - एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजः which means -  " Though I be but one, let my might be extensive. " &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Ideals of Sovereignty and the Poetics of Power|author=Theodore Nicholas Proferes|publisher=American Oriental Society|page=27|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qXzXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vibhu+vedas&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XBauVPTRGNiRuASP3YLoCA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCDgo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the words, ''vibhu'' and ''[[prabhu]]'', appear in the [[Rig Veda]] but these words have a fixed psychological significance – ''vibhu'' means - 'coming into existence to pervade the whole being as ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ānanda]]'', and ''prabhu'' means - 'coming into existence as a specific object or particular experience within the range of one’s consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret of the Vedas|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|page=355|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fTJb_Y1Tp94C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sage of the Rig Veda (II.xxiv.11) asserts that:-

:विभु प्रभु प्रथमं मेहनावतो बृहस्पतेः सुविदत्राणि राध्या |
:इमा सातानि वेन्यस्य वाजिनो येन जना उभ्यें भुञ्जते विशः ||

[[Brihaspati]], the lord of the heaven of light and the guardian of ''[[Ṛta|rta]]'', is present in all things and beings (''vibhu'') same as the [[Brahman]] of the [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Religion and Philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads|author=A.B.Keith|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=448|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p9zCbRMQbyEC&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ac-sVL-MMtLbuQTp0ICQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance==

In the [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]], while describing the world of Brahman, there is the mention of the hall of Brahman called ''Vibhu'' (or built by ''Vibhu'' here meaning – 'egoism') arriving at which hall the glory of Brahman reaches the one who seeks liberation, where the seeker thinks himself to be Brahman, and thinking thus approaches the throne ''Vikakshanā'' ('perception'), in other words, the seeker having become liberated experiences Brahman, his own true nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=sacred Books of the East|publisher=The Floating Press|pages=262, 263|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hoV-aiNlwbgC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaudapada]] in his ''kārikā'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] stating:-

:निवृत्तेः सर्वदुःखानामीशानः प्रभुरव्ययः  |

describes the fourth state (''[[turiya]]'') as the ordainer (''iśana''), as the supreme lord (''prabhu''), as the non-dual (''advaita'') and the all-pervading (''vibhu'') god (''devata'') of all beings. Here, the word, ''avyaya'', means that which is not subject to change; and ''turiya'' is ''vibhu'' because it pervades all the three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=67|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=vibhu+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8tesVICFHIyRuASEvoK4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to all six orthodox [[Vedic]] ''darśanas'' which comprise [[Hindu philosophy]], with the exception of [[Ramanuja]]’s 'theory of atomic dimensionless soul', the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|ātmān]]'' is ''vibhu'' ('omnipresent'). The followers of [[Jainism]], who believe that the ''ātmān'' assumes the size corresponding to the size of the body it occupies, also believe that in the final state of liberation it remains unalterable, but they reject the Hindu theory of ''vibhu'' which to them does not explain if the soul is same at all times everywhere why for is there the experience individual self. Vedāntists argue that for the atman to be unchangeable in the state of liberation then it must be regarded either as ''anu'' ('minute') or as ''vibhu'' ('pervasive').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|publisher=University of California Press|page=219|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahmasutram|author=Sitanath Tattvabhushan|publisher=Genesis Publishing

[[Advaita Vedanta]] rests on the premise that only the substratum ([[Brahman]]) is real, the phenomenal world all with its properties and relations is unreal and due to ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. Substance, in its pure subtle state is the constitutive cause of things, and in its rational state it is the substratum of qualities, actions, etc., and exists in nine forms – earth (''prithivi''), water (''jala''), fire (''agni''), air (''vayu''), space (''akasha'') ('which five constitute the physical world'), direction (''disha'') ('without which no movement is not possible'), time (''kaal'') ('the substratum and the causal factor of all psycho-physical product and worldly behaviour'), mind (''manas'') and self (''ātmān''); the first four and mind are ''paramanus'' ('infinitesimal') and the rest are ''vibhu'' ('ubiquitous'), simple and infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion|publisher=Global Vision|page=557|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0TBTVPax4E8C&amp;pg=PA557&amp;dq=vibhu+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_tusVNfMFdijugSUiIH4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vindhyāvāsī, giving up the doctrine of the three psychical organs, associates the processes of the faculty of knowledge (''buddhi'') and I-consciousness with the thinking organ (''manah'') which three were the great all –penetrating ''vibhu''.

The '''Y chromosome''' is one of two sex [[chromosome]]s ([[allosome]]s) in [[mammal]]s, including [[human]]s, and many other animals. The other is the [[X chromosome]]. Y is the [[Sex-determination system|sex-determining]] chromosome in many [[species]], since it is the presence or absence of Y that determines the male or female [[sex]] of [[offspring]] produced in [[sexual reproduction]]. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the [[gene]] [[SRY]], which triggers [[testis]] development. The [[DNA]] in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million [[base pairs]].&lt;ref name="Chromosome Y"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=Y |title = Ensembl Human MapView release 43 |date = February 2014 |accessdate = 2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the [[human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|title=Male Chromosome May Evolve Fastest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/science/14gene.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, over 200 Y-linked genes have been identified.&lt;ref name="National Center for Biotechnology Information"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Genes and Disease| publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information| location = Bethesda, Maryland|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22266/#A296}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Y-linked genes are expressed and (apart from duplicated genes) [[hemizygous]] (present on only one chromosome) except in the cases of [[aneuploidy]] such as [[XYY syndrome]] or [[XXYY syndrome]]. 

== Overview ==

===Discovery===
The Y chromosome was identified as a sex-determining chromosome by [[Nettie Stevens]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1905 during a study of the [[mealworm]] ''Tenebrio molitor''. [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]] independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by [[Hermann Henking]]. She realized that the previous idea of [[Clarence Erwin McClung]], that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome "Y" simply to follow on from Henking's "X" alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;David Bainbridge, 'The X in Sex: How the X Chromosome Controls Our Lives'', pages 3-5, 13, [[Harvard University Press]], 2003 {{ISBN|0674016211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Schwartz, ''In Pursuit of the Gene: From Darwin to DNA'', pages 170-172, [[Harvard University Press]], 2009 {{ISBN|0674034910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the Y chromosome was named after its similarity in appearance to the letter "Y" is mistaken.  All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well-defined shape during [[mitosis]]. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes.  It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during [[mitosis]], has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, pages 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
{{See also|Androgen insensitivity syndrome|Intersex}}
Most mammals have only one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Males have one Y chromosome and one [[X chromosome]], while females have two X chromosomes. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains a gene, [[SRY]], which triggers embryonic development as a male. The Y chromosomes of humans and other mammals also contain other genes needed for normal sperm production.

There are exceptions, however. For example, the [[platypus]] relies on an [[XY sex-determination system]] based on five pairs of chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Grützner"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grützner F, Rens W, Tsend-Ayush E |title=In the platypus a meiotic chain of ten sex chromosomes shares genes with the bird Z and mammal X chromosomes |journal=Nature |volume=432 |pages=913–9177 |year=2004 |doi=10.1038/nature03021 |url= |pmid=15502814 |issue=7019 |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2004Natur.432..913G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Platypus sex chromosomes have strong sequence similarity with the avian [[ZW sex-determination system|Z chromosome]], (indicating close [[Sequence homology|homology]]),&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warren WC, Hillier LD, Graves JA |title=Genome analysis of the platypus reveals unique signatures of evolution |journal=Nature |volume=453 |pages=175–183 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nature06936 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7192/full/nature06936.html |pmid=18464734 |issue=7192 |pmc=2803040 |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2008Natur.453..175W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SRY gene so central to sex-determination in most other mammals is apparently not involved in platypus sex-determination.&lt;ref name="Veyrunes"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Veyrunes F, Waters PD, Miethke P |title=Bird-like sex chromosomes of platypus imply recent origin of mammal sex chromosomes |journal=Genome Research |volume=18 |pages=965–973 |year=2008 |doi=10.1101/gr.7101908 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/6/965.abstract |pmid=18463302 |issue=6 |pmc=2413164 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among humans, some men have two Xs and a Y ("XXY", see [[Klinefelter syndrome]]), or one X and two Ys (see [[XYY syndrome]]), and [[triple X syndrome|some women have three Xs]] or a single X instead of a double X ("X0", see [[Turner syndrome]]).  There are other exceptions in which [[SRY]] is damaged (leading to an [[Swyer syndrome|XY female]]), or copied to the X (leading to an [[XX male]]). 

== Origins and evolution ==

===Before Y chromosome===
Many [[ectotherm]]ic [[vertebrates]] have no sex chromosomes.  If they have different sexes, sex is determined environmentally rather than genetically.  For some of them, especially [[reptile]]s, sex depends on the incubation temperature; others are [[hermaphrodite#Simultaneous hermaphrodites|hermaphroditic]] (meaning they contain both male and female gametes in the same individual).

===Origin===
The X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved from a pair of identical chromosomes,&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muller, H. J. |title=A gene for the fourth chromosome of Drosophila |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=325–336 |year=1914 |doi=10.1002/jez.1400170303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lahn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lahn B, Page D |title=Four evolutionary strata on the human X chromosome |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5441 |pages=964–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10542153 |doi=10.1126/science.286.5441.964}}&lt;!--http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s63100.htm [replaced]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; termed [[autosome]]s, when an ancestral animal developed an allelic variation, a so-called "sex locus" – simply possessing this [[allele]] caused the organism to be male.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt; The chromosome with this allele became the Y chromosome, while the other member of the pair became the X chromosome. Over time, genes that were beneficial for males and harmful to (or had no effect on) females either developed on the Y chromosome or were acquired through the process of [[chromosomal translocation|translocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graves J. A. M. |author2=Koina E. |author3=Sankovic N. |title=How the gene content of human sex chromosomes evolved |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=219–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16650758 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2006.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the X and Y chromosomes were thought to have diverged around 300 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|pmc=4120474|title=Y chromosome evolution: emerging insights into processes of Y chromosome degeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research published in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/01/human_male_still_a_work_in_pro.html |title=Human Male: Still A Work in Progress |work=NPR |date=January 13, 2010 |first=Jon |last=Hamilton }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly research published in 2008 documenting the sequencing of the platypus genome,&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; has suggested that the XY sex-determination system would not have been present more than 166 million years ago, at the split of the [[monotreme]]s from other mammals.&lt;ref name="Veyrunes" /&gt; This re-estimation of the age of the [[theria]]n XY system is based on the finding that sequences that are on the X chromosomes of marsupials and [[eutherian]] mammals are present on the autosomes of [[platypus]] and birds.&lt;ref name="Veyrunes" /&gt; The older estimate was based on erroneous reports that the platypus X chromosomes contained these sequences.&lt;ref name="Grützner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=Jaclyn M. |first2=Arthur |last2=Riggs |first3=Jennifer A. Marshall |last3=Graves |title=Gene mapping studies confirm the homology between the platypus X and echidna X1 chromosomes and identify a conserved ancestral monotreme X chromosome |year=1992 |journal=Chromosoma |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=596–601 |doi=10.1007/BF00360536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recombination inhibition===
[[Genetic recombination|Recombination]] between the X and Y chromosomes proved harmful—it resulted in males without necessary genes formerly found on the Y chromosome, and females with unnecessary or even harmful genes previously only found on the Y chromosome.  As a result, genes beneficial to males accumulated near the sex-determining genes, and recombination in this region was suppressed in order to preserve this male specific region.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt; Over time, the Y chromosome changed in such a way as to inhibit the areas around the sex determining genes from recombining at all with the X chromosome. As a result of this process, 95% of the human Y chromosome is unable to recombine. Only the tips of the Y and X chromosomes recombine. The tips of the Y chromosome that could recombine with the X chromosome are referred to as the [[pseudoautosomal region]].  The rest of the Y chromosome is passed on to the next generation intact, allowing for its use in tracking human evolution.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Degeneration===
By one estimate, the human Y chromosome has lost 1,393 of its 1,438 original genes over the course of its existence, and [[Extrapolation|linear extrapolation]] of this 1,393-gene loss over 300 million years gives a rate of genetic loss of 4.6 genes per million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graves |first=J. A. M. |year=2004 |title=The degenerate Y chromosome—can conversion save it? |journal=Reproduction Fertility and Development |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=527–534 |doi=10.1071/RD03096 |pmid=15367368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Continued loss of genes at the rate of 4.6 genes per million years would result in a Y chromosome with no functional genes – that is the Y chromosome would lose complete function – within the next 10 million years, or half that time with the current age estimate of 160 million years.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goto |first=H. |first2=L. |last2=Peng |first3=K. D. |last3=Makova |year=2009 |title=Evolution of X-degenerate Y chromosome genes in greater apes: conservation of gene content in human and gorilla, but not chimpanzee |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=134–144 |doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9189-y |pmid=19142680 |bibcode=2009JMolE..68..134G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomic analysis reveals that many mammalian species are experiencing a similar loss of function in their heterozygous sex chromosome. Degeneration may simply be the fate of all non-recombining sex chromosomes, due to three common evolutionary forces: high [[mutation rate]], inefficient [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graves |first=J. A. M. |year=2006 |title=Sex chromosome specialization and degeneration in mammals |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=901–914 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.024 |pmid=16530039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, comparisons of the human and [[chimpanzee]] Y chromosomes (first published in 2005) show that the human Y chromosome has not lost any genes since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees between 6–7 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Jennifer F. |year=2005 |title=Conservation of Y-linked genes during human evolution revealed by comparative sequencing in chimpanzee |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=100–103 |doi=10.1038/nature04101 |pmid=16136134 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2005Natur.437..100H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a scientific report in 2012 stated that only one gene had been lost since humans diverged from the rhesus macaque 25 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Christine|title=Biologists Debunk the 'Rotting' Y Chromosome Theory, Men Will Still Exist|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20120222/9163/y-chromosome-chromosome-theory-men-extinct-monkey-x-chromosome-biology.htm|publisher=Medical Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These facts provide direct evidence that the linear extrapolation model is flawed and suggest that the current human Y chromosome is either no longer shrinking or is shrinking at a much slower rate than the 4.6 genes per million years estimated by the linear extrapolation model.

====High mutation rate====
The human Y chromosome is particularly exposed to high mutation rates due to the environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through [[sperm]], which undergo multiple [[cell division]]s during [[gametogenesis]]. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater risk of mutation than the rest of the genome.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"/&gt; The increased mutation risk for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt; However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lindblad-Toh K, Wade CM, Mikkelsen TS, Karlsson EK, Jaffe DB, Kamal M, Clamp M, Chang JL, Kulbokas EJ, Zody MC, Mauceli E, Xie X, Breen M, Wayne RK, Ostrander EA, Ponting CP, Galibert F, Smith DR, DeJong PJ, Kirkness E, Alvarez P, Biagi T, Brockman W, Butler J, Chin CW, Cook A, Cuff J, Daly MJ, DeCaprio D, Gnerre S, Grabherr M, Kellis M, Kleber M, Bardeleben C, Goodstadt L, Heger A, Hitte C, Kim L, Koepfli KP, Parker HG, Pollinger JP, Searle SM, Sutter NB, Thomas R, Webber C, Baldwin J, Abebe A, Abouelleil A, Aftuck L, Ait-Zahra M, Aldredge T, Allen N, An P, Anderson S, Antoine C, Arachchi H, Aslam A, Ayotte L, Bachantsang P, Barry A, Bayul T, Benamara M, Berlin A, Bessette D, Blitshteyn B, Bloom T, Blye J, Boguslavskiy L, Bonnet C, Boukhgalter B, Brown A, Cahill P, Calixte N, Camarata J, Cheshatsang Y, Chu J, Citroen M, Collymore A, Cooke P, Dawoe T, Daza R, Decktor K, DeGray S, Dhargay N, Dooley K, Dooley K, Dorje P, Dorjee K, Dorris L, Duffey N, Dupes A, Egbiremolen O, Elong R, Falk J, Farina A, Faro S, Ferguson D, Ferreira P, Fisher S, FitzGerald M, Foley K, Foley C, Franke A, Friedrich D, Gage D, Garber M, Gearin G, Giannoukos G, Goode T, Goyette A, Graham J, Grandbois E, Gyaltsen K, Hafez N, Hagopian D, Hagos B, Hall J, Healy C, Hegarty R, Honan T, Horn A, Houde N, Hughes L, Hunnicutt L, Husby M, Jester B, Jones C, Kamat A, Kanga B, Kells C, Khazanovich D, Kieu AC, Kisner P, Kumar M, Lance K, Landers T, Lara M, Lee W, Leger JP, Lennon N, Leuper L, LeVine S, Liu J, Liu X, Lokyitsang Y, Lokyitsang T, Lui A, Macdonald J, Major J, Marabella R, Maru K, Matthews C, McDonough S, Mehta T, Meldrim J, Melnikov A, Meneus L, Mihalev A, Mihova T, Miller K, Mittelman R, Mlenga V, Mulrain L, Munson G, Navidi A, Naylor J, Nguyen T, Nguyen N, Nguyen C, Nguyen T, Nicol R, Norbu N, Norbu C, Novod N, Nyima T, Olandt P, O'Neill B, O'Neill K, Osman S, Oyono L, Patti C, Perrin D, Phunkhang P, Pierre F, Priest M, Rachupka A, Raghuraman S, Rameau R, Ray V, Raymond C, Rege F, Rise C, Rogers J, Rogov P, Sahalie J, Settipalli S, Sharpe T, Shea T, Sheehan M, Sherpa N, Shi J, Shih D, Sloan J, Smith C, Sparrow T, Stalker J, Stange-Thomann N, Stavropoulos S, Stone C, Stone S, Sykes S, Tchuinga P, Tenzing P, Tesfaye S, Thoulutsang D, Thoulutsang Y, Topham K, Topping I, Tsamla T, Vassiliev H, Venkataraman V, Vo A, Wangchuk T, Wangdi T, Weiand M, Wilkinson J, Wilson A, Yadav S, Yang S, Yang X, Young G, Yu Q, Zainoun J, Zembek L, Zimmer A, Lander ES|display-authors = 6 |title=Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7069 |pages=803–819 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16341006 |doi=10.1038/nature04338 |bibcode=2005Natur.438..803L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inefficient selection====
Without the ability to recombine during [[meiosis]], the Y chromosome is unable to expose individual [[allele]]s to natural selection. Deleterious alleles are allowed to "hitchhike" with beneficial neighbors, thus propagating maladapted alleles in to the next generation. Conversely, advantageous alleles may be selected against if they are surrounded by harmful alleles (background selection). Due to this inability to sort through its gene content, the Y chromosome is particularly prone to the accumulation of [[Noncoding DNA|"junk" DNA]]. Massive accumulations of retrotransposable elements are scattered throughout the Y.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"/&gt; The random insertion of DNA segments often disrupts encoded gene sequences and renders them nonfunctional. However, the Y chromosome has no way of weeding out these "jumping genes". Without the ability to isolate alleles, selection cannot effectively act upon them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A clear, quantitative indication of this inefficiency is the [[entropy rate]] of the Y chromosome. Whereas all other chromosomes in the [[human genome]] have entropy rates of 1.5–1.9 bits per nucleotide (compared to the theoretical maximum of exactly 2 for no redundancy), the Y chromosome's entropy rate is only 0.84.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zhandong |last=Liu |first2=Santosh S. |last2=Venkatesh |first3=Carlo C. |last3=Maley |title=Sequence space coverage, entropy of genomes and the potential to detect non-human DNA in human samples |journal=BMC Genomics |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue= 1|pages=509 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-509 |pmid=18973670 |pmc=2628393}} Fig. 6, using the [[Lempel-Ziv]] estimators of entropy rate.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the Y chromosome has a much lower information content relative to its overall length; it is more redundant.

====Genetic drift====
Even if a well adapted Y chromosome manages to maintain genetic activity by avoiding mutation accumulation, there is no guarantee it will be passed down to the next generation. The population size of the Y chromosome is inherently limited to 1/4 that of autosomes: diploid organisms contain two copies of autosomal chromosomes while only half the population contains 1 Y chromosome. Thus, genetic drift is an exceptionally strong force acting upon the Y chromosome. Through sheer random assortment, an adult male may never pass on his Y chromosome if he only has female offspring. Thus, although a male may have a well adapted Y chromosome free of excessive mutation, it may never make it in to the next gene pool.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"/&gt; The repeat random loss of well-adapted Y chromosomes, coupled with the tendency of the Y chromosome to evolve to have more deleterious mutations rather than less for reasons described above, contributes to the species-wide degeneration of Y chromosomes through [[Muller's ratchet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Charlesworth |first=B. |first2=D. |last2=Charlesworth |year=2000 |title=The degeneration of Y chromosomes |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1563–1572 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0717 |pmc=1692900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene conversion ===
As it has been already mentioned, the Y chromosome is unable to recombine during [[meiosis]] like the other human chromosomes; however, in 2003, researchers from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] discovered a process which may slow down the process of degradation.
They found that human Y chromosome is able to "recombine" with itself, using [[palindrome]] [[base pair]] sequences.&lt;ref name="rozen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rozen S, Skaletsky H, Marszalek J, Minx P, Cordum H, Waterston R, Wilson R, Page D |title=Abundant gene conversion between arms of palindromes in human and ape Y chromosomes |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6942 |pages=873–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12815433 |doi=10.1038/nature01723|bibcode=2003Natur.423..873R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a "recombination" is called [[gene conversion]].

In the case of the Y chromosomes, the [[palindrome]]s are not [[noncoding DNA]]; these strings of bases contain functioning genes important for male fertility. Most of the sequence pairs are greater than 99.97% identical. The extensive use of gene conversion may play a role in the ability of the Y chromosome to edit out genetic mistakes and maintain the integrity of the relatively few genes it carries. In other words, since the Y chromosome is single, it has duplicates of its genes on itself instead of having a second, homologous, chromosome. When errors occur, it can use other parts of itself as a template to correct them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Findings were confirmed by comparing similar regions of the Y chromosome in humans to the Y chromosomes of [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s and [[gorilla]]s. The comparison demonstrated that the same phenomenon of gene conversion appeared to be at work more than 5 million years ago, when humans and the non-human primates diverged from each other.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Future evolution ===

In the terminal stages of the degeneration of the Y chromosome, other chromosomes increasingly take over genes and functions formerly associated with it.  Finally, the Y chromosome disappears entirely, and a new sex-determining system arises.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt;{{POV statement|date=September 2016}}{{synthesis inline|date=September 2016}} Several species of [[rodent]] in the sister families [[Muridae]] and [[Cricetidae]] have reached these stages,&lt;ref name="Marchal 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=J.

===1:1 sex ratio===
[[Fisher's principle]] outlines why almost all species using [[sexual reproduction]] have a [[sex ratio]] of 1:1. [[W. D. Hamilton]] gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on "Extraordinary sex ratios",&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:&lt;!-- this is a better explanation than Fisher's contorted text--&gt;

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

==Non-mammal Y chromosome==
Many groups of organisms in addition to mammals have Y chromosomes, but these Y chromosomes do not share common ancestry with mammalian Y chromosomes.  Such groups include ''[[Drosophila]]'', some other insects, some fish, some reptiles, and some plants. In ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the Y chromosome does not trigger male development.  Instead, sex is determined by the number of X chromosomes. The ''D. melanogaster'' Y chromosome does contain genes necessary for male fertility. So XXY ''D. melanogaster'' are female, and ''D. melanogaster'' with a single X (X0), are male but sterile. There are some species of Drosophila in which X0 males are both viable and fertile.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===ZW chromosomes===
Other organisms have mirror image sex chromosomes: where the homogeneous sex is the male, said to have two Z chromosomes, and the female is the heterogeneous sex, and said to have a Z chromosome and a [[ZW sex-determination system|W chromosome]]. For example, female birds, snakes, and butterflies have ZW sex chromosomes, and males have ZZ sex chromosomes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Non-inverted Y chromosome===
There are some species, such as the [[Japanese rice fish]], the XY system is still developing and cross over between the X and Y is still possible. Because the male specific region is very small and contains no essential genes, it is even possible to artificially induce XX males and YY females to no ill effect.&lt;ref name=Schartl&gt;{{cite journal| author = Schartl, Manfred| title = A comparative view on sex determination in medaka| journal = Mechanisms of Development| volume = 121|issue=7–8| pages = 639–645| date = July 2004| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925477304000371| accessdate =6 December 2011| doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.03.001| pmid = 15210173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Y chromosome==
In humans, the Y chromosome spans about 58 million [[base pair]]s (the building blocks of [[DNA]]) and represents approximately 1% of the total DNA in a male [[cell (biology)|cell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome=Y National Library of Medicine's Genetic Home Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The human Y chromosome contains over 200 genes, at least 72 of which code for proteins.&lt;ref name="Chromosome Y"/&gt; Traits that are inherited via the Y chromosome are called [[Y linkage|Y-linked]], or holandric traits.

Some cells, especially in older men and [[tobacco smoking|smokers]], lack a Y chromosome. It has been found that men with a higher percentage of [[haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]] [[stem cells]] in blood lacking the Y chromosome (and perhaps a higher percentage of other cells lacking it) have a higher risk of certain [[cancer]]s and have a shorter life expectancy. Men with "loss of Y" (which was defined as no Y in at least 18% of their hematopoietic cells) have been found to die 5.5 years earlier on average than others. This has been interpreted as a sign that the Y chromosome plays a role going beyond sex determination and reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lars A. Forsberg|title=Mosaic loss of chromosome Y in peripheral blood is associated with shorter survival and higher risk of cancer|journal=Nature Genetics|date=April 2014|volume=46|pages=624–628 |pmid=24777449 |doi=10.1038/ng.2966|issue=6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the loss of Y may be an effect rather than a cause). And yet women, who have no Y chromosome, have lower rates of cancer. Male smokers have between 1.5 and 2 times the risk of non-respiratory cancers as female smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andy Coghlan|title=Y men are more likely to get cancer than women|journal=New Scientist|date=13 December 2014|page=17|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429995.800-y-men-are-more-likely-to-get-cancer-than-women.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jan P.

===Non-combining region of Y (NRY)===
{{Further|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup}}
The human Y chromosome is normally unable to recombine with the X chromosome, except for small pieces of [[pseudoautosomal region]]s at the [[telomere]]s (which comprise about 5% of the chromosome's length).  These regions are relics of ancient [[Homology (biology)|homology]] between the X and Y chromosomes. The bulk of the Y chromosome, which does not recombine, is called the "NRY", or non-recombining region of the Y chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080401184955.htm ''Science Daily'']'', Apr. 3, 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in this region are used to trace direct paternal ancestral lines. 

===Genes===
==== Number of genes ====
The following are some of the gene count estimates of human Y chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to [[genome annotation]] their predictions of the [[number of genes]] on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see [[gene prediction]]). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project ([[Consensus CDS Project|CCDS]]) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.&lt;ref name="pmid20441615"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pertea M, Salzberg SL| title=Between a chicken and a grape: estimating the number of human genes. | journal=Genome Biol | year= 2010 | volume= 11 | issue= 5 | pages= 206 | pmid=20441615 | doi=10.1186/gb-2010-11-5-206 | pmc=2898077 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=20441615  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Category see also|Genes on human chromosome Y}}
In general, the human Y chromosome is extremely gene poor—it is one of the largest [[Gene Deserts|gene deserts]] in the human genome. Disregarding [[Pseudoautosomal region|pseudoautosomal]] genes, genes encoded on the human Y chromosome include:

===Y-chromosome-linked diseases===
Diseases linked to the Y chromosome typically involve an [[aneuploidy]], an atypical number of chromosomes. 

=====Y chromosome microdeletion=====
[[Y chromosome microdeletion]] (YCM) is a family of genetic disorders caused by missing genes in the Y chromosome. Many affected men exhibit no symptoms and lead normal lives.  However, YCM is also known to be present in a significant number of men with reduced fertility or reduced sperm count.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====Defective Y chromosome=====
This results in the person presenting a female [[phenotype]] (i.e., is born with female-like genitalia) even though that person possesses an XY [[karyotype]]. The lack of the second X results in infertility. In other words, viewed from the opposite direction, the person goes through [[defeminization]] but fails to complete [[Virilization|masculinization]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The cause can be seen as an incomplete Y chromosome: the usual karyotype in these cases is 45X, plus a fragment of Y. This usually results in defective testicular development, such that the infant may or may not have fully formed male genitalia internally or externally. The full range of ambiguity of structure may occur, especially if [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] is present. When the Y fragment is minimal and nonfunctional, the child is usually a girl with the features of [[Turner syndrome]] or [[mixed gonadal dysgenesis]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====XXY=====
{{main|Klinefelter syndrome}}

Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is not an [[aneuploidy]] of the Y chromosome, but a condition of having an extra X chromosome, which usually results in defective postnatal testicular function.  The mechanism is not fully understood; it does not seem to be due to direct interference by the extra X with expression of Y genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====XYY=====
{{main|XYY syndrome}}

47, XYY syndrome (simply known as XYY syndrome) is caused by the presence of a single extra copy of the Y chromosome in each of a male's cells. 47, XYY males have one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes, for a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Researchers have found that an extra copy of the Y chromosome is associated with increased stature and an increased incidence of learning problems in some boys and men, but the effects are variable, often minimal, and the vast majority do not know their karyotype.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1965 and 1966 [[Patricia Jacobs]] and colleagues published a chromosome survey of 315 male patients at
[[Scotland]]'s only special security hospital for the [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]],
finding a higher than expected number of patients to have an extra Y chromosome.&lt;ref name="jacobs-1965"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs, Patricia A. |author2=Brunton, Muriel |author3=Melville, Marie M. |author4=Brittain, Robert P. |author5=McClemont, William F. |date=December 25, 1965 |title=Aggressive behavior, mental sub-normality and the XYY male |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=208 |issue=5017 |pages=1351–2 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v208/n5017/abs/2081351a0.html |doi=10.1038/2081351a0 |pmid=5870205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study wondered "whether an extra Y chromosome predisposes its carriers to unusually aggressive behaviour", and this conjecture "framed the next fifteen years of research on the human Y chromosome".&lt;ref name="richardson-sex-itself"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Sarah S.|title=Sex Itself: The Search for Male &amp; Female in the Human Genome|date=2013|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-08468-8|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through studies over the next decade, this conjecture was shown to be incorrect: the elevated crime rate of XYY males is due to lower median intelligence and not increased aggression,&lt;ref name="witkin-1976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witkin HA, Mednick SA, Schulsinger F, Bakkestrom E, Christiansen KO, Goodenough DR, Hirschhorn K, Lundsteen C, Owen DR, Philip J, Rubin DB, Stocking M | title = Criminality in XYY and XXY men | journal = Science | volume = 193 | issue = 4253 | pages = 547–55 | date = August 1976 | pmid = 959813 | doi = 10.1126/science.959813| bibcode = 1976Sci...193..547W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased height was the only characteristic that could be reliably associated with XYY males.&lt;ref name="witkin-1977"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Witkin, Herman A. |author2=Goodenough, Donald R. |author3=Hirschhorn, Kurt |date=1977 |title=XYY Men: Are They Criminally Aggressive? |journal=The Sciences |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=10–13 |doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1977.tb01570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "criminal karyotype" concept is therefore inaccurate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

====Rare====
The following Y-chromosome-linked diseases are rare, but notable because of their elucidating of the nature of the Y chromosome.

=====More than two Y chromosomes=====
Greater degrees of Y chromosome polysomy (having more than one extra copy of the Y chromosome in every cell, e.g., XYYY) are rare. The extra genetic material in these cases can lead to skeletal abnormalities, decreased IQ, and delayed development, but the severity features of these conditions are variable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====XX male syndrome=====
[[XX male syndrome]] occurs when there has been a [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] in the formation of the male [[gamete]]s, causing the [[SRY]] portion of the Y chromosome to move to the X chromosome. When such an X chromosome contributes to the child, the development will lead to a male, because of the SRY gene.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Genetic genealogy ===
{{Main|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosomal Adam}}

In human [[genetic genealogy]] (the application of [[genetics]] to [[Genealogy|traditional genealogy]]), use of the information contained in the Y chromosome is of particular interest because, unlike other chromosomes, the Y chromosome is passed exclusively from father to son, on the patrilineal line. [[Mitochondrial DNA]], maternally inherited to both sons and daughters, is used in an analogous way to trace the matrilineal line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Brain function===
Research is currently investigating whether male-pattern neural development is a direct consequence of Y-chromosome-related gene expression or an indirect result of Y-chromosome-related androgenic hormone production.&lt;ref name="Kopsida 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Role of the Y Chromosome in Brain Function | journal = The Open Neuroendocrinology Journal | first = Eleni | last = Kopsida |author2=Evangelia Stergiakouli |author3=Phoebe M. Lynn |author4=Lawrence S.

===Microchimerism===
The presence of male chromosomes in fetal cells in the blood circulation of women was discovered in 1974.&lt;ref name="SchroederEtAl1974"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Schröder J, Thlikainen A, de la Chapelle A|title=Fetal leukocytes in the maternal circulation after delivery: Cytological aspects|journal=Transplantation|volume=17|issue=4|year=1974|pages=346–354|issn=0041-1337|doi=10.1097/00007890-197404000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, it was found that male fetal progenitor cells could persist postpartum in the maternal blood stream for as long as 27 years.&lt;ref name="BianchiEtAl1996"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bianchi D. W. |author2=Zickwolf G. K. |author3=Weil G. J. |author4=Sylvester S. |author5=DeMaria M. A. | year = 1996 | title = Male fetal progenitor cells persist in maternal blood for as long as 27 years postpartum | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 705–708 | doi=10.1073/pnas.93.2.705 | pmid=8570620 | pmc=40117|bibcode=1996PNAS...93..705B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, investigated the origin of male chromosomes found in the peripheral blood of women who had not had male progeny. A total of 120 subjects (women who had never had sons) were investigated, and it was found that 21% of them had male DNA. The subjects were categorised into four groups based on their case histories:&lt;ref name="YanEtAl2004"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in women without sons: Quantitative assessment and correlation with pregnancy history|url=http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(05)00270-6/fulltext|author=Yan, Zhen|author2=Lambert, Nathalie C.|author3=Guthrie, Katherine A.|author4=Porter, Allison J.|author5=Loubiere, Laurence S.|author6=Madeleine, Margaret M.|author7=Stevens, Anne M.|author8=Hermes, Heidi M.|author9=Nelson, J. Lee|last-author-amp=yes|journal =The American Journal of Medicine|volume=118| issue=8|pages=899–906 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.03.037 |format=full text |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pmid=16084184 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Group A (8%) had had only female progeny.
* Patients in Group B (22%) had a history of one or more miscarriages.
* Patients Group C (57%) had their pregnancies medically terminated.
* Group D (10%) had never been pregnant before.

The study noted that 10% of the women had never been pregnant before, raising the question of where the Y chromosomes in their blood could have come from. The study suggests that possible reasons for occurrence of male chromosome microchimerism could be one of the following:&lt;ref name="YanEtAl2004"/&gt;
* miscarriages,
* pregnancies,
* vanished male twin,
* possibly from sexual intercourse.

A 2012 study at the same institute has detected cells with the Y chromosome in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.&lt;ref name="ChanEtAl2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in the human female brain|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045592|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0045592|author=Chan W.
