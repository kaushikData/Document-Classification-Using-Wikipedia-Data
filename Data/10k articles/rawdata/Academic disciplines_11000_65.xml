The '''Professor Abdus Salam Centre for Physics''' ({{lang-ur|عبداسلام ادارہ برائے طبیعیات}}), previously known as the '''Riazzudin National Centre for Physics''' is an academic [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|national research institute]] for physics and mathematical sciences located in [[Islamabad, Pakistan]]. The [[Government of Pakistan]] had the jurisdiction of the institute from 1999 until April 2004, when the institute was made a scientific organization. However, the institute is still funded in large by the Pakistani federal government&lt;ref name="ncp.edu.pk"&gt;http://www.ncp.edu.pk/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The proposal for the establishment of the centre was first put forward in 1951. It is under the ''de facto'' control of the Strategic Plans Division of the Pakistani [[National Command Authority (Pakistan)|National Command Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoodbhoy |first1=Pervez |title=A Pakistani's candid report after visiting India's IITs |url=https://scroll.in/article/802345/a-pakistani-visitors-report-after-returning-from-india-the-enemy-country |website=Scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 1999, the institute operates quadripartite supervision of [[ICTP]], [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|INSC]], and [[CERN]], and main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[high-energy physics]] research. As of today, the NCP emerged as world's leading particle physics institute producing hundreds of papers by world's scientists who joined this institute, and numerous scientific experiments have been constructed at NCP by national and international collaborations to make use of them.

==History==

===Origins===
Establishing world-class physics research institutes was proposed by a number of scientists. The roots of NCP institutes go back to when Nobel laureate professor [[Abdus Salam]], after receiving his doctorate in physics, came back to Pakistan in 1951. Joining his alma mater, [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] as Professor of Mathematics in 1951, Salam made an effort to establish the physics institute but was unable to do so. The same year, he became chairman of the Mathematics [[Academic department|Department]] of the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] where he tried to revolutionise the department by introducing the course of [[Quantum Mechanics]] necessary for undergraduate students, but it was soon reverted by the vice-chancellor. He soon faced the choice between intellectual death or migration to the stimulating environment of a [[Education in Europe|western institutions]]. This choice, however, left a deep impression on him and was behind his determination to create an institution to which physicists from developing countries would come as a right to interact with their peers from industrially advanced countries without permanently leaving their own countries. This resulted in founding to the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP) by Professor Abdus Salam in Italy.

===INSC and INP===
In 1974, Prof. Abdus Salam visualised the need of an institution where experts from the industrialised nations and learners from the developing countries could get together for a couple of weeks once a year to exchange views on various subjects of current interest in Physics and allied sciences. His suggestion was accepted by Chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and it was the year 1976 when the first [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs]] (INSC) was inaugurated at Nathiagali, with co-sponsorship of [[ICTP]] and [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], under the directorship of Prof. [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], a pupil student of Abdus Salam. The same year, Ishfaq Ahmad established the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Physics|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] at the [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore|University of Engineering and Technology]] of Lahore where Abdus Salam was invited to give first lectures on particle physics and quantum mechanics.

Since then, it has been regularly held without break and it is a great credit to Prof. Riazuddin for his dedication and commitment as such type of international scientific gathering in a developing country like Pakistan presents a major step for the promotion of science. A major aim and goal, Prof. Abdus Salam had in his mind when he made his original proposal to PAEC in 1974 that Nathiagali Summer College would evolve into a full-fledged Centre for Physics on the pattern of ICTP. To transform his vision to reality, his student Prof. Riazuddin played a major role.

===Foundation===
The National Centre for Physics came into reality when Prof. Riazuddin arranged a one-day symposium on ''Frontiers of Fundamental Physics'' on 27 January 1999 at the Institute of Physics of Quaid-e-Azam University, only seven months before the recent tests, (''[[Chagai-I]]''). All the leading scientists of the country and some visitors from [[CERN]] attended this symposium and they provided their support. Prof. Riazuddin being the founding father of NCP, was its first Director-General and it was inaugurated by Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], Chairman of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] during this period, on 16 May 2000. The Director General of [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN), Dr. [[Luciano Maiani]] and distinguished members of his delegation, the Vice-Chancellor of Quaid-i-Azam University, Dr. Tariq Saddiqui and other dignitaries, witnessed the inauguration.&lt;ref name="ncp.edu.pk"/&gt; The first academic faculty of this institute were included [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]], [[Fayyazuddin|Fiazuddin]], [[Masud Ahmad]], and Ishfaq Ahmad, who first presented their physics papers to the institutes and CERN.

In 2008, Dr. Hamid Saleem became its Director-General after, his predecessor and founding father of NCP, Prof. Riazuddin, who was made lifetime Director General Emeritus. The vision of Prof. Riazuddin to make NCP one of the leading Physics institute of Pakistan is now being carried by Dr. Hamid Saleem.

NCP offers research in different branches of Physics such as [[particle Physics]], [[computational physics]], [[Astrophysics]], [[Cosmology]], [[Atmospheric physics]], [[Atomic, molecular, and optical physics]], [[Chemical physics]], [[Condensed matter physics]], ([[Fluid dynamics]], [[Laser Physics]], [[Mathematical physics]], [[Plasma Physics]]·, [[Quantum field theory]], Nano Physics, [[Quantum information]] theory

==Collaboration with CERN==
NCP is collaborating with CERN in the field of [[Particle physics#Experimental_laboratories|experimental high-energy physics]]. NCP and CERN are involved in the development, testing and fabrication of 432 [[Resistive plate chamber|Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC)]] required for the [[Compact Muon Solenoid#Layer_5_–_The_muon_detectors_and_return_yoke|CMS muon detector]] at CERN. The RPC has an excellent time resolution i.e. of the order of 1–2 nanoseconds and it will be used for the bunch tagging at [[LHC]]. At the national level, this project is a joint collaboration of NCP and PAEC, whereas at international level, NCP also collaborating with Italy, China, [[South Korea]] and US.

The RPC is a gaseous detector made using two parallel-plates of bakelite with high resistivity. Each RPC for CMS will be equipped with 96 electronic channels, which will be readout are based on 0.14 micrometre BiCMOS technology. For the complete system, number of readout channels are around 50,000. RNCP has an experimental high energy physics laboratory which is equipped with the high speed and advanced data acquisition system based on VME standards. This laboratory is used for prototyping and testing of RPCs at present.

===Advanced Scientific Computing===

High performance and data intense computing is the back bone of modern-day science. There are stringent requirements for computing at LHC. To exploit the full physics potential of LHC data in comprehensive manner. NCP will require high performance computing for accelerator physics, computational condensed matter physics and theoretical particle physics. For accessing and managing the LHC data novel techniques like the concept of data and computing grids are used. CERN has evolved a new project called the [[Worldwide LHC Computing Grid|LHC Computing Grid (LCG)]]. NCP is a partner of CERN in this project and it is the only LCG node in [[Pakistan]].

===International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)===
NCP signed a memorandum of understanding during dr. [[K. R. Sreenivasan]], Director ICTP's visit to Pakistan from 26 to 30 June 2005. In addition, the Centre carries out research in areas that are not covered by any institute of Physics. One such area being pursued by the Centre involves a number of activities in Experimental High-Energy Physics through a co-operative agreement with CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Besides this, NCP has collaborations with several international institutes and universities in the field of theoretical physics including AS-ICTP, Trieste, Italy; Centre for Plasma Astrophysics (CPA), K-Leuven University, Belgium; Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan; Ruhr University, Bochum (RUB), Germany and many others. Several research papers are published in reputed international journals each year from NCP through national and international collaborations.

==Mechanisms of adaptation to acidic environments==

Most acidophile organisms have evolved extremely efficient mechanisms to pump protons out of the [[intracellular]] space in order to keep the [[cytoplasm]] at or near neutral pH. Therefore, intracellular proteins do not need to develop acid stability through evolution. However, other acidophiles, such as ''[[Acetobacter]] aceti'', have an acidified cytoplasm which forces nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Menzel, U.
|author2=Gottschalk, G.
|date=1985
|volume=143
|title=The internal pH of ''Acetobacterium wieringae'' and ''Acetobacter aceti'' during growth and production of acetic acid
|issue=1
|journal=Arch Microbiol
|pages=47–51
|doi=10.1007/BF00414767
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, ''Acetobacter aceti'' has become a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins can attain acid stability.

Studies of proteins adapted to low pH have revealed a few general mechanisms by which proteins can achieve acid stability.  In most acid stable proteins (such as pepsin and the [[soxF]] [[protein]] from ''Sulfolobus acidocaldarius''), there is an overabundance of acidic residues which minimizes low pH destabilization induced by a buildup of positive charge. Other mechanisms include minimization of solvent accessibility of acidic residues or binding of metal cofactors. In a specialized case of acid stability, the NAPase protein from ''Nocardiopsis alba'' was shown to have relocated acid-sensitive [[salt bridge (protein)|salt bridges]] away from regions that play an important role in the unfolding process. In this case of kinetic acid stability, protein longevity is accomplished across a wide range of pH, both acidic and basic.

The '''Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios''' ('''APTA''' – São Paulo’s Agency for Agribusiness Technology), linked to [[Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento]] (Secretariat of Agriculture and Supplies), came about in 2001, in order to coordinate all agriculture and cattle raising research in the state of [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. Its main objective is to generate and transfer scientific and technological knowledge in [[agribusiness]], thereby harmonizing the socio-economic development with environmental balance. The main innovation in this reorganization was the creation of 15 regional poles of development, spread throughout the state.
APTA has guided itself by the prospects of technological demands, and does it regionally, as an instrument to guide the research of the entire agency.
In addition to the poles, APTA’s structure encompasses the six research bodies of the Secretaria da Agricultura and Abastecimento (SAA – Secretariat of Agriculture and Supplies) – the [[Instituto Agronômico de Campinas]] (IAC -Agronomical Institute), the [[Instituto Biológico]] (Biological Institute), the [[Instituto de Economia Agrícola]] (IEA -  Agricultural Economics Institute), the Instituto de Zootecnica (IZ - Zoo technical Institute), the Instituto de Pesca (Fisheries Institute) and the Instituto de Tecnologia de Alimentos (ITAL – Food Technology Institute). The agency centers its activities on four strategic programs: bioenergy, environmental sustainability, organization of the rural and outlying areas, and food safety.
As the second largest agribusiness technological research institution in Brazil and the Southern Hemisphere, APTA features 64 experimental units and 43 research laboratories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5270">In [[neuroethology]] and the study of [[learning]], '''anti-Hebbian learning''' describes a particular class of [[learning rule]] by which [[synaptic plasticity]] can be controlled. These rules are based on a reversal of [[Hebbian learning|Hebb's postulate]], and therefore can be simplistically understood as dictating reduction of the strength of synaptic connectivity between neurons following a scenario in which a neuron directly contributes to production of an action potential in another neuron.
 	
==Evidence from neuroethology==
Neuroethological study has provided strong evidence for the existence of a system which adheres to an anti-[[Hebbian learning]] rule. Research on the mormyrid electric fish has demonstrated that the [[electrosensory lateral-line lobe]] (ELL) receives sensory input from [[knollenorgan]]s (electroreceptive sensory organs) which utilize a self-generated electrical discharge (called an EOD; electric organ discharge) to extract information from the environment about objects in close proximity to the fish.

In addition to information from sensory receptors, the ELL receives a signal from the area of the brain responsible for ''initiating'' the electrical discharges, known as the EOD command nucleus. This [[efference copy]] diverges, transmitted through two separate pathways, before the signals converge along with electrosensory input on [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje]]-like Medium Ganglion cells in the ELL. These cells receive information through extensive apical dendritic projections from parallel fibers that signal the transmission of an order to release an EOD. These cells also receive information from neurons conveying electrosensory information.

Important to anti-Hebbian learning, the synapses between the parallel fibers and the apical dendrites of Medium [[Ganglion cells]] show a specific pattern of synaptic plasticity. Should activation of the dendrites by parallel fibers occur in a short time period preceding the initiation of a dendritic broad spike (an action potential which travels through the dendrites), the strength of the connection between the neurons at these synapses will be reduced. Activation by the parallel fibers in all other circumstances – including activation significantly preceding as well as any activation following the broad spike – will result in the strengthening of the [[synapse]].

==Significance==
Since the neurons of the ELL receive both a corollary discharge (another term for an efference copy) of the motor output commands sent to the EOD, and afferent input from the electrosensory receptors, the animal is able to eliminate predictable inputs produced by its own motor output. The system is able to filter the expected input from the EOD, while signals which are unexpected, arriving at odd intervals with regard to the motor command are effectively strengthened by the learning rule. This allows the extraction of information about objects which cause an alteration in the flow of the electric field around the fish, highlighting changes while discarding uninformative sensory inputs.

The adaptation of these synapses, though, will only increase the strength of a synaptic connection until the resulting excitation aids in activation of a broad-spike wave. As a result, if changes in external environment are consistent, the connections between the neurons previously described will reach a level at which excitation, similar to the initial state, is once again held at a threshold, so that slight changes in the incoming sensory information will result in contribution to broad-spike initiation. In this manner, the organism is able to learn to ignore redundant sensory information in the environment. The eventual desensitization to these consistencies is essential to prevent excessive noise from masking important sensory information. Numerous potential causes which could result in a consistent alteration in the reception of EOD signals include: growth, changes in water conductance (salinity), low water levels (where the shallow bottom of the body of water would interfere with electrical currents), and possibly injuries.

==Predicted application==
Synaptic plasticity operating under the control of an anti-Hebbian learning rule is thought to occur in the [[cerebellum]]. Understanding the operation of neural learning could provide valuable insights for the treatment of cerebellar-related disorders. The knowledge could also serve a significant function in the computer-based collection of data, repeatedly adjusting to redundant inputs while emphasizing the appearance of alterations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">"'''As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly'''" is an [[aphorism]] which appears in the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the [[Bible]] — [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#26:11|Proverbs 26:11]] ({{Lang-he|כְּ֭כֶלֶב שָׁ֣ב עַל־קֵאֹ֑ו כְּ֝סִ֗יל שֹׁונֶ֥ה בְאִוַּלְתֹּֽו}} ''Kəḵeleḇ šāḇ ‘al-qê’ōw; kəsîl, 	šōwneh ḇə’iwwaltōw.''), also partially quoted in the [[New Testament]], [[2 Peter]] 2:22.  It means that fools are stubbornly [[Rigidity (psychology)|inflexible]] and this is illustrated with the repulsive [[simile]] of the [[dog]] that eats its [[vomiting|vomit]] again, even though this may be poisonous.  Dogs were considered [[unclean animals|unclean]] in Biblical times as they were commonly [[scavenger]]s of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures, symbolising evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lj8IXYthLgC|page=354|title=The Book of Proverbs: Chapters 15–31|author=Bruce K. Waltke|isbn=978-0-8028-2776-0|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUEAAAAMAAJ|title=Writing with a purpose|author=James McNab McCrimmon|page=144|isbn=978-0-395-17740-2|year=1973|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/saa/1997/00000005/00000001/art00003|title=Dogs: God's Worst Enemies?|author=Sophia Menache|volume=5|issue=1|year=1997|pages=23–44|doi=10.1163/156853097X00204|journal=Society and Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yz04U3SlSMC&amp;pg=PA92 |year=2008 |title=Animal imagery in the book of Proverbs |isbn=978-90-04-16287-7 |author=Tova Forti |chapter=Dog and Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#27:22|Proverbs 27:22]], "Though you grind a fool in a [[mortar and pestle|mortar]], grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjEYEjVVEosC|title=Dictionary of biblical imagery|author1=Leland Ryken |author2=Jim Wilhoit |author3=James C. Wilhoit |author4=Tremper Longman |author5=Colin Duriez |author6=Douglas Penney |author7=Daniel G. Reid |page=296|isbn=978-0-8308-1451-0|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Proverbs, the "fool" represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, and the "wise" represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously. The modern association of these words with intellectual capacity is not in the original context.

==Development==
The Greek translation in the [[Septuagint]] developed the idea, imbuing it with a sense of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], "As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes abominable, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin." This was due to the contemporary idea of the fool as [[Bad (ethics)#Christian theology|ungodly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Conceptual Stratification in LXX Prov 26,11: Toward Identifying the Tradents Behind the Aphorism |author=Tova Forti |journal=Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=241–258 |issn=1613-0103 |doi=10.1515/ZAW.2007.019 |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/ZAW.2007.019 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] refers to the proverb ([[s:Bible (King James)/2 Peter#2:22|2 Peter 2:22]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJcsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA285 |page=285 |title=Notes, explanatory and practical, on the general epistles of James, Peter, John and Jude |author=Albert Barnes |year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; "But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."  [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] cites this in his poem ''[[The Gods of the Copybook Headings]]'' as one of several classic examples of repeated folly:{{cquote|As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man&lt;br&gt;There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.&lt;br&gt;That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,&lt;br&gt;And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;}}

The proverb is a favourite of the British politician [[Ken Livingstone]] who used it on the occasion of his failure to rejoin the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/livingstone-vents-his-fury-as-his-bid-to-rejoin-labour-fails-649295.html|title=Livingstone vents his fury as his bid to rejoin Labour fails|author=Paul Waugh|date=24 July 2002|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on occasion in the [[Parliament of Australia]] by [[Paul Keating]], in reference to his political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The half wit, wisdom of a failed intellect | journal=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=Sep 26, 2006 |author=Piers Akerman |quote=In 1990, Paul Keating famously accused Wilson Tuckey of being "a dog returning to its own vomit" ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV programme ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'' (the prequel to ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''), in the episode titled "Home," Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father. He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Joyce: "Why did you go back to Oxford?" 
Endeavour: "Oh! A policeman goes where he's sent."
Joyce: "When I told Pop, he just said, ''''Proverbs 26:11'''.'"
Endeavour: [Recognizing the verse] "Well I've many faults, God knows, but I try to draw the line at masochism. Besides, traditionally it's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime, not the... whatever I was."&lt;ref&gt;''Endeavour'', Season 1, Episode, 4 May 5th 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beauty Is in the Street: A Visual Record of the May 68 Uprising'''''&lt;ref name=dd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10367/1/may-1969-to-may-2011|title=May 1969 To May 2011|date=2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Dazed Digital]]|first=Huw|last=Nesbitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2011 book of posters produced by the ''Atelier Populaire'' (Popular Workshop) in support of the [[May 1968 events in France]]. It was edited by Johan Kugelberg with Philippe Vermés and published in the United Kingdom by Four Corners Books in 2011.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/beauty-is-in-the-street-2291269.html|title=Beauty is in the Street|date=31 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Matilda|last=Battersby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Paris July 1968.jpg|thumb|Posters in Paris in July 1968]]

The ''Atelier Populaire'', who designed and printed the posters, were a group of [[Marxist]] artists and art students who occupied the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] during with the wave of [[wildcat strikes]] in May 1968.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; Using a [[silk-screen]] printing press they produced thousands of posters at a time.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; They typically were printed on newssheet using a single colour, and use a simple [[iconography]] in which the factory represents the role of workers in society and the fist stands for solidarity and resistance (see right).&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

They comment on topics including the [[freedom of the press]] (see also [[Censorship in France]]), [[colonialism]] (see also [[French colonial empire]]) and the status of [[immigrant workers]] (see also [[Immigration to France]]).&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; The posters were also used to voice opposition to [[consumerism]] and were inspired by the [[Situationist International]]'s critique of the [[spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]] and [[Georges Perec]]'s 1965 novel ''[[Things: A Story of the Sixties]].&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

Though the posters display various styles, individual artists were never credited and each work was treated as the work of the collective.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; General assemblies (see [[General assembly (Occupy movement)]]) were held to discuss and vote on the posters.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/01/1968-paris-protest-posters-.html|title='Beauty Is in the Street' features 1968 Paris protest posters|date=January 1, 2012|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Liesl|last=Bradner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; In a 1969 book of the posters, the ''Atelier Populaire'' wrote "To use them for decorative purposes, to display them in bourgeois places of culture or to consider them as objects of aesthetic interest is to impair both their function and their effect."&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

Much of the imagery they created, including a poster of a truncheon-wielding [[riot police]]man (right) has since achieved iconic status.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; The posters were rarely saved but were collected by Kugelberg who staged an exhibition at London's [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; The exhibition commemorated the 40th anniversary of the protests.&lt;ref name=dd/&gt;

==Overview==

The book includes over 200 posters.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/four-corners-beauty-in-the-street|title=Four Corners: Beauty is in the Street|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=It's Nice That|first=Alex|last=Bec}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the exhibition which preceded it, the posters in the book are accompanied by photographs taken by Vermés of the students, the production process and the protests,&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; many of which were previously unpublished.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

The book also includes a foreword by Vermés, a founder of the ''Atelier Populaire'';&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; translations of first-hand accounts of students' and strikers' clashes with the police;&lt;ref name=int/&gt; manifestos and pamphlets;&lt;ref name=dd/&gt; a pictorial index, a bibliography, and a thumbnail gallery of posters that were not reproduced full-size.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Justin McGuirk noted the continued relevance of "the spirit of '68" in the United Kingdom in the wake of the [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|2010 student protests]], describing the book as "a beautiful volume". McGuirk questioned the absence of political design from the 2010 protests and occupations, as well as the commercial [[street art]] of [[Banksy]] and [[Shepard Fairey]], and the contemporary popularity of the 1939 [[Keep Calm and Carry On]] poster.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/23/beauty-in-street-posters-protest|title=Beauty Is in the Street: the power of protest posters|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Justin|last=McGuirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s Liesl Bradner also argued for the book's relevance in 2012 after the [[Occupy movement]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s naming "the protester" as its [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Alex Bec of the art blog ''It's Nice That'' noted that despite the events of May 1968 having been well documented, "''Beauty is in the Street'' blew everything before it out of the water."&lt;ref name=int/&gt; Fíacha O'Dubhda of ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]'' described the book as one "that immerses the reader in the process through which spontaneous design and production were used to document, illustrate and instigate" the events of May 1968.&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/review/article/on-the-barricades|title=On the barricades|date=Summer 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]|first=Fíacha|last=O'Dubhda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17154">{{short description|An approach to human geography that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach}}
'''Behavioral geography''' is an approach to [[human geography]] that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach. Behavioral geographers focus on the [[cognitive process]]es underlying [[spatial reasoning]], [[decision making]], and [[behavior]]. In addition, behavioral geography is an ideology/approach in human geography that makes use of the methods and assumptions of [[behaviorism]] to determine the [[cognitive]] processes involved in an individual's perception of or response and reaction to their environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Behavioral geography is that branch of human science, which deals with the study of cognitive processes with its response to its environment, through behaviorism.

==Issues==
Because of the name it is often assumed to have its roots in [[behaviorism]]. While some behavioral geographers clearly have roots in behaviorism&lt;ref name=Norton01&gt;Norton, W. (2001). Initiating an affair human geography and [[behavior analysis]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2 (4), 283–290 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton02&gt;Norton, W. (2002) Explaining Landscape Change: Group Identity and Behavior. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (2), 155–160 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; due to the emphasis on cognition, most can be seen as cognitively oriented. Indeed, it seems that behaviorism interest is more recent&lt;ref name=Glass07&gt;Glass, J.E. (2007). Behavior analytic grounding of sociological [[social constructionism]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8 (4), 426–433 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; and growing.&lt;ref name=Norton01/&gt; This is particularly true in the area of human landscaping.

Behavioral geography draws from early behaviorist works such as [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s concepts of "[[cognitive map]]s". More [[Cognitive geography|cognitively oriented]], behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.&lt;ref name=Norton97&gt;Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. ''The Psychological Record'', 47, 439–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive processes include environmental perception and cognition, wayfinding, the construction of cognitive maps, place attachment, the development of attitudes about space and place, decisions and behavior based on imperfect knowledge of one's environs, and numerous other topics.

The approach adopted in behavioral geography is closely related to that of [[psychology]], but draws on research findings from a multitude of other disciplines including economics, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[transportation planning]], and many others.

== The Social Construction of Nature ==
[[Nature]] is the world which surrounds us, including all life (plants, animals, organisms, humans, etc.) and physical features. [[Social constructionism|Social Construction]] is the way that human beings process the world around us in our minds. According to [[Plato|Plato's]] 'Classical Theory of Categorization', humans create categories of what they see through experience and imagination.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;Gerber, J. (1997). Beyond Dualism — the social construction of nature and the natural ''and'' social construction of human beings. Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.925.2585&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism, therefore, is this characterization that makes language and [[semantics]] possible.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; If these experiences and imageries are not placed into categories,  then the human ability to think about it becomes limited.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

The social construction of nature looks to question different truths and understandings for how people treat nature, based on when and where someone lives. In academic circles, researchers look at how truths exist ([[ontology]]) and how truths are justified ([[epistemology]]).&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Construction is both a process and an outcome, where people's understandings of the word nature can be both [[literal and figurative language|literal]] and [[metaphor]]ical,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Demerit, D. (2002). What is the 'social construction of nature'? A typology and sympathetic critique. Retrieved from https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/SOC165/Demeritt_2002_-_Social_Constr_of_Nature.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as through giving it a human quality ([[Mother Nature]]).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Williams, R. (1983). Keyword: A vocabulary of culture and society. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to discredit [[science]] or philosophy.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

As a subset of behavioral geography, the social construction of nature also includes [[environmental ethics]] and [[Value (ethics)|values]], which affect how humans treat, and interact with, the [[natural environment]]. It incorporates ideas from [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[geography]], [[biology]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[economics]], and other disciplines, to bring together the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of life. Social constructionism uses a lot of ideas from [[Western world]] thinking, but it is also incorporates truths from other [[world view]]s, such as the [[Traditional knowledge|Traditional Knowledge]] of Aboriginal groups, or more specifically [[ecofeminism]]&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Merchant, C. (2003). Reinventing Eden: The Fate of Nature in Western Culture. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). ''Staying Alive: Women, Ecology, and Development'' (1st ed.).

Ubuntu, Ukama, Environment and Moral Education. ''Journal of Moral Education, 41''(3), 329-340.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophy in [[Africa]], for example. It is also related to [[Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism|postmodernism]]&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;Proctor, J. (1998).

''Nature, 519(7542)'', 143-147.&lt;/ref&gt; that views humans as a force that is redirecting the [[geological history of Earth]],&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; destroying nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, W. (1995). The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature. In ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature'' (pp. 69-90). New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Role of Linguistics ===
[[File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|thumb|Raymond Williams, author of ''Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society (1983)''.]]
There are many ways of understanding and interpreting nature.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; According to [[Raymond Williams]], there are three ways to give meaning to (or define) nature:
# Nature as a quality, character or process&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. human nature)
# Nature as a force&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. weather)
# Nature as the material world&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. the physical environment)
According to [[Raymond Williams]], language plays a role in how we understand, interpret, and give meaning to nature.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This is how multiple truths can be valid at the same time.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== The Role of Mental Maps ===
Humans have the ability to create images of their environments through experiences in their mind.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Lynch, D. (1960). The Image of the City. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences allow us to create [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] where we can create memories associated to space.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is a two-way process where the environment provides suggestions for what should be seen, and then the observer gives meaning with those suggestions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

These images have three parts:
# An identity&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A pattern&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A [[Pragmatism|practical]] or [[emotion]]al meaning&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
According to [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], the environmental images (or mental maps) that we make can either be weak or strong, where the process is ongoing and never stops.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== The Role of Science ===
[[Science]] occurs at many [[dimension]]s and scales that do not consider culture, but can be motivated by politics, economics and ethics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Pedynowski, D. (2003). Science(s) - which, when and whose? Probing the metanarrative of scientific knowledge in the social construction of nature. Retrieved from http://0-eds.b.ebscohost.com.mercury.concordia.ca/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=15017498-bcd5-409d-b7ed-3d2141dad610%40sessionmgr101&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific knowledge consists of [[concept]]s and [[analysis]], and is a way to represent nature.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

According to [[Michel Foucault]], a truth does not have to be close to reality for it to be worth something or have power.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For [[Carolyn Merchant]], science can only be given power if a truth is interpreted as having worth.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Schools of Thought ==

[[Relativism]] is important in the social construction of nature, as all truths are relative to the perspective they are coming from. There are two schools of thought on how the social construction of nature is relative:
# [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|Critical Realism]] (being realistic)&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
# [[Pragmatism]] (being practical)&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Critical realists reject the idea of relativism and rely more on natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Pragmatists have no set opinion on the matter and rely on [[social science]] and ethics, instead.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

According to [[Richard Rorty]], relativism is relevant to pragmatism in three ways:
# Every belief is equally valid&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# There is no criteria for what a truth can be&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That any truth can be justified by the society it comes from&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
According to [[Gilbert White]], pragmatism has four main assumptions:
# That human existence is based on putting labor into the land&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That the idea of owning anything is a [[wikt:conception|conception]]&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That humans learn from their experiences&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That engagement of the publics is what allows for commitments&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Richard Rorty also associated three characteristics to pragmatism:
# That all theories characterize some form of truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That there is not difference between what can and should be done when it comes to the truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That knowledge is constrained by the conversations we have&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Being pragmatic is the more accepted school of thought for social construction being a relative concept.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

* '''1920s-1930s''': The belief that technology is destroying nature&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1950s-1960s''': The belief that humans risk being annihilated if they do not control technological impacts&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1960s-1970s''': The public awakening of human impacts on the environment with the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1980s''': The belief that no matter the costs, unrestricted growth is needed for progress&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1987''': The spreading of public awareness of impacts with the publication of the [[Brundtland Commission]] Report: ''[[Our Common Future]]''&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== How Nature becomes Socially Constructed ==
[[File:Vandana_shiva_20070610.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vandana_shiva_20070610.jpg|thumb|Vandana Shiva, author of ''Staying Alive: Women, Culture, and Development (1988)''.]]
Nature can be socially constructed by both culturally interpreting and physically shaping the environment.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Peterson, A. (1999). Environmental Ethics and the Social Construction of Nature. Retrieved from https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/54464729/Peterson.SocialConstructionNature.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1517194179&amp;Signature=VH%2F5cQL2wkJVCJqk1%2BJZTifMdIY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEnvironmental_Ethics_and_the_Social_Cons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen in three ways:
# Using non-human symbols to represent nature ([[Totem]]ism)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Using non-human animals to relate to nature ([[Animism]])&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Viewing nature as an '[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]' ([[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]]) &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
Constructions can also be categorized by giving them meaning through the process of [[embodied cognition|embodiment]],&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; which has three components:
# The '[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]' (the individual)&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The practice it originates from (the culture)&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# An associated [[Taxon|taxonomic group]] (i.e. [[homo sapiens]])&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
No matter how nature becomes socially constructed, though, the process itself is limited by three dimensions:
# The physical dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The mental dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The social dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
The physical dimension is limited to the human body, where the brain is responsible for creating and selecting thoughts.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The mental dimension is used to understand the physical dimension and is limited to human logic.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The social dimension needs moral and [[social order]] and is used to give meaning to both what is physically present and what is culturally constructed.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; All three dimensions must be present and linked to be able to socially construct nature.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

== Criticism on the Social Construction of Nature ==
The social construction of nature has room for improvement in four main areas:
# By giving more importance to how realities are culturally constructed through social interactions&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
# By acknowledging that all science should be analyzed by the same standard&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By gaining a better understanding of the role language plays in constructionism&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By giving more importance to how truths exist and how they are justified, using [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]]&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''Brescia University College''' is a [[Catholic higher education|Catholic]] [[Liberal arts college|liberal arts]] [[women's college]] located in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  Affiliated with the [[University of Western Ontario]], Brescia is the only [[university]]-level women's college in Canada. It has approximately 1,100 [[undergraduate]] students. According to the 2017 Ranking Web of Universities, Brescia was ranked 150 in a list of post-secondary institutions in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/North_america/Canada?page=1|title=Canada {{!}} Ranking Web of Universities|website=www.webometrics.info|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brescia is an officially Catholic institution,&lt;ref name="Leishman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory Leishman|title=Against Judicial Activism: The Decline of Freedom and Democracy in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aoPksJ0dj4C&amp;pg=PA60|year=2006|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6001-7|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; it accepts students of all faiths and backgrounds.

==History==
Brescia was founded in 1919 as '''Ursuline College''' by the [[Ursulines]], an organization of women of Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="Fay2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence J. Fay|title=History of Canadian Catholics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwNvfUGvRqsC&amp;pg=PA119|date=9 May 2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6988-1|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teresa Berger|title=Dissident Daughters: Feminist Liturgies in Global Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u37ZRKrTj3kC&amp;pg=PA106|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22379-3|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally located in an old converted house at 556 Wellington Street in downtown [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="LutmanGallery1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John H.

''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduates received University of Western Ontario degrees.&lt;ref name="BoutilierPrentice2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beverly Boutilier|author2=Alison Prentice|title=Creating Historical Memory: English-Canadian Women and the Work of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryT0gX7czfUC&amp;pg=PA307|date=1 November 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4164-1|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ursuline Sisters named the [[Roman Catholic]] college after the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Brescia]] where their [[religious institute]] was founded. The first class was of seven young women who each paid $50 for tuition.

The Ursuline Superior General, Mother Clare Gaukler, bought a piece of land at 1285 Western Road in London, and construction began on a permanent building in 1923.  The building was built by contractor Joseph Michael Piggot, opened for classes and residence in 1925, and was named Brescia Hall.  Brescia Hall was later renamed "Ursuline Hall".

Brescia was known as a liberal arts school and the courses taught were: English, French, Spanish, Philosophy, History, Classics, and Religious Knowledge. Brescia students took other courses such as Science, Mathematics, Political Economy at [[University of Western Ontario|Western]]. Over time, Brescia adapted some of the courses (e.g., Philosophy) to be appropriate for Catholic women. In 1936, a Home Economics program was begun, it evolved into what is known today as the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences.

Ursuline College was renamed "Brescia College" in 1963, and in 2001 renamed "Brescia University College".

In September 2007, Brescia started the first graduate program.  In 2017, the college began offering a degree in non-profit management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/new-degree-breaks-ground-for-non-profit-sector/article25402352/ "New degree breaks ground for non-profit sector"].

==Programs==

*Bachelor of Arts (English, French, Psychology, Sociology, Family Studies, Philosophy and Religious Studies, Community Development, Political Science, Human Ecology and Dimensions of Leadership)
*Bachelor of Management &amp; Organizational Studies
*Bachelor of Science (Foods &amp; Nutrition and Human Ecology)
*Master of Foods and Nutritional Sciences
*Certificate in Community Development
*Certificate in Religious Education

The Honours Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition at Brescia is accredited by [[Dietitians of Canada]], making graduates eligible to apply for dietetic internship placements.

Brescia offers a Master of Foods and Nutritional Sciences program, which is divided into two streams: The internship MSc stream, available to those who have graduated from a programme accredited by Dietitians of Canada, combines a master's degree with an internship and graduates can write the exam needed to become a registered dietitian.  The second stream is for people who are already a Registered Dietitian in Canada.

Brescia also offers a Preliminary Year, a co-educational one-year university preparatory program taught by university professors on the College campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/future/pre-university/index.html Preliminary Year] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515005324/http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/future/pre-university/index.html |date=May 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The College also offers an English as a Second Language programme called  CultureWorks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lfpress.com/2016/08/02/assyrian-brother-and-sister-fled-syria-and-got-scholarships-to-londons-western-university/wcm/2f1f8455-6330-1690-df73-10beb37986a0 "Assyrian brother and sister fled Syria and got scholarships to London's Western University"].

==Student life==
The Preliminary Year programme and the Masters of Science are co-education; all undergraduate programs are women-only. However, all courses are accessible to UWO students, male or female, including students from Western's two other affiliated university colleges.

==Buildings==
James Carlisle Pennington designed Brescia Hall (1924–25) for the Ursuline Sisters, near Western Road at Sarnia Road, on the campus of the University of Western Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1385 James Carlisle Pennington&lt;/ref&gt; The Mother St. James memorial building (completed in 1963) is the main building on campus; it houses classrooms, offices, student services, the business office, the Beryl Ivey Library and computer lab, the Mother St. James Memorial Auditorium, a coffee shop and the Circle Women's Centre resource centre. The Ursuline hall is the residence for 170 female students.  Ursuline Hall also has the cafeteria (Castle Café), some professors' offices, the food laboratories and a few classrooms. In September 2013, Brescia opened its new residence building and dining pavilion, Clare Hall, which houses just over 300 students and includes an eatery called the Mercato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/campus_life/residence/overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928112843/http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/campus_life/residence/overview.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut-Off grade is the minimum grade required in order for a [[mineral]] or [[metal]] to be economically [[Mining|mined]] (or processed). Material found to be above this grade is considered to be [[ore]], while material below this grade is considered to be waste.

The cut-off grade can be determined through a variety of methods, each of varying complexity. Cut-off grades are selected to achieve a certain objective, such as resource utilization or economic benefit. Dividing these objectives even further gives way to specific goals such as the maximization of total profits, immediate profits, and present value. It is important to recognize that the cut-off grade is not simply calculated to a definitive answer. It is in fact a strategic variable that has major implications on mine design. The cut-off grade is adapted as the economic environment changes with regard to [[metal prices]] and mining costs, and is therefore a constantly changing. Metal value is not the only factor affecting the profitability of a block. The presence of unwanted (often [[Hazardous waste|hazardous]]) material in a block may increase the processing cost. This should also be considered when classifying waste rock and ore.

{{Table Digital video broadcast standards}}

'''DVB-H''' ('''Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld''') is one of three prevalent [[mobile TV]] formats. It is a technical specification for bringing broadcast services to mobile handsets. DVB-H was formally adopted as [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]] standard EN 302 304 in November 2004. The DVB-H specification (EN 302 304) can be downloaded from the official DVB-H website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvb-h.org/ DVB-H : Global Mobile TV]&lt;/ref&gt; From March 2008, DVB-H is officially endorsed by the [[European Union]] as the "preferred technology for terrestrial mobile broadcasting".&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/451&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Rapid - Press Releases - EUROPA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/itemlongdetail.cfm?item_id=3535 Commission opens Single Market for Mobile TV - Europe's Information Society Newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/info_centre/communic_reports/mobile_tv/acte_en.pdf eCommunications: Site re-launch | Europa - Information Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/18/business/EU-FIN-EU-Mobile-Broadcasting.php EU endorses Nokia-backed DVB-H mobile broadcasting standard - International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; The major competitors of this technology are [[Qualcomm]]'s [[MediaFLO]] system, the [[3G]] cellular system based [[MBMS]] mobile-TV standard, and the [[ATSC-M/H]] format in the U.S. '''[[DVB-SH]]''' (Satellite to Handhelds) now and DVB-NGH (Next Generation Handheld) in the future are possible enhancements to DVB-H, providing improved [[spectral efficiency]] and better modulation flexibility. DVB-H has been a commercial failure, and the service is no longer on-air{{dubious|date=June 2014}}. [[Finland]] was the last country to switch-off its signals in March 2012.{{dubious|date=June 2014}}

==Technical explanation==
DVB-H technology is a superset of the successful [[DVB-T]] (Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial) system for digital terrestrial television, with additional features to meet the specific requirements of handheld, battery-powered receivers. In 2002 four main requirements of the DVB-H system were agreed: broadcast services for portable and mobile usage with 'acceptable quality'; a typical user environment, and so geographical coverage, as mobile radio; access to service while moving in a vehicle at high speed (as well as imperceptible handover when moving from one cell to another); and as much compatibility with existing digital terrestrial television (DVB-T), to allow sharing of network and transmission equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin, Gerard. Cell Phone Culture Mobile Technology in Everyday Life. New York: Routledge, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

DVB-H can offer a downstream channel at high data rates which can be used as standalone or as an enhancement of mobile telecommunication networks which many typical handheld terminals are able to access anyway.

[[Time slicing (digital broadcasting)|Time slicing]] technology is employed to reduce power consumption for small handheld terminals. IP datagrams are transmitted as data bursts in small time slots.  Each burst may contain up to two megabits of data (including parity bits). There are 64 parity bits for each 191 data bits, protected by [[Reed-Solomon error correction|Reed-Solomon codes]]. The front end of the receiver switches on only for the time interval when the data burst of a selected service is on air. Within this short period of time a high data rate is received which can be stored in a buffer. This buffer can either store the downloaded applications or playout live streams.

The achievable power saving depends on the relation of the on/off-time. If there are approximately ten or more bursted services in a DVB-H stream, the rate of the power saving for the front end could be up to 90%. DVB-H is a technical system which was carefully tested by the DVB-H Validation Task Force in the course of 2004 (see [[ETSI]] Technical Report TR 102 401). [[DVB-SH]] improved radio performances and can be seen as an evolution of DVB-H.

[[File:DVB-H-framestructure.svg|thumb|right|300px|DVB-H Frame structure]]
DVB-H is designed to work in the following bands:
*[[Very high frequency|VHF-III]] (170-230&amp;nbsp;MHz, or a portion of it)
*[[Ultra high frequency|UHF-IV/V]] (470-862&amp;nbsp;MHz, or a portion of it)
*[[L band|L]] (1.452-1.492&amp;nbsp;GHz)

DVB-SH now and DVB-NGH in the near future are expected to expand the supported bands.

DVB-H can coexist with DVB-T in the same [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]].

==DVB-IPDC==
'''DVB-IPDC''' (DVB for IP [[Datacasting]]) is the specification for broadcasting mobile TV services based on [[Internet Protocol]]. DVB-IPDC is a set of systems layer specifications originally designed for use with the DVB-H physical layer, but that will ultimately be used as a higher layer for all DVB mobile TV systems, including [[DVB-SH]], and indeed as a higher layer for any other IP capable system.

In short, with regard to mobile TV, these specifications define what is delivered, how it is delivered, how it is described, and how it is protected. They cover system architecture, use cases, DVB PSI/SI signalling, electronic service guide (ESG), content delivery protocols (CDP), and service purchase and protection (SPP). Almost all of these have now been published as formal ETSI standards.
The full set of DVB-IPDC specifications is available from [http://www.dvb-h.org/technology.htm dvb-h.org].

==DVB-NGH==
In 2007 a study mission was formed to investigate the options for a potential '''DVB-H2''' successor to DVB-H, but the project was later shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connectedtv.eu/ibc-dvb-t2-a-possible-home-for-the-dvbs-next-generation-handheld-standard-292/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409072519/http://www.connectedtv.eu/ibc-dvb-t2-a-possible-home-for-the-dvbs-next-generation-handheld-standard-292/ |archivedate=9 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In November 2009, the DVB group made a 'call for technologies' for a new system ('''DVB-NGH''' - Next Generation Handheld) to update and replace the DVB-H standard for digital broadcasting to mobile devices.&lt;ref name="dvbngh"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5rJxPjR7F?url=http://www.dvb.org/technology/dvb-ngh/index.xml http://www.dvb.org/technology/dvb-ngh/]&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule was for submissions to be closed in February 2010, the new ETSI standard published in 2013, and rollout of the first DVB-NGH devices from 2015.&lt;ref name="dvbngh"/&gt;

==DVB-SH==
{{main article|DVB-SH}}
The DVB-SH (Satellite services to Handheld) standard was published in February 2007. Trials are ongoing in several European countries.

==Service launches==
{{update|date=November 2010}}

In [[Finland]], the license to operate a DVB-H network was awarded to Digita, but the service was closed in March 2012. In May 2006 they announced that they had signed a contract with [[Nokia]] to use its DVB-H platform for the service. The network was supposed to be launched on 1 December 2006, but disagreements regarding copyrights of the broadcast material have stalled the launch. Among the services available will be [[Voice (tv)|Voice]] TV and [[Kiss (radio)|Kiss]] [[digital radio]]. Initially the network should cover 25% of the population with coverage area [[Helsinki]], [[Oulu]] and [[Turku]]. Mobiili-TV started commercial services on 10 May 2007. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The service was ended on 5.3.2012 due to lack of subscribers. Network operator Digita was granted to upgrade old DVB-H transmitters to next generation DVB-T2Lite technology which has ability to carry HD, SD and mobile-size picture for TV sets, laptops, pocket-PCs, mobile phones etc. simultaneously.

In [[India]], Indian public broadcaster [[Prasar Bharti]] (also known as DD for Doordarshan) started DVB-H trials in various metropolitan areas to test the reception quality of the broadcast coverage. Moreover, DD is currently broadcasting 8 channels in the [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://infotech.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2069424.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Doordarshan launches MobileTV- Indiatimes - Infotech | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525174338/http://infotech.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2069424.cms | archivedate=25 May 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]], [[Hutchison 3G|3 Italia]] and [[Reti Radiotelevisive Digitali]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tre.it/public/rassegna/Modulazione_ENG.pdf 3 Italia and RRD launch hierarchical modulation]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; launched nationwide services in May 2006 (technology used&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expway.com/telechargement/1221664059.pdf EXPWAY selected by 3 Italia to provide the world’s first mobile TV DVB-H Electronic Service Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710212612/http://www.expway.com/telechargement/1221664059.pdf |date=10 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), both [[Telecom Italia Mobile]] (TIM) and [[Mediaset]] in June 2006, [[Vodafone Italy|Vodafone]] in December 2006. DVB OSF was the adopted security standard in this country. Since June 2008, 3 Italia has made some channels free on Dvb-h for all the users.

In [[Singapore]], [[M1 Limited|M1]], [[StarHub]], [[Singtel]] and [[Mediacorp]] launches for Beijing Olympics a nationwide DVB-H pilot adopting OMA BCAST SmartCard profile.

In the [[Philippines]], [[Smart Communications|SMART]] had launched its Mobile TV services, called ''MyTV''. It is only available on the [[Nokia N92]] and N77 mobile phone due to incompatibility of the current system with other security technologies such as DVB OSF, the one supported by all other handset manufacturers. However, with transition to OMA SmartCard Profile, it is yet to be available on other mobile phones models. This transition is not foreseen by end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvb-h.org/Services/services-philippines-mytv.htm About SMART MyTV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011023014/http://www.dvb-h.org/Services/services-philippines-mytv.htm |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smart.com.ph/Gold/FAQs/myTV_FAQs.htm FAQs - myTV FAQs - Smart Gold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114000130/http://www.smart.com.ph/Gold/FAQs/myTV_FAQs.htm |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], [[Crown Castle]] had rolled out a DVB-H offering through a company they created called [[Modeo]] in 2006. It was initially offered in New York, but it was eventually terminated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/crown-castle-effectively-pulls-mobile-tv-plug/2007-07-24 terminate&lt;/ref&gt; Modeo was attempting to compete head-to-head with [[MediaFLO]]; which is both a Mobile TV company and Mobile TV Standard created by [[Qualcomm]].

At the [[NAB Show|NAB]] trade show in April 2006, a second service launch was announced by SES Americom, Aloha Partners and [[Reti Radiotelevisive Digitali]]. Titled [[Hiwire|Hiwire Mobile Television]], the service is set to begin trials in Las Vegas in Q4 2006. Hiwire owns two 6&amp;nbsp;MHz channels of spectrum at 700&amp;nbsp;MHz covering most of the country.

In [[Albania]], [[DigitAlb]] and GrassValley launched the service on December 20, 2006 with free access up to the end of 2008. The package consists of 16 channels and covers 65% of the territory as of August 2007.

In [[Vietnam]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC]] launched nationwide service on 21 December 2006. Similar issue to Smart in Philippines, the system was supporting only few Nokia handsets that limited the take-off of the service.

[[O2 Ireland|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Ireland]] commenced a trial in March 2007 with a single high site 1.2&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter at Three Rock covering the greater [[Dublin]] area.

In [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[South Africa]] nationwide service launch is planned for 2008 or 2009, However, the unavailability of the UHF frequencies keeps on delaying services launches.

In [[Austria]] DVB-H is available since the start of [[UEFA Euro 2008]] as result of a joint effort between Media Broad and the mobile operators [[Hutchison 3G|3]] and [[Orange Austria|Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;: ''[http://www.media-broadcast.com/en/company/press/dvb-h-austria.html DVB-H now available in all Austrian regional capitals]'', 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The service was switched off at the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;: ''[http://www.csimagazine.com/csi/Austria-to-switch-off-DVB-H.php Austria to switch off DVB-H ]'', 19 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morocco]], the service has been launched in May 2008.

In [[Switzerland]] DVB-H is available since the start of [[UEFA Euro 2008]] thanks to [[Swisscom]].

In [[Germany]] the future of DVB-H is still unknown due to continuous issues with the license and open questions about the business model, in particular which role operators play in it and if they are willing to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post: ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/31/AR2008073101709.html Operators Kill DVB-H In Germany]'', 31 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], two companies have been issued licenses by the government, [[Shanghai Media Group]] and [[China Central Television]]. Trials are currently underway, services were expected to be launched before the 2008 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]]. However, in this country, [[China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting]] (CMMB) is the standard the most deployed in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In [[Malaysia]], [[U Mobile]], the fourth telecom operator and the country's newest 3G service provider announced commercial availability of a mobile broadcast TV service based on DVB-H technology before the end of 2007. The service will be called ''Mobile LiveTV''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.u.com.my/sec_press/pdf/News%20-%20070618%20Nokia%20MiTV%20MobTV%20announcement-vers-June18-7pm.pdf Official Press Release Announcement by U Mobile]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenya]] has a DVB-H service, DStv Mobile, which was launched in Nairobi by South African company Digital Mobile TV. Consumers will receive a package of ten DStv channels through their mobile phones at a cost of Sh1,000 per month. The channels will include SuperSport Update, SuperSport 2, SuperSport 3, CNN International, Big Brother Africa and Africa Magic.

In [[Iran]], DVB-H services began in [[Tehran]] in March 2008. The service brings ten television and four radio channels to mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=47573&amp;sectionid=3510208 Press TV - Iran can watch TV on cell phones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326174241/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=47573&amp;sectionid=3510208 |date=26 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Estonia]], DVB-H service started testing phase in April 2008 with Levira and EMT, offering up to 15 TV-stations. Testing period ended in November 2009; the service never went into commercial use.

In [[South Africa]] Multichoice launched the public version of its DVB-H service, called [[DSTV]] Mobile on 1 December 2010. During September 2018, MultiChoice announced that its DStv Mobile service will end on 31 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/277329-dstv-ending-its-mobile-tv-service.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], [[KPN]] launched a DVB-H service on 29 May 2008. The service offers 10 channels, 1 channel specially made for the service and 9 channels which are converted regular broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpn.com/corporate/nl/pers/persber.htm?contentid=4409 KPN lanceert als eerste in Europa grootschalig netwerk voor mobiele TV - KPN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531170522/http://www.kpn.com/corporate/nl/pers/persber.htm?contentid=4409 |date=31 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 2011, KPN announced it was terminating the DVB-H service on 1 June 2011 because of a lack of new mobiles supporting the standard which resulted in fewer users. KPN still believes in mobile video, but in the form of video-on-demand using mobile internet connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpn.com/corporate/overkpn/Perscentrum/nieuwsbericht/KPN-stopt-met-MobielTV-via-DVBH.htm KPN stopt met MobielTV via DVB-H] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175729/http://www.kpn.com/corporate/overkpn/Perscentrum/nieuwsbericht/KPN-stopt-met-MobielTV-via-DVBH.htm |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jamaica]], DVB-H service was launched by telecoms provider LIME in 2010 in the capital city Kingston and its Metropolitan Area. Further upgrades were made and the service was made available in the second city, Montego Bay.

==Lack of acceptance==
At the [[NAB Show|NAB]] show in April 2012, Peter Siebert of Europe's DVB Project Office said DVB-H did not succeed because so few devices were available, mainly because content producers would not subsidize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483472-Mobilizing_for_Mobile_DTV.php |title=Mobilizing for Mobile DTV |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competing technologies - like [[MediaFLO]] in the US - did not have any success, new sales were terminated in December 2010 and the allocated spectrum sold to AT&amp;T.

These 1st generation transmissions protocols are not very spectrum efficient, but the fatal problem seems to be the lack of business model for mobile-TV. Very few have been willing to pay for the services. Even with a free mobile-tv signal, the daily use was often just a few minutes.

The Dutch KPN is an example. KPN quote lack of receiving devices, but even when KPN's service was initially free the average daily use was a mere 9 minutes per phone having a DVB-H receiver. (TV is typically watched 2–3 hours per day.)

Soon 4G/LTE  will be standard in all smartphones. 4G/LTE  is already being used in many countries and will very likely be able to provide the needed capacity for mobile-TV within most peoples download maximum (Max GigaBytes).

4G/LTE has the potential of efficient multicast, which can increase the spectrum efficiency in broadcast type application to within a factor of maybe two compared to the newest (e.g. DVB-T2/T2Lite) broadcast protocols.

The '''Damascus Pentateuch''' ({{lang-he| כֶּתֶר דַּמֶּשֶׂק}} '''''Keter Dameseq''''' or '''Crown of Damascus''') is a 10th century Hebrew Bible [[codex]] (Pentateuch),&lt;ref&gt;In the glosses of the very last page of Deuteronomy (458 in vol. 2), in the hand-writing of a second person (probably the owner of the codex), is appended a memorial of his wife’s passing in 4943 [[anno mundi]] (or what corresponds to 1183 CE).&lt;/ref&gt; containing the first Five Books of Moses. The codex was copied by an unknown scribe, replete with Masoretic annotations. The manuscript is defective in its beginning, as it starts with Genesis 9:26 (Exodus 18:1–23 is also missing). It was acquired by the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem National Library (Ms. Heb. 24°5702 ; Sassoon 507 (formerly). Microfilm no. F-8886&lt;/ref&gt; and published in a large, two-volume facsimile edition in 1978&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/view/1/1/ The Damascus Pentateuch] (ed. D.S. Loewinger), for the [[Jewish National and University Library]], Jerusalem, pub. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore 1978 (2 volumes)&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin).

==History==
The Damascus Pentateuch came to renown owing largely to the works of the bibliophile, [[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]], who bought the codex in Damascus in the early 20th century. It is one of the oldest extant Bible codices, ranking with that of the [[Aleppo Codex]] and [[Leningrad Codex]]. In many places, the Damascus Pentateuch follows the traditions of the masorete, [[Aaron ben Asher]], in ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'', as well as in most large and small letters, being harmonious with the Masoretic variants prescribed by Ben-Asher up to 52% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Masoretic tradition of Ben Asher, the copyist of the Damascus Pentateuch also writes '''פצוע דכא''' in Deut. 23:2 with an ''aleph'', and writes '''תעשה''' in Exo. 25:31 in ''defective scriptum'', without a ''yod'', as also the word '''האפד''' in Exo. 28:26 is written by him in ''defective scriptum'', without a ''waw''. Such practices are also common with Aaron Ben Asher.&lt;ref&gt;As shown by early witnesses who saw the Aleppo Codex and described its content, such as Menashe Sathon, whose notes on the Aleppo Codex were sent to Jerusalem and later reviewed by M.D. Cassuto, who relayed the same unto Rabbi Yaakov Sapir (19th century). Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (late 16th century) had also seen the Aleppo Codex. See: Joseph Offer, ''M.D. Cassuto's Notes on the Aleppo Codex'', Sefunot: Studies and Sources on the History of the Jewish Communities in the East (pub. by the [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]), Jerusalem 1989, p. 309 [33].&lt;/ref&gt;  It is written on parchment, in three columns to the page, in large oriental square script typical of writing scripts used in the 9th century. Like other codices of its era, it bears [[micrography]] known as the ''Masora Magna'' (large ''Masora''), that is, the preservation of the [[Minutiae|minutiæ]] of the text-tradition written as a gloss on the top and bottom of each page, as well as the ''Masora Parva'' (small ''Masora'') written in between the columns. According to Sassoon, the writer of the ''[[Masoretic Text|Masora]]'' (critical notes of the Masoretic annotations) was a follower of Ben Asher, yet the Bible text (orthography and vocalization) follows that of [[Ben Naphtali]] and his school.&lt;ref name=london1932&gt;''Ohel Dawid – Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London'', David Solomon Sassoon, vol. 1, London: Oxford University Press 1932, pp. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37055&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=81&amp;hilite= 22–23]&lt;/ref&gt; As to the age of the Codex, Sassoon has posited that “the manuscript is probably older than the British Museum MS., No. Oriental 4445, which is supposed to have been written about 820–850 CE., of Babylonian origin.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt; The text is furnished with [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] vowel points, accents, and the ''[[Rafe]]h'' strokes, e.g. the horizontal line written above the non-accentuated letters of '''בג"ד כפ"ת''', including the '''א''' in some cases, as on p.&amp;nbsp;54 in vol. 1 (on Genesis 32:28&lt;ref&gt;In the Hebrew Bible, it is Genesis 32:29&lt;/ref&gt;), ישר'''א'''ל. The smaller divisions for the weekly biblical lections, otherwise known as ''Sedarim'', are marked throughout the codex by the writer of the ''Masora'' by a large ''samekh'' ('''ס''') in the margin with the number of the ''Seder'' below.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt;

The style of lettering follows an archaic style; the leg of the Hebrew character ''qof'' ('''ק''') is joined to its roof, while the ''he'' ('''ה''') is made like the ''ḥet'' ('''ח'''), with hardly any distinction between the two letters. The ''lamed'' ('''ל''') is written exceptionally long, and hooked towards the outside. The final ''nun'' ('''ן''') is written almost the same as the letter ''zayn''.

All the ''qərē''&lt;ref&gt;That is, what is not written in the text, but must be read aloud in the text.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kətiv''&lt;ref&gt;That this, what is actually written in the text, but is not read in the text. Instead, the word is replaced by a different reading.&lt;/ref&gt; are marked by the writer of the text with a final ''nun'' in the margin without any further direction as to what the reading should be.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt;

A summary of the Damascus Pentateuch was made by [[Israel Yeivin]], in connection with the problems of the Aleppo Codex.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A study of its vocalization and accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, pp. 361-362 (Hebrew: כתר ארם צובה : ניקודו וטעמיו).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yeivin, the ''textus receptus'' of the Damascus Pentateuch is mostly harmonious with the Leningrad Codex. As for the variants in vocalization it follows that of Ben Asher up to 52% of the time, and that of Ben Naphtali up to 46% of the time, for which diversity it has been called by him "a mixed manuscript where one can find in it a few 'improvements,' but which differs in several aspects regarding its vocalization and trope symbols from the Aleppo Codex."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A study of its vocalization and accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, pp. 361-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[urban design]] and [[urban planning]], '''daylighting''' is the redirection of a [[stream]] into an above-ground channel. Typically, the rationale behind daylighting is to revert a stream of water to a more natural state, for the purposes of runoff reduction, habitat creation for species in need of it, or for  aesthetic purposes. Daylighting is intended to revitalize the [[riparian]] environment for a stream which had been previously diverted into a [[culvert]], pipe, or a [[drainage]] system. In the UK, the practice is also known as '''deculverting'''.&lt;ref&gt;

The term also refers to the public process toward such projects. According to the Planning and Development Department of the City of Berkeley, "A general consensus has developed that protecting and restoring natural creeks' functions is achievable over time in an urban environment while recognizing the importance of property rights."&lt;ref&gt;

===Natural drainage systems===
Natural drainage systems help [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|manage stormwater]] by [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating]] and slowing the flow of [[Storm water|stormwater]], filtering and [[bioremediation|bioremediating]] pollutants by soils and plants, reducing [[impervious surface]]s, using porous paving, increasing vegetation, and improving related pedestrian amenities. Natural features &amp;mdash; open, vegetated [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]]s, stormwater cascades, and small wetland ponds &amp;mdash; mimic the functions of nature lost to urbanization. At the heart are plants, trees, and the deep, healthy soils that support them. All three combine to form a "living [[infrastructure]]" that, unlike pipes and vaults, increase in functional value over time.

Some efforts to blend urban development with natural systems use innovative drainage design and landscaping instead of traditional curbs and gutters, pipes and vaults. One such [[Daylighting (streams)#Urban Seattle|demonstration project]] in the [[Pipers Creek (Seattle)|Pipers Creek]] watershed reduced imperviousness by more than 18 percent. The project built bioswales, landscape elements intended to remove silt and pollution from surface runoff water and planted 100 evergreen trees and 1,100 shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/mitigationbp/brief.do?mitssId=5246&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2003, the project reduced the volume of stormwater leaving the street in a 2-year storm event by 98%.&lt;!-- Consolidated 2 citations into 1 --&gt;&lt;ref name=NDS_SEA&gt;(1)

&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reduction can reduce storm damage to water quality and habitats for species such as the iconic salmon. Unfortunately, the engineering alternatives have a relatively expensive [[Total cost of ownership|initial price]], since they are usually replacing existing structures, albeit life-limited ones. Further, conventional systems generally do not consider [[full cost accounting]]. The NDS alternatives can also provide [[Rate of return|returns on investment]] by improving urban environments.

The Street Edge Alternatives Street breaks most of the conventions of 150 years of standard American street design. Narrow, curved streets, open drainage swales, and an abundance of diverse plants and trees welcome pedestrians as well as diverse species. Adjacent residents maintain city infrastructure in the form of street "gardens" in front of their homes, visually integrating the neighborhood along the street. The Natural Drainage System united the community visually, environmentally, and socially. The 110th Cascades SEA (2002–2003) are a creek-like cascade of stair-stepped natural, seasonal pools that intercept, infiltrate, slow and filter over {{convert|21|acre|m2}} of stormwater draining through the project.&lt;ref name="Streams in the Urban Landscape"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jone|first=Scott|title=Streams in the Urban Landscape|url=https://www.maida.com.au/plumbing/seattle-public-utilities/|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; With impervious surfaces having replaced most of the natural ground cover in urban environments, habitat for wildlife is dramatically reduced compared to historic baselines. Hydrologic changes have resulted, and impervious waterways directly carry non-point pollution through urban creeks. One effective solution is to restore streams and riparian habitat. This improves the entire urban watershed, far beyond the riparian channel itself.

====Vancouver, British Columbia====
[[File:Vancouver old streams.jpg|thumb|left|The historic stream network in Vancouver, B.C.]]
In the 1880s there were over 50 wild salmon streams in [[Vancouver]] alone.&lt;ref name="Lost Streams of Vancouver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Streams of Vancouver|url=http://vancouverstreetstories.com/lost-streams-of-vancouver/|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, as Vancouver grew, these streams were lost to urbanization.  They were covered by roads, homes, and businesses.  They were also lost when they were buried beneath sewers or culverts. &lt;br /&gt;
The City of Vancouver and its residents are now making an effort to uncover these lost streams and restore them back to their natural state.

=====Hastings Creek=====
[[File:Hastings Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Creek Restored at Creekway Park.  Vancouver, B.C.]] 

The Hastings Creek Stream Daylighting Project was originally proposed in 1994 as a way to manage storm water and for aesthetic purposes.  The idea was to bring the stream back to its once natural formation which would improve the surrounding habitat for wildlife as well as the originally proposed purposes.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Stream Daylighting Projects"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jone|first=Scott|title=Planning for Wildlife: Evaluating Creek Daylighting as a means of Urban Conservation|url=http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp05/MQ63529.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project's plan was finalized in 1997, and work began the same year.&lt;ref name="PNE Master Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hastings Park PNE Master Plan|url=http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/hastings-park-pne-master-plan.aspx|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stream had existed in [[Hastings Park]] until 1935 when the Park became focused on entertainment rather than its original purpose when it was given to the city in 1889, which was to be a retreat for those with a passion for the outdoors. As the [[Pacific Nation Exhibition|Pacific Nation Exhibition (PNE)]] grounds continued to expand there was a continued loss of natural woodlands, greenery and waterways.  It was not until the 1980s when the surrounding community began to look at continuing to uphold its original purpose.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Stream Daylighting Projects"/&gt;

The daylighting project made major progress in 2013 in the area located in the Creekway Park, which was originally a parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=parking lot transformed into lush new urban park and restored creek|url=http://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/parking-lot-transformed-into-lush-new-urban-park-and-restored-creek.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The daylighted stream will one day connect the Sanctuary in [[Hastings Park]] to the [[Burrard Inlet]].  The progress made in Creekway Park is a major step towards this goal. This daylighting project also improved pedestrian and bikeway transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Hastings Park and the PNE|url=http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/hastings-park-pne-master-plan.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stream is now able to obtain the stormwater from the surrounding area, which reduces the load that is felt by the municipality's storm sewers. It is the storms in early autumn which provide the water flow for the creek, meaning that there is variable flow throughout the year.  During the late summer months the moist soil is relied upon to maintain the vegetation of the area.  This variation in flow does not allow for [[salmon]] migration through the creek; however it does house [[trout]] as well as vegetation which aid in the filtration of the storm water entering the creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=open house board on pne june 16|url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/open-house-board-pne-june-16-ecology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Spanish Banks=====
[[File:Restored Stream Spanish Banks.jpeg|thumb|right|Daylighted Stream at Spanish Banks, Vancouver, B.C.]]
Located upstream from [[Spanish Banks]] waterfront, one of the highest profile creeks in Vancouver Metro became open to salmon in 2000. In a collaborative project between Spanish Banks Streamkeepers Association and the Department of [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]], barriers to fish passage were removed and habitat structure was added. [[Bodies of water in Vancouver#Spanish Banks Creek|Spanish Banks Creek]] was previously diverted through a culvert underneath a parking lot, but the lower reaches of this creek have been revitalized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbanstreams.org/spanishbankscreek/&lt;/ref&gt; The banks were stabilized with [[riprap]], large woody debris was added for habitat cover, and spawning gravels were added in appropriate areas. Rigorous effectiveness monitoring has not been performed, but a few dozen [[coho salmon|coho]] and [[chum salmon|chum]] salmon are known to spawn there annually in a sustaining population.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/the-stream-that-spawned-a-comeback/article4182186/&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance to the creek is provided by Spanish Banks Streamkeepers Association, a local volunteer stewardship group.

=====St. George Rainway=====

The [[East Vancouver]] neighborhood of [[Mount Pleasant, Vancouver|Mount Pleasant]] has officially incorporated into its community plan a project to restore St. George Creek, a tributary to the False Creek watershed. St. George street is the site of this former stream, which now flows through the sewers and a culvert. This paved street will be converted into a shared-use  path, [[riparian]] habitat, and [[Urban open space|urban greenspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. George Rainway Street |url=http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142645/http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. George Creek once spawned [[salmon]] and [[trout]], and hosted a diverse [[riparian]] ecosystem. The restoration of this habitat using the rainway proposal would allow for salmon spawning, recreational and educational opportunities, and improve the community's access to nature and transportation alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://mtpleasantwatershed.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal would pass the following community centres: [[Great Northern Way Campus]], St. Francis Xavier School, Mt. Pleasant Elementary, Florence N. Elementary, Kivan Boys and Girls Club, Robson Park Family Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falsecreekwatershed.org/uploads/2/0/5/0/20500086/st_george.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed landscape designs have been produced, and incorporated into the community plan of Mount Pleasant neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142645/http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project leaders from the [[False Creek]] watershed Society and Vancouver Society of Storytelling have collaborated with Mount Pleasant Elementary students to create a street mural drawing attention to the belowground stream.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vancourier.com/news/east-side-group-aims-to-recreate-lost-stream-with-rainwater-runoff-1.681412&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the mural is the only physical progress on the project.

=====Tatlow Creek=====
This is a future project aiming to ultimately connect the gap in the Seaside Greenway in order to link it to the [[Burrard Bridge]]. The beginning of this project has been started by the [https://vancouver.ca/  City of Vancouver] in 2013, after its approval on July 29 of the same year. Volunteer Park is located in [[Kitsilano]] at the corner of Point Grey Road and Macdonald Street.  This is where the main daylighting project for this area is planned to occur.&lt;ref name="City of Vancouver Park Board Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Vancouver Park Board Report|url=http://cityhallwatch.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/park-board-report_seasidegreenwayimprovements-07-10-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phase one'' is currently in progress.  Point Grey Road is currently closed to through motor traffic in order to turn the street into a greenway for cycling and walking.  This part of the project is expected to be complete by summer 2014.&lt;ref name="City of Vancouver Park Board Report" /&gt;

''Phase two'' of this project is looking to include the daylighting of Tatlow Creek which is located in Volunteer Park.  This phase must go through the City Council and the Park Board capital planning process for the 2015-2017 Capital Plan before any plans can be finalized.&lt;ref name="City of Vancouver Park Board Report" /&gt;

Tatlow Creek had been scheduled to be daylighted in 1996, and the project to start in 1997.  The project was deemed feasible and the storm water was to be diverted back into the natural creek bed and tunneled under Point Grey Road.  When it was not done, the project was proposed again by a [[University of British Columbia|UBC]] masters' student as the Tatlow Creek Revitalization Project.  If this project is completed as phase 2 of the new Park Board Project it would allow for [[salmon]] and [[trout]] spawning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=circle UBC|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/14448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pipers Creek=====
'''[[Pipers Creek (Seattle)|Pipers Creek]]''' in the central to north [[Greenwood, Seattle, Washington|Greenwood]] area is joined by [[Venema Creek|Venema]] and [[Mohlendorph Creek]]s in [[Carkeek Park]] on Puget Sound. Pipers is one of the four largest streams in urban Seattle, together with Longfellow, Taylor, and Thornton creeks.  Pipers Creek drains a {{convert|1835|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} watershed into Puget Sound, from a residential upper plateau that is most of the watershed, through the steep ravines of the {{convert|216|acre|km2|1}} of Carkeek Park. The headwaters begin in the north Greenwood neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the park, the creek can be seen at N 90th Street between Greenwood and Palatine avenues N.

Years of hard work by neighbors and volunteers have brought salmon back to Pipers Creek, Venema, and Mohlendorph creeks in the mid-2000s after there were none for 50 years. The latter is named for the late Ted Mohlendorph, a biologist who spearheaded efforts to restore the watershed as salmon habitat.

Though still plagued by problems endemic to urban streams, Piper's Creek today is a scintillating example of the possible. Though augmented by hatchery fish, anywhere from 200 to 600 [[chum salmon]] return each November, along with a few [[Coho salmon|coho]] in the fall and fewer occasional winter [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]]. Inspirationally, several hundred small resident [[coastal cutthroat trout]] live in the watershed, believed to be native fish that survived decades of urban assault. An environmental learning center and programs are part of comprehensive restoration. More than four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of trail are maintained by neighborhood volunteers who put in 4,000 hours of work in 2003, for example. The creek waters are pretty in their impressively restored settings, but the watershed is the surrounding neighborhoods and streets, laced with petrochemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, wandering pets, and such. Along with steeply high volume during storm runoff and resulting turbidity, water quality is the remaining big issue in restoring salmon.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;

The north fork of Pipers Creek is the site for the 110th Cascades, an S.E.A. (Street Edge Alternatives) street demonstration project (see [[Daylighting (streams)#Natural Drainage Systems and Street Edge Alternatives|above]]). The 110th Cascades are a creek-like cascade of stair-stepped natural, seasonal pools that intercept, infiltrate, slow and filter over {{convert|21|acre|m2}} of stormwater draining through the project. The cascades are a part of an NDS (Natural Drainage Systems) project; together these united the community visually, environmentally, and socially, toward integrating the neighborhood as a community.&lt;ref name=NDS_SEA /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDS_110&gt;(1)

=====Taylor Creek=====
* '''[[Taylor Creek (Seattle)|Taylor Creek]]''' flows from Deadhorse Canyon (west of Rainier Avenue S at 68th Avenue S and northwest of Skyway Park), through [[Lakeridge Park]] to Lake Washington. With volunteer effort and some city matching grants, restoration has been underway since 1971. Volunteers have planted thousands of indigenous trees and plants, removed tons of garbage, removed invasive plants, and had city help removing fish-blocking culverts and improving trails. A deer has been spotted and sightings of raccoons, opossum and birds are common. By about 2050, the area will be looking like a young version of what it looked like before being disrupted. Taylor is one of the four largest streams in urban Seattle.&lt;ref name=Dietrich&gt;Dietrich&lt;/ref&gt;

Coho salmon and cutthroat trout returned as soon as barriers were removed, after concerted effort and pressure by citizen groups of activist neighbors (1989–1998).

&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent efforts began (1995) with informal removal of ivy smothering trees, then invasive species like holly, laurel and blackberries, and realization that effective restoration would require comprehensive stewardship.

:With a "Small and Simple" Department of Neighborhoods grant, the neighborhood started a formal effort. Neighborhood groups, planning with naturalists and landscape architects brought an effective early step rebuilding trails, promoting access and building constituency. Further priorities were protection for habitat, restoration of stream beds, rehabilitation as a natural area using native plants, and using the Madrona Woods as a setting for environmental education programs at local schools. A hired landscape architect became a team member, experimental plots were set up to test different methods for revegetating with native plants. (Plants adapt to microclimates; experimentation is required to jumpstart the otherwise very long natural processes.)

:Friends of Madrona Woods earned a much larger Department of Neighborhoods matching grant in 2000, funding the creation of a Master Action Plan, and major trail restoration work. The community match for the grant was nearly 2500 hours of volunteer labor by community members and school children from St. Therese and Epiphany schools. After many decades of urban use without formal maintenance, substantial trail engineering was required. EarthCorps was contracted to do the actual construction, which included 86 steps, two landings and a bridge.

:EarthCorps is a local program to foster environmental responsibility and global cooperation among young people around the world. Two thirds the Corps members come from King County and the U.S., one third are recruited from partner organizations around the world. They combine the best elements of the 1930s [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] with those of the [[Peace Corps]]. Participants learn resource management skills by completing restoration projects throughout King County. This work has included restoring stream banks and salmon habitat, reclaiming logging roads, and building trails. They completed 30,000 hours of work in 1999 alone.

:In the process of clearing, volunteers found substantial erosion in the wetland hillside, leading to a grant from a Parks Department fund to stabilize it with a water cascade of natural materials. Neighbors did a little trail-building of their own with Volunteers for Outdoor Washington and an all-day trail building workshop (February 2000). Local school children learn about restoration by working with Madrona Woods volunteers throughout the year. Work parties continue monthly through much of the year.&lt;!-- Consolidated 2 into 1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) Scott &lt;br /&gt;(2)

====Porter Brook, Sheffield, Yorkshire====
The '''[[Porter Brook]]''' flows from the west of [[Sheffield]] on the edge of the [[Peak District]] and flows into the [[River Sheaf]] at ''Sheaf Street'' near [[Sheffield station|Sheffield Railway Station]]. The Porter Brook is one of Sheffield's five well known rivers, along with the [[River Don, Yorkshire|Don]], [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]], [[River Loxley|Loxley]] and [[River Rivelin|Rivelin]]. The Porter has been deculverted at ''Matilda Street'' near the BBC Radio Sheffield studios. A feasibility study for the scheme was undertaken for South Yorkshire Forest Partnership by Sheffield City Council in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deculverting.com/2016/04/29/deculverting-sheffields-porter-brook-city-centre/ |title=Deculverting Sheffield’s Porter Brook – City Centre (Article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the Environment Agency and the EU via the Interreg North Sea Region Programme. The project was completed by Sheffield City Council with funding from the Environment Agency in 2016. Before and after pictures, taken from 2011 through to 2016, at [https://deculverting.com/ www.deculverting.com] show the scheme at the same location prior to commencement, during construction and completion. The site has been maintained since 2016 with the help of the Wild Trout Trust.

The Porter Brook daylighting scheme featured in a 2016 BBC Radio 4 documentary entitled A River of Steel, produced by sound recordist Chris Watson, ex-member of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Caberet Voltaire]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07qbcbv |title=A River of Steel (Radio Programme)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was also discussed in an article in The Guardian in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/29/river-runs-global-movement-daylight-urban-rivers |title=A river runs through it (Article)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====River Roch, Rochdale, Greater Manchester====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[River Roch]] that runs through the town of [[Rochdale]] has recently been uncovered, revealing the medieval bridge in place. It was covered in 1904 to accommodate a tram network that has since closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-36520198|title=Hidden medieval bridge reopens|date=2016-06-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other countries ==
In [[Seoul]], which buried the [[Cheonggyecheon]] creek during the city's 1960s boom, an artificial waterway and adjoining parks have been built atop it. Mayor [[Lee Myung Bak]], formerly a construction magnate with the [[Hyundai]] [[chaebol]] that helped bury the river, ran for office promising to daylight it, and achieved in 2005 a {{convert|5.8|km|mi}} [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] in a city without very many parks or playgrounds.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The new park is hugely popular, alleviating fears that opening the river would cause nearby businesses to lose customers.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk (13 October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Ecologically sustainable development''' is the environmental component of [[sustainable development]]. It can be achieved partially through the use of the [[precautionary principle]]; if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent [[environmental degradation]].
Also important is the principle of [[intergenerational equity]]; the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. In order for this movement to flourish, environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity.

==Political considerations==
Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development. The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to [[Sustainable development#Politics|sustainable development]]. Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements, work attitudes, [[Morality|social morality]]—particularly interpersonal responsibilities, hierarchy of authority, quality of scientific education and implementation, and degree of domestic stability—especially, freedom from [[social conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel.

ISSN (Online) 1940-0004, ISSN (Print) 2194-6566, DOI: 10.1515/ngs-2013-021, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; National policy and development planning requires three conditions to permit ecological [[sustainability]]: action-oriented values to which individuals are committed, political authorities that favour long-term ecological benefits over immediate economic gains, and a policy with a politically competent [[constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Lynton K.|title=Political Aspects of Ecologically Sustainable Development|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1984|volume=11|issue=04|pages=299–308|doi=10.1017/S037689290001465X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S037689290001465X|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has taken an evidence based approach to sustainability development by using Environmental [[Sustainability measurement|Sustainability Indicators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=47F48106-1 |title=Environmental Sustainability Indicators |author=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guiding tool for policy development. At the municipal level, many cities also use evidence based indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ca/community/3568.aspx |title=Sustainability Charter|author=City of Surrey|accessdate=7 May 2016}}

==Forums for ecologically sustainable development==
The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980, becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goal-oriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert P.|title=How to Save the World: Strategy for World Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1980|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-389-20011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global [[conservation movement]]. The traditional focus became cure rather than [[Prevention Science|Prevention]], confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society. Specifically, the concentration on [[wildlife conservation]] drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The Origins of the World Conservation Strategy|journal=Environmental Review|year=1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=177–187|jstor=3984544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by [[economic development]] decisions with a format that targets a wide audience. There are three chief conservation objectives:
#Maintaining essential [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and life-support systems
#Preserving [[genetic diversity]]
#Establishing a sustainable use of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|title=Ecologically Sustainable Development: Integrating Economics, Ecology, and Law|journal=Willamette Law Review|year=1995|volume=31|issue=2|pages=261–306|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=31+Willamette+L.+Rev.+261&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=118207f62b4908b2ee0eb7a21f829a93|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities. Nicholas Polunin, former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation, believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an [[UNESCO]] conference in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polunin|first=Nicholas|title=Our Global Environment and the World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1982|volume=9|issue=02|pages=115|doi=10.1017/S0376892900020002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid [[population growth]], proliferation of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and depletion of [[natural resource]]s. Similarly, the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000 Report to the President]], presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies, institutions, and rates of technologic advancement do not change. Findings of this type prompted [[environmentalist]]s and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions:
:*Publication and broadcast of [[environmental issue]]s
:*Use of traditional [[Media (communication)|communication mediums]] such as posters and automobile stickers
:*Distribution of increasing basic and applied environmental research results
:*Information about [[family planning]] and the necessity to control population growth
:*Designating more area as [[national park]]s or [[wilderness area]]s, including the ocean
:*Organization of local, state, national, and international conferences to discuss environmental issues
:*Encouraging sustainable uses of our natural resources
:*Establishment of [[common law]]s for the Earth and mankind
:*Obtaining support form [[nongovernmental organization]]s and [[institution]]s for the World Campaign
:*Attaining recognition such as "Guardians of the Biosphere Awards," for persons and/or groups that demonstrate actions to preserve the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=The World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=46|issue=5|pages=269–271|doi=10.2307/4447840|jstor=4447840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">'''Ethanol precipitation''' is a method used to purify and/or concentrate [[RNA]], [[DNA]], and [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[pectin]] and [[xyloglucan]] from [[aqueous solutions]] by adding [[ethanol]] as an antisolvent.

== DNA precipitation ==
=== Theory ===
[[Image:Na+H2O.svg|thumb|right|The first [[solvation shell|hydration shell]] of a sodium ion dissolved in water]]
DNA is [[chemical polarity|polar]] due to its highly charged [[phosphate]] backbone. Its polarity makes it water-soluble (water is polar) according to the principle [[Solubility#Polarity|"like dissolves like"]].

Because of the high polarity of water, illustrated by its high [[dielectric constant]] of 80.1 (at 20 °C), electrostatic forces between [[Electric charge|charged particles]] are considerably lower in aqueous solution than they are in a [[vacuum]] or in air.

This relation is reflected in [[Coulomb's law]], which can be used to calculate the force acting on two charges &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by using the dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; (also called relative static permittivity) of the medium in the denominator of the equation (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is an [[electric constant]]):

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

At an atomic level, the reduction in the force acting on a charge results from water molecules forming a [[Solvation shell|hydration shell]] around it. This fact makes water a very good solvent for charged compounds like salts. Electric force which normally holds salt [[crystal]]s together by way of [[ionic bonds]] is weakened in the presence of water allowing ions to separate from the crystal and spread through solution.

The same mechanism operates in the case of negatively charged phosphate groups on a DNA backbone: even though positive ions are present in solution, the relatively weak net electrostatic force prevents them from forming stable ionic bonds with phosphates and [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] out of solution.

[[Ethanol]] is much less polar than water, with a dielectric constant of 24.3 (at 25 °C). This means that adding ethanol to solution disrupts the screening of charges by water. If enough ethanol is added, the electrical attraction between phosphate groups and any positive ions present in solution becomes strong enough to form stable [[ionic bonds]] and DNA precipitation. This usually happens when ethanol composes over 64% of the solution. As the mechanism suggests, the solution has to contain positive ions for precipitation to occur; usually Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plays this role

=== Practice ===
[[Image:Tabletop centrifuge.jpg|thumb|150px|A laboratory tabletop centrifuge]]
DNA is precipitated by first ensuring that the correct concentration of positive ions is present in solution (too much will result in a lot of salt co-precipitating with DNA, too little will result in incomplete DNA recovery) and then adding two to three volumes of at least 95% ethanol. Many protocols advise storing DNA at low temperature at this point, but there are also observation that it may not improve DNA recovery, and may even lower precipitation efficiency while using over-night incubation time.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeugin JA, Hartley JL |title=Ethanol Precipitation of DNA |journal=Focus |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=1–2 |year=1985 |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/focus.Par.56415.File.dat/Focus%20Volume%207%20Issue%204.PDF |accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crouse J, Amorese D |title=Ethanol Precipitation: Ammonium Acetate as an Alternative to Sodium Acetate |journal=Focus |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=3–5 |year=1987 |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/focus.Par.34900.File.dat/Focus%20Voume%209%20Issue%202.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122123626/http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/focus.Par.34900.File.dat/Focus%20Voume%209%20Issue%202.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, good efficiency can be achieved at room temperature, but when possible degradation is taken into account, it is probably better to incubate DNA on wet ice. Optimal incubation time depends on the length and concentration of DNA. Smaller fragments and lower concentrations will require longer times to achieve acceptable recovery. For very small lengths and low concentrations over-night incubation is recommended. In such cases use of carriers like [[tRNA]], [[glycogen]] or linear [[polyacrylamide]] can greatly improve recovery.

During incubation DNA and some salts will precipitate from solution, in the next step this precipitate is collected by [[laboratory centrifuge|centrifugation]] in a microcentrifuge tube at high speeds (~12,000[[standard gravity|g]]). Time and speed of centrifugation has the biggest effect on DNA recovery rates. Again smaller fragments and higher dilutions require longer and faster centrifugation. Centrifugation can be done either at room temperature or in 4 °C or 0 °C.
During centrifugation precipitated DNA has to move through ethanol solution to the bottom of the tube, lower temperatures increase [[viscosity]] of the solution and larger volumes make the distance longer, so both those factors lower efficiency of this process requiring longer centrifugation for the same effect.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;
After centrifugation the supernatant solution is removed, leaving a ''pellet'' of crude DNA. Whether the pellet is visible depends on the amount of DNA and on its purity (dirtier pellets are easier to see) or the use of co-precipitants.

In the next step, 70% ethanol is added to the pellet, and it is gently mixed to break the pellet loose and wash it. This removes some of the salts present in the leftover supernatant and bound to DNA pellet making the final DNA cleaner. This suspension is centrifuged again to once again pellet DNA and the supernatant solution is removed. This step is repeated once.

Finally, the pellet is air-dried and the DNA is resuspended in water or other desired [[buffer solution|buffer]]. It is important not to over-dry the pellet as it may lead to [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of DNA and make it harder to resuspend.

[[Isopropanol]] can also be used instead of ethanol; the precipitation efficiency of the isopropanol is higher making one volume enough for precipitation. However, isopropanol is less volatile than ethanol and needs more time to air-dry in the final step. The pellet might also adhere less tightly to the tube when using isopropanol.&lt;ref name="a0" /&gt;

The '''fantasy defense''' is where a defendant accused of attempting a crime (enticing [[Minor (law)|minors]] into sexual activity, for example) claims that they never intended to complete the crime.

{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}'''Feminist anthropology''' is a four-field approach to [[anthropology]] ([[Archaeology|archeological]], [[Biological anthropology|biological]], [[Cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brodkin |first1=Karen |first2=Sandra |last2=Morgen |first3=Janis |last3=Hutchinson |title=Anthropology as White Public Space |journal=American Anthropologist |year=2011 |volume=113 |issue=4 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Hortense Powdermaker]]), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the [[American Anthropological Association]] –&amp;nbsp;the [http://afa.americananthro.org/ Association for Feminist Anthropology]&amp;nbsp;– and its own publication, ''Voices''.

== History ==
Feminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.&lt;ref name="LewinIntro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Ellen | title = Feminist anthropology: a reader | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden | isbn = 1405101962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parezo | first = Nancy | title = Hidden scholars: women anthropologists and the Native American Southwest | year = 1993 | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | location = Albuquerque| isbn = 0826314287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erminnie A. Smith|Erminnie Platt Smith]], [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]], [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], [[Frances Densmore]]—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=WomenAnthros&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gacs | first1 = Ute D. | last2 = Kahn | first2 = Aisha| last3 = McIntyre | first3 = Jerrie | last4 = Weinberg | first4 = Ruth | title = Women anthropologists: selected biographies | year = 1989 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Champagne|isbn=0252060849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography "The House of Lim" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork.&lt;ref name=WolfInterview&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rofel | first = Lisa | title = The outsider within: Margery Wolf and feminist anthropology | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 596–604 | publisher = [[American Anthropological Association]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | date = September 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While anthropologists like [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]] are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. [[Hortense Powdermaker]], for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, [[Zora Neale Hurston]], a student of [[Franz Boas]], the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo- scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely [[Katherine Dunham]] and [[Pearl Primus]], both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist [[Mary Leakey]].

The anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's "Women in the Field" and [[Michelle Rosaldo]] and [[Louise Lamphere]]'s edited volume ''[[Woman, Culture, and Society]]'', attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women.&lt;ref name=Golde&gt;{{cite book|last=Golde|first=Peggy|title=Women in the field: anthropological experiences|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0520054229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men becomes universal.{{Dubious|date=February 2017}} A second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with  [[Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels']] [[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]], arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism.&lt;ref name=Leacock&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | title = Interpreting the origins of gender inequality: Conceptual and historical problems | journal = [[Dialectical Anthropology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00249543 | date = February 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00249543 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schuller | first = Mark | title = Participation, more than add women and stir?

In the wake of [[Gayle Rubin]] and her critique of "the sex/gender system," the anthropology of women transformed into an anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident.&lt;ref name=Lugones&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lugones | first1 = María C. | last2 = Spelman | first2 = Elizabeth V. | title = Have we got a theory for you! Feminist theory, cultural imperialism and the demand for ‘the woman's voice’ | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages =573–581 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | date = 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists [[Henrietta Moore]] and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to "[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male oriented discipline".&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Henrietta L. | title = Feminism and anthropology | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | location = Hoboken | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780745667997 | oclc = 18259349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the "study of man" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience.

Today, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces.&lt;ref name=FemEthnog&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Visweswaran | first = Kamala | title = Histories of feminist ethnography | journal = [[Annual Review of Anthropology]] | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 591–621 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | date = October 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies.

==Feminist Archaeology==

[[Feminist archaeology]] initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as [[Archaeological theory#Post-processual archaeology|symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies]]. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline)&lt;ref&gt;^ Hays-Gilpin, 2000:92. Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 571:89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.&lt;ref&gt;^ Gero, 1985:342. Sociopolitics and the Woman-at-Home Ideology. American Antiquity 50:342-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during "field work" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2013/04/13/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that s not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|first=Kate|last=Clancy|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/04/26/a-can-of-worms-worth-opening/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist Cultural Anthropology ==
Feminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of [[feminism]] through the lens of [[cultural anthropology]].  When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way.  New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions.  This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Feminist Anthropology: Past, Present, and Future|url=|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=44|issue=6|pages=99–101|doi=10.5860/CHOICE.44-3361|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike.  With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender at the Crossroads of Knowledge : Feminist Anthropology in the Postmodern Era|last=Di Leonardo|first=Micaela|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. 

When feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women.  However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writing Culture|last=Behar|first=Ruth|last2=Gordon|first2=Deborah A|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Relationship with Feminism==
The relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the [[Sexism|oppression of women]] is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of "woman" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist [[Michelle Rosaldo]] wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rosaldo, M.Z. |date=1980 |title=The Use and Abuse of Anthropology: Reflections on Feminism and Cross-Cultural Understanding |journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=389–417 |issn=0097-9740 |doi=10.1086/493727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary feminist anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]] argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt;

Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been [[marginalized]] and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticised - local people are seen as the producers of [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the [[Feminism in Latin America|grassroots feminism of Latin America]]), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"/&gt; Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking ''about'' and not ''for'' women, could overcome this bias.

Marilyn Strathern characterised the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self-sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relation with the world.".&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt; Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricism]] of feminism.

==The 'double difference'==
Feminist anthropology, [[Rayna Rapp]] argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]]ism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non-Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized.

Moore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.

'''Five Towns College''' is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit]] college in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==History==
Five Towns College was founded as a [[business school]] in 1972 by Lorraine Kleinman Cohen and Stanley G. Cohen, Ed.D. Programs at the college have expanded to cover popular music, theatre, film, and communications.

The original proposed site for this college was to be in [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]] in southwestern [[Nassau County, New York]], an area known as "The [[Five Towns]]", but the college was actually sited in [[Merrick, New York]]. Five Towns College moved to [[Seaford, New York]] in 1982 and to its current location in Dix Hills in [[Suffolk County, New York]] in 1992.

Although the college is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit college]], its board of trustees and its founding president Stanley Cohen have argued that the college would be "better positioned to build an endowment if it were a nonprofit." Cohen, however, was removed from office in 2014 and shareholders have filed suit against the plan to make the college non-profit.&lt;ref name=Newsday_2014_05_23&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/stanley-cohen-five-towns-college-founder-ousted-by-trustees-1.8167224 |title=Five Towns College founder removed by trustees |author= |publisher=[[Newsday]] |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College is the licensee of [[WFTU (AM)|WFTU]], 1570&amp;nbsp;kHz, in [[Riverhead, New York]] a full-time AM broadcast station, which returned to the air in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=18238 |title=Station Search Details |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flagellation'''  (Latin ''flagellum'', "whip"), '''flogging''', '''whipping''' or '''lashing''' is the act of beating the human body with special implements such as [[whip]]s, [[wikt:lash|lash]]es, [[Birching|rod]]s, [[Switch (rod)|switches]], the [[cat o' nine tails]], the [[sjambok]], the [[knout]], etc. Typically, flogging is imposed on an unwilling subject as a punishment; however, it can also be submitted to willingly, or performed on oneself, in religious or [[impact play|sadomasochistic contexts]].

The strokes are usually aimed at the unclothed back of a person, in certain settings it can be extended to other corporeal areas. For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).

In some circumstances the word "flogging" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between "flogging" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and "whipping" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.

==Current use as punishment==
{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}
Officially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.

Flogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including fornication, alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, lashes for punishment for women are often performed with the Qu'ran under one arm to minimise the swing and as a reminder of the source of legislation. They are not supposed to leave permanent scars, and when the number of lashes is high, are frequently done in batches to minimise risk of harm.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Judaism===
{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}

According to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.

===Antiquity===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.

In the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Whips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.

The Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&amp;mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as "half death" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}"'' ("taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead").

===From Middle Ages to modern times===
[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]
The Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area "and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody".&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590–591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged "at a cart's tail" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, "until his [or her] back be bloody". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198&lt;/ref&gt; She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.

In the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Tim (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EJCOl7S0UYgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Imperial Russia, 1801-1905]''. Routledge. p.83. {{ISBN|0-415-23110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use against slaves===
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|200px|An African-American slave named [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], photo taken at Baton Rouge, 1863. The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]

Whipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave "patrollers," mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].

===Flogging as military punishment===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.

====United States====
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, officers were not flogged. However, in 1745, a [[cashiering|cashiered]] British officer's sword could be broken over his head, among other indignities inflicted on him.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasson, p 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of [[New Hampshire]] Senator [[John P. Hale]], the [[United States]] Congress banned flogging on all U.S. ships on 28 September 1850, as part of a then-controversial amendment to a naval appropriations bill.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;Hodak, George. [http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/congress_bans_maritime_flogging/ "Congress Bans Maritime Flogging"]. ''ABA Journal''. September 1850, p. 72. Retrieved 18 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legisworks.org/congress/31/session-1/chap-80.pdf 31st Congress, Session 1, Chapter 80 (1850), p515.] Quote: ''"''Provided'', That flogging in the navy, and on board vessels of commerce, be, and the same is hereby, abolished from and after the passage of this act."''&lt;/ref&gt; Hale was inspired by [[Herman Melville]]'s "vivid description of flogging, a brutal staple of 19th century naval discipline" in Melville's "novelized memoir" ''[[White Jacket]]''.&lt;ref name=Congress /&gt; Melville also included a vivid depiction of flogging, and the circumstances surrounding it, in his more famous work, ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.

Military flogging was abolished in the United States Army on 5 August 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the United States Army|last=Weigley|first=Russell|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=978-0253203236|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment was abolished in the [[Royal Navy]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/armyrefs.html Cardwell's Army Reforms 1870--1881]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Flogging was a common disciplinary measure in the [[Royal Navy]] that became associated with a seaman's manly disregard for pain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]". National Maritime Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Aboard ships, [[knittles]] or the [[cat o' nine tails]] was used for severe formal punishment, while a "rope's end" or "starter" was used to administer informal, on-the-spot discipline. In severe cases a person could be "flogged around the fleet": a significant number of lashes (up to 600) was divided among the ships on a station and the person was taken to all ships to be flogged on each.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Grint, The Arts of Leadership, 2000, {{ISBN|0191589330}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJ6yjNy___AC&amp;pg=PA238, pp.237-238]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1879 a motion to abolish flogging in the Royal Navy was debated in the House of Commons. [[John O'Connor Power]], the member for Mayo, asked the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] to bring the navy cat-of-nine-tails to the [[House of Commons Library|Commons Library]] so that the members might see what they were voting about.  It was the Great "Cat" Contention, "Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns." [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] celebrates the occasion in his poem, "Wilfred Owen's Photographs": "A witty profound Irishman calls/For a 'cat' into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Ted, "Wilfred Owen's Photographs", ''Lupercal'', 1960. See also Stanford, Jane, ''That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power'', 2011, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the maximum number of lashes that could be inflicted on soldiers in the British Army reached 1,200. This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted "nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of "The Steelbacks" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails ("Not a whimper under the lash"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

====France====
Meanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}
One of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.

=== Australian penal colonies ===
[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]
{{See also|History of Australia}}

Once common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already "imprisoned", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.

Flagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.

With the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or "lashes," to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.

Female convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.

Floggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.

At the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.

Flogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].

During the [[Ancient Roman religion|Ancient Roman festival]] of [[Lupercalia]] young men ran through the streets with thongs cut from the hide of goats which had just been sacrificed, and women who wished to conceive put themselves in their way to receive blows, apparently mostly on the hands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The eunuch priests of the goddess [[Cybele]], the ''[[galli]]'', flogged themselves until they bled during the annual festival called [[Dies sanguinis]]. [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery religions]] also sometimes involved ritual flagellation, as famously depicted in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] at [[Pompeii]], apparently showing initiation into the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Christianity===

[[Flagellation of Christ|''The Flagellation'', in a Christian context]], refers to an episode in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] prior to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]]. The practice of [[mortification of the flesh]] for religious purposes has been utilised by members of various [[Christian denominations]] since the time of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054. Nowadays the 
[[Discipline (instrument of penance)|instrument of penance is called a discipline]], a cattail whip usually made of knotted cords, which is flung over the shoulders repeatedly during private prayer.&lt;ref name="Opus Dei Information Office"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=9316 |title= Opus Dei and corporal mortification |publisher= Opus Dei Information Office |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, a group of Roman Catholics, known as the [[Flagellant]]s, took self-mortification to extremes. These people would travel to towns and publicly beat and whip each other while preaching repentance. The nature of these demonstrations being quite morbid and disorderly, they were during periods of time suppressed by the authorities. They continued to reemerge at different times up until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Flagellants| website = Encyclopædia Britannica| publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.| date = 6 December 2016| url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/flagellants| accessdate = 9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flagellants|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=6th|date=7 October 2018|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/flagellants|accessdate = 9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flagellation was also practised during the [[Black Plague]] as a means to purify oneself of sin and thus prevent contracting the disease. [[Pope Clement VI]] is known to have permitted it for this purpose in 1348.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Flagellants|author= Leslie Alexander St. Lawrence Toke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]], the founder of the [[Lutheran Church]], regularly practiced self-flagellation as a means of mortification of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wall|first=James T. |title=The Boundless Frontier: America from Christopher Columbus to Abraham Lincoln|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|language=English |page=103|quote=Though he did not go to the ends that had Luther— including even self-flagellation— the methods of ritualistic observance, self-denial, and good works did not satisfy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Congregationalist]] writer [[Sarah Osborn]] (1714-1796) also practiced self-flagellation in order "to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God".&lt;ref name="Rubin1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Julius H.|title=Religious Melancholy and Protestant Experience in America|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780195083019|page=115|quote=In the many letters to her correspondents, Fish, Anthony, Hopkins, and Noyes, Osborn examined the state of her soul, sought spiritual guidance in the midst of her perplexities, and created a written forum for her continued self-examination.

Her view was that loving acceptance of the many sufferings of daily life was pleasing to God, and fostered loving relationships with other people, more than taking upon oneself extraneous sufferings through instruments of penance. As a Carmelite nun, Saint Thérèse practiced voluntary corporal mortification.

Some members of strict [[monastic]] orders, and some members of the Catholic lay organization [[Opus Dei]], practice mild self-flagellation using the discipline.&lt;ref name="Opus Dei Information Office"/&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] took the discipline regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barron|first=Fr. Robert|title=Taking the Discipline|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCts0fjsmug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-flagellation remains common in [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]] and one convent in [[Peru]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Certain rituals like the traditional flagellation ritual called [[Tatbir|Talwar zani]] (talwar ka matam or sometimes tatbir) using a sword or zanjeer zani or zanjeer matam, involving the use of a zanjeer (a chain with blades) are also performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200506060012 |title=Scars on the backs of the young |work=New Statesman |location=London |date=6 June 2005 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are religious customs that show solidarity with Husayn and his family.

==As a sexual practice==

Flagellation is also used as a sexual practice in the context of [[BDSM]]. The intensity of the beating is usually far less than used for punishment.

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann: ''In Leder gebunden.

The '''German Aerospace Center''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.}}), abbreviated '''DLR''', is the national center for aerospace, energy and transportation research of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Cologne]] and it has multiple other locations throughout Germany. The DLR is engaged in a wide range of [[research and development]] projects in national and international partnerships. In addition to conducting its own research projects, DLR also acts as the German [[space agency]]. As such, it is responsible for planning and implementing the German space programme on behalf of the [[Cabinet of Germany|German federal government]]. As a project management agency, DLR also coordinates and answers the technical and organisational implementation of projects funded by a number of German federal ministries.

== Overview ==
[[File:Raumfahrt-Kontrollzentrum 9900.jpg|thumb|German Space Operations Center (GSOC) in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] near [[Munich]].]]
DLR has approximately 8000 employees at 20 locations in Germany. Its institutes and facilities are spread over 13 sites, as well as offices in [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] DLR has a budget of about 670 million euro to cover its own research, development and operations. Approximately one third of this sum comes from competitively allocated [[Research funding|third-party funds]] (German: ''Drittmittel''). In addition to this, DLR administers around 500 million euro in German funds for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). In its capacity as project management agency, it manages over 650 million euro in research on behalf of German federal ministries. DLR is a full member of the [[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems]] (CCSDS) and a member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]].

In the context of DLR's initiatives to promote young research talent, ten [[DLR School Lab]]s were set up in Berlin-Adlershof, [[Braunschweig]], [[Bremen]], Cologne-Porz, [[Dortmund]], [[Göttingen]], Hamburg-Harburg, Lampoldshausen/Stuttgart, [[Neustrelitz]], and [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] over the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/schoollab/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1722/3663_read-18208/ | title = DLR_School_Lab - The DLR_School_Labsn | accessdate = 2013-01-15 | work = DLR Portal | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DLR School Labs, school pupils can become acquainted with the practical aspects of natural and engineering sciences by conducting interesting experiments.

The modern DLR was created in 1997, but was the culmination of over half a dozen space, aerospace, and research institutes from across the 20th century.

The oldest predecessor organization of DLR was established by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in Göttingen in 1907. This ''Modellversuchsanstalt der Motorluftschiff-Studiengesellschaft'' (MLStG; German for "Institute for Testing of Aerodynamic Models of the Powered Airship Society") later became the ''[[Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt]]'' ("Aerodynamics Laboratory" or "Aerodynamic Experimental Station"). In the 1940s the DVL (an AVA sister organization) funded [[Konrad Zuse]]'s work on the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] and [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] computers. Another German aviation technology research facility, the 1935-founded, top-secret ''[[Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt]]'' at [[Völkenrode]] which conducted research — much of it for military aviation to suit the Luftwaffe's needs — in parallel to the then-existing forerunners of the DLR of today, would not be discovered by the Allies until after the war's end.

In 1947 the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Weltraumfahrt'' ("Consortium on Space Flight") was formed, leading to the ''Gesellschaft für Weltraumforschung'' (GfW;  "Society for Space Research") being formed in 1948.&lt;ref name=de100&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/100Jahre/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2581/4435_read-7391/ | title = Space flight in Germany – timeline including important events | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2007-02-04 | work = 100 Years | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the Research Institute of Jet Propulsion Physics (FPS) was established at the Stuttgart airport.&lt;ref name="DLR Stuttgart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-344/999_read-1358/ |title=DLR site Stuttgart |work=DRL Portal |publisher=German Aerospace Center |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was later called the DLR was formed in 1969 as the ''Deutsche Forschungs- und Versuchsanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrt'' (DFVLR;  "German Test and Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight") through the merger of several institutions. These were the ''[[Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt]]'' (AVA), the ''[[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (DVL; "German Laboratory for Aviation"), the ''[[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (DFL; "German Research Institute for Aviation") and (in 1972) the ''Gesellschaft für Weltraumforschung'' (GfW; "Society for Space Research").

In 1989, the DFVLR was renamed ''Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrt'' (DLR;  "German Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight").  Also in 1989, the ''[[Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten]]'' (DARA;  "German Agency for Space Flight Affairs") was created.&lt;ref name=de100/&gt;

Following the merger with the ''Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten'' (DARA; German for "German Agency for Space Flight Affairs") on 1 October 1997, the name was changed to "Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt" (DLR), literally "German Center for Aviation and Space Flight". The shorter translation "German Aerospace Center" is used in English-language publications.

Other German space organizations include the ''Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme'' (IRS; [[Institute for Space Systems]]), founded in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Space-Systems-and-Industry/Institut-Fur-Raumfahrtsysteme-Germany.html|title=Defense &amp; Security Intelligence &amp; Analysis: IHS Jane's - IHS|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with DLR's ''Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme'' located in Bremen.&lt;ref name='DLR Bremen'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3523/7991_read-12992/ | title = DLR’s Bremen Site | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2010-01-28 | work = DLR Portal | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, significant contributions are made to the [[European Space Organization]].

== Research ==
[[File:DLR Helikopter.JPG|thumb|The DLR Institute of Flight Systems operates this helicopter as part of the [[Flying Helicopter Simulator]] (FHS)]]

DLR’s mission comprises the exploration of the Earth and the solar system, as well as research aimed at protecting the environment and developing environmentally compatible technologies, and at promoting mobility, communication and security. DLR’s research portfolio, which covers the four focus areas [[Aviation|Aeronautics]], [[Spaceflight|Space]], [[Transport]]ation and [[Energy]], ranges from [[basic research]] to innovative applications. DLR operates large-scale research centres, both for the benefit of its own projects and as a service for its clients and partners from the worlds of business and science.

The objective of DLR’s [[aeronautics]] research is to strengthen the competitive advantage of the national and European aeronautical industry and aviation sector, and to meet political and social demands – for instance with regard to climate-friendly aviation. German [[space exploration|space research]] activities range from experiments under conditions of weightlessness to the exploration of other planets and environmental monitoring from space. In addition to these activities, DLR performs tasks of public authority pertaining to the planning and implementation of the German space programme, in its capacity as the official space agency of the Federal Republic of Germany. DLR’s Project Management Agency (German: ''Projektträger im DLR'') has also been entrusted with tasks of public authority pertaining to the administration of subsidies. In the field of [[energy development|energy research]], DLR is working on highly efficient, low-{{CO2}} power generation technologies based on gas turbines and fuel cells, on solar thermal power generation, and on the efficient use of heat, including [[cogeneration]] based on fossil and renewable energy sources. The topics covered by DLR’s [[Transport engineering|transportation research]] are maintaining mobility, protecting the environment and saving resources, and improving transportation safety.

In addition to the already existing projects [[Mars Express]], [[global navigation satellite system]] [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], and [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]], the Institute of Space Systems (German: ''Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme'') was founded in Bremen on 26 January 2007. In the future, 80 scientists and engineers will be doing research into topics such as space mission concepts, satellite development and propulsion technology.

=== Planetary research ===

==== Mars Express ====
[[File:Ceraunius Tholus in perspective by Mars Express.jpg|thumb|Martian volcano Ceraunius Tholus in perspective by the HRSC aboard Mars Express]]
The High Resolution Stereo Camera [[High Resolution Stereo Camera|HRSC]] is the most important German contribution to the European Space Agency’s [[Mars Express]] mission. It is the first digital stereo camera that also generates multispectral data and that has a very high resolution lens. The camera records images of the Martian surface which formed the basis for a large number of scientific studies. With the HRSC, which was developed at the German Aerospace Center’s Institute of Planetary Research (German: ''Institut für Planetenforschung''), it is possible to analyse details no larger than 10 to 30 meters in three dimensions.

==== Rosetta and Philae ====
[[File:Rosetta's Philae on Comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ''Philae'' on [[Churyumov-Gerasimenko]]]]
The [[comet]] orbiter [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'']] is controlled from the [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC), in [[Darmstadt]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/20/world/europe/rosetta-comet-probe/index.html |title=Comet-chasing probe wakes up, calls home |publisher=CNN |first1=Michael |last1=Pearson |first2=Matt |last2=Smith |date=21 January 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLR has provided the structure, thermal subsystem, flywheel, the Active Descent System (procured by DLR but made in Switzerland),&lt;ref name="moog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moog.com/literature/Space_Defense/Spacecraft/Propulsion/active_descent_system.pdf |title=Active Descent System |publisher=[[Moog Inc.]] |accessdate=11 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112012855/http://www.moog.com/literature/Space_Defense/Spacecraft/Propulsion/active_descent_system.pdf |archive-date=12 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ROLIS, downward-looking camera, SESAME, acoustic sounding and seismic instrument for [[Philae (spacecraft)|''Philae'']], the orbiter's landing unit. It has also managed the project and did the level product assurance.

The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] made the payload engineering, eject mechanism, landing gear, anchoring harpoon, central computer, COSAC, APXS and other subsystems.

==== Dawn ====
The framing cameras, provided by the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] and the DLR, are the main imaging instruments of Dawn, a multi-destination space probe to the [[protoplanet]]s [[4 Vesta]] and [[1 Ceres]] launched in 2007.&lt;ref name="Rayman 2006 605–616"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rayman |first=Marc |author2=Fraschetti, Thomas C. |author3=Raymond, Carol A. |author4=Russell, Christopher T. |title=Dawn: A mission in development for exploration of main belt asteroids Vesta and Ceres |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=April 5, 2006 |volume=58 |pages=605–616 |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/Dawn_overview.pdf |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.01.014 |issue=11 |bibcode=2006AcAau..58..605R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cameras offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres.&lt;ref name=sierks&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11214-011-9745-4 | title = The Dawn Framing Camera | year = 2011 | last1 = Sierks | first1 = H. | last2 = Keller | first2 = H.

=== Manned spaceflight ===

==== Columbus ====
[[Image:S122e008264.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus Module]] on the [[International Space Station]] orbiting the Earth in 2008]]

DLR operates the [[Columbus Control Center]] in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]], [[Germany]]. It is responsible for the coordination of scientific activities as well as for systems operations and life support on board the orbiting Columbus laboratory.

In February 2008, the [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus laboratory]], Europe’s core contribution to the International Space Station [[International Space Station|ISS]], was brought into space by the Space Shuttle and docked to the ISS. The cylindrical module, which has a diameter of {{convert|4.5|m|ftin}}, contains state-of-the-art scientific equipment. It is planned to enable researchers on Earth to conduct thousands of experiments in biology, materials science, fluid physics and many other fields under conditions of weightlessness in space.

[[Image:STS-61-a-patch.png|thumb|right|The ''Deutschland-1'' orbital space plane flight, funded by West Germany, included over {{convert|7|short ton|t|order=flip}} of German science research equipment]]

==== Spacelab, Shuttle, Mir, Soyuz ====
Germany has near ten astronauts and participates in ESA manned space programs including flights of German astronauts aboard US [[Space Shuttle]]s and Russian spacecraft. Besides missions under ESA and flights on [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] and [[Mir]], two Space Shuttle missions with the European built [[Spacelab]] were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by Germany (like a separate few by [[ESA]] and one by [[Japan]]) with German astronauts on board as hosts and not guests. The first West German mission ''[[Deutschland 1]]'' (Spacelab-D1, DLR-1, NASA designation [[STS-61-A]]) took place in 1985. 

The second similar mission, ''[[Deutschland 2]]'' (Spacelab-D2, DLR-2, NASA designation [[STS-55]]), was first planned for 1988, but then due to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] was delayed until 1993 when it became the first German manned space mission after [[German reunification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124617/http://fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth-bound research and aeronautics ===

==== Remote sensing of the Earth ====
In [[remote sensing]] of the Earth, [[satellite]]s provide comprehensive and continually updated information on "System Earth". This remote sensing data is used to investigate the Earth’s atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces, and ice sheets. Practical applications of this technology include environmental monitoring and disaster relief.

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004]], for instance, up-to-date maps could be compiled very quickly using Earth observation satellites. These maps could then be used for orientation during relief missions. DLR conducts these research activities at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) (German: ''Deutsches Fernerkundungsdatenzentrum''), a DLR institute based in Oberpfaffenhofen. Nowadays, satellite data is also important for [[Climatology|climate research]]: it is used to measure temperatures, {{CO2}} levels, [[Particulate|particulate matter]] levels, rainforest deforestation and the [[Albedo|radiation conditions]] of the Earth’s surface (land, oceans, polar ice).

==== TerraSAR-X ====
The new German Earth observation satellite [[TerraSAR-X]] was launched in June 2007. The objective of this five-year mission is to provide radar remote sensing data to scientific and commercial users. The satellite’s design is based on the technology and expertise developed in the X-SAR and SRTM SAR missions ([[Synthetic aperture radar|Synthetic Aperture Radar]]). The sensor has a number of different modes of operation, with a maximum resolution of one meter, and is capable of generating elevation profiles.

TerraSAR-X is the first satellite that was jointly paid for by government and industry. DLR contributed about 80 percent of the total expenses, with the remainder being covered by [[EADS Astrium]]. The satellite's core component is a radar sensor operating in the X band and capable of recording the Earth’s surface using a range of different modes of operation, capturing an area of 10 to 100 kilometers in size with  a resolution of 1 to 16 meters.

====Astronomical surveys====
The [[Uppsala-DLR Trojan Survey]] (UDTS) was a search for asteroids near [[Jupiter]] in the 1990s, in collaboration with the Swedish [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]]. When it concluded there was another survey, the [[UAO-DLR Asteroid Survey]], this time with a focus on [[Near Earth asteroids]] and both surveys discovered numerous objects.

==== Suborbital Spaceplane ====
Studying a [[suborbital spaceplane]], DLR conducted [[Falke (spacecraft)|Falke]] prototype for [[Hermes (spaceplane)|Hermes]] spaceplane program, participates in non-realized [[Sanger II]] project and since 2005 work under the concept making fast intercontinental passenger transport possible. The [[SpaceLiner]] is a reusable vehicle lifting-off vertically and landing like a glider.

==== Research aircraft ====
[[File:ILA 2008 PD 423.JPG|thumb|ATTAS]]
[[File:SOFIA in air.jpg|thumb|SOFIA's maiden flight on 26 April 2007]]
DLR operates Europe’s largest fleet of research aircraft. The aircraft are used both as research objects and as research tools. DLR’s research aircraft provide platforms for all kinds of research missions. Scientists and engineers can use them for practical, application-oriented purposes: Earth observation, atmospheric research or testing new aircraft components. DLR is for instance investigating wing [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]] and possible ways of eliminating it, which would also help to reduce aircraft noise. So-called "flying simulators" can be used to simulate the flight performance of aircraft that have not been built yet. This method was for instance used to test the [[Airbus A380]] in the early stages of its development. The [[VFW-Fokker 614|VFW 614]] '''ATTAS''' was used to test several systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fuel-cell-mv2.dlr.de/fl/produkte/dl/experimental2.htm | title = Experimental Cockpit}}{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-altitude research aircraft HALO ([[High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft]]) will be used for atmospheric research and Earth observation from 2009. With a cruising altitude of more than 15 kilometers and a range of over 8,000 kilometers, HALO will provide for the first time the capability to gather data on a continental scale, at all latitudes, from the tropics to the poles, and at altitudes as high as the lower stratosphere.

The Airbus A320-232 ''D-ATRA'', the latest and largest addition to the fleet, has been in use by the German Aerospace Center since late 2008. ATRA ([[Advanced Technology Research Aircraft]]) is a modern and flexible flight test platform which sets a new benchmark for flying test beds in European aerospace research – and not just because of its size.

DLR and [[NASA]] jointly operate the flying infrared telescope SOFIA ([[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]]). A [[Boeing 747SP]] with a modified fuselage enabling it to carry a reflecting telescope developed in Germany is used as an airborne research platform. The aircraft is operated by the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] at Site 9 (USAF Plant 42) in Palmdale, California. Observation flights will be flown 3 or 4 nights a week, for up to eight hours at a time and at an altitude of 12 to 14 kilometers. SOFIA has been designed to remain operational for a period of 20 years. It is the successor to the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]] (KAO), which was deployed from 1974 to 1995.

==== Emissions research ====
DLR conducts research into {{CO2}} and noise emissions caused by air transport. In order to ensure that increasing traffic volumes do not lead to an increase in the noise pollution caused by air transport, DLR is investigating options for noise reduction. The "Low-noise Approach and Departure Procedures" research project (German: ''Lärmoptimierte An- und Abflugverfahren''), for instance, forms part of the national research project "Quiet Traffic" (German: ''Leiser Verkehr''). The objective of this project is to find flight procedures that can reduce the amount of noise generated during takeoff and landing. One approach is to analyse noise propagation at ground level during takeoff using a large number of microphones. Researchers are also trying to reduce the noise at source, focusing for instance on airframe and engine noise. They hope to minimise noise generated in the engines using so-called "[[Active noise control|antinoise]]".

The German Aerospace Center's research work on {{CO2}} emissions caused by air transport focuses for instance on model calculations concerning the effects of converting the global aircraft fleet to [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen propulsion]]. The growth rates of aviation are above average. This raises the question if {{CO2}} emission-free hydrogen propulsion could perhaps limit the effects of growing air traffic volumes on the environment and the climate.

==== Hydrogen as an energy carrier ====
The [[Hydrosol]] and [[Hydrosol-2]] is one of the energy research projects in which DLR scientists are engaged. For the first time, scientists have achieved thermal water splitting using solar energy, generating hydrogen and oxygen without {{CO2}} emissions. For this achievement, the DLR team and several other research groups received the [[Descartes Prize]], a research award created by the European Commission.  The FP6 Hydrosol II pilot reactor (around 100&amp;nbsp;kW) for solar [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] [[hydrogen production]] at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]] started in November 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP6_PROJ&amp;ACTION=D&amp;RCN=75098&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=1161712766968 | title = HYDROSOL II | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2009-11-03 | work = Sixth Framework Programme | publisher = [[CORDIS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is in operation since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/ | title = DLR scientists achieve solar hydrogen production in a 100-kilowatt pilot plant | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2008-11-25 | work = DLR Portal | publisher = German Aerospace Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traffic Congestion====
[[File:Zeppelin nt dlr.jpg|thumb|[[Zeppelin NT]] carrying the DLR logo]]
During the 2006 FIFA World Cup football championship, DLR implemented the Soccer project aimed at preventing traffic congestion. In this transportation research project, traffic data was obtained from the air in Berlin, Stuttgart and Cologne and used as input for traffic forecasting. A sensor system combining a conventional and a thermographic camera was used to obtain the data. A zeppelin, an aeroplane and a helicopter served as flying research platforms. An image analysis software package generated aerial photos showing the current traffic parameters as well as traffic forecasts. In this way, traffic control centres could be provided with almost-real-time traffic information, and road users could be diverted whenever necessary.

==== Solar tower power plant ====
[[Image:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|thumb|The 11&amp;nbsp;MW [[PS10]] near Seville in Spain.]]
In 2007, the first commercially operated [[Solar power tower|solar tower power plant]], the [[PS10 solar power tower]], was commissioned. It has a capacity of eleven megawatt and it is located near Sevilla, in [[Sanlúcar la Mayor]] (Spain). DLR is prominently involved in developing the technology for this type of power plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/sectors/doc/csp/ps10_final_report.pdf Final technical progress report, for European Union officials (November 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811230017/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/sectors/doc/csp/ps10_final_report.pdf |date=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In solar tower power plants, sun-tracking mirrors (heliostats) redirect the solar radiation onto a central heat exchanger (receiver) on top of a tower. This generates high-temperature process heat, which can then be used in gas or steam turbine power plants to generate electrical power for the public electricity grid. In the future, solar thermal tower plant technology could also be used to generate solar fuels, such as hydrogen, without {{CO2}} emissions.

The '''German Protestant Institute of Archaeology (GPIA), Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute''', founded in 1900 is one of the most important biblical archaeological institutes in the Near East. Its [[German language|German]] name is ''Deutsches Evangelisches Institut für Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes''.

== Institutes ==
The German Protestant Institute of Archaeology, Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute, operates in two locations – [[Jerusalem]] and [[Amman]]. Its high reputation as cultural institution, help desk, and meeting place for European scholars makes it a sought-after partner for cooperation between German and international organizations and projects. The GPIA is a foundation administered by the [[German Protestant Church]]. At the same time, it serves as a research unit of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] (DAI). They cooperate in several archaeological projects.

* Institute [[Jerusalem]],
Director-General: Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. h.c. [[Dieter Vieweger]]&lt;br /&gt;
Address: Auguste-Victoria-Compound, P.O.Box 18 463, Jerusalem 91184&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological museum

* Institute [[Amman]],
Director: Dr. Jutta Häser&lt;br /&gt;
Address: P.O.Box 183, Amman 11118, Jordan&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological collection

== Aims ==
The mission of the institute was clearly stated in its founding charter: the exploration of the Holy Land and its diverse past, cultures and religions. The knowledge acquired was meant to be available to, and discussed by, both experts and the general public. In light of this founding mission, the institute undertakes research on the history and culture of the region. To this end, the institute conducts its own excavations and supports other German research projects.

The institute is also committed to disseminating the results of research, especially in the areas of archaeology, cultural studies, theology and the Church. For this purpose, the institute maintains a research library, issues its own archaeological journal and organises meetings, lecture series and exhibitions. Especially important is the Course Programme for theologians, which was founded over 100 years ago by the first director, [[Gustaf Dalman]]. The institute also tries to make archaeological knowledge available to the public by offering guided tours of Jerusalem and the surrounding area.

The GPIA fosters close relations with the cultural institutions in the host countries and supports scientific research without any political or religious borders on both sides of the river Jordan.

== Archaeological projects ==

=== Tall Zira'a and the Gadara Region Project (Jordan) ===
Together with the [[Biblical Archaeological Institute]] in [[Wuppertal]], the GPIA conducts the [[Gadara Region Project]] (2001–2020) in the Wadi al-'Arab, south of Umm Qais. The central archaeological site of the Wadi al-'Arab is the [[Tall Zira'a]].
There is hardly an area of Palestine where its history can be studied in such a concentrated manner as in the Wadi al-'Arab. This deep valley, which lies roughly five kilometres south-west of the ancient [[Decapolis]] city of Gadara (today [[Umm Qais]]), is, in many ways, an archaeological bonanza due to the variety in what it has to offer. A number of springs, fertile soils and a moderate climate all provide for excellent living conditions, and the most imposing hill in the valley, Tall Zira'a, possesses its own artesian spring and the very best potential for settlement.

In addition, an important trade route ran through the wadi which once linked Egypt with Mesopotamia. The economic success and industriousness of the wadi's inhabitants have left plenty of traces over the millennia. Over one hundred sites mark out the distinguished history of human settlement in the region from the advent of sedentism to the Islamic period. Settlements, canals, water mills, cisterns, oil presses, wine presses, watch towers, graves and, above all, Tall Zira'a with its over 5000 years of settlement activity.

=== The archaeological park below the Church of the Redeemer (Jerusalem) ===
The archaeological park opened in November 2012 "The Times", located below the nave of the Church of the Redeemer was co-developed by German Protestant Institute (GPIA) and offers the possibility to commit more than 2000 years of history of the city of Jerusalem by walking through it.

The archaeological excavations, conducted by [[Conrad Schick]] 1893 und Ute Wagner-Lux (the former director of GPIA) respectively Karl Vriezen 1970–1974, have been prepared by the German Protestant Institute in the Holy Land in 2009–2012 to present visitors the different stages of development and building of Jerusalem.

=== Former projects ===
* Ute Wagner-Lux – [[Madaba]] / [[Jerusalem]] / [[Gadara]],
* August Strobel – Kallirrhoë (En ez-Zara),
* Gunnar Lehmann; Martin Peilstöcker – Plain of [[Akko]],
* Volkmar Fritz – Tell el-Oreme,
* Susanne Kerner – [[Gadara Aqueduct|Gadara Tunnel System]]
* Thomas Weber – Gadara
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger – Esh-Shallaf near Irbid,
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger; Roland Lamprichs – Baja near [[Petra]],
* Roland Lamprichs – Tall Johfieh,
* Michael Heinzelmann – [[Hippos]].

==History==
The GPIA was founded on June 19, 1900, by the Deutsche Evangelische Kirchenkonferenz in Eisenach in order to "maintain, further and regulate the relations between the holy places of biblical history, on the one hand, and between the scientific inquiry and the interests of the Christian faith of the Protestant Church, on the other, in the fields of biblical and ecclesiastical archaeology."

Gustaf Dalman – then Professor of Old Testament and Judaic Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] – was appointed first director and built up the Jerusalem institute. The changed situation after the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967 necessitated the establishment of the Amman institute. In 1982, the institute in Jerusalem moved to new buildings at the Auguste-Victoria-Compound on the [[Mount of Olives]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">'''Granny dumping''' (informal) is a term that was introduced in the early 1980s by professionals in the medical and social work fields. Granny dumping is defined by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as "the abandonment of an elderly person in a public place such as a hospital or nursing home, especially by a relative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=granny dumping - definition of granny dumping in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/granny_dumping|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be carried out by family members who are unable or unwilling to continue providing care due to financial problems, burnout, lack of resources (such as home health or assisted living options), or stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dumping Ground For Granny|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/dumping-ground-granny-201140?rm=eu|website=Newsweek|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House: Wilson calls for action on ‘granny dumping’ {{!}} The Royal Gazette:Bermuda Health|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150310/NEWS06/150319979|website=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practice, known as ''[[ubasute]]'', had allegedly existed in Japan centuries ago when senile elders were brought to mountaintops by poor citizens who were unable to look after them. The widespread economic and demographic problems facing Japan have seen it on the rise with relatives dropping off seniors at hospitals or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese people who can't afford elder care are reviving a practice known as 'granny dumping'|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/japanese-people-reviving-granny-dumping-practice-2017-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70,000 (both male and female equally) elderly Americans were estimated to have been abandoned in 1992 in a report issued by the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]]. In this same study, ACEP received informal surveys from 169 hospital Emergency Departments and report an average of 8 "granny dumping" abandonments per week. According to the New York Times, 1 in 5 people are now caring for an elderly parent and people are spending more time than ever caring for an elderly parent than their own children. Social workers have said that this may be the result of millions of people who are near the breaking point of looking after their elderly parents who are in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Granny Dumping by the Thousands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/opinion/granny-dumping-by-the-thousands.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=29 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, granny dumping is more likely to happen in states such as Florida, Texas and California where there are large populations of retirement communities. Congress has attempted to step in by mandating to emergency departments requiring them to see all patients. However, Medicaid is covering less and less of medical bills through reimbursement (in 1989 it was 78% but that number is decreasing) and reduced eligibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some cases, the hospitals may not want to take the risk of having a patient who cannot pay so they will attempt to transfer their care to another hospital. According to the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] set into place by [[Ronald Reagan]], a hospital can transfer at the patient's request or providers must sign a document providing why they believe a patient's care should be better served at another facility. With 40% of revenue coming from [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] a hospital must earn 8 cents per dollar to compensate for the loss of 7 cents per Medicaid/Medicare patients. Hospitals had to pay an additional 2 billion dollars to private payers to cover costs for Medicare/Medicaid patients in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conard|first=Jane Reister|date=1992|title=Granny Dumping: The Hospital's Duty of Care to Patients Who Have Nowhere to Go|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40239388|journal=Yale Law &amp; Policy Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=463–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of granny dumping can happen before long weekends and may peak before Christmas when families head off on holidays. Caregivers in both Australia and New Zealand report that old people without acute medical problems are dropped off at hospitals. As a result, hospitals and care facilities have to carry an extra burden on their limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Martin|title=Holiday concern about 'granny dumping' at hospitals|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11348685|website=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en-NZ|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disturbing rise in cases of 'granny dumping'|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/elderly-being-dumped-by-families-at-hospital/news-story/4642a4958d8ff9edf5160382350a1103|website=News.com.au|publisher=The Sunday Mail, Queensland|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green furniture''', often symbolized by a tree, are products that use materials from sustainable forests, have low toxic material levels, locally manufactured and are durable enough to last. It should lend itself to easy repair, disassembly, and recycling. Products certified by MBDC’s C2C ([[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle 2 Cradle]]) product regimen are a perfect example, like certified [[office chair]]s from [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller]], Mebelluks (Russia) and [[Steelcase]]. These product can be easily taken apart, sorted into their constituent parts, and recycled at the end of their useful lives.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Hindu art''' encompasses the artistic traditions and styles culturally connected to [[Hinduism]] and have a long history of religious association with Hindu scriptures, rituals and worship.

==Background==
[[Hinduism]], with its [[Hinduism by country|1 billion followers]], it makes up about 15% of the world’s population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape - Hinduism|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-hindu.aspx|work=A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Major Religious Groups as of 2010|publisher=The pew foundation|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art.  There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;”Heart of Hinduism: Sanskrit and Sanskriti (Culture).” 2004, 30 Mar 2009. &lt; http://hinduism.iskcon.com/lifestyle/801.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

*Singing
*Instrumental music
**Learning music in [[Hindu culture]] was a difficult task before the 20th century because of a necessary birth into a [[gharana]]. After the early 1920s integration of anyone wanting to learn classical Hindustani music could. An average ensemble normally includes a harmonium (which was brought to India by westerners), flute, [[veena]], [[sitar]], swaramandala, and a tabla. Many of the songs have strong themes that are related to theology such as a god’s favorite pastimes, praise of any god whether they be in their original form from “the trinity” or the god's reincarnation, even stories of the creation of earth. Since instrumental music is a performance art it must follow strict guidelines that come from the treatise Natya Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Beck, Guy. “Hindu music, now and into the future.” Hinduism Today October/November/December 2007. 28-31. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1515&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dancing
*Painting
**Indian variety - the different types of folk paintings are proud for Indian culture which reflects beauty, tradition and heritage of India. There are many types of traditional paintings like [[Madhubani art|Madhubani]], Rajsthani, [[Batik|Batik-Art]], Patachitra, Gond, Mandala, [[Warli|Tribal Art Warli]], [[Pithora (painting)|Pithora]], Bengali, Nirmal, [[Mysore painting|Mysore]], [[Tanjore]] paintings etc. which are the expressions of love, almighty, beauty, truth, tradition and art of each and every region of the India.

**Drapery- The art of drapery has progressed over time. At one point both men and women wore dhotis but around the 14th century that changed and women’s fashion became more intricate thus creating the sari. The drapery involved distinguishes the wearer’s taste, occupation, and social status. The fabrics chosen range from cotton and synthetic fabrics all the way to silk. The fabric chosen depends on what occasion the wearer is going to use the item of clothing for. The draping of the sari comes in four different families: [[Marvari]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], Tribal, and Nivi. The family that the wearer chooses depends on the wearer’s personal taste. The way an item of clothing is draped tells a lot about the wearer such as expression of creativity, progression of fashion, and where the user comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Boulanger, Chantal. “The Remarkable Indian Art of Draping.” Hinduism Today. October/November/December 2008. 60-62. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3078&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Texts on Art Practices==

*Natya Shastra
**The Natya Shastra is the leading guide to the Hindu performing arts. It is based on the Natya Veda, which no longer exists, and is roughly 37 chapters long with 6,000 [[slokas]].&lt;ref&gt;“Natya Shastra: Encyclopedia II.” 29 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Natya_Shastra_-_Text_and_title/id/1793036&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities Dedicated to the Production of Art==

*Raghupajpur
**This city is solely dedicated to the production of artwork that is driven by the divine forces of Hinduism and these artworks are produced in a traditional fashion. The city is located in Eastern India (Orissa) and at one point this city was at risk of being completely destroyed due to British rule{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. During this time religion and the power of the kings were being overthrown and as such there was no reason for a city to exist whose main purpose is to supply traditional art. After this crisis occurred the city began to exclusively base itself on agriculture until a man named Jacnnath Mopatra led a training center for chitrakars. This revolution began production of the traditional art works once again in the 1950s and since the work being produced is known internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohanty, M.P. “Living, Painting, Worshipping Art.” Hinduism Today. July/August/September 2007. 54-59. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Symbols==

*Extra Limbs-Extra limbs are seen on many of the Hindu deities in paintings and sculptures. The extra limbs show how much power the god is capable of because of their ability to perform many tasks at once. Such as the goddess [[Sarasvati]] always has a minimum of four arms. Two of the arms will be playing a vina, representing the tuning of her knowledge, prayer beads in another hand and a scripture in another, both of these items are used to represent her devotion to her spirituality. Since she is the goddess of learning and art we see that she is very capable and very powerful in her area of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp. “Saravasti, the Goddess of Learning.” 20 Mar 2009. &lt; http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lotus Flower-The lotus flower is another common item seen constantly throughout the arts. The lotus flower represents purity, beauty, prosperity, fertility, and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Anil K. Goel, Lucknow. “God’s Favorite Flower.” Hinduism Today. 1999. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4411&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason the flower shows these attributes is due to the process in which the lotus flower goes through in order to blossom. The flower grows out of mud and rests atop the water in which it grows showing the hardship it must endure in order to achieve maximum beauty. Many deities have their name based on the Sanskrit word for lotus such as Lakshimi.&lt;ref&gt;“Lotus-Hindu Symbols” Religion Facts. 2007. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/lotus.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">'''Hybrid intelligent system''' denotes a software system which employs, in parallel, a combination of methods and techniques from  artificial intelligence subfields as:
* [[Neuro-fuzzy]] systems
* hybrid connectionist-symbolic models
* Fuzzy [[expert system]]s
* [[Connectionist expert system]]s
* Evolutionary neural networks
* [[Genetic fuzzy system]]s
* [[Rough fuzzy hybridization]]
* Reinforcement learning with fuzzy, neural, or evolutionary methods as well as  symbolic reasoning methods.

From the [[cognitive science]] perspective, every natural intelligent system is hybrid because it performs mental operations on both the symbolic and subsymbolic levels. For the past few years there has been an increasing discussion of the importance of [[A.I. Systems Integration]]. Based on notions that there have already been created simple and specific [[AI]] systems (such as systems for [[computer vision]], [[speech synthesis]], etc., or software that employs some of the models mentioned above) and now is the time for integration to create broad [[AI]] systems. Proponents of this approach are researchers such as [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Ron Sun]], [[Aaron Sloman]],  and [[Michael A. Arbib]].

An example hybrid is a [[hierarchical control system]] in which the lowest, reactive layers are sub-symbolic. The higher layers, having relaxed time constraints, are capable of reasoning from an abstract world model and performing planning.

Intelligent systems usually rely on hybrid reasoning processes, which include [[inductive reasoning|induction]], [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[abductive reasoning|abduction]] and reasoning by [[analogy]].

Some of the early production projects which have used '''Ingex''' include a [[Foo Fighters]] music video, and the BBC television series [[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]].&lt;ref name=cwuk /&gt;

== Features ==

The different software products in the suite support:&lt;ref name=ingex-sourceforge /&gt;

* Multi-camera video capture in a studio environment
* Video tape archive preservation
* Acting as a server to [[Avid Technology|Avid]] editing clients

''Media Harmony''&lt;ref name="ingex.sourceforge.net"&gt;http://ingex.sourceforge.net/MediaHarmony/&lt;/ref&gt; is a module for [[Samba (software)|Samba]] [[Virtual file system|Virtual file system (VFS)]].  This allows editing clients, such as [[Avid Technology|Avid]], to use low-cost commodity storage for video and media files.

''Ingex Studio'' provides studio-style recoding, capture, transcode, and [[MXF]] wrapping for multiple cameras, also known as multi-camera tapeless recording.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://ingex.sourceforge.net/studio/&lt;/ref&gt;  The software runs on commodity PC hardware and [[Serial digital interface|SDI]] IO cards.  The media can then be edited by MXF-based editors, for example, [[Avid Media Composer]].

The '''International Council for Traditional Music''' ('''ICTM''') is [[non-governmental organization]] focused on [[musicology]] and [[dance research]]. Founded in [[London]] on 22 September 1947, it publishes the ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]'' once a year and the ''[[Bulletin of the ICTM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ictmusic.org/publications/bulletin-ictm/past-issues|title=Bulletin of the ICTM {{!}} International Council for Traditional Music|website=www.ictmusic.org|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' three times a year. The organization was previously known as '''The International Folk Music Council''' ('''IFMC'''). In 1949, it helped found the [[UNESCO]] [[International Music Council]] and remains in formal consultative relationship with UNESCO. Since 2013, its president has been Salwa El-Shawan Castelo-Branco, director of the Instituto de Etnomusicologia – Centro de Estudos em Música e Dança at the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">A '''K-line''', or '''Knowledge-line''', is a [[mental agent]] which represents an association of a group of other mental agents found active when a subject solves a certain [[problem]] or formulates a new [[idea]]. These were first described in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s essay [[K-lines: A Theory of Memory]], published in 1980 in the journal ''Cognitive Science'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you "get an idea," or "solve a problem" ... you create what we shall call a K-line. ... When that K-line is later "activated", it reactivates ... mental agencies, creating a partial mental state "resembling the original."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/CSJarchive/1980v04/i02/p0117p0133/MAIN.PDF  Minsky's "K-lines: A Theory of Memory]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Whenever you 'get a good idea', solve a problem, or have a memorable experience, you activate a K-line to 'represent' it. A K-line is a wirelike structure that attaches itself to whichever mental agents are active when you solve a problem or have a good idea.

When you activate that K-line later, the agents attached to it are aroused, putting you into a 'mental state' much like the one you were in when you solved that problem or got that idea.  This should make it relatively easy for you to solve new, similar problems!" (1998, p. 82.)

Pargament] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003050724/http://www.bgsu.edu/downloads/cas/file35128.pdf |date=2012-10-03 }}, BGSU&lt;/ref&gt; is an emeritus professor of [[psychology]] at [[Bowling Green State University]] ([[Ohio]], USA).

== Biography ==

Born in 1950&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament (2007). ''[https://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0730/2007019485-b.html Spiritually integrated psychotherapy: Understanding and addressing the sacred]''. New York: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-844-2}} (birth year 1950 in LOC pub data)&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name=VITA/&gt; Pargament received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/psych/page33121.html BGSU/Psychology faculty page - Kenneth I. Pargament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218203937/http://bgsu.edu/departments/psych/page33121.html |date=2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently studies various relationships between [[religion]], psychological well-being and stress, as well as other closely related subjects.  He is also licensed in [[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]] and has a private practice.

Pargament has published over 200 papers on the subject of religion and spirituality in psychology.  He is world-renowned for his scholarly contributions to the [[psychology of religion]], and for providing clinically relevant scientific analyses of religion's role in mental health.  Pargament has also written two books: ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice]]'' (1997; see [[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|article]]),&lt;ref name=p97&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament (1997). ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping (book)|The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice]]''. New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Spiritually Integrated Psychotherapy: Understanding and Addressing the Sacred'' (2007).  Both of these seminal works provide a systematic program of empirical research, guided by theory, that is of practical relevance to helping professionals.

== Research ==

One of Pargament's best known areas of research has pertained to Religious Coping, which involves drawing on religious beliefs and practices to understand and deal with life stressors.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt; Pargament has also helped to design a [[questionnaire]] called the "RCOPE" to measure Religious Coping strategies.&lt;ref name=rcope&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Harold G. Koenig &amp; Lisa M. Perez (2000). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4%3C519::AID-JCLP6%3E3.0.CO;2-1 The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology'', v56 n4, pp519-543. {{doi|10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The three methods of coping that are identified by the RCOPE are the deferring style, self-directing style, and collaborative style. The deferring style involves delegating all problem solving to God; the self-directing style is when the individual chooses to utilize the power God has given them to solve the problem on their own; and the collaborative style is implemented when the individual treats God as a teammate in the problem solving process. The collaborative style of religious coping has been found to have the greatest psychological benefits, correlating with increased self-esteem and lower levels of depression.&lt;ref name=copingstyles&gt;Phillips III, R. E., Lynn, Q. K., Crossley, C. D., &amp; Pargament, K. I. (2004). Self-Directing 	Religious Coping: A Deistic God, Abandoning God, or No God at All?. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 43(3), 409-418.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, Pargament's work has helped set the stage for a large scale program of research on this subject: currently there have been over 250 published studies on religious coping.

Pargament's research also has helped psychologists learn how religious belief influences mental and physical health. For instance, he found that religious activity increased for Muslim-Americans after 9/11, and that in comparison with those who remained isolated and rejected by their religion, they experienced fewer symptoms of depression &lt;ref name=muslims&gt;Abu-Raiya, H., Pargament, K. I., &amp; Mahoney, A. (2011). Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks. Psychology Of Religion And Spirituality, 3(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he found that negative religious coping among AIDS patients was associated with an increase in HIV-related symptoms &lt;ref name=HIV&gt;Cotton, S., Puchalski, C. M., Sherman, S. N., Mrus, J. M., Peterman, A. H., Feinberg, J., Kenneth 	I. Pargament, Amy C. Justice, Anthony C. Leonard, Tsevat, J. (2006). Spirituality and Religion in Patients with HIV/AIDS. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 21S5-S13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pargament has described four major stances toward religion that have been adopted by psychotherapists in their work with clients. He called them the religiously ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''[[religious pluralism|pluralist]]'' stances.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;&lt;ref name=zp&gt;Brian J. Zinnbauer &amp; Kenneth I. Pargament (2000). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=2995869&amp;site=ehost-live Working with the sacred: Four approaches to religious and spiritual issues in counseling]. ''Journal of Counseling &amp; Development'', v78 n2, pp162-171. ISSN 0748-9633&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the pluralistic approach is the best for clinicians because it recognizes the existence of a Supreme Being but allows for many interpretations of that reality.&lt;ref name=puralistic&gt;Zinnbauer, B. J., &amp; Pargament, K. I. (2000). Working With the Sacred: Four Approaches to Religious and Spiritual Issues in Counseling. Journal of Counseling &amp; Development, 78(2), 162-171.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Pargament believes that religious discussions should become a greater part of the therapeutic process. He has advocated for religious guidebooks to be created for psychotherapists and that religious training be mandated.&lt;ref name="puralistic"/&gt;

Pargament has also linked [[attribution theory]] to the [[psychology of religion]], doing empirical research distinguishing between different forms of religious attribution.

[[File:Tide station leveling.jpg|thumbnail|Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services staff member conducts tide station levelling in support of the US Army Corp of Engineers in Richmond, Maine.]]
'''Levelling''' ([[British English]]) or '''leveling''' ([[American English]]); is a branch of [[surveying]], the object of which is to establish or verify or measure the height of specified points relative to a datum. It is widely used in  [[cartography]] to measure [[Geodetic system|geodetic]] [[height]], and in [[construction]] to measure height differences of construction artifacts.

==Optical levelling==
[[Image:Baak.svg|thumb|right|Stadia marks on a crosshair while viewing a metric [[levelling rod]]. The top mark is at 1.5 m and the lower is at 1.345 m. The distance between the marks is 0.155 m, yielding a distance to the rod of 15.5 m.]]Optical levelling  employs an [[optical level]],which consists of a precision telescope with [[crosshair]]s and [[Stadia mark]]s. The cross hairs are used to establish the level point on the target, and the stadia allow range-finding; stadia are usually at ratios of 100:1, in which case one metre between the stadia marks on the levelling staff represents 100 metres from the target.
The complete unit is normally mounted on a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]], and the telescope can freely rotate 360° in a horizontal plane. The surveyor adjusts the instrument's level by coarse adjustment of the tripod legs and fine adjustment using three precision levelling screws on the instrument to make the rotational plane horizontal. The surveyor does this with the use of a [[Bull's eye level|bull's eye]] [[spirit level|level]] built into the instrument mount.
The surveyor looks through the eyepiece of telescope while an assistant holds a vertical [[Level staff|level staff]] which is a graduated in inches or centimeters. The level staff is placed with its foot on the  point for which the level measurement is required. The telescope is rotated and focused until the level staff is plainly visible in the crosshairs. In the case of a high accuracy manual level, the fine level adjustment is made by an altitude screw, using a high accuracy bubble level fixed to the telescope. This can be viewed by a mirror whilst adjusting or the ends of the bubble can be displayed within the telescope, which also allows assurance of the accurate level of the telescope whilst the sight is being taken. However, in the case of an automatic level, altitude adjustment is done automatically by a suspended prism due to gravity, as long as the coarse levelling is accurate within certain limits. When level, the staff graduation reading at the crosshairs is recorded, and an identifying mark or marker placed where the level staff rested on the object or position being surveyed.

==Linear levelling procedure==
[[File:NivellementExample.svg|thumb|Diagram showing relationship between two level staff, or rods, shown as 1 and 3. The level line of sight is 2.]]

A typical procedure for a linear track of levels from a known datum is as follows. Set up the instrument within {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=off}} of a point of known or assumed elevation. A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale. This gives the height of the instrument above the starting (backsight) point and allows the height of the instrument (H.I.) above the datum to be computed.
The rod is then held on an unknown point and a reading is taken in the same manner, allowing the elevation of the new (foresight) point to be computed. The procedure is repeated until the destination point is reached. It is usual practice to perform either a complete loop back to the starting point or else close the traverse on a second point whose elevation is already known. The closure check guards against blunders in the operation, and allows residual error to be distributed in the most likely manner among the stations.

Some instruments provide three crosshairs which allow [[Stadia mark|stadia]] measurement of the foresight and backsight distances. These also allow use of the average of the three readings (3-wire leveling) as a check against blunders and for averaging out the error of interpolation between marks on the rod scale.

The two main types of levelling are single-levelling as already described, and double-levelling (Double-rodding). In double-levelling, a surveyor takes two foresights and two backsights and makes sure the difference between the foresights and the difference between the backsights are equal, thereby reducing the amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ira Osborn Baker|title=Leveling: Barometric, Trigonometric and Spirit|page=126|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22single+leveling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-levelling costs twice as much as single-levelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Guy Bomford|title=Geodesy|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|edition=4th|page=204|year=1980|isbn=0-19-851946-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hAJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single+levelling%22&amp;dq=%22single+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Turning a level===

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. Turning is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location.

To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed.

The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

==Refraction and curvature==
The curvature of the earth means that a line of sight that is horizontal at the instrument will be higher and higher above a spheroid at greater distances. The effect may be significant for some work at distances under 100 meters.

The line of sight is horizontal at the instrument, but is not a straight line because of refraction in the air. The change of air density with elevation causes the line of sight to bend toward the earth.

The combined correction for refraction and curvature is approximately:&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Foote, and Kelly, Surveying Theory and Practice, 1966 p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta h_{meters} = 0.067 D_{km} ^2 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \Delta h_{feet} = 0.021 \left(\frac {D_{ft}}{1000} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; 
For precise work these effects need to be calculated and corrections applied. For most work it is sufficient to keep the foresight and backsight distances approximately equal so that the refraction and curvature effects cancel out. Refraction is generally the greatest source of error in leveling. For short level lines the effects of temperature and pressure are generally insignificant, but the effect of the temperature gradient ''dT / dh'' can lead to errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Guy Bomford|title=Geodesy|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|place=Oxford | edition=4th | page=222|year=1980|isbn=0-19-851946-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hAJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single+levelling%22&amp;dq=%22single+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levelling loops and gravity variations==

Assuming error-free measurements, if the Earth's gravity field were completely regular and gravity constant, leveling loops would always close precisely:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n \Delta h_i = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

around a loop. In the real gravity field of the Earth, this happens only approximately; on small loops typical of engineering projects, the loop closure is negligible, but on larger loops covering regions or continents it is not.

Instead of height differences, ''geopotential differences'' do close around loops:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n \Delta h_i g_i, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; stands for gravity at the leveling interval ''i''. For precise leveling networks on a national scale, the latter formula should always be used.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta W_i = \Delta h_i g_i\ &lt;/math&gt;

should be used in all computations, producing geopotential values &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; for the [[benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]]s of the network.

===Older instruments===

[[File:SAM PC 1 - Levelling instrument Kern+Co. 1890.jpg|thumb|A "Y" level. The telescope can be removed and reversed or rotated to remove errors.]] The wye level is the oldest and bulkiest of the older style optical instruments. A low-powered telescope is placed in a pair of clamp mounts, and the instrument then leveled using a [[spirit level]], which is mounted parallel to the main telescope.

The [[dumpy level]] was developed by English civil engineer [[William Gravatt]], while surveying the route of a proposed railway line from London to Dover. More compact and hence both more robust and easier to transport, it is commonly believed that dumpy levelling is less accurate than other types of levelling, but such is not the case. Dumpy levelling requires shorter and therefore more numerous sights, but this fault is compensated by the practice of making foresights and backsights equal.

Precise level designs were often used for large leveling projects where utmost accuracy was required. They differ from other levels in having a very precise spirit level tube and a micrometer adjustment to raise or lower the line of sight so that the crosshair can be made to coincide with a line on the rod scale and no interpolation is required.

===Automatic level===
Automatic levels make use of a compensator that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Three level screws are used to level the instrument.

===Laser level===

This style is widely used in construction work but not for more precise control work. An advantage is that one person can perform the levelling independently, whereas other types require one person at the instrument and one holding the rod.

The sensor can be mounted on earth-moving machinery to allow automated grading.

'''Local coordinates''' are measurement indices into a ''local [[coordinate system]]'' or a ''local [[coordinate space]]''. A simple example is using house numbers to locate a [[house]] on a [[street]]; the street is a local coordinate system within a larger system composed of city townships, states, countries, etc.

Local systems exist for convenience. Continuing the geographic example, one could use [[latitude and longitude]] for all terrestrial locations, but unless one has a highly precise [[GPS]] device, this is impractical.

In [[computer graphics]] and [[computer animation]], local coordinate spaces are also useful for their ability to model independently transformable aspects of geometrical [[scene graph]]s. When modeling a car, for example, it is desirable to describe the center of each wheel with respect to the car's coordinate system, but then specify the shape of each wheel in separate local spaces centered about these points. This way, the information describing each wheel can be simply duplicated four times, and independent transformations (e.g., steering rotation) can be similarly effected. Bounding volumes of objects may be described more accurately using extents in the local coordinates, (i.e. an [[object oriented bounding box]], contrasted with the simpler [[axis aligned bounding box]]).

The tradeoff for this flexibility is additional computational cost: the rendering system must access the higher-level coordinate system of the car and combine it with the space of each wheel in order to draw everything in its proper place.

Local coordinates also afford digital designers a means around the finite limits of numerical representation. The [[tread marks]] on a tire, for example, can be described using millimetres by allowing the whole tire to occupy the entire range of numeric precision available. The larger aspects of the car, such as its frame, might be described in centimetres, and the terrain that the car travels on could be specified in meters.

In [[differential topology]], local coordinates on a [[manifold]] are defined by means of an [[atlas (topology)|atlas of charts]]. The basic idea behind coordinate charts is that each small patch of a manifold can be endowed with a set of local coordinates. These are collected together into an atlas, and stitched together in such a way that they are self-consistent on the manifold.

The '''modified compression field theory''' (MCFT) is a general model for the load-deformation behaviour of two-dimensional cracked [[reinforced concrete]] subjected to shear. It models concrete considering concrete stresses in principal directions summed with reinforcing stresses assumed to be only axial. The concrete stress-strain behaviour was derived originally from Vecchio's tests and has since been confirmed with about 250 experiments performed on two large special purpose testing machines at the [[University of Toronto]]. Similar machines have been built in Japan and the United States, providing additional confirmation of the quality of the method's predictions.

The most important assumption in the MCFT model is that the cracked concrete in reinforced concrete can be treated as a new material with empirically defined [[Stress–strain curve|stress–strain]] behaviour. This behaviour can differ from the traditional stress–strain curve of a cylinder, for example. The strains used for these stress–strain relationships are average strains, that is, they lump together the combined effects of local strains at cracks, strains between cracks, bond-slip, and crack slip. The calculated stresses are also average stresses in that they implicitly include stresses between cracks, stresses at cracks, interface shear on cracks, and dowel action. For the use of these average stresses and strains to be a reasonable assumption, the distances used in determining the average behaviour must include a few cracks.

==History==
Frank J. Vecchio defined the original form of MCFT in 1982 from the testing of 30 reinforced concrete panels subjected to uniform strain states in a specially built tester. The theory of MCFT traces back through the compression field theory of 1978 to the Diagonal compression Field Theory of 1974. The definitive description of the MCFT is in the 1986 [[American Concrete Institute]] paper "The Modified Compression Field Theory for Reinforced Concrete Elements Subjected to Shear".

An '''obscene phone call''', as the term is commonly used, is an unsolicited [[telephone]] call where a person derives [[sexual pleasure]] by using sexual or foul language to someone, who may be known to them or who may be a complete stranger.  (There are many varieties of consensual sexual phone calls.) Making [[obscene]] telephone calls for sexual pleasure is known as ''telephone scatologia'' and is considered a form of [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Dalby, J.

Generally, unwilling recipients of obscene phone calls are advised to simply hang up on obscene callers, and to report the incident to the telephone company and/or the police.  Even when [[Caller ID]] is not shown, calls are logged by the telephone company, so the perpetrator's phone number can be discovered. However, many people who regularly engage in obscene phone calls use [[payphones]] or prepaid [[Mobile phone|cell phones]], and in these cases, a more extensive investigation is necessary.

The demographic that most commonly commits obscene phone calls ranges from the age of 12 to 16 years, with an average of 14 years of age.{{cn|date=August 2016}} Often they are emotionally or behaviorally maladjusted and have shown previous signs of [[sexual abuse]], as well as having already committed sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Saunders, E.

==Etymology==
"Paraprosdokian" comes from the Greek "[[wikt:παρά|παρά]]", meaning "against" and "[[wikt:προσδοκία|προσδοκία]]", meaning "expectation". The term "prosdokia" ("expectation") occurs with the preposition "para" in Greek rhetorical writers of the 1st century BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, with the meaning "contrary to expectation" or "unexpectedly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Demetrius On Style, The Greek text of Demetrius De Elocutione |authorlink=Demetrius of Phalerum |author=Demetrius |editor=Roberts, W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23023">In astronomy a '''phase curve''' describes the brightness of a reflecting body as a function of its [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]]. The brightness usually refers the object's [[absolute magnitude]], which, in turn, is its [[apparent magnitude]] at a distance of one [[astronomical unit]] from the Earth and Sun. The [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] equals the arc subtended by the observer and the sun as measured at the body.

The phase curve is useful for characterizing an object's [[regolith]] (soil) and atmosphere. It is also the basis for computing the [[geometrical albedo]] and the [[Bond albedo]] of the body. In [[ephemeris]] generation, the phase curve is used in conjunction with the distances from the object to the Sun and the Earth to calculate the apparent magnitude.

==Mercury==

[[File:Mercury Phase Curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and its opposition surge.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

The phase curve of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is very steep, which is characteristic of a body on which bare [[regolith]] (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° ([[crescent]] phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the phase curve indicates a mean slope on the surface of Mercury of about 16°,&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; which is slightly smoother than that of the [[Moon]]. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to a sharp peak. This surge in brightness is called the [[opposition effect]]&lt;ref Name="Shkuratov"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Helfenstein"/&gt; because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;

Early visual observations contributing to the phase curve of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; in the 1800s and by [[André-Louis Danjon]]&lt;ref name="Danjon1949"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danjon1950"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danjon1953"/&gt; in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues&lt;ref name="IrvineIII"/&gt; used photoelectric photometry in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs,&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1970"/&gt; summarized by D. Harris&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton1992"/&gt; for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering the widest range of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; using the [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO)]] on the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)]] satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now the major source of the phase curve used in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton2005"/&gt; for predicting apparent magnitudes.

The apparent brightness of Mercury as seen from Earth is greatest at phase angle 0° ([[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]] with the Sun) when it can reach magnitude −2.6.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; At phase angles approaching 180° ([[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]]) the planet fades to about magnitude +5&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; with the exact brightness depending on the phase angle at that particular [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]]. This difference of more than 7 magnitudes corresponds to a change of over a thousand times in apparent brightness.

==Venus==

[[File:Venus Phase Curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Venus&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus"/&gt; compared to Mercury,&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; and the brightness excess of Venus.]]

The relatively flat phase curve of [[Venus]] is characteristic of a cloudy planet.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, as opposed to the narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin [[crescent]], due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of [[sulfuric acid]] that are above the planet's cloud tops.&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus"/&gt; Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.

The history of observation and analysis of the phase curve of Venus is similar to that of Mercury. The best set of modern observations and interpretation was reported by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard.&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus" /&gt; They used the [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]] instrument on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and ground-based, CCD equipment to observe the phase curve from 2 to 179°. As with Mercury, these new data are the major source of the phase curve used in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton2005"/&gt; for predicting apparent magnitudes.

In contrast to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus as seen from Earth does not occur at phase angle zero. Since the phase curve of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at phase angle 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; Near [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]] the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The typical range in apparent brightness for Venus over the course of one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury.

==Earth==

The phase curve of the [[Earth]] has not been determined as accurately as those for Mercury and Venus because its integrated brightness is difficult to measure from the surface. Instead of direct observation, [[earthshine]] reflected from the portion of the Moon not lit by the Sun has served as a proxy. A few direct measurements of the Earth's luminosity have been obtained with the [[EPOXI]] spacecraft. While they do not cover much of the phase curve they reveal a rotational light curve caused by the transit of dark oceans and bright land masses across the hemisphere. P. Goode and colleagues at [[Big Bear Solar Observatory]] have measured the earthshine&lt;ref Name="Goode"/&gt; and T. Livengood of NASA analyzed the EPOXI data.&lt;ref Name="Livengood"/&gt;

Earth as seen from Venus near opposition from the Sun would be extremely bright at magnitude −6. To an observer outside the Earth's orbit on Mars our planet would appear most luminous near the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun, at about magnitude −1.5.

==Mars==

[[File:Mars phase curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Mars&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt; compared to Mercury.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

Only about 50° of the martian phase curve can be observed from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun than our planet. There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the phase curve. R. Schmude&lt;ref Name="Schmude2004"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Schmude2006"/&gt; obtained many of the [[Mars]] brightness measurements used in a comprehensive phase curve analysis performed by A. Mallama.&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt;

Because the orbit of Mars is considerably eccentric its brightness at opposition can range from magnitude −3.0 to −1.4.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; The minimum brightness is about magnitude +1.6&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; when Mars is on the opposite site of the Sun from the Earth. Rotational variations can elevate or suppress the brightness of Mars by 5% and global dust storms can increase its luminosity by 25%.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt;

==Gas giants==

The outermost planets ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) are so distant that only small portions of their phase curves near 0° (full phase) can be evaluated from the Earth. That part of the curve is generally fairly flat, like that of Venus, for these cloudy planets.

The apparent magnitude of Jupiter ranges from −2.9 to −1.4, Saturn from −0.5 to +1.4, Uranus from +5.3 to +6.0, and Neptune from +7.8 to +8.0. Most of these variations are due to distance. However, the magnitude range for Saturn also depends on its ring system as explained below.

==The rings of Saturn==

[[File:Saturn Phase Curve 2.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Saturn, according to Schmude&lt;ref Name="Schmude2010"/&gt; demonstrating the opposition effect of the ring system.]]

The brightness of the Saturn system depends on the orientation of [[Rings of Saturn|its ring system]]. The rings contribute more to the overall brightness of the system when they are more inclined to the direction of illumination from the Sun and to the view of the observer. Wide open rings contribute about one magnitude of brightness to the disk alone.&lt;ref Name="MallamaSky"/&gt; The icy particles that compose the rings also produce a strong opposition surge. Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini spacecraft images have been analyzed in an attempt to characterize the ring particles based on their phase curves.&lt;ref Name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Poulet"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Cuzzi"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Salo2010"/&gt;

==The Moon==

[[File:Moon Phase Curve 5.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of the Moon&lt;ref name="CoxMoon"/&gt; compared to Mercury.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

The phase curve of the [[Moon]] approximately resembles that of Mercury due to the similarities of the surfaces and the lack of an atmosphere on either body.&lt;ref name="Warell"/&gt; [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]] spacecraft data analyzed by J. Hillier, B. Buratti and K. Hill&lt;ref Name="Hillier"/&gt; indicate a lunar opposition surge. The Moon's apparent magnitude at full phase is −12.7&lt;ref name="WilliamsMoon"/&gt; while at quarter phase it is 21 percent as bright.&lt;ref name="CoxMoon"/&gt;

==Planetary satellites==

The phase curves of many [[natural satellite]]s of other planets&lt;ref Name="Bauer"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Deau"/&gt; have been observed and interpreted. The icy moons often exhibit opposition brightness surges. This behavior has been used to model their surfaces.

==Asteroids==

The phase curves of many [[asteroid]]s&lt;ref Name="CoxAsteroids"/&gt; have also been observed and they too may exhibit opposition surges. Asteroids can be physically classified in this way.&lt;ref Name="Kaasalainen"/&gt; The effects of rotation can be very large and have to be factored in before the phase curve is computed. An example of such a study is reported by R. Baker and colleagues.&lt;ref Name="Baker"/&gt;

==Exoplanets==

Programs for characterizing planets outside of the solar system depend largely on spectroscopy to identify atmospheric constituents and states, especially those that point to the presence of life forms or which could support life. However, brightness can be measured for very distant Earth-sized objects that are too faint for spectroscopic analysis. A. Mallama&lt;ref name="MallamaExo"/&gt; has demonstrated that phase curve analysis may be a useful tool for identifying planets that are Earth-like. Additionally, J. Bailey&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; has pointed out that phase curve anomalies such as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)#Venus|brightness excess of Venus]] could be useful indicators of atmospheric constituents such as water, which might be essential to [[Extraterrestrial life|life in the universe]].

==Criticisms on phase curve modelling==

Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are frequently based on [[Hapke parameters|Hapke parameterization]]. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein&lt;ref Name="Shepard"/&gt; found no strong evidence that a particular set of [[Hapke parameters]] derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by [[Bruce William Hapke|B. Hapke]] may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.

It is incorporated into almost everything that transmits or receives a [[radio wave]], which includes, but is not limited to, [[mobile phone]]s, [[radio]]s, [[Wi-Fi]], and two-way radios.
RF engineering is a highly specialized field that typically includes the following areas of expertise:
# Design of antenna systems to provide radiative coverage of a specified geographical area by an electromagnetic field or to provide specified sensitivity to an electromagnetic field impinging on the antenna.
# Design of coupling and transmission line structures to transport RF energy without radiation.
# Application of circuit elements and transmission line structures in the design of oscillators, amplifiers, mixers, detectors, combiners, filters, impedance transforming networks and other devices.
# Verification and measurement of performance of radio frequency devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How to Measure Requirement for RF Equipments| url = http://ranatec.com/how-to-measure-requirement-for-rf-equipments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To produce quality results, the RF engineer needs an in-depth knowledge of [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and general [[electronics]] theory as well as specialized training in areas such as wave propagation, impedance transformations, filters and microstrip printed circuit board design to name a few.

==Radio electronics==
''Radio electronics'' is concerned with [[electronics|electronic]] [[electrical network|circuits]] which receive or transmit [[radio]] signals.

Typically, such circuits must operate at [[radio frequency]] and power levels, which imposes special constraints on their design. These constraints increase in their importance with higher frequencies. At [[microwave]] frequencies, the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] of [[signal trace]]s becomes a crucial part of the physical layout of the circuit.

* [[Electronic filter|RF filter]]s
* [[RF shielding]], [[Ground plane]]
* [[PCB layout guidelines]]
* [[DSSS]], [[noise power]]
* [[Digital radio]]

==Duties==

Radio-frequency engineers are specialists in their respective field and can take on many different roles, such as design, installation, and maintenance.  Radio-frequency engineers require many years of extensive experience in the area of study.  This type of engineer has experience with transmission systems, device design, and placement of antennas for optimum performance. 
The RF engineer job description at a [[broadcast]] facility can include maintenance of the station's high-power broadcast transmitters and associated systems. This includes transmitter site emergency power, remote control, main transmission line and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] adjustments, [[microwave radio relay]] [[Studio/transmitter link|STL]]/[[Transmitter/studio link|TSL]] links, and more.

In addition, a radio-frequency design engineer must be able to understand electronic hardware design, circuit board material, antenna radiation, and the effect of interfering frequencies that prevent optimum performance within the piece of equipment being developed.

'''Refeeding syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] consisting of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are [[starvation|starved]], severely [[malnourishment|malnourished]] or metabolically stressed due to severe illness. When too much food and/or liquid nutrition supplement is consumed during the initial four to seven days of refeeding, this triggers synthesis of [[glycogen]], fat and protein in cells, to the detriment of [[serum (blood)|serum (blood)]] concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.&lt;ref name=pmid18583681&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehanna HM, Moledina J, Travis J |title=Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1495–8 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18583681 |pmc=2440847 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a301 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18583681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doig|first=GS|last2=Simpson|first2=F|last3=Heighes|first3=|last4=Bellomo|first4=R|last5=Chesher|first5=D|last6=Caterson|first6=ID|last7=Reade|first7=MC|last8=Harrigan|first8=PWJ|date=2015-12-01|title=Restricted versus continued standard caloric intake during the management of refeeding syndrome in critically ill adults: a randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, single-blind controlled trial|journal=The Lancet Respiratory Medicine|volume=3|issue=12|pages=943–952|doi=10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00418-X|issn=2213-2619|pmid=26597128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac, pulmonary and neurological symptoms can be signs of refeeding syndrome. The low serum minerals, if severe enough, can be fatal.

==Cause==
Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and [[electrolyte]] disorders, especially [[hypophosphatemia]], along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.

During [[fasting]] the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates to fat tissue [[fatty acids]] and [[amino acids]] as the main energy sources. The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving [[red blood cell]]s. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, [[insulin]] secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and [[glucagon]] secretion is increased.&lt;ref name=pmid18583681/&gt;

During refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased [[blood sugar]], resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires [[phosphate]]s, [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[2,3-diphosphoglycerate]] in [[red blood cells]], leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the [[basal metabolic rate]]. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the [[blood serum|serum]] electrolytes, including [[phosphorus]] and [[magnesium]]. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; vitamin [[thiamine]] may fall. [[Arrhythmia|Abnormal heart rhythms]] are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, [[coma]] and convulsions and [[cardiac failure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for [[anorexia nervosa]] when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webb GJ, Smith K, Thursby-Pelham F, Smith T, Stroud MA, Da Silva AN |title=Complications of emergency refeeding in anorexia nervosa: case series and review |journal=Acute Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=69–76 |year=2011 |pmid=22041604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery. The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.

==Diagnosis==
Refeeding syndrome can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are required in order to make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the refeeding syndrome can occur within the first few days of refeeding.  Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period. 

==Treatment==
In critically ill patients admitted to an [[intensive care unit]], if [[phosphate]] drops to below 0.65&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced. Prescribing [[thiamine]], [[vitamin B]] complex (strong) and a [[multivitamin|multivitamin and mineral preparation]] is recommended. Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable. Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care, it is commonly recommended that [[Energy balance (biology)|energy intake]] should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3–5 days of treatment of refeeding syndrome.

See NICE Clinical guideline CG32, section 6.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition support in adults: oral nutrition support, enteral tube feeding and parenteral nutrition. Full guideline [NICE. Clinical guideline CG32]|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/evidence|website=National Institute for Clinical Excellence|accessdate=April 26, 2017|date=2006–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On first aid and preliminary medical management, see for example the guidance by [[HMS Monmouth (F235)|HMS Monmouth]] medical officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeffery SM, Freshwater DA |title=Management of starvation in a Role 1 setting |journal=Journal of the Royal Naval Medical Service |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=9–15 |year=2012 |pmid=22558735}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
A common error, repeated in multiple papers, is that "The syndrome was first 
described after [[World War II]] in Americans who, held by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] as [[prisoners of war#World War II|prisoners of war]], had become malnourished during captivity and who were then released to the care of United States personnel in the [[Philippines]]."&lt;ref name="pmid14847450"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1951|title=A clinical study of malnutrition in Japanese prisoners of war|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–96|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-35-1-69|pmid=14847450|vauthors=Schnitker MA, Mattman PE, Bliss TL|url=https://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=35&amp;issue=1&amp;page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, closer inspection of the 1951 paper by Schnitker reveals the prisoners under study were not American POWs but Japanese soldiers who, already malnourished, surrendered in the Philippines during 1945, after the war was over. 

It is difficult to ascertain when the syndrome was first discovered and named, but it is likely the associated electrolyte disturbances were identified well before 1951, perhaps in Holland during the closing months of World War II, before Victory Day in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=BSandstead|first2=HR|last3=Drummond|first3=J|date=1945|title=Starvation in Western Holland: 1945.|journal=Lancet|volume=246|pages=282–83.|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(45)90738-0|last1=Burger|first1=GCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also anecdotal eyewitness reports from a still earlier time of Polish prisoners in Iran who were freed from Soviet camps in 1941–1942 under an amnesty to form an army under General Anders and were given food whilst in a state of starvation which caused many to die.&lt;ref&gt;Many of these deaths were due to dysentry, typhoid and other diseases but this was largely amongst the civilian evacuees from Poland.  Clear eyewitness reports identify eating too much as a cause.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Historian Flavius [[Josephus]] writing in first century the described classic symptoms of the syndrome among survivors of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege of Jerusalem]]. He described the death of those who over indulged in food after famine, whereas those who ate a more restrained pace survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm#link52HCH0013|title=The Wars of the Jews by Flavius Josephus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.org|page=book V, chapter XIII, paragraph 4|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 5th century BCE work 'On Fleshes' (De Carnibus), [[Hippocrates]] writes, "if a person goes
seven days without eating or drinking anything, in this period most die; but there are some who survive that time
but still die, and others are persuaded not to starve themselves to death but to eat and drink: however, the cavity
no longer admits anything because the jejunum (nêstis) has grown together in that many days, and these people
too die." Though [[Hippocrates]] misidentifies the exact cause of death, this passage likely represents an early description of Refeeding Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates of Kos. De Carnibus. 5th century BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1155">In [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]], a '''segregate''', or a '''segregate taxon''' is created when a [[taxon]] is split off from another taxon. This other taxon will be better known, usually bigger, and will continue to exist, even after the segregate taxon has been split off. A segregate will be either new or ephemeral: there is a tendency for taxonomists to disagree on segregates, and later workers often reunite a segregate with the 'mother' taxon. 

If a segregate is generally accepted as a 'good' taxon it ceases to be a segregate. Thus, this is a way of indicating change in the taxonomic status.  It should not be confused with, for example, the subdivision of a genus into [[subgenus|subgenera]].

:For example, the genus ''[[Alsobia]]'' is a ''segregate'' from the genus ''[[Episcia]]''; The genera ''[[Filipendula]]'' and ''[[Aruncus]]'' are segregates from the genus ''[[Spiraea]]''.

{{merge|Reflections of signals on conducting lines |discuss=Talk:Talk:Signal reflection#On merging|date=October 2018}}
'''Signal reflection''' occurs when a signal is transmitted along a transmission medium, such as a [[reflections of signals on conducting lines|copper cable]] or an [[optical fiber]]. Some of the signal power may be reflected back to its origin rather than being carried all the way along the cable to the far end. This happens because imperfections in the cable cause [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatches and non-linear changes in the cable characteristics. These abrupt changes in characteristics cause some of the transmitted signal to be reflected. In [[radio frequency]] (RF) practice this is often measured in a dimensionless ratio known as [[voltage standing wave ratio]] (VSWR) with a VSWR bridge.  The ratio of energy bounced back depends on the [[Impedance matching|impedance mismatch]].  Mathematically, it is defined using the [[reflection coefficient]].

Because the principles are the same, this concept is perhaps easiest to understand when considering an optical fiber. Imperfections in the glass create mirrors that reflect the light back along the fiber.

Impedance discontinuities cause [[attenuation]], [[attenuation distortion]], [[standing waves]], [[ringing (signal)|ringing]] and other effects because a portion of a transmitted signal will be reflected back to the [[transmitter|transmitting]] device rather than continuing to the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]], much like an [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]. This effect is compounded if multiple discontinuities cause additional portions of the remaining signal to be reflected back to the transmitter. This is a fundamental problem with the [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] method of connecting electronic components. 

When a returning reflection strikes another discontinuity, some of the signal rebounds in the original signal direction, creating multiple echo effects.  These [[forward echo]]es strike the receiver at different intervals making it difficult for the receiver to accurately detect data values on the signal. The effects can resemble those of [[jitter]].

[[File:Megger Time-Domain Reflectometer MTDR1.jpg|thumb|[[Time-domain reflectometer]] for electrical [[Electrical cable|cable]] fault detection]]
Because damage to the cable can cause reflections, an instrument called an electrical [[time-domain reflectometer]] (ETDR; for electrical cables) or an [[optical time-domain reflectometer]] (OTDR; for optical cables) can be used to locate the damaged part of a cable. These instruments work by sending a short pulsed signal into the cable and measuring how long the reflection takes to return.  If only reflection magnitudes are desired, however, and exact fault locations are not required, VSWR bridges perform a similar but lesser function for [[Radio frequency|RF cables]].

The combination of the effects of signal attenuation and impedance discontinuities on a [[communications link]] is called [[insertion loss]]. Proper network operation depends on constant [[characteristic impedance]] in all cables and connectors, with no impedance discontinuities in the entire cable system.  When a sufficient degree of [[impedance matching]] is not practical, [[echo suppressor]]s or [[echo canceller]]s, or both, can sometimes reduce the problems.

The [[Bergeron Diagram]] method, valid for both linear and non-linear models, evaluates the reflection's effects in an electric line.

'''Social impact entertainment''' ('''SIE''') is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value.

The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of [[Entertainment-education]] which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/entertainment-education/|title=Entertainment-Education|date=2012-10-24|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "[[Impact producer|Impact Producers]]" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building.

[[Cinema of Change]] reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/the-cinema-of-change-ecosystem/|title=The Cinema of Change EcosystemThe Cinema of Change Ecosystem - Cinema of Change|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable being [[Participant Media]] due to its $100 million+ funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jmkdbrhlfK8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Tech Billionaires: Reshaping Philanthropy in a Quest for a Better World|last=Solomon|first=Lewis D.|date=2011-12-31|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412813747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Norman Lear Center]] and [[UCLA TFT]]'s Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.

'''Solar radiation management''' (SRM) projects are a type of [[climate engineering]] which seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce [[global warming]]. Proposed methods include increasing the planetary [[albedo]], for example using [[stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]]. Restorative methods have been proposed regarding the protection of natural heat reflectors like sea ice, snow and glaciers with engineering projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desch|first1=Steven J.|last2=et al|title=Arctic Ice Management|journal=Earth's Future|date=19 December 2016|doi=10.1002/2016EF000410|volume=5|issue=1|pages=107–127|bibcode=2017EaFut...5..107D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGlynn|first1=Daniel|title=One big reflective band-aid|url=https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2017/01/one-big-reflective-band-aid|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Berkley Engineering|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=A Radical New Scheme to Prevent Catastrophic Sea-Level Rise|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/a-new-geo-engineering-proposal-to-stop-sea-level-rise/550214|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their principal advantages as an approach to climate engineering is the speed with which they can be deployed and become fully active, their potential low financial cost, and the reversibility of their direct climatic effects.

Solar radiation management projects could serve as a temporary response while levels of greenhouse gases can be brought under control by [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[greenhouse gas removal]] techniques. They would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and thus do not address problems such as [[ocean acidification]] caused by excess [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Purpose==
Climate engineering projects have been proposed in order to reduce [[global warming]]. As early as 1974, Russian expert [[Mikhail Budyko]] suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. The annual cost of delivering a sufficient amount of sulfur to counteract expected greenhouse warming is estimated at 2 to 8 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClellan|first1=Justin|last2=Keith|first2=David W.|last3=Apt|first3=Jay|title=Cost analysis of stratospheric albedo modification delivery systems|issue=3|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034019#erl427423s6|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=7|pages=034019|language=en|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034019|date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preliminary study by [[Edward Teller]] and others in 1997 presented the pros and cons of various relatively "low-tech" proposals to mitigate global warming through scattering/reflecting sunlight away from the Earth via insertion of various materials in the upper stratosphere, low earth orbit, and {{L1}} locations.&lt;ref name="Teller1997"&gt;{{Cite journal

See pages 10-14 in particular. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By modifying the albedo of the Earth's surface, or by preventing sunlight reaching the Earth by using a [[solar shade]], the sun's warming effect can be cancelled out—although the cancellation is imperfect, with regional discrepancies remaining.&lt;ref name="royal_society"&gt;{{cite book

SRM or albedo modification, is considered to be a potential option for addressing [[climate change]]. As the [[National Academy of Sciences]] states in its 2015 report: "The two main options for responding to the risks of climate change involve mitigation—reducing and eventually eliminating human-caused emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)—and adaptation—reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems to changes in climate. A third potentially viable option, currently under development but not yet widely deployed, is [[carbon dioxide removal]] (CDR) from the atmosphere accompanied by reliable sequestration. A fourth, more speculative family of approaches called albedo modification seeks to offset climate warming by greenhouse gases by increasing the amount of sunlight reflected back to space."&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-11|isbn = 9780309314824|date = 2015-02-10|last1 = Council|first1 = National Research|last2 = Impacts|first2 = Committee on Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation Discussion of|last3 = Division On Earth And Life Studies|first3 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last4 = Ocean Studies Board|first4 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last5 = Climate|first5 = Board on Atmospheric Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, solar radiation management is widely viewed as a complement, not a substitute, to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. As The Royal Society concluded in its 2009 report: "Geoengineering methods are not a substitute for climate change mitigation, and should only be considered as part of a wider package of options for addressing climate change."&lt;ref name="The Royal Society"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or put another way: "The safest and most predictable method of moderating climate change is to take early and effective action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. No geoengineering method can provide an easy or readily acceptable alternative solution to the problem of climate change. Geoengineering methods could, however, potentially be useful in future to augment continuing efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions, and so should be subject to more detailed research and analysis."&lt;ref name="The Royal Society" /&gt;

By intentionally changing the Earth's [[albedo]], or reflectivity, scientists propose that we could reflect more heat back out into space. We could also intercept sunlight before it reaches the Earth through a literal shade built in space. The effects are uncertain but it has been suggested that 2% albedo increase would roughly halve the effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doubling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Academy of Sciences]] describes several of the potential benefits and risks of solar radiation management: "Modeling studies have shown that large amounts of cooling, equivalent in scale to the predicted warming due to doubling the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere, can be produced by the introduction of tens of millions of tons of aerosols into the stratosphere. ... Preliminary modeling results suggest that albedo modification may be able to counter many of the damaging effects of high greenhouse gas concentrations on temperature and the hydrological cycle and reduce some impacts to sea ice. Models also strongly suggest that the benefits and risks will not be uniformly distributed around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-14|isbn = 9780309314824|date = 2015-02-10|last1 = Council|first1 = National Research|last2 = Impacts|first2 = Committee on Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation Discussion of|last3 = Division On Earth And Life Studies|first3 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last4 = Ocean Studies Board|first4 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last5 = Climate|first5 = Board on Atmospheric Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicability of many techniques listed here has not been comprehensively tested. Even if the effects in computer simulation models or of small-scale interventions are known, there may be cumulative problems such as [[ozone depletion]], which become apparent only from large-scale experiments.&lt;ref name = hacking&gt;{{cite journal

Various small-scale experiments have been carried out on techniques such as [[cloud seeding]], increasing the volume of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and implementing [[cool roof]] technology.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

SRM has been suggested to control regional climate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = D. N. | last2 = Neelin | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Li | first3 = Q.

SRM projects could, for example, be used as a temporary response while levels of greenhouse gases can be brought under control{{according to whom|date=March 2017}} by greenhouse gas remediation techniques but would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and thus not address problems such as [[ocean acidification]] caused by excess [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Advantages ==
Solar radiation management has certain advantages relative to emissions cuts, adaptation, and carbon dioxide removal. Its effect of counteracting climate change would be experienced very rapidly, on the order of months after implementation,&lt;ref name="nap.edu" /&gt; whereas the effects of emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal are delayed because the [[Climate inertia|climate change that they prevent is itself delayed]]. Some proposed solar radiation management techniques are expected to have very low direct financial costs of implementation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moriyama|first=Ryo|last2=Sugiyama|first2=Masahiro|last3=Kurosawa|first3=Atsushi|last4=Masuda|first4=Kooiti|last5=Tsuzuki|first5=Kazuhiro|last6=Ishimoto|first6=Yuki|date=2016-09-08|title=The cost of stratospheric climate engineering revisited|journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change|volume=22|issue=8|language=en|pages=1207–1228|doi=10.1007/s11027-016-9723-y|issn=1381-2386}}&lt;/ref&gt; relative to the expected costs of both unabated climate change and aggressive mitigation. This creates a different problem structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Scott|date=2008-01-01|title=The Incredible Economics of Geoengineering|journal=Environmental and Resource Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–54|doi=10.1007/s10640-007-9174-8|issn=0924-6460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weitzman|first=Martin L.|date=14 July 2015|title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics|volume=117|issue=4|pages=1049–1068|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:17368469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the provision of emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal present [[collective action problems]] (because ensuring a lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a [[public good]]), a single countries or a handful of countries could implement solar radiation management. Finally, the direct climatic effects of solar radiation management are reversible on short timescales.&lt;ref name="nap.edu" /&gt;

==Limitations and risks==
As well as the imperfect cancellation of the climatic effect of greenhouse gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0103-z|title=A simple model to account for regional inequalities in the effectiveness of solar radiation management|journal=Climatic Change|volume=110|issue=3–4|pages=649|year=2011|last1=Moreno-Cruz|first1=Juan B.|last2=Ricke|first2=Katharine L.|last3=Keith|first3=David W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are other significant problems with solar radiation management as a form of climate engineering. SRM is temporary in its effect, and thus and long-term restoration of the climate would rely on long-term SRM, unless [[carbon dioxide removal]] was subsequently used.

Solar radiation management does not [[Greenhouse gas removal|remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere]] and thus does not reduce other effects from these gases, such as [[ocean acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/wingenter/Wingenter_PeECE_III_GRL_2007.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214164046/http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/wingenter/Wingenter_PeECE_III_GRL_2007.pdf |date=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While not an argument against solar radiation management ''per se'', this is an argument against reliance on climate engineering to the exclusion of greenhouse gas reduction.

=== Control and predictability ===
Most of the information on solar radiation management is from models and computer simulations. The actual results may differ from the predicted effect. The full effects of various solar radiation management proposals are not yet well understood.&lt;ref name="mongabay2007"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0627-planktos.html|title = WWF condemns iron fertilization scheme to fight global warming|publisher = News.mongabay.com|date = December 2012|accessdate = 2012-09-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024114948/http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0627-planktos.html|archivedate = 24 October 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be difficult to predict the ultimate effects of projects,&lt;ref name="Keith Bower 2006, pp. 328"&gt;Keith Bower et al., 2006 Computational assessment of a proposed technique for global warming mitigation via albedo-enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds.

Furthermore, most modeling to date consider the effects of using solar radiation management to fully counteract the increase in global average surface temperature arising from a doubling or a quadrupling of the preindustrial carbon dioxide concentration. Under these assumptions, it overcompensates for the changes in precipitation from climate change. Solar radiation management is more likely to be optimized in a way that balances counteracting changes to temperature and precipitation, to compensate for some portion of climate change, and/or to slow down the rate of climate change.

=== Side effects ===
There may be unintended climatic consequences of solar radiation management, such as significant changes to the [[hydrological cycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1 = G.|last1 = Bala|last2 = Duffy|first2 = B.|last3 = Taylor|first3 = E.|title = Impact of geoengineering schemes on the global hydrological cycle|format = Free full text|journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18505844|volume = 105|issue = 22|pages = 7664–7669|date = June 2008|issn = 0027-8424|pmid = 18505844|pmc = 2409412|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711648105|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.7664B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilmes | first1 = S. | last2 = Fasullo | first2 = J. | last3 = Lamarque | first3 = J.

=== Termination shock ===
If solar radiation management were masking a significant amount of warming and then were to abruptly stop, the climate would rapidly warm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045103|title = Climate engineering and the risk of rapid climate change|year = 2009|last1 = Ross|first1 = A.|last2 = Damon Matthews|first2 = H.|journal = [[Environmental Research Letters]]|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = 045103|bibcode = 2009ERL.....4d5103R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would cause a sudden rise in global temperatures towards levels which would have existed without the use of the climate engineering technique. The rapid rise in temperature may lead to more severe consequences than a gradual rise of the same magnitude.

=== Disagreement ===
Leaders of countries and other actors may disagree as to whether, how, and to what degree solar radiation would be used, which could exacerbate international tensions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Weaponization ===
In 1976, 85 countries signed the U.N. Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.&lt;ref name="benefits_risks_costs2"&gt;[[Alan Robock|Robock, A.]], A. Marquardt, B.

However, this does not eliminate the risk.

These projects seek to modify the atmosphere, either by enhancing naturally occurring stratospheric aerosols, or by using artificial techniques such as reflective [[balloons]].

{{Main|Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)}}
{{See also|Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering}}
Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere is the proposed solar radiation management method that has received the most sustained attention. This technique could give much more than 3.7&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of globally averaged negative forcing,&lt;ref name="atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lenton, T.

Sulfates are the most commonly proposed aerosols for climate engineering, since there is a good natural analogue with (and evidence from) volcanic eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions inject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, which form sulfate aerosol and [[Volcanic winter|cool the planet]].

====Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement====
{{Main|Ocean fertilization}}
Enhancing the natural marine [[sulfur cycle]] by fertilizing a small portion with [[iron]]—typically considered to be a [[greenhouse gas remediation]] method—may also increase the reflection of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing concentrations of CO, CH4, C5H8, CH3Br, CH3I, and dimethyl sulfide during the Southern Ocean Iron Enrichment Experiments|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/23/8537|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2004-06-08|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 423229|pmid = 15173582|pages = 8537–8541|volume = 101|issue = 23|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0402744101|language = en|first = Oliver W.|last = Wingenter|first2 = Karl B.|last2 = Haase|first3 = Peter|last3 = Strutton|first4 = Gernot|last4 = Friederich|first5 = Simone|last5 = Meinardi|first6 = Donald R.|last6 = Blake|first7 = F.

This could potentially be used as regional solar radiation management, to slow [[Antarctic]] ice from melting. Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect.

====Cool roof====
[[File:Roof-albedo.gif|frame|The [[albedo]] of several types of roofs]]
{{Main|Reflective_surfaces_(climate_engineering)}}
Painting roof materials in white or pale colours to reflect solar radiation, known as '[[cool roof]]' technology, is encouraged by legislation in some areas (notably California).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-999-2008-020/CEC-999-2008-020.PDF |title=Global Cooling: Increasing World-wide Urban Albedos to Offset CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |author=Hashem Akbari|year=2008 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is limited in its ultimate effectiveness by the constrained surface area available for treatment. This technique can give between 0.01-0.19&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of globally averaged negative forcing, depending on whether cities or all settlements are so treated.&lt;ref name="atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net"/&gt; This is small relative to the 3.7&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of positive forcing from a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, while in small cases it can be achieved at little or no cost by simply selecting different materials, it can be costly if implemented on a larger scale. A 2009 Royal Society report states that, "the overall cost of a 'white roof method' covering an area of 1% of the land surface (about 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) would be about $300 billion/yr, making this one of the least effective and most expensive methods considered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can reduce the need for [[air conditioning]], which emits CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and contributes to global warming.

However, the effect would be strongly regional, and would not be ideal for controlling [[Arctic shrinkage]], which is one of the most significant problems resulting from global warming. Furthermore, desert albedo modification would be expensive, would compete with other land uses, and would have strongly negative ecological consequences.&lt;ref name="The Royal Society" /&gt; Finally, the total area required during 2010-70 is larger than all non-polar deserts combined.

====Ocean changes====
Oceanic foams have also been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = | doi = 10.3354/cr00885 | pmid =   | last1 = Evans | first1 = J. | last2 = Stride | first2 = E. | last3 = Edirisinghe | first3 = M. | last4 = Andrews | first4 = D. | last5 = Simons | first5 = R. | title = Can oceanic foams limit global warming? | journal = Climate Research | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–160 | year = 2010 | bibcode = 2010ClRes..42..155E }}&lt;/ref&gt; using microscopic bubbles suspended in the upper layers of the [[photic zone]].  A less costly proposal is to simply lengthen and brighten existing ship wakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hand|first1=Eric|title=Could bright, foamy wakes from ocean ships combat global warming?|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/could-bright-foamy-wakes-ocean-ships-combat-global-warming|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ice protection====

Arctic sea ice formation could be increased by pumping deep cooler water to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desch|first1=Steven J.|last2=et al|title=Arctic Ice Management|journal=Earth's Future|date=19 December 2016|doi=10.1002/2016EF000410|volume=5|issue=1|pages=107–127|bibcode=2017EaFut...5..107D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sea ice (and terrestrial) ice can be thickened by increasing albedo with silica spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGlynn|first1=Daniel|title=One big reflective band-aid|url=https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2017/01/one-big-reflective-band-aid|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Berkley Engineering|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaciers flowing into the sea may be stabilized by blocking the flow of warm water to the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=A Radical New Scheme to Prevent Catastrophic Sea-Level Rise|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/a-new-geo-engineering-proposal-to-stop-sea-level-rise/550214|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Forestry ====
[[Reforestation]] in [[tropical]] areas has a cooling effect. [[Deforestation]] of high-[[latitude]] and high-[[altitude]] forests exposes [[snow]] and this increases [[albedo]].&lt;ref name="carbonplanet"&gt;[http://www.carbonplanet.com/downloads/Climate_Effects_of_Forests_Full.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121133842/http://www.carbonplanet.com/downloads/Climate_Effects_of_Forests_Full.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grassland management ====
Changes to grassland have been proposed to increase albedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamwey |first1=Robert M. |title=Active Amplification of the Terrestrial Albedo to Mitigate Climate Change: An Exploratory Study |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/s11027-005-9024-3 |journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change |volume=12 |issue=4 |page=419 |arxiv=physics/0512170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can give 0.64&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of globally averaged negative forcing,&lt;ref name="atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net" /&gt; which is insufficient to offset the 3.7&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of positive forcing from a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but could make a minor contribution.

==== High-albedo crop varieties ====
Selecting or [[genetically modified organism|genetically modifying]] commercial [[crops]] with high albedo has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16428-a-highalbedo-diet-will-chill-the-planet.html |title=A high-albedo diet will chill the planet - environment - 15 January 2009 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, with farmers simply switching from one variety to another. [[Temperate]] areas may experience a 1&amp;nbsp;°C cooling as a result of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tackling Regional Climate Change By Leaf Albedo Bio-geoengineering |journal=Current Biology |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 146–50 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.12.025 |last1= Ridgwell |first1= A |first2= J |first3= A |first4= P |pmid= 19147356 |last2= Singarayer |last3= Hetherington |last4= Valdes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is an example of [[bio-geoengineering]]. This technique can give 0.44&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of globally averaged negative forcing,&lt;ref name="atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net" /&gt; which is insufficient to offset the 3.7&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of positive forcing from a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but could make a minor contribution.

===Space-based ===
Space-based climate engineering projects ([[space sunshade]])s are seen by many commentators and scientists as being very expensive and technically difficult, with the [[Royal Society]] suggesting that "the costs of setting in place such a space-based armada for the relatively short period that SRM geoengineering may be considered applicable (decades rather than centuries) would likely make it uncompetitive with other SRM approaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Space mirrors ====

==== Moon dust ====
Mining moon dust to create a shielding cloud was proposed by Curtis Struck at [[Iowa State University]] in [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol 60, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roger Angel |author2=S. Pete Worden |title=Making Sun-Shades from Moon Dust |journal=National Space Society, Ad Astra |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages= |date=Summer 2006 |url=http://www.nss.org/adastra/volume18/angel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/050627_warming_solution.html |title=Space Ring Could Shade Earth and Stop Global Warming |publisher=LiveScience |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dispersive solutions ====
[[File:Space lens.png|thumb|right|300px|The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. In reality, a 1000 kilometre diameter lens is enough, much smaller than what is shown in the simplified image. In addition, as a [[Fresnel lens]] it would only be a few millimeters thick.]]
Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large [[diffraction grating]] (thin wire mesh) or [[lens (optics)|lens]] in space, perhaps at the [[Inner lagrangian point|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. Using a Fresnel lens in this manner was proposed in 1989 by J. T. Early.&lt;ref name="Early"&gt;{{Cite news |author= J. T. Early |title= Space-Based Solar Shield To Offset Greenhouse Effect |year= 1989 |periodical= Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume= 42 |pages= 567–569 |postscript=. }} This proposal is also discussed in footnote 23 of {{Cite journal |author=Edward Teller |author2=Roderick Hyde |author3= Lowell Wood |title= Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects for Physics-Based Modulation of Global Change |year= 1997 |format= PDF |publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/231636.pdf |accessdate= 21 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a diffraction grating was proposed in 1997 by [[Edward Teller]], [[Lowell Wood]], and Roderick Hyde.&lt;ref name="Teller1997"/&gt; In 2004, physicist and science fiction author [[Gregory Benford]] calculated that a [[concave lens|concave]] rotating [[Fresnel lens]] 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the {{L1}} point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%. He estimated that this would cost around [[United States dollar|US$]]10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] up front, and another $10 billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.&lt;ref name="Benford1"&gt;See [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/4/7/41932/19363 Russell Dovey, "Supervillainy: Astroengineering Global Warming] and [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 Bill Christensen, "Reduce Global Warming by Blocking Sunlight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417153949/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 |date=17 April 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; One issue with implementing such a solution is the need to counteract the effects of the solar wind moving such megastructures out of position.

== Governance ==
Climate engineering poses several challenges in the context of governance because of issues of power and jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="benefits_risks_costs2"/&gt; Climate engineering as a climate change solution differs from other mitigation and adaptation strategies. Unlike a carbon trading system that would be focused on participation from multiple parties along with transparency, monitoring measures and compliance procedures; this is not necessarily required by climate engineering. Bengtsson&lt;ref&gt;Bengtsson, L. (2006) 'Geo-engineering to confine climate change: is it at all feasible?' Climatic Change 77: 229–234&lt;/ref&gt; (2006) argues that "the artificial release of sulphate aerosols is a commitment of at least several hundred years". Yet this is true only if a long-term deployment strategy is adopted. Under a short-term, temporary strategy, implementation would instead be limited to decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nclimate2493| title=A temporary, moderate and responsive scenario for solar geoengineering| journal=Nature Climate Change| volume=5| issue=3| pages=201–206| year=2015| last1=Keith| first1=David W.| last2=MacMartin| first2=Douglas G.|url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/56537/2/nclimate2493-s1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases, however, highlight the importance for a political framework that is sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over such a long period and yet is flexible as the techniques innovate through time. There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, climate engineering has been made into a very political issue. Most discussions and debates are not about which climate engineering technique is better than the other, or which one is more economically and socially feasible. Discussions are broadly on who will have control over the deployment of climate engineering and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. This is especially important due to the regional variability of the effects of many climate engineering techniques, benefiting some countries while damaging others. The challenge posed by climate engineering is not how to get countries to do it. It is to address the fundamental question of who should decide whether and how climate engineering should be attempted – a problem of governance.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, S (2007) Why cooperate? The incentive to supply global public goods. Oxford University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar radiation management raises a number of governance challenges. [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]] argues that the cost is within the realm of small countries, large corporations, or even very wealthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Keith2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://keith.seas.harvard.edu/papers/89.Keith.EngineeringThePlanet.e.pdf|format = PDF|title = Engineering the Planet|author = David Keith|accessdate = 2008-04-08|pages = "3–4,8"}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Victor suggests that climate engineering is within the reach of a lone "Greenfinger," a wealthy individual who takes it upon him or herself to be the "self-appointed protector of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Oxford Review of Economic Policy]]|year = 2008|volume = 24|issue = 2|pages = 322–336|doi = 10.1093/oxrep/grn018|title = On the regulation of geoengineering|author = [[David G. Victor]]|citeseerx = 10.1.1.536.5401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Geoengineering Option|issue = March/April 2009|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/arctic-antarctic/2009-03-01/geoengineering-option|journal = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-11-18|date = March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that a [[rogue state]] threatening solar radiation management may strengthen action on mitigation.&lt;ref name="doi10.1007/s10584-011-0102-0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Millard-Ball|first1 = A.|title = The Tuvalu Syndrome|doi = 10.1007/s10584-011-0102-0|journal = Climatic Change|volume = 110|issue = 3–4|pages = 1047–1066|year = 2011|pmid = |pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and regulatory systems may face a significant challenge in effectively regulating solar radiation management in a manner that allows for an acceptable result for society. There are, however, significant incentives for states to cooperate in choosing a specific climate engineering policy, which make unilateral deployment a rather unlikely event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Stanford J Law Sci Policy|year = 2011|issue = 2|pages = 56–69|title = Geoengineering and the myth of unilateralism: pressures and prospects for international cooperation|author = Joshua Horton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have suggested that building a global agreement on climate engineering deployment will be very difficult, and instead power blocs are likely to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Ricke|first1 = K. L.|last2 = Moreno-Cruz|first2 = J. B.|last3 = Caldeira|first3 = K.|title = Strategic incentives for climate geoengineering coalitions to exclude broad participation|doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014021|journal = Environmental Research Letters|volume = 8|issue = 1|pages = 014021|year = 2013|pmid = |pmc = |bibcode = 2013ERL.....8a4021R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==
There have been a handful of studies into attitudes to and opinions of solar radiation management. These generally find low levels of awareness, uneasiness with the implementation of solar radiation management, cautious support of research, and a preference for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mercer | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Keith | first2 = D. W. | last3 = Sharp | first3 = J. D. | doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/044006 | title = Public understanding of solar radiation management | journal = Environmental Research Letters | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 044006 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2011ERL.....6d4006M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploring public perceptions of stratospheric sulfate injection|journal = Climatic Change|date = 2015-02-10|issn = 0165-0009|pages = 299–312|volume = 130|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10584-014-1317-7|language = en|first = Christine|last = Merk|first2 = Gert|last2 = Pönitzsch|first3 = Carola|last3 = Kniebes|first4 = Katrin|last4 = Rehdanz|first5 = Ulrich|last5 = Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is often the case with public opinions regarding emerging issues, the responses are highly sensitive to the questions' particular wording and context.

One cited objection to implementing a short-term temperature fix is that there might then be less incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions until it caused some other environmental catastrophe, such as a [[Ocean acidification|chemical change in ocean water]] that could be disastrous to [[Marine biology|ocean life]].&lt;ref name="Benford2"&gt;[[Gregory Benford]] (Comments at the [[64th World Science Fiction Convention]], August 2006.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;

Various '''sources of sharia''' are used by [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] to [[elucidate]] the body of [[Islamic]] law.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-islam.org/jurisprudence/ |title=Jurisprudence and its Principles |accessdate=2008-07-26 |last=Mutahhari |first=Morteza |authorlink=Morteza Motahhari |publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source accepted universally by all [[Muslims]] is the [[Qur'an]], the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported [[Sunnah]], but rejected by others; [[Quranism]]. The Qur'an is the [[holy scripture]] of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of [[God in Islam|God]]. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and [[Hadith|quotations]] of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], narrated through his [[Sahabah|Companions]] and the [[Imams]] (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;

As Islamic regulations stated in the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt; According to [[Sunni]] schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are [[Ijma|consensus]], the exact nature of which bears no consensus itself; [[Qiyas|analogical reason]]; pure reason; [[Istislah|seeking]] the [[Maslaha|public interest]]; [[Istihsan|juristic discretion]]; the [[Fatwā|rulings]] of the [[Sahabah|first generation]] of Muslims; and [[urf|local customs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/shariahintroduction.html |title=Shari`ah and Fiqh |accessdate=2008-07-26 |work=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |publisher=University of Southern California |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918043205/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/shariahintroduction.html |archivedate=18 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanafi]] school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] generally use the [[Hadith]] instead. [[Shafi'i]] school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ijtihad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ijtihad-legislation.htm |title=The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation |accessdate=2008-07-26 |last=Motahhari |first=Morteza |authorlink=Morteza Motahhari |publisher=Al-Tawhid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Shia]], [[Usuli]] school of [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the [['aql|intellect]]. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the [[usul al-fiqh|principles of jurisprudence]] as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. [[Akhbari]] Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject [[ijtihad]].&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Momen (1985), p.185–187 and 223–234&lt;/ref&gt; According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Momen (1985), p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary sources==

=== Qur’an ===
{{further|Wikisource:Legislation Verses Of Quran}}
[[File:Opened Qur'an.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of the Qur'an, one of the primary sources of sharia.]]

The Qur'an is the first and most important source of Islamic law. Believed to be the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad through angel [[Jibril|Gabriel]] in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the scripture specifies the moral, philosophical, social, political and [[Islamic economics|economic]] basis on which a society should be constructed. The verses revealed in Mecca deal with [[Islamic philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Islamic theology|theological]] issues, whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio-economic laws. The Qur'an was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad, and compiled soon after his death.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ/&gt;

The verses of the Qur'an are categorized into three fields: "science of speculative theology", "[[Islamic ethics|ethical principles]]" and "rules of human conduct". The third category is directly concerned with Islamic legal matters which contains about five hundred verses or one thirteenth of it. The task of interpreting the Qur'an has led to various opinions and judgments. The interpretations of the verses by Muhammad's companions for Sunnis and [[Shia Imams|Imams]] for Shias are considered the most authentic, since they knew why, where and on what occasion each verse was revealed.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NomaniQ&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sunnah ===
The Sunnah is the next important source, and is commonly defined as "the traditions and customs of Muhammad" or "the words, actions and silent assertions of him". It includes the everyday sayings and utterances of Muhammad, his acts, his tacit consent, and acknowledgments of statements and activities. According to [[Shi'ite]] jurists, the sunnah also includes the words, deeds and acknowledgments of the [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|twelve Imams]] and [[Fatimah]], Muhammad's daughter, who are believed to be [[The Fourteen Infallibles|infallible]].&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NomaniH&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Justification for using the Sunnah as a source of law can be found in the Qur'an. The Qur'an commands Muslims to follow Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|59|7|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Qadri (1986), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the [[Qur'an]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or ''[[sunnah]]'', of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.

Much of the sunnah is recorded in the [[Hadith]]. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As long as he was alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established.&lt;ref name=NomaniH/&gt; Due to problems of authenticity, the [[Science of hadith|science of Hadith]] (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.&lt;ref name="H-EoI"&gt;"Hadith", ''Encyclopedia of Islam.''&lt;/ref&gt;

To establish the authenticity of a particular Hadith or report, it had to be checked by following the chain of transmission (''[[isnad]]''). Thus the reporters had to cite their reference, and their reference's reference all the way back to Muhammad. All the references in the chain had to have a reputation for honesty and possessing a good retentive memory.&lt;ref name=NomaniH/&gt;  Thus biographical analysis (''[[Ilm ar-Rijal|`ilm al-rijāl]]'', lit. "science of people"), which contains details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (''thiqāt'') of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain.&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2000) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of biographical dictionaries include [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]]'s "''[[Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (Asqalani)|Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb]]''" or [[al-Dhahabi]]'s "''[[Tadhkirat al-huffaz|Tadhkirat al-huffāz]]''."&lt;ref&gt;See:
*Robinson (2003) pp. 69–70;
*Lucas (2004) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this criterion, Hadith are classified into three categories:&lt;ref name=NomaniH/&gt;
#Undubitable (''[[mutawatir]]''), which are very widely known, and backed up by numerous references.
#Widespread (''mashhur''), which are widely known, but backed up with few original references.
#Isolated or Single (''wahid''), which are backed up by too few and often discontinuous references.

in a shariah court a qadi (judge ) hears a case, including witnesses and evidence . then the qadi makes a ruling . sometimes the qadi consults a mufti or scholar of law, for an opinion.

==Secondary sources==
All medieval Muslim jurists rejected arbitrary opinion, and instead developed various secondary sources, also known as juristic principles or doctrines{{Clarify|date=September 2008}}, to follow in case the primary sources (i.e. the Qur'an and Sunnah) are silent on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, John (1985). "Legal Logic and Equity in Islamic Law", The American Journal of Comparative Law, '''33''' (1): 63-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consensus===
{{main|Ijma}}
The ''ijma' '', or [[consensus]] amongst Muslim jurists on a particular legal issue, constitutes the third source of Islamic law. Muslim jurists provide many [[Ayah|verses]] of the Qur'an that legitimize ''ijma' '' as a source of legislation.&lt;ref name= Mahmasani&gt;Mahmasani, S. ''Falsafe-e Ghanoongozari dar Eslam''. Tehran: Amir Kabir. pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verses {{cite quran|2|143|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|103|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|110|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|59|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|115|style=ref}} and {{cite quran|9|119|style=ref}} are presented by Mahmasani.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad himself said:
*"My followers will never agree upon an error or what is wrong",
*"God's hand is with the entire community".&lt;ref name = Mahmasani/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslehuddin, M. ''Philosophy of Islamic Law and the Orientalists''. New Delhi: Taj printers, 1986. pg.146&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The principle of ''ijma' '' emerged as soon as Muhammad passed away. Its first notable application was the election of [[Abu Bakr]] as the [[Caliph]]. [[Sunnis]] often regard the election as proof of the effectiveness of ''ijma' ''.&lt;ref name =NomaniI&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=September 2008}}--&gt;In history, it has been the most important factor in defining the meaning of the other sources and thus in formulating the doctrine and practice of the Muslim community.&lt;ref name = britIjma&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Ijma''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is so because ''ijma' '' represents the unanimous agreement of Muslims on a regulation or law at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;"Id̲j̲māʿ", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Sunni Muslims regard ''ijma' '' as the third fundamental source of sharia law, after the divine revelation of the Qur'an, the prophetic practice or Sunnah. The analogical reasoning or qiyas is described as fourth source in Sunni Islam, whereas Shi'a Islam uses 'aql (intellect). Many conservative Muslim writers have claimed that the use of ''ijma' '' makes Islamic law compatible with [[democracy]].--&gt;

There are various views on ''ijma' '' among Muslims. Sunni jurists consider ''ijma' '' as a source, in matters of legislation, as important as the Qur'an and Sunnah. Shiite jurists, however, consider ''ijma' '' as source of secondary importance, and a source that is, unlike the Qur'an and Sunnah, not free from error.&lt;ref name=NomaniI&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ijma' '' was always used to refer to agreement reached in the past, either remote or near.&lt;ref name = britIjma/&gt; Amongst the Sunni jurists there is diversity on who is eligible to participate in ''ijma' '', as shown in the following table:

In modern Muslim usage it is no longer associated with traditional authority and appears as democratic institution and an instrument of reform.&lt;ref name= britIjma/&gt;

===Analogical reason===
{{main|Qiyas}}
''Qiyas'' or analogical reason is the fourth source of the [[sharia]] for the majority of [[Sunni]] jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. [[Shiite]]s do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (''[['Aql|aql]]''); among Sunnis, the [[Hanbali]]tes have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the [[Zahiri]]tes don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]]. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 9–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the practice of ''qiyas'' will often point to passages in the Qur'an that describe an application of a similar process by past Islamic communities. According to supporters of the practice, Muhammad said: "Where there is no revealed injunction, I will judge amongst you according to reason."&lt;ref&gt;Mahmasani, S. ''Falsafe-e Ghanoongozari dar Eslam''. Tehran: Amir Kabir. pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Further, supporters claim that he extended the right to reason to others. Finally, supporters of the practice claim that it is sanctioned by the [[ijma]], or [[consensus]], amongst [[Sahaba|Muhammad's companions]].&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt; Islamic studies scholar [[Bernard G. Weiss]] has pointed out that while analogical reason was accepted as a fourth source of law by later generations, its validity was not a foregone conclusion among earlier Muslim jurists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard G. Weiss]], ''The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi'', pg. 633. [[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the issue of analogical reason and its validity was a controversial one early on, though the practice eventually gained acceptance of the majority of Sunni jurists.

The success and expansion of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, such as those of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Persia]]ns. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between [[Medina]], the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the [[Umayyad dynasty]], the concept of ''qiyas'' was abused by the rulers. The [[Abbasid]]s, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;

The general principle behind the process of ''qiyas'' is based on the understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, [[Islam and alcohol|wine is prohibited in Islam]] because of its intoxicating property. Thus ''qiyas'' leads to the conclusion that all [[intoxicant]]s are forbidden.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;

The [[Hanafi]] [[maddhab|school of thought]] very strongly supports ''qiyas''. [[Imam]] [[Abu Hanifa]], an important practitioner of ''qiyas'', elevated ''qiyas'' to a position of great significance in [[Islamic law]]. Abu Hanifa extended the rigid principle of basing rulings on the Qur'an and Sunnah to incorporate opinion and exercise of free thought by jurists. In order to respond suitably to emerging problems, he based his judgments, like other jurists, on the explicit meanings of primary texts (the Qur'an and sunnah). But, he also considered the "spirit" of Islamic teachings, as well as whether the ruling would be in the interest of the objectives of Islam. Such rulings were based on public interest and the welfare of the Muslim community.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;

{{Rquote|right|The knowledge of ours is an opinion, it is the best we have been able to achieve. He who is able to arrive at different conclusions is entitled to his own opinion as we are entitled to our own.|[[Abu Hanifa]]&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;}}

The [[Shafi'i]] [[maddhab|school of thought]] accepts ''qiyas'' as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, considered it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to ''qiyas''. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the [[Qur'an]] and [[sunnah]]. According to [[Shafi'i]], if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.
&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imam Malik]] accepted ''qiyas'' as a valid source of legislation. For him, if a parallel could be established between the effective cause of a law in the primary sources and a new case, then analogical deduction could be viable tool. Malik, however, went beyond his adherence to "strict analogy" and proposed pronouncements on the basis of what jurists considered was "public good".&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

===Juristic preference===
{{main|istihsan}}
[[Abu Hanifa]] developed a new source known as juristic preference.&lt;ref name= britIstihsan&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Istihsan''&lt;/ref&gt; Juristic preference is defined as:
*A means to seek ease and convenience,
*To adopt tolerance and moderation,
*To over-rule analogical reason, if necessary.&lt;ref name= Histihsan/&gt;

The source, inspired by the principle of conscience, is a last resort if none of the widely accepted sources are applicable to a problem. It involves giving favor to rulings that dispel hardship and bring ease to people.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;  The doctrine was justified directly by the Qur'anic verse stating: "Allah desires you ease and good, not hardship".&lt;ref name=Histihsan&gt;Hasan (2004), p.157–160&lt;/ref&gt; Though its main adherents were Abu Hanifa and his pupils (such as Abu Yusuf), Malik and his students made use of it to some degree. The source was subject to extensive discussion and argumentation,&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, "Considerations on the Function and Character of Sunnī Legal Theory".&lt;/ref&gt; and its opponents claimed that it often departs from the primary sources.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

This doctrine was useful in the [[Islamic world]] outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name=britIstihsan/&gt; One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is [[Najis|contaminated]] it may not be used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.&lt;ref name=Histihsan/&gt;

===Public interest===
Malik developed a tertiary source called ''[[Istislah|al-maslahah al-mursalah]]'', which means that which is in the best interests of the general public. According to this source of Islamic law, rulings can be pronounced in accordance with the "underlying meaning of the revealed text in the light of public interest". In this case, the [[Ulema|jurist]] uses his wisdom to pursue public interest. This source is rejected by the Shafi'ites, Hanbalites and Zahirites from Sunni jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

===Inference===
Shafi'i accepted cases in which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas. Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted ''istidlal'' or [[inference]], a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where no clear precedent could be found. In this case, public interest was distinguished as a basis for [[legislation]].&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

Muslim scholars divided inference into three types. The first is the expression of the connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause. Next, inference could mean presumption that a state of things, which is not proved to have ceased, still continues. The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Hodkinson, Keith. ''Muslim Family Law: A Sourcebook''. [[India]]: [[Routledge]], 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason===
{{main|Ijtihad}}
[[Shi'ite]] jurists maintain that if a solution to a problem can not be found from the primary sources, then ''aql'' or reason should be given free rein to deduce a proper response from the primary sources. The process, whereby rational efforts are made by the jurist to arrive at an appropriate ruling, when applied is called ''ijtihad'' (literally meaning "exerting oneself"). Shi'ite jurists maintain that qiyas is a specific type of ijtihad. The Sunni Shafi' school of thought, however, holds that both qiyas and ijtihad are the same.&lt;ref name =NomaniIj&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p.15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni jurists accepted ijtihad as a mechanism for deducing rulings. They, however, announced an end to its practice during the thirteenth century. The reason for this was that centers of Islamic learning (such as [[Baghdad]], [[Nishapur]], and [[Bukhara]]) had fallen into the hands of the Mongols. Thus, the "doors to ijtihad", were closed.&lt;ref name=NomaniIj/&gt; In Sunni Islam, thus, ijtihad was replaced by ''taqlid'' or the acceptance of doctrines developed previously.&lt;ref name=IjtEI&gt;Ijtihad, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Later in Sunni history, however, there were notable instances of jurists using reason to re-derive law from the first principles. One was [[Ibn Taymiyya]] (d. 728/1328), another was [[Averroes|Ibn Rus̲h̲d]] (Averroes d. 595/1198).&lt;ref name = IjtEI/&gt;

There are many justifications, found in the Qur'an and sunnah, for the use of ijtihad. For example, during a conversation with Mu'ādh ibn Jabal, Muhammad asked the former how he would give judgments. Mu'ādh replied that he would refer first to the Qur'an, then to the Sunnah and finally commit to ijtihad to make his own judgment. Muhammad approved of this.&lt;ref&gt;ʻAlwānī (1973), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawyer who is qualified to use this source is called a ''mujtahid''. The founders of the Sunni [[madhab]]s (schools of law) were considered such lawyers. All ''mujtahid'' exercise at the same time the powers of a ''[[mufti]]'' and can give ''[[fatwa]]''. Some ''mujtahid'' have claimed to be ''muj̲addid'', or "renewer of religion." Such persons are thought to appear in every century. In Shi'ite Islam they are regarded as the spokespersons of the hidden Imam.&lt;ref name=IjtEI/&gt;

===Local custom===
{{main|Urf}}

The term urf, meaning "to know", refers to the customs and practices of a given society. Although this was not formally included in Islamic law,&lt;ref name=UrfEI&gt;"Urf", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; the sharia recognizes customs that prevailed at the time of Muhammad but were not abrogated by the Qur'an or the tradition (called "Divine silence"). Practices later innovated are also justified, since Islamic tradition says what the people, in general, consider good is also considered as such by [[Allah|God]]. According to some sources, urf holds as much authority as ijma (consensus), and more than qiyas (analogical deduction). Urf is the Islamic equivalent of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref name = Urf&gt;Hasan (2004), p. 169–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Local custom was first recognized by Abū Yūsuf (d. 182/798), an early leader of the Ḥanafī school. However, it was considered part of the Sunnah, and not as formal source. Later, al-Sarak̲h̲sī (d. 483/1090) opposed it, holding that custom cannot prevail over a written text.&lt;ref name=UrfEI/&gt;

According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the application of local custom, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars.&lt;ref name=Urf/&gt; Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology''', or '''SCIAA''', was founded in 1963 as a research institute at [[University of South Carolina]] and as a State cultural resource management agency. In the latter capacity, SCIAA is part of the Executive Department of the South Carolina State Government and serves as the main State agency concerned with the State's Archaeology (both [[Prehistoric archaeology|prehistoric]] and historic), and its discovery, study, interpretation, publication, and official conservation at its curatorial facilities. As a University research institute, SCIAA both initiates and conducts a wide spectrum of field investigations and collections research throughout [[South Carolina]]. SCIAA participates in numerous university projects, and is a significant part of the University's infrastructure, and the University's publication series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1411">In [[botany]], a '''staminode''' is an often rudimentary, sterile or abortive [[stamen]], which means that it does not produce [[pollen]].&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; ''A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent''; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Staminodes are frequently inconspicuous and stamen-like, usually occurring at the inner whorl of the flower, but are also sometimes long enough to protrude from the corolla.

[[Image:Staminode 1509.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The arrow points to the hairy staminode of a Grinnell's Penstemon (''Penstemon grinellii'') flower]]

Sometimes, the staminodes are modified to produce [[nectar]], as in the Witch Hazel ''([[Hamamelis]])''.&lt;ref&gt;jin lu mei shu. Hamamelis Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 1: 124. 1753. Flora of China 9: 32. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Staminodes can be a critical characteristic for differentiating between species, for  instance in the orchid genus ''[[Paphiopedilum]]'', and among the [[penstemon]]s.

In the case of [[Canna (plant)|Cannas]], the petals are inconsequential and the staminodes are refined into eye-catching petal-like replacements.

A spectacular example of staminode is given by ''[[Couroupita guianensis]]'', a [[tropical tree]] growing in South America also known as cannonball tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">The '''Wilhelmine Ring''' is the name for a belt of distinctive multi-occupancy rental housing blocks constructed in the second half of the 19th century around the [[Berlin Customs Wall|historic city center]] of [[Berlin]]. It is characterized by a dense settlement pattern with four- to five-story residential buildings with side and rear wings around an inner courtyard. The designation reflects the period of origin of this town planning solution under the German monarchs [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].

==Location==
[[File:Berliner Ringbahn1885.jpg|thumb|left|The railway line around Berlin on a 1885 map. The dark area at center right is the developed part of the city, which was long constricted by the customs wall]]
The Wilhelmine Ring comprises large parts of the Berlin subdistricts [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Friedrichshain]], [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln (locality)|Neukölln]], [[Schöneberg]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], [[Moabit]] and [[Charlottenburg]]. It arose primarily in the still undeveloped area between the [[Berlin Customs Wall]], which was removed in the 1860s, and a [[Berlin Ringbahn|railway line]] constructed between 1867 and 1877 to encircle the city.&lt;ref&gt;Die Stadtbahn in Berlin: Planung, Bau, Auswirkung, Falko Krause, Diplomica Verlag Hamburg 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preconditions and features==
The commencement of large-scale German industrialization in the latter part of the 19th century led to a pressing need for labor, which was met by a strong rural exodus favoring Berlin, where abundant jobs could be found. Living accommodations for this rapid influx of workers were needed in the immediate vicinity of the new factories, for which there was no space within the old city limits.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Bodenschatz, Auf dem Weg zur Mietkasernenstadt?, pp 297-308 in Berlin, 19. Jahrhundert: Ein Metropolen-Kompendium, Roland Berbig et al., Akademie Verlag Berlin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 a large scale incorporation of neighboring settlements had expanded the area of Berlin by some 70 percent. According to census figures, 547,571 people lived in the city in that year. This population almost tripled in the course of the ensuing 30 years, without significant area growth of the city. The planning for the necessary housing was undertaken in 1862 by [[Hobrecht-Plan|James Hobrecht]], whose “Plan for developing the surroundings of Berlin”, as its name indicates, included an area far exceeding the limits of the just-enlarged city. It specified a network of ring and radial streets with relatively large block sizes, which facilitated the rapid construction of large adjoining buildings in which multi-family rental accommodations were planned.&lt;ref&gt;James Hobrecht und Berlin, Hans Stimmann, in 150 Jahre Metropole Berlin,Susanne Kähler et al., Elsengold Verlag Berlin 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berlin-Wedding Postkarte 005.jpg|thumb|Typical Wilhelmine Ring building with shops on the ground floor and apartments in the upper storeys, from a postcard featuring Wedding around 1900]]

A decisive factor was a regulation passed in 1853 by city planning authorities obligating property developers to little more than adhering to a specified street frontage and a minimal size for the inside courtyards of 5.34 × 5.34 meters, at that time the turning circle of city wagons with fire-fighting equipment. Therefore, in the following decades private developers building in the area to be known as the Wilhelmine Ring used each land parcel to the maximum possible extent, filling it with five- to six-story buildings containing many, often very small, [[Tenement#Berlin|rental units]]. Since the developers had to co-finance the street-access infrastructure, with costs calculated on the basis of the width of the street frontage, this part of the building was relatively narrow, the rest being taken up by the side and rear wings. The front apartments were frequently large and spacious and intended for the middle class, containing, particularly in the desirable first upper floor (the ''bel étage'' or ''piano nobile''), decorative stucco ceilings and parquetry flooring and commanding high rents. The rear wing apartments, by contrast, were much smaller and plainer, harder to ventilate, without views, and usually only offering shared toilet facilities in the hallways or courtyard. These back apartments were primarily rented by working-class families, who in turn sublet rooms to supplement their modest income. In the Wilhelmine Ring the population density was over 1000 per hectare. Over 20 percent of the workers were so-called “sleepers-in” without the resources to rent even a single room, renting a bed on an hourly basis in an apartment that was, even without them, frequently very overcrowded.

Only in 1887 did a new regulation impose stricter constraints on property developers. For example, the eaves or lower edge of the roof could not be higher than 22 meters and the number of storeys was limited to five.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Current situation==
Wherever it was not badly destroyed in [[World War II]] the Wilhelmine Ring is still very present in today’s Berlin and a distinctive feature of the city. Although the ring is still characterized by high density construction and a scarcity of open spaces, the flats are popular because of their historic character and nearness to the city center. In the course of urban redevelopment, renovation and modernization, inner courtyards were sometimes expanded by removing rear or side wings. In other cases the size of the rear apartments was considerably increased by combining them into larger units.

'''Zoophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. '''Bestiality''' is [[Cross-species sex|cross-species sexual activity]] between [[human]] and non-human [[animals]]. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).&lt;ref name="ranger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ranger |first1=R. |last2=Fedoroff |first2=P. | year = 2014 | title = Commentary: Zoophilia and the Law | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 421–426 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/4/421.full | pmid = 25492067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sex with animals [[Zoophilia and the law|is not outlawed in some countries]], in most countries, bestiality is illegal under [[cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] laws or laws dealing with [[buggery]] or [[crime against nature|crimes against nature]].

== Terminology ==
===General===
Three key terms commonly used in regards to the subject — ''zoophilia'', ''bestiality'', and ''zoosexuality'' — are often used somewhat interchangeably. Some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (as a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (as sexual acts with animals), because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals.&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt; Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals.&lt;ref name="earls"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107906320201400106 |pmid=11803597 |title=A Case Study of Preferential Bestiality (Zoophilia) |year=2002 |last1=Earls |first1=C. M. |last2=Lalumiere |first2=M. L. |journal=Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some zoophiles report that they have never had sexual contact with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maratea, R. J. | year = 2011 | title = Screwing the pooch: Legitimizing accounts in a zoophilia on-line community | journal = Deviant Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | page = 938 | doi=10.1080/01639625.2010.538356}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with zoophilia are known as "zoophiles", though also sometimes as "zoosexuals", or even very simply "zoos".&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbookth"&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | chapter = Bestiality and Zoophilia: A Discussion of Sexual Contact With Animals | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | editor = Ascione, Frank | author = Beetz, Andrea M. | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zooerasty, [[sodomy]], and zooerastia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=zooerastia definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zooerastia|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are other terms closely related to the subject but are less synonymous with the former terms, and are seldom used. "Bestiosexuality" was discussed briefly by Allen (1979), but never became widely established.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Ernest Bornemann]] (1990, cited by Rosenbauer, 1997) coined the separate term ''[[zoosadism]]'' for those who derive pleasure – sexual or otherwise – from inflicting pain on animals. Zoosadism specifically is one member of the [[Macdonald triad]] of precursors to [[Psychopathy|sociopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=J. M.|title=The Threat to Kill|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1963|volume=120|issue=2|pages=125–30|url=http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=149172|accessdate=19 January 2013|format=PDF|doi=10.1176/ajp.120.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophilia===
The term ''zoophilia'' was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886) by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]], who described a number of cases of "violation of animals (bestiality)",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "zoophilia erotica",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term ''zoophilia'' derives from the combination of two nouns in [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''ζῷον''''' (''zṓion'', meaning "animal") and '''''φιλία''''' (''[[wiktionary:-philia|philia]]'', meaning "(fraternal) love"). In general contemporary usage, the term ''zoophilia'' may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific [[paraphilia]] (''i.e.,'' the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term ''zooerasty'' for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals,&lt;ref name="deviance 391"&gt;D. Richard Laws and William T. O'Donohue: [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=zoophilia+paraphilia Books.Google.co.uk], Sexual Deviance, page 391. [[Guilford Press]], 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-605-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that term has fallen out of general use.

===Zoosexuality===
[[File:Tako to ama retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katsushika Hokusai|Hokusai]]&lt;!--Katsushika is the family name so it is put first, BUT he is called by his given name--&gt;'s (1760–1849) ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]''.]]

The term ''zoosexual'' was proposed by [[Hani Miletski]] in 2002&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt; as a value-neutral term. Usage of ''zoosexual'' as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word – as, for instance, in the phrase "zoosexual act" – may indicate sexual activity between a human and a non-human animal. The derivative noun "zoosexuality" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate [[sexual orientation]] manifesting as romantic or emotional involvement with, or sexual attraction to, non-human animals.&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is zoosexuality|url=http://zoosexuality.org/?id=1|website=Zoosexuality.org|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bestiality===
[[File:日本春宫册页《女人和狗》.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Japanese ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock print]] from [[Kunisada|Utagawa Kunisada]]'s series, "Eight Canine Heroes of the House of Satomi", 1837. ]]
[[File:Indiaerotic5.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An 18th-century Indian miniature depicting women practising zoophilia in the bottom register.]]
The legal term ''bestiality'' has three common pronunciations: {{IPA|[ˌbestʃiˈæləti]}} or {{IPA|[ˌbistʃiˈæləti]}} in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/american/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[ˌbestiˈæləti]}} in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between ''zoophilia'' and ''bestiality'', using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/zoophilia.htm |title=Sexuality.about.com |website=Sexuality.about.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusing the matter yet further, writing in 1962, Masters used the term ''bestialist'' specifically in his discussion of zoosadism.

Stephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Opposed, Say Neigh |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/1999-12-15/news/all-opposed-say-neigh/ |author=Melinda Roth |work=Riverfront Times |date=15 December 1991 |accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]] studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and reported them as understanding the term ''zoophilia'' to involve concern for the animal's welfare, pleasure, and consent, as distinct from the self-labelled zoophiles' concept of "bestialists", whom the zoophiles in their study defined as focused on their own gratification. Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that ''zoophilia'' is a term used by "apologists" for ''bestiality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams CJ, Weinberg MS |title=Zoophilia in men: a study of sexual interest in animals |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=523–35 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14574096 |doi=10.1023/A:1026085410617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of occurrence==
The [[Kinsey report]]s rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms,&lt;ref name="deviance 391" /&gt; but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing [[sampling bias]]. [[Martin Duberman]] has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when [[Paul Gebhard]], Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duberman: [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html KinseyInstitute.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111215816/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html |date=11 January 2009 }}, Kinsey's Urethra ''The Nation,'' 3 November 1997, pp. 40–43. Review of ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life.'' By James H. Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared with 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt's 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1974, cited and re-examined by Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Friday]]'s 1973 book on [[female sexuality]], ''[[My Secret Garden]]'', comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Friday|title=My Secret Garden|publisher=Simon and Schuster|edition=Revised|year=1998|isbn=978-0-671-01987-7|pages=180–185|chapter=What do women fantasize about? The Zoo|origyear=1973|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J9ZKmplu4agC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent).&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1778686 |year=1991 |last1=Alvarez |first1=WA |last2=Freinhar |first2=JP |title=A prevalence study of bestiality (zoophilia) in psychiatric in-patients, medical in-patients, and psychiatric staff |volume=38 |issue=1–4 |pages=45–7 |journal=International Journal of Psychosomatics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |title=Men's erotic fantasies |year=1980 |last1=Crépault |first1=Claude |last2=Couture |first2=Marcel |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |pmid=7458662}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Joyal |first1=C.

{{anchor|Faunoiphilia}}
Sexual arousal from watching animals mate is known as ''faunoiphilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, Anil. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=faunoiphilia&amp;f=false Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices]. CRC Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals [[mating|mate]] is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). [[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality.&lt;ref name="watching"&gt;R.E.L. Masters: ''Forbidden Sexual behavior and Morality.'' New York, NY 1962, Lancer Books, Inc. (Section "Psychical bestiality").&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|Where in the book does it say that?

==Perspectives on zoophilia==
[[File:Franz von Bayros 020.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Art by [[Franz von Bayros]] depicting [[oral sex]] between an adolescent and a [[deer]]]]

=== Research perspectives ===
Zoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: [[Psychology]] (the study of the human [[mind]]), [[sexology]] (a relatively new discipline primarily studying [[human sexuality]]), [[ethology]] (the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]]), and [[anthrozoology]] (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).

The nature of animal minds, animal [[mental process]]es and structures, and animal [[self-awareness]], [[perception]], [[emotion in animals]], and "map of the world", are studied within [[animal cognition]] and also explored within various specialized branches of [[neuroscience]] such as [[neuroethology]].

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5), zoophilia is placed in the classification "other specified paraphilic disorder"&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[paraphilia]]s not otherwise specified" in the DSM-III and IV&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[World Health Organization]] takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its [[ICD]][[ICD-10|-10]] as "other disorder of sexual preference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10, F65.8 Other disorders of sexual preference |website=Who.int |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DSM-5, it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miletski | first1 = H | year = 2015| title = Zoophilia – Implications for Therapy | url = | journal = JSET | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 85–86 | doi=10.1080/01614576.2001.11074387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]]. It may also be touched upon by [[sociology]] which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to [[sexual abuse]] and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within the scope of [[psychiatry]] if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context.
The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself;&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2011.01.004 |title=A new classification of zoophilia |year=2011 |last1=Aggrawal |first1=Anil |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73–8 |pmid=21315301}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

{| valign="top"
|-
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human-animal role-players&lt;li&gt;Romantic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Zoophilic fantasizers&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

|}

Additionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantasizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

Zoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias&lt;ref name="LawsO'Donohue2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. Richard Laws|author2=William T.

Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do not come to the attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.&lt;ref name="Roukema2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard W. Roukema|title=What Every Patient, Family, Friend, and Caregiver Needs to Know About Psychiatry, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t7Mg3iuc9ygC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=zoophilia+other+paraphilias|date=August 13, 2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-750-9|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910. Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002);&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; their research arrived at the following conclusions:

:*Most zoophiles have (or have also had) long term human relationships as well or at the same time as zoosexual ones, and that zoosexual partners are usually dogs and/or horses (Masters, Miletski, Beetz)&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggrawal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anil Aggrawal|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=zoophilia+most+common+animal#PPA258|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=December 22, 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4309-9|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Zoophiles' emotions and care for animals can be real, relational, authentic and (within animals' abilities) reciprocal, and not just a substitute or means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;(Masters, Miletski, Weinberg, Beetz)&lt;/ref&gt; Beetz believes zoophilia is not an inclination which is chosen.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;
:* Society in general at present is considerably misinformed about zoophilia, its stereotypes, and its meaning.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt; The distinction between zoophilia and zoosadism is a critical one to these researchers, and is highlighted by each of these studies. Masters (1962), Miletski (1999) and Weinberg (2003) each comment significantly on the social harm caused by misunderstandings regarding zoophilia: "This destroy[s] the lives of many citizens".&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;

Beetz also states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals – in the form of bestiality or zoophilia – needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law."&lt;ref name="BeetzPodberseck"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony L. Podberscek|author2=Andrea M. Beetz|title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;lpg=PT91&amp;dq=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;pg=PT94#v=onepage&amp;q=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=September 1, 2005|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-0-85785-222-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, research has engaged three further directions – the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] is not present, and can form an affectionate bond.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as [[consent]] beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Balcombe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/29/animalbehaviour.evolution |title=Animals can be happy too |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 May 2012 |location=London |date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on [[criminology|criminological]] reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 Scie-SocialCareOnline.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115133416/http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 |date=15 November 2010 }} Bestiality/Zoophilia: A Scarcely-Investigated Phenomenon Between Crime, Paraphilia, and Love&lt;/ref&gt; As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for [[self-selection]] bias.&lt;ref name="Slade2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W.

Medical research suggests that some zoophiles only become aroused by a specific species (such as horses), some zoophiles become aroused by multiple species (which may or may not include humans), and some zoophiles are not attracted to humans at all.&lt;ref name="earls" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15895645 |year=2005 |last1=Bhatia |first1=MS |last2=Srivastava |first2=S |last3=Sharma |first3=S |title=1.

Instances of this behavior have been found in the Bible.&lt;ref name="aggrawal_2009_16_3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.07.006 |title=References to the paraphilias and sexual crimes in the Bible |year=2009 |last1=Aggrawal |first1=Anil |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=109–14 |pmid=19239958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian [[Val Camonica]] a man is shown about to penetrate an animal.

Several cultures built temples ([[Khajuraho]], India) or other structures ([[Sagaholm]], [[tumulus|barrow]], Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at [[Khajuraho]] these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the Church-oriented culture of the [[Middle Ages]] zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as "both a violation of [[Religion and sexuality|Biblical edicts]] and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal."&lt;ref&gt;Masters (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal. As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], their validity cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref name="BulloughBullough1994"/&gt;

===Religious perspectives===
Passages in [[Leviticus 18]] (Lev 18:23: "And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion." RSV) and 20:15–16 ("If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them." RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the [[New Testament]] have been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Plummer |first=Keith |title=To beast or not to beast: does the law of Christ forbid zoophilia? |year=2001 |url=http://place.asburyseminary.edu/trenpapers/892 |conference=53rd National Conference of the Evangelical Theological Society |location=Colorado Springs, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II of his [[Summa Theologica]], medieval philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranked various "unnatural vices" (sex acts resulting in "venereal pleasure" rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that "the most grievous is the sin of bestiality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas-homo.html Fordham.edu] Aquinas on Unnatural Sex&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian theologians extend [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s view that [[Antithesis of the Law#Adultery|even having thoughts of adultery is sinful]] to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.

There are a few references in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of "Life events" on the exterior of the [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] at [[Khajuraho]]. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;The Critical and Cultural Study of the Shatapatha Brahmana by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture, having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal.&lt;ref name="PodberscekBeetz2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony L. |last1=Podberscek |first2=Andrea M. |last2=Beetz |title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;pg=PT12 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |date=1 September 2005 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-0-85785-222-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some Hindu scriptures, such as the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'', having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Hell]], where one is tormented by having one's body rubbed on trees with razor-sharp thorns.&lt;ref name = "mani"&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 978-0-8426-0822-0|oclc=2198347|pages = 368–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the United Kingdom, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive).&lt;ref name=opsisect63&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63|work=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|title=Section 63 – Possession of extreme pornographic images|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[United Kingdom Ministry of Justice|UK Ministry of Justice]]'s explanatory note on extreme images saying "It is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image.

Laws on zoophilia are sometimes triggered by specific incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Fischer: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222156/http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/122006 Lawmakers hope to outlaw bestiality], 
''Arizona Daily Star,'' 28 March 2006. In Arizona, the motive for legislation was a "spate of recent cases."&lt;/ref&gt; While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as "[[sodomy]]" or "bestiality", which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community. Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community "standards".&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;Posner, Richard, A Guide to America's Sex Laws, The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-226-67564-0}}. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of [[horse-ripping]] incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |title=TheLocal.se |publisher=TheLocal.se |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515124451/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it.

Pornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In the [[United States]], zoophilic pornography would be considered [[obscene]] if it did not meet the standards of the [[Miller Test]] and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).

Similar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.

The potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as "[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 – 1930.

Material featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as [[Playboy]], so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&amp;SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&amp;SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).&lt;/ref&gt;
The promotion of "stars" began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969–72, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was "[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dark Side of Porn Season 2 (2006) - Documentary / TV-Show|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/dark-side-porn-season-2-2006/|website=Crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.

Into the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like "Wilma" and the "Dutch Sisters". In the 1980s, "bestiality" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialità'' in 1976.

Today, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book &amp; Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as "Hector", a [[Great Dane]] starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers. For example, Suzy Spark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Explícito]]'' featured zoophilia.

In the UK [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer ‘Acts of depravity’ found on dad’s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of "extreme" material as a bid for users' attention.

==Health and safety==
{{Main article|Zoonosis}}
Infections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.

==Zoophiles==

=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===
The love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word "zoophilia" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it &lt;ref name="CraigheadNemeroff2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=W. Edward Craighead|editor2=Charles B. Nemeroff|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQMRmyOfpJ8C&amp;dq=zoophilia+meaning&amp;q=zoophilia+meaning#v=snippet&amp;q=zoophilia%20meaning&amp;f=false|date=November 11, 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-27083-6|page=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[paraphilia]]. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.&lt;ref name="Delaney2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Delaney|title=Law and Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjqWw-9ZQfYC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=zoophilia+romantic|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43700-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophile community===
[[File:Zeta toy MMB 01.jpg|thumb|right|Several companies (e.g., Bad Dragon) sell [[dildo]]s in the shape of animal penises, both realistic and fantastical. This one is based on a [[wolf's penis]].]]
An online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread [[computer network]]ing, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to "openly" express their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski, 1999, p .35.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"&gt;Weinberg and Williams&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor&lt;ref&gt;Miletski p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; – along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind&lt;!-- Clarify: Of what kind? Of all internet groups? Or of zoophilia-related internet groups? --&gt; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.&lt;ref&gt;Milteski (1999), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriette, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.&lt;ref&gt;Donofrio, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum "beastforum.com" has more than one million members as of March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |title=Beast Forum statistics |publisher=Big-boards.com |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106122801/http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastforum.com |title=The Worlds Largest Bestiality Board |publisher=BeastForum.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"/&gt;

There also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. There was also a German support group called "Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen ("Zoophile Interest Group").&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:&lt;ref name="browplm2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/2/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 2 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I asked him [a zoophile] when he had his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always interested in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted to make him feel good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.'[...] 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'"&lt;ref name="browplm2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.

=== Arguments against bestiality ===
Bestiality is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK [[Home Office]] review on sexual offences in 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |title=Protecting the Public: Strengthening Protection Against Sex Offenders and Reforming the Laws on Sexual Offences |chapter=Other offences |pages=32–3 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-10-156682-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131205100653/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human;&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt;

An argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and [[Intelligent Design]] proponent at the [[Center for Science and Culture]] of the conservative Christian [[Discovery Institute]]: – "such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe—a concept known as '[[human exceptionalism]]' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind's inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2005/08/bestiality-and-varied-attacks-on-human.html Wesleyjsmith.com] and [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/985pgwjh.asp Weeklystandard.com], 31 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.&lt;ref name=Regan63&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) has said that as animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ Sex Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071214033934/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |date=14 December 2007 }}, NManimalControl.com&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that "bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur." In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that 'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |title=The First Strike Campaign: ANIMAL SEXUAL ABUSE FACT SHEET |website=NManimalControl.com |accessdate=13 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010653/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |archive-date=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2752/089279393787002105 |title=Children Who are Cruel to Animals: A Review of Research and Implications for Developmental Psychopathology |year=1993 |last1=Ascione |first1=Frank R. |journal=Anthrozoös: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions of People and Animals |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=226–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for bestiality ===
[[File:Persian woman with an animal Wellcome L0033282.jpg|thumb|Book illustration depicting dog with woman, [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]], 15th century.]]
Some defenders of bestiality argue that the issue of [[sexual consent]] is irrelevant because many legal human practices (such as [[semen collection]], [[Artificial insemination of livestock and pets|artificial insemination]], hunting, [[animal testing|laboratory testing]], and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 February 2011 by Lucas Wachob |url=http://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/columnists/article_f08fbb0c-42ca-11e0-ab43-00127992bc8b.html |title=Column: In defense of chicken 'lovers' – The Breeze: Columnists |website=Breezejmu.org |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination and slaughter]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the 'right' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty."&lt;ref name="interdis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |title=Inter-disciplinary.net |format=PDF |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722100122/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hani Miletski|Miletski]] believes that "Animals are capable of sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way."&lt;ref&gt;Miltski, 1999, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cauldwell, 1948 &amp; 1968; Queen, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt; Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 1971, and Greenwood, 1963, both cited in Miletski, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans.&lt;ref name="Dekkers, 1994"&gt;Dekkers, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human."&lt;ref name="interdis"/&gt; Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.&lt;ref&gt;(Einsenhaim, 1971, cited in Kathmandu, 2004)"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preference utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosopher and [[Animal rights|animal liberation]] author [[Peter Singer]] argues that bestiality is not unethical so long as it involves no harm or cruelty to the animal&lt;ref name=SingerNerve&gt;Singer, Peter. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080616055314/http://www.nerve.com/Opinions/Singer/heavyPetting/main.asp Heavy Petting], ''Nerve'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Harm principle]]''). In the article "Heavy Petting,"&lt;ref name="Singer01"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pablo Stafforini |url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |title=Utilitarian.com |website=Utilitarian.com |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606173906/http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |archivedate=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer argues that zoosexual activity need not be abusive, and that relationships could form which were mutually enjoyed. Singer and others have argued that people's dislike of bestiality is partly caused by irrational [[speciesism]] and [[anthropocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/isle/isq034 |title=Animal Liberation or Human Redemption: Racism and Speciesism in Toni Morrison's Beloved |year=2010 |last1=Ruetenik |first1=T. |journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=317–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/cul.2010.0020 |first=Colleen Glenney |last=Boggs |date=Fall 2010 |title=American Bestiality: Sex, Animals, and the Construction of Subjectivity |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=76 |issue=76|pages=98–125 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/summary/v076/76.boggs.html |jstor=40925347|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because interspecies sex occurs in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070314-hybrids.html |title=Interspecies Sex: Evolution's Hidden Secret? |website=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because humans ''are'' animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/pwruab/cgi-bin/pwrofthepen/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kerstin-grune1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Changing Perspectives of Bestiality: Breaking the Human-Animal Distinction to Violating Animal  Rights|website=Stanford.edu|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporters argue that zoosexual activity is not "unnatural" and is not intrinsically wrong.&lt;ref name="mroberts"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1328310 |title=The Unjustified Prohibition against Bestiality: Why the Laws in Opposition Can Find No Support under the Harm Principle |year=2009 |last1=Roberts |first1=Michael |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01639625.2010.538356 |title=Screwing the Pooch: Legitimizing Accounts in a Zoophilia On-line Community |year=2011 |last1=Maratea |first1=R.

Some zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way—far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles."&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mentions in the media==
Because of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator ([[OFCOM]]) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/?a=87101 |title=OFCOM Broadcasting Code |website=Ofcom.org.uk |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.

Mention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially adult [[cartoon]] series such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'', [[satire|satirical comedy]] such as ''[[Borat]]'', and films (especially shock [[exploitation film]]s), although a few broadcasters such as [[Howard Stern]] (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and [[Tom Binns]] (whose [[XFM London]] Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In literature, American novelist [[Kurt Vonnegut]] refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'', and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]''. [[Philip K. Dick]] also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in ''[[Flow My Tears The Policeman Said]]''. [[John Irving]]'s novel ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony. In ''[[Clerks II]]'' Randal orders a [[donkey show]] as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as "interspecies erotica" by the male performer.

[[Pu Songling]] refers to zoophilia in the ''[[Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio]]'' short story "[[The Fornicating Dog]]", which talks about sexual relations between a woman and her white dog.
