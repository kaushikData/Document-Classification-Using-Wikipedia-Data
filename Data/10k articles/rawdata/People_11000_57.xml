On 5 September 2009, the ''Ilinden'' [[passenger vessel|sightseeing boat]] with a group of 57 foreign tourists on board, of which 55 were [[Bulgaria]]n, sank in [[Lake Ohrid]], southwestern [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Fifteen people died.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;

Lake Ohrid is the deepest lake in the [[Balkans]], with maximum depth of {{convert|288|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="novinite"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=107541|title=PM: 15 Bulgarians Dead as Boat Sinks in Macedonia Lake|date=2009-09-05|publisher=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ilinden'' boat was taking tourists to the [[Sveti Naum|Saint Naum Monastery]]. The boat, built in 1924,&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?vestID=113380|title= "Илинден" произведен 1924 година|date=2009-09-05|publisher=A1|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a maximum capacity of 45 passengers.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; It sank within four minutes, some {{convert|200|m|-2}} from the shore, in shallow waters. The boat is said to have sunk around 11:00&amp;nbsp;AM local time,&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; in the vicinity of the Elešec camping site. Two other boats, the ''Alexandria'' and the ''Kristina'', were nearby and were able to assist the passengers of the ''Ilinden''. Most of the tourists on board were senior citizens, many of whom were unable to swim. Victims were from [[Pirdop]], [[Zlatitsa]], [[Chelopech]] and particularly [[Anton, Bulgaria|Anton]].&lt;ref name="newsbg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ibox.bg/news/id_410944344|title= Кораб с българи потъна в Охридското езеро|last=Виткова|first=Нора|author2=Ралица Йорданова|date=2009-09-05|publisher=News.bg|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Macedonia's top officials visited the place of the accident. [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] [[Boyko Borisov]] ordered that a Bulgarian government aeroplane bring the surviving Bulgarians back home.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Another aeroplane, a [[Bulgarian Air Force]] [[C-27J Spartan]], transported the corpses of Bulgarian victims.&lt;ref name="newsbg"/&gt; The Minister of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of Macedonia [[Mile Janakievski]] offered his resignation over the accident due to moral reasons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makfax.com.mk/en-us/Details.aspx?itemID=8646  Minister of Transport and Communication resigned]&lt;/ref&gt; which was not accepted by Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2009/09/10/nb-03 Macedonian government refuses to accept Janakievski's resignation].

6 September was declared a [[national day of mourning]] in the Republic of Macedonia. Similarly, 7 September was declared a national day of mourning in Bulgaria and all official events related to the celebration of the [[Bulgarian unification]] on 6 September were cancelled.&lt;ref name="novinite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsbg"/&gt; A minute of silence was observed before Macedonia and Bulgaria's [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers later on 5 September and against Scotland and Montenegro.

A nongovernmental organization, the [[Bulgarian Cultural Club – Skopje]] proposed to Mayor Aleksandar Petreski of Ohrid the erection of a monument commemorating both the victims of the accident and those whose help saved many lives.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Saint Abramios the Recluse''' (290–360) was an early Christian hermit and ascetic from [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]].

==Biography==
Abramios was born in 290&amp;nbsp;AD in [[Edessa]] (modern-day [[Şanlıurfa]], [[Turkey]]). On the day of his wedding, he left his fiancée and went to the coast of the [[Sea of Marmara]], near [[Lampsacus]] (modern-day [[Lapseki]]). There, he lived in a cave and left it only two times: first, when he was ordered to baptise a pagan village; and second, to free his niece Maria from sin. He achieved perfection in hermetic life and was devoted to the God and praying. When his parents died and left him large fortune, he distributed his possessions among the poor. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/10/saint-abramius-recluse-and-his-niece.html/ Saint Abramios the Recluse and his niece, blessed Mary] Retrieved on 15 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 360&amp;nbsp;AD. His feast day is on October 29 (November 11 in Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nycathedral.org/readings.php?dy=2461343/ Thursday of the 22nd week after Pentecost] Retrieved on 15 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Count '''Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексей Григорьевич Орлов}}; {{OldStyleDate|5 October|1737|24 September}}&amp;nbsp;– {{OldStyleDate|5 January|1808|24 December 1807}})&lt;ref&gt;Dates indicated by the letters "O.S." are [[Julian calendar|Old Style]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Russia]]n soldier and statesman, who rose to prominence during the reign of [[Catherine the Great]].

Orlov served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], and through his connections with his brother, became one of the key conspirators in the plot to overthrow [[Peter III of Russia|Tsar Peter III]] and replace him on the Russian throne with his wife, Catherine. The plot, carried out in 1762, was successful, and Peter was imprisoned under Alexei Orlov's guard. He died shortly afterwards in mysterious circumstances, and it was popularly believed Orlov had either ordered, or personally carried out, his murder. Handsomely rewarded by Catherine after her accession, the Orlovs became powerful at court. Alexei was promoted and took part in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74]], commanding a [[Imperial Russian Navy|naval expedition]] to the Mediterranean in 1770, which destroyed the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman fleet]] at the [[Battle of Chesma]]. For his success he was granted the [[Victory title|honorific]] '''Chesmensky'''. The Russian victory sparked off the [[Orlov Revolt]] in the Greek territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]] soon afterwards.

Orlov remained in the Mediterranean, and received the unusual commission of seducing and then capturing [[Princess Tarakanoff]], a pretender to the Russian throne. Orlov was successful in doing so, and tricked her into boarding a Russian ship at [[Livorno]], where she was arrested and transported to Russia. Alexei's brother, Grigory, Catherine's lover before and after the coup took place, fell from favour soon afterwards, and the Orlovs' power at court diminished. Alexei became a renowned breeder of livestock at his estates, developing the horse breed known as the [[Orlov Trotter]] and popularising the [[Orloff (chicken)|Orloff]] breed of chicken. He left Russia after the death of Catherine and the accession of her son, [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I]], but returned after Paul's death and lived in Russia until his death in 1808.

==Family and early life==
Alexei was born into the noble [[Orlov (family)|Orlov]] family in [[Lyubini, Bezhetsky District, Tver Oblast|Lyubini]] in [[Tver Oblast]] on {{OldStyleDate|5 October|1737|24 September}}, the son of Grigory Ivanovich Orlov, governor of [[Novgorod]], and brother of [[Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov]].&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|title=The English Cyclopædia|pages=588–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] and by 1762 had reached the rank of sergeant. He distinguished himself in the [[Seven Years' War]] and was wounded at the [[Battle of Zorndorf]]. He was described as a giant of a man, over two meters tall, and a celebrated duellist, with a scar across his cheek.&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Radzinsky |title=Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar|pages=11–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scar earned him the nickname 'scarface'.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moss|title=A History of Russia: Since 1855|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the 1762 coup==
Together with his brother Grigory, Alexei Orlov became involved in the palace coup to overthrow [[Peter III of Russia|Tsar Peter III]] and place his wife, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], on the Russian throne. In the coup, carried out in July 1762, Alexei went to meet Catherine at the [[Peterhof Palace]], and finding her in bed, announced 'the time has come for you to reign, madame.'&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Black|title=The Chinese Palace at Oranienbaum|pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then drove her to [[St Petersburg]], where the guards regiments there proclaimed their loyalty to her.&lt;ref name="Julicher139"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Julicher|title=Renegades, Rebels and Rogues Under the Tsars|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tsar was arrested and imprisoned at [[Ropsha]], under the guard of Alexei Orlov.&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"/&gt; There Peter died in mysterious circumstances on {{OldStyleDate|17 July|1762|6 July}}. Orlov is popularly supposed to have murdered him, either on his own initiative or on Catherine's orders.&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; One account has Orlov giving him poisoned wine to drink which caused &lt;blockquote&gt;... flames [to course] through his veins. This aroused suspicion in the overthrown emperor and he refused the next glass. But they used force, and he defended himself. In that horrible struggle, in order to stifle his cries, they threw him on the ground and grabbed his throat. But he defended himself with the strength that comes from final desperation, and they tried to avoid wounding him. They placed a rifle strap on the emperor's neck. Alexei Orlov kneeled with both legs on his chest and blocked his breathing. He passed away in their hands.&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Orlov apparently wrote a letter to Catherine after Peter's death, confessing that Peter had been killed in a drunken brawl with one of his jailers, Feodor Bariatynsky, and taking the blame.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Streeter"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Streeter |title=Catherine the Great|pages=41–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Julicher140"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Julicher|title=Renegades, Rebels and Rogues Under the Tsars|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of this letter has been questioned. It was announced that the Tsar had died from an attack of haemorrhoidal colic.&lt;ref name="Streeter"/&gt;

== Service under Catherine II ==
[[File:Graf Orlov Chesmenskiy.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Oval portrait of Alexei Orlov by [[Carl-Ludwig Christinek]], 1779]]
The Orlovs were rewarded after Catherine's accession, and Alexei was promoted to the rank of [[major-general]], and given the title of count. He and his brother received 50,000 roubles and 800 [[serf]]s.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Streeter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julicher142"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Julicher|title=Renegades, Rebels and Rogues Under the Tsars|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lack of formal education and his ignorance of foreign languages, he maintained an interest in science, patronizing [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]], and corresponding with [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Free Economic Society]] and its first elected chairman. Rewarded with large estates, he took an interest in [[horse breeding]], developing the [[Orlov Trotter]], and popularising the breed of chicken now known as the [[Orloff (chicken)|Orloff]].&lt;ref name="Murrell"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murrell|title=Discovering the Moscow Countryside|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tull"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tull|title=Horse Hoeing Husbandry|page=665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became involved in military operations during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-74|Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74]], organising the [[First Archipelago Expedition]], and commanding of a squadron of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. He fought and won the [[Battle of Chesma]] against an Ottoman fleet on 5 July 1770, with the help of British naval expertise, and received the right to add the [[Victory title|honorific]] 'Chesmensky' to his name.&lt;ref name="Papalas"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Papalas|title=Rebels and Radicals|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reynolds|title=Navies in History|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the [[Order of St. George]] First Class. His expedition sparked off the [[Orlov Revolt]] in Greece, which despite initial successes, lacked continued Russian support, and was eventually put down by the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Papalas"/&gt; Orlov was sent as plenipotentiary to the talks at [[Focşani]] in 1772, but his impatience caused the breaking off of negotiations, which led to dissatisfaction from the Empress.

Catherine then commissioned Orlov to make contact with [[Princess Tarakanoff|Yelizaveta Alekseyevna]], a pretender to the throne claiming to be the daughter of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]], and deliver her to Russia.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{Cite book|last=King &amp; Wilson|title=The Resurrection of the Romanovs|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orlov did so by pretending to be a supporter of hers, and successfully seduced her. He then lured her aboard a Russian ship at [[Livorno]] in May 1775, where she was arrested by Admiral [[Samuel Greig]] and taken to Russia, where she was imprisoned and later died.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzarev"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ritzarev|title=Eighteenth-century Russian Music|pages=118–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this service, the Orlovs fell from favour at court, and Alexei and Grigory were dismissed from their positions. Orlov retired to the [[:ru:Нескучное (усадьба)|Sans Ennui Palace]] near Moscow, and gave luxurious balls and dinners, making himself 'the most popular man in Moscow.'&lt;ref name="Tolstoy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tolstoy|title=War and Peace|pages=1321–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Old age ==
After Catherine's death in 1796 the new ruler, [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I]] ordered that his father, Peter III, be reburied in a grand ceremony. Alexei Orlov was ordered to carry the [[Imperial Crown of Russia|Imperial Crown]] in front of the coffin.&lt;ref name="Heinze"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Heinze|title=Baltic Sagas|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orlov was briefly suspected of having been one of the assassins of Paul I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Died |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/32113996 |work= The Evening Post |location= New York |date= 1801-12-14 |access-date= 2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orlov left Russia during the reign of Paul I, but returned to [[Moscow]] after his death and the accession of [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]].&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; Orlov commanded the militia of the fifth district during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] in 1806-7, which was placed on a war footing almost entirely at his own expense.&lt;ref name="Tull"/&gt;

He died in Moscow on {{OldStyleDate|5 January|1808|24 December 1807}}. He left an estate worth five million roubles and 30,000 serfs.&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; His marriage with Eudokia Nikolayevna Lopukhina (contracted on 6 May 1782) produced a daughter, [[Anna Orlova-Tshesmenskaja]] (1785–1848), and a son, Ivan (1786–1787). Eudokia died while giving birth to Ivan in 1786. Orlov also is believed to have had an illegitimate son named Alexander (1763–1820).

'''Alistair Urquhart''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɪ|s|t|ər|_|ˈ|ɜr|k|ər|t}}; 8 September 1919&lt;ref name=survival&gt;[http://www.far-eastern-heroes.org.uk/Alistair_Urquhart/html/survival.htm Survival]. Alistair Urquhart, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; – 7 October 2016) was a Scottish businessman and the author of ''The Forgotten Highlander'', an account of the three and a half years he spent as a [[Prisoner of war#Empire of Japan|Japanese prisoner of war]] during his service in the [[Gordon Highlanders]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]] during the [[Second World War]].

==Military career==

Urquhart was born in [[Aberdeen]] in 1919. He was [[conscript]]ed into the [[British Army]] in 1939, at the age of 19, and served with the [[Gordon Highlanders]] stationed at [[Fort Canning]] in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=sfchron&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/16/BAGD12UGKD.DTL Seeing Pampanito, 64 years after a near death].

''[[The Sunday Times]]'' {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken prisoner when the Japanese invaded the island during the [[Battle of Singapore]], which lasted from December 1941 to February 1942. He was sent to work on the [[Burma Railway]],&lt;ref name=refused&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8534000/8534377.stm The man who refused to die]. Alan Little, 25 February 2010. ''[[The Today Programme]]'', [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; built by the [[Empire of Japan]] to support its forces in the [[Burma Campaign]] and referred to as "Death Railway" because of the tens of thousands of forced labourers who died during its construction. While working on the railway Urquhart suffered [[malnutrition]], [[cholera]] and [[torture]] at the hands of his captors.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;

After working on the railway and in the docks in Singapore, Urquhart was loaded into the hold of the ''[[Kachidoki Maru]]'', an American passenger and cargo ship captured by the Japanese and put to use as a "[[hell ship]]" transporting hundreds of prisoners. The ship was part of a convoy bound for Japan; on the voyage prisoners endured more illness, [[dehydration]], and instances of [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=sfchron /&gt;&lt;ref name=times /&gt; On 12 September 1944, the ship was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by the US submarine [[USS Pampanito|USS ''Pampanito'']],&lt;ref name=sfchron /&gt; whose commander was unaware of its cargo of prisoners. Urquhart was burned and covered in oil when the ship went down, and swallowed some oil which caused permanent damage to his vocal cords.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; He floated in a single-man raft for five days without food or water before being picked up by a Japanese [[whaling ship]] and taken to Japan.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;

In Japan, Urquhart was sent to work in coal mines belonging to the [[Aso Mining Company]] and later a labour camp ten miles from the city of [[Nagasaki]]. He was there when the city was [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|hit with an atomic bomb]] by the United States.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;&lt;ref name=stv&gt;[http://news.stv.tv/scotland/159894-alistair-urquharts-full-incredible-interview/ Alistair Urquhart's full incredible interview]. 25 February 2010.

==Post-war==
In 2010, Urquhart published ''The Forgotten Highlander: My Incredible Story of Survival During the War in the Far East'', an account of his experiences.&lt;ref name=forgotten&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MHRzPgAACAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Forgotten Highlander]''.

'''Anna Melloni Rasmussen''' (1898-1983) was a Danish spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].&lt;ref name="Kragh 2003"&gt;Kragh, Jesper Vaczy. ''Danish Spiritualism, 1853-2012''. In Christopher M.

'''Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá''' ({{IPA-es|anˈtonjo xoˈse ðe ˈsukɾe j alkaˈla|lang}}; 1795–1830)&lt;!--Per MOS, full dates in infobox need not be repeated in lede--&gt;, known as the "'''Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho'''" ({{lang-en|"Grand [[Marshal]] of [[Ayacucho]]"}}), was a [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] independence leader who served as the fourth [[President of Peru]] and the second [[President of Bolivia|President]] of [[Bolivia]]. Sucre was one of [[Simón Bolívar]]'s closest friends, generals and statesmen. The city of [[Sucre]], Bolivia's capital, is named for him, as is a [[Sucre state|state of Venezuela]] and a [[Sucre Department|department of Colombia]]. Both the [[Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport|old]] and [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport|new]] airports of [[Ecuador]]'s capital [[Quito]] are also named after him.

==Biography==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2015}}

===Family===
The aristocratic Sucre family traces its roots back to origins in [[Flanders]]. It arrived in Venezuela through Charles de Sucre y Franco Perez, a Flemish nobleman, son of Charles Adrian de Sucre, Marquess of Peru and Buenaventura Carolina Isabel Garrido y Pardo, a Spanish noblewoman. Charles de Sucre y Pardo served as a soldier in [[Catalonia]] in 1698 and was later named Governor of [[Cartagena de Indias]] and Captain General of [[Cuba]]. On December 22, 1779, Charles de Sucre y Pardo arrived in [[Cumaná]], Venezuela, having been named Governor of [[New Andalusia Province|New Andalucia]], which includes present-day [[Sucre State]].

===Military career===
In 1814, Antonio José de Sucre joined the fight for South America independence from Spain. The [[Battle of Pichincha]] took place on May 24, 1822, on the slopes of the [[Pichincha Volcano|Pichincha volcano]], near [[Quito]] in what is now [[Ecuador]]. The encounter, fought in the context of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], pitted a [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|Patriot]] army under Sucre against a Royalist army commanded by Field Marshal [[Melchor Aymerich]]. The defeat of the Royalist forces brought about the liberation of Quito and secured the independence of the provinces belonging to the ''[[Royal Audience of Quito|Real Audiencia de Quito]]'', or ''Presidencia de Quito'', the Spanish colonial administrative jurisdiction from which the [[Republic of Ecuador]] would eventually emerge.

As of late 1824, [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]]s still had control of most of southern [[Peru]] as well as [[Real Felipe]] Fort in the port of [[Callao]]. On December 9, 1824, the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] took place at Pampa de La Quinua, near the town of [[Quinua, Peru|Quinua]], between Royalist and Patriot forces. Sucre, as [[Simón Bolívar]]'s lieutenant, led the Patriot forces to victory over  the [[Viceroy]] [[José de la Serna]], who was wounded.  After the battle, second commander-in-chief [[José de Canterac]] signed the final capitulation of the Royalist army on his behalf. As a result, he was promoted, at the request of the Peruvian Congress, to [[Marshal]] and as [[General in Chief]] by the Colombian legislature.

[[File:Capitulación de Ayacucho1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Surrender at Ayacucho'' ([[Daniel Hernández (painter)|Daniel Hernández]]).]]
After the victory at Ayacucho, following precise orders from Bolívar, Sucre, nominated as Ayacucho's Grand Marshal, entered [[Upper Peru]] (known today as [[Bolivia]]) territory on February 25, 1825. Besides having orders of installing an immediately independent administration, his role was limited to giving an appearance of legality to the process that Upper Peruvians themselves had begun already. 

Royalist general [[Pedro Antonio Olañeta]] stayed in [[Potosí]], where he received by January the "Union" Infantry Battalion coming from [[Puno]] under the command of colonel [[José María Valdez]]. Olañeta then summoned a War Council, which agreed to continue the resistance in the name of Ferdinand VII. Next, Olañeta distributed his troops between [[Cotagaita]] fortress with the "Chichas" Battalion. in charge of colonel Medinacelli, while Valdez was sent to [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]] with the "Union" Infantry Battalion and loyalist militias, and Olañeta himself marched toward [[Vitichi]], with 60,000 pieces of gold from the Coin House in Potosí. But for the Spanish military personnel in Upper Peru, it was too little too late, as since 1821 all out guerilla warfare had raged in this part of the continent.

However, in [[Cochabamba]] the First Battalion of the Infantry Regiment "Ferdinand VII", led by colonel José Martínez, rebelled and side with the independence movement, only to be followed later by the Second Battalion, "Ferdinand VII" Infantry Regiment in [[Vallegrande]], resulting in the forced resignation of Brigadier Francisco Aguilera on February 12. Royalist colonel José Manuel Mercado occupied [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] on February 14, as [[Chayanta Municipality|Chayanta]] stayed in the hands of lieutenant colonel Pedro Arraya, with the cavalry squadrons "Santa Victoria" (Holy Victory) and "Dragones Americanos" (American Dragoons), and in Chuquisaca the cavalry squadron "Dragones de la Frontera"(Frontier Dragoons) under colonel Francisco López claimed victory for the independence forces on February 22. At this point, the majority of royalist troops of Upper Peru refused to continue fighting against the powerful army of Sucre and switched allegiances. Colonel Medinacelli with 300 soldiers also revolted against Olañeta, and on April 2 of 1825 they faced each other in the [[Battle of Tumusla]], which ended with the death of Olañeta. A few days later, on April 7, general José Mario Valdez surrendered in [[Chequelte]] to general Urdininea, putting an end to the war in Upper Peru and signalling victory to the local independence movement which had been active since 1811.

After the Constituent Assembly in Chuquisaca was reconvened by Marshal Sucre, on July 8 of 1825, and then later concluded, it was determined the complete independence of Upper Peru under the republican form. Finally, the Assembly president  José Mariano Serrano, together with a commission, wrote down the "Independence Act of the Upper Peruvian Departments" which carries the date of August 6, 1825, in honor of the Battle of Junín won by Bolivar. Independence was declared by 7 representatives from Charcas, 14 from Potosí, 12 from [[La Paz]], 13 from Cochabamba and 2 from [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]]. The act of Independence, wrote by the president of the Congress, Serrano, states in its expositive part:

{{cita|"''The world knows that the land of Upper Peru has been, in the American continent, the altar where the free people shed the first blood, and the land where the last of the tyrants’ tombs finally lays. Today, the Upper Peruvian departments protest in the face of the whole Earth its irrevocable resolution to be governed by themselves.''"}}

Through a decree it was determined that the new state in Upper Peru would carry the name of [[República Bolívar]], in honor of the liberator, who was designated as "Father of the Republic and Supreme Chief of State". Bolívar thanked them for these honors, but declined the presidency of the Republic, a duty he gave instead to the victor of Ayacucho, Grand Marshal Sucre, who would later be sworn in the same day as the first [[President of Bolivia]]. After some time, the subject of the name of the Young nation arose again, and a Potosian deputy named [[Manuel Martín Cruz]] offered a solution, suggesting that in the same manner which from [[Romulus]] comes Rome, from Bolívar ought to come the new nation of [[Bolivia]].

{{cita|"''If from Romulus, Rome; from Bolívar, it is Bolivia''".}}

By the time Bolívar got the news of the decision, he felt flattered by the young nation, but until then he hadn’t accepted willingly Upper Peru's because he was worried about its future, due to Bolivia's location in the center of South America; this, according to Bolivar, would create a nation that would face many future wars, which curiously did happen. Bolivar wished that Bolivia would become part of another nation, preferably Peru (given the fact that it had been part of [[Viceroyalty del Perú]] for centuries), or Argentina (since during the last decades of colonial domain it had been part of [[Viceroyalty del Río de la Plata]]), but what deeply convinced him otherwise was the attitude of the people. On August 18, upon his arrival to La Paz, there was a manifestation of popular rejoicing. The same scene repeated when the Liberator arrived to [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], then to Potosí and finally to Chuquisaca. Such a fervent demonstration by the people touched Bolívar, who called the new nation his "Predilect Daughter", and was called by the peoples of the new republic their "Favorite Son".

After the foundation of Bolivia, he became also the commander in chief of the [[Armed Forces of Bolivia]], which he created the following day on the basis of the guerrilla forces and active Patriot armies stationed at the time of the declaration. He gave the young republic its first Constitution in 1828.

=== Battle of Tarqui ===

In the [[Battle of Tarqui]], fought on February 27, 1829, heavily outnumbered two to one, Sucre defeated a Peruvian invasion force led by third President and General of Peru [[José de La Mar]], whose intentions had been to annex [[Guayaquil]] and the rest of Ecuador to Peru.

===Post-independence===
When a strong movement arose against Bolívar, his followers, and the Bolivian constitution in 1828, Sucre resigned.

===Assassination===

Sucre was killed on June 4, 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Monroy |first=Ramón Rocha |url=http://www.bolpress.com/art.php?Cod=2009060501 |title=Ultimas cartas de Sucre |publisher=Bolpress |date=June 5, 2009 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Juan José Flores wanted to separate the southern departments (Quito, Guayaquil, and Azuay), called the District of Ecuador, from the Gran Colombia so as to form an independent country and become its first President. General Flores foresaw that if Antonio José de Sucre arrived in Quito from Bogota, he could thwart his plans, since Sucre was very popular due to his reputation as hero and leader in the Battles of Pichincha, Tarqui and Ayacucho. General Juan José Flores put himself in contact with the anti-Bolívar and anti-Sucre leader Brigadier-General and the Commanding General of Cauca, José María Obando, who was not present at Sucre's death but who delegated this criminal act to the Venezuelan Colonel Apolinar Morillo. Commander Juan Gregorio Sarria (who later confessed he had been paid by Obando), José Erazo (a highway bandit and guerrilla fighter), and three peons as accomplices. The plan was to ambush José Antonio de Sucre on the morning of June 4, 1830, in the cold and bleak forested district of Berruecos, along a narrow path that was perennially covered with fog. 

The five assassins were hiding behind trees along the part of the trail known as La Jacoba waiting for Sucre's party, which would be passing the area single file. Sucre's retinue comprised seven persons: two muleteers with the baggage, two sergeants, one being the Marshal's orderly, a representative to the Congress from Cuenca, and his{{clarify|date=November 2013}}&lt;!--Whose servant? If representative's, remove comma &amp; add "and" before "a representative". If Sucre's, chg "his" to "the Marshal's" or "Sucre's".--&gt; servant, and finally Sucre himself. When Sucre approached La Jacoba, he was struck by three bullets, two inflicting superficial wounds to his head and one piercing his heart. He fell from his horse, which had been shot in the neck, and died almost instantly. His body remained there for twenty-four hours, as his companions, fearful of a similar fate, had fled in panic. 

Later, Juan Gregorio Sarria and Colonel Apolinar Morillo confessed that it was Obando who had convinced them to assassinate Sucre. Commander Juan Gregorio Sarria also confessed that Obando had paid him to kill Sucre, since there were anti-Bolivar politicians and officers in Bogota that wanted to see both Bolívar and Sucre eliminated. The ringleader of the anti-Bolívar faction in Bogota was Santander, who was Obando's friend and who had failed in his attempt to assassinate Bolivar {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. The three peons who were part of the Sucre assassination party were poisoned by Apolinar Morillo to prevent them from testifying about Sucre's murder. In the end, Colonel Apolinar Morillo was convicted and shot in the main square of Bogota for the murder of Sucre on November 30, 1842, and José Erazo died in prison that same year. José Maria Obando was granted immunity due to the fact that he was too powerful in the [[Cauca Department (Gran Colombia)|Cauca Department]]. [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], although indirectly involved with Sucre's death, was directly involved with Bolívar's attempted assassination and was exiled {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

====Burial and aftermath====

[[File:Plaza de Armas Sucre Decembre 2007 - Monument à Sucre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to Antonio José de Sucre in the constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre]]

The following day Sucre's orderly, a sergeant named Lorenzo Caicedo, with some help from others, buried the body and marked the makeshift grave with a cross formed of branches. When the widow received news of the assassination, she promptly brought Sucre's remains from Berruecos to Quito, where they were interred in secret in the oratory of the chapel of "El Dean" on one of her haciendas. Subsequently, she had the remains transferred, also in secret, to the Carmen Bajo Convent in Quito, where they were placed facing the main altar of the church. Seventy years later, in April 1900, Sucre's remains were discovered and, their authenticity scrupulously verified,  transferred to the Quito Cathedral on June 4, 1900, in a sumptuous parade led by the Executive and his Ministers, the high dignitaries of the Church, and the diplomatic corps. At the time, the government ordered the building of a crypt, but it was not inaugurated until thirty-two years later, on August 4, 1932. This mausoleum consisted of a nine-ton monolith of granite from the quarries of the Pichincha volcano. Its cover, on which a cross is carved in high relief, was so heavy that thirty persons were required to move it into place.

According to the December 19, 1830 ''Gaceta de Colombia'', Issue No. 495, a power-hungry, ambitious General Obando paid an assassin to kill Sucre by falsely informing the assassin that Sucre was a traitor and had to be stopped because Sucre's intentions were to go to Quito and separate the Department of Cauca and the three southern departments of Colombia and unite them with Peru. In reality, Sucre, a protégé of Bolívar, was going to Quito to stop the separation of the District of Ecuador from the Gran Colombia and to retire as soon as possible in Quito to live a quiet life with his wife. Some have argued that Sucre was ordered assassinated by General Obando so as to leave no clear successor to Bolívar in the Gran Colombia. Before his death, Bolívar believed Sucre to be the only man who could have reunited the Gran Colombia; however, Bolívar's generals and the majority of the politicians running the separate departments of the Gran Colombia had other selfish and ambitious plans. Sucre represented, according to historian Tomás Polanco Alcántara, "the indispensable complement to Simón Bolívar". Upon hearing the news of Sucre's death, Bolívar said, "Se ha derramado, Dios excelso, la sangre del inocente Abel..." ("The blood of the innocent Abel has been spilled, oh God almighty..."). Bolívar later wrote (''Gaceta de Colombia'', July 4, 1830):

{{cquote|If he had breathed his spirit upon the theater of victory, with his last breath he would have given thanks to heaven for having given him a glorious death; but cowardly murdered in a dark mountain, he leaves his fatherland the duty of prosecuting this crime and of adopting measures that will curb new scandals and the repetition of scenes as lamentable and painful as this.}}

Sucre is buried in the [[Cathedral of Quito]], [[Ecuador]], as he had said, "I want my bones to be forever in Quito", where his wife, [[Mariana Carcelén|Mariana de Carcelén y Larrea, Marquise of Solanda]], was from.

In 1013 CE, he traveled to the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom and stayed there for 12 years and came back to India. He is recognised as one of the greatest figures of classical Buddhism, and Atisa's chief disciple [[Dromtön]] was the founder of the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/myreincarnation/tibetan-buddhism-glossary.php|title=Tibetan Buddhism from A to Z - My Reincarnation - POV - PBS|first=|last=POV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|New Translation]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==Early life==

=== Palace life ===
[[Bikrampur]], the most probable place for Atiśa's birthplace, was the capital of the [[Pala Empire]] as it had been of the ancient kingdoms of southeast Bengal. Though the city's exact location is not certain, it presently lies in the [[Munshiganj District]] of Bangladesh, and continues to be celebrated as an early center of Buddhist cultural, academic, and political life. Similar to [[Gautama Buddha]], Atiśa was born into royalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maha Bodhi Society]], ''The Maha Bodhi'', Volume 90, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a king known as Kalyana Shri and his mother was Shri Prabhavati. One of three royal brothers, Atiśa went by the name of Candragarbha during the first part of his life. In fact, it was not until he traveled to [[Guge]] and encountered King Jangchup Ö ({{bo|w=byang chub 'od}}, 984–1078) that he was given the name Atiśa.

Atisá's Birthplace is still known as the Homestead of an atheist scholar because as Buddhism is non theistic, people in Bangladesh often refer him as an atheist scholar.

==Studies==
According to Tibetan sources, Atiśa was ordained into the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] lineage at the age of twenty-eight by the Abbot Śīlarakṣita and studied almost all Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools of his time, including teachings from [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], Tantric Hinduism and other practices. He also studied the sixty-four kinds of art, the art of music and the art of logic and accomplished these studies until the age of twenty-two. Among the many Buddhist lineages he studied, practiced and transmitted the three main lineages were the ''Lineage of the Profound Action'' transmitted by [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] and [[Vasubandhu]], the ''Lineage of Profound View'' transmitted by [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Candrakīrti]], and the ''Lineage of Profound Experience'' transmitted by [[Tilopa]] and [[Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Great Kagyu Masters: The Golden Lineage Treasury by Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen, Snow Lion Publications, pages 154-186&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Atiśa had more than 150 teachers, but one key one was [[Dharmakīrtiśrī]].{{Sfn|Buswell|2014|p=247}}

==Preaching in Sumatra and Tibet==
[[File:Mural of Atisha at Ralung Gompa, 1993.jpg|thumb|280px|{{Other Information}}Mural of Atiśa at [[Ralung Monastery]], 1993.]]
Tibetan sources assert that Atisa spent 12 years in [[Sumatra]] of the [[Srivijaya]] empire and he returned to India in 1025 CE which was also the same year when [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola dynasty]] invaded Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;Atisa and Tibet: Life and Works of Dipamkara Srijnana  by  Alaka Chattopadhyaya p.91&lt;/ref&gt;
Atiśa returned to India. Once back, the increasingly knowledgeable monk received much attention for his teachings and skills in debate and philosophy. On three separate occasions, the monk Atiśa was acclaimed for defeating non-Buddhist extremists in debate. When he came into contact with what he perceived to be a misled or deteriorating form of Buddhism he would quickly and effectively implement reforms. Soon enough he was appointed to the position of steward, or abbot, at [[Vikramashila]] established by [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Emperor Dharmapala]].

Atiśa's return from [[Suvarnabhumi]], where he had been studying with Dharmakīrtiśrī, and his rise to prominence in India coincided with a flourishing of Buddhist culture and the practice of Buddhism in the region, and in many ways Atiśa's influence contributed to these developments. According to traditional narratives, King [[Langdarma]] had suppressed Buddhism's teachings and persecuted its followers for over seventy years. According to the ''[[Blue Annals]]'', a new king of [[Guge]] by the name of [[Yeshe-Ö]] sent his academic followers to learn and translate some of the Sanskrit Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=bstan pa'i mgon po|title=Blue Annals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DuVrgEACAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Lokesh Chandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these academics was Nagtso, who was eventually sent to [[Vikramashila]] to study Sanskrit and plead with Atiśa to come teach the Dharma in his homeland.
At [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]], he was very impressed with the king's request for "a teaching of the people […] had [Atiśa] been asked for advanced empowerments into tantric deity systems […] he would have been far less pleased".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It was during the three years Atiśa spent in this town that he compiled his teachings into his most influential scholarly work, ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa]]'', and encountered the disciple forecast by Tārā, [[Dromtön]]. It was this disciple who furthered Atiśa's work after he died.

According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], when Atiśa discovered the store of Sanskrit texts at Pekar Kordzoling, the library of [[Samye]], "he said that the degree to which the Vajrayana had spread in Tibet was unparalleled, even in India. After saying this, he reverently folded his hands and praised the great dharma kings, translators, and panditas of the previous centuries."{{Sfn|Tulku|Helm|2006|p=74}}

'''Burkhard Christoph Graf&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Graf}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Münnich''' ({{lang|ru|Христофо́р Анто́нович Миних}}, [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]] {{transl|ru|Khristofor Antonovich Minikh}}; 9 May 1683 – 16 October 1767) was a [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] general who became a [[field marshal]] and [[political figure]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the major Russian Army reformer and founder of several elite military formations during the reign of [[Anna of Russia]]. As a statesman, he is regarded as the founder of Russian [[Philhellenism]]. Münnich also was a hereditary engineer and a specialist in [[hydrotechnology]]. He had the grade of count of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the German Nation.

==Early career==
Münnich was born at [[Berne, Germany|Neuenhuntorf]] in the Grand [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] in the military family of Anton Günther Mönnich (since 1688 ''von Münnich'', an east-Frisian nobility). Beside the knowledge of the native [[Low German language]] he also learned the [[Latin]] and [[French language]]s. He entered the French service at 17. Thence he transferred successively to the armies of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] where he earned the rank of a [[colonel]] and later [[Major General]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1721, he was invited by the Russian ambassador in [[Warsaw]] [[Grigoriy Dolgorukov]] for engineering projects of the newly acquired northern territories. Around that time his father has died. Upon arrival to Russia he presented [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] plans for the fortification of [[Kronstadt]] fortress, with which pleasantly surprised the Russian emperor, and the [[Annenkrone]] fortification in [[Vyborg]]. He was promoted to the [[Lieutenant General]] in 1722. Among his first undertakings was the completion of the costly [[Ladoga Canal]], which had been under construction for more than a decade. For his engineering and military-engineering achievements he was promoted to the rank of the [[General-in-Chief]] in 1726 by [[Catherine I]], and awarded the [[Order of St. Alexander Nevsky]]. In 1727, Münnich was appointed the Governor of [[Saint Petersburg]] city while the Imperial court was temporarily transferred to Moscow by [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. From 1728 to 1734 he was a General-Governor of [[Ingria]], [[Karelia]], and Finland as well as was awarded the title of a [[count]]. During his governorship Münnich improved the local ports, reinforced the newly established [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] (1703), and was thinking of building a bridge towards [[Stockholm]].

==Russian army reformer==
Upon the coronation of [[Anna of Russia]] (1730), he was instructed to prepare the city for the return of Imperial court. After successfully accomplishing that Münnich was promoted to a [[List of Russian field marshals|General-Fieldmarshal]], was appointed to the position of president of Russian [[War Collegiate]] in 1732 as well as given an order to re-organize the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. Münnich became a founder of the [[Leib-Guard Cavalry Regiment]], the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]], and the Shlyakhetskiy [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|Cadet Corps]] which was destined to supply the future generations of officers. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Münnich also reformed numerous other military formations as well as the War Collegiate itself. He established a new formation for the Russian army at that time, the Corps which consisted of 12 regiments [[Cuirassier]] Cavalry as well as the first [[Hussar]] regiments. Münnich revised the table of ranks and evened the salary of the Russian officers with the invited foreign military specialists. He was the first to introduce the [[sapper]] regiments to the Russian army as well as founded the Engineer School for Officers. During his administration some 50 other fortresses were erected which substantially improved the well-being of the Russian Armed Forces at that time. Due to the [[Andrey Osterman]] affairs, he was released of his duties.

==Ottoman campaign of 1734-1739==
In 1734, by the reference of [[Ernst Johann von Biron]] he was sent to take the city of Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) and after [[Siege of Danzig (1734)|a prolonged siege]] and evasion of [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] was heavily reproached. However, after that in 1733, the [[Russian Empire]] was able to install [[Augustus III of Poland]] as the King of Poland (ratified in 1736).

In 1736, as the Commander of the Russian army he headed the [[Russo-Turkish Wars|Turkish campaigns]] besieging the important ports of [[Azov|Azak]] and [[Ochakov|Özi]]. 
On 21 May 1735 he stormed and sacked [[Perekop|Or Qapı]] penetrating into the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] peninsula. 
Münnich destroyed the important Tatar cities of [[Kezlev]], [[Simferopol|Aqmescit]], and [[Bakhchisaray]]. 
He was forced out of the peninsula due to poor logistics and battle fatigue of his formations, while another General, Count [[Peter Lacy|Peter von Lacy]], took [[Azov|Azak]] earning himself a rank of the [[General-Fieldmarshal]]. 
Münnich refused to resume the campaign the very next year, but he returned to the lower [[Dnieper]] steppes in 1737, and on 2 July took the fortress of [[Ochakov|Özi]] with the help of the Russian artillery. 
During the sack of Özi, he manually raised the regimental banner of the Izmailovsky Regiment on one of the towers of fortress after a successful attack. 
The siege of Özi was also later mentioned in the humorous stories about [[Baron Munchausen]], based on the adventures of the [[page (servant)|page]] to [[Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick]], Hieronymus von Münchhausen. 
Due to the heavy losses, the campaign was paused again while conducting negotiations in [[Nemyriv|Nemirov]] ([[Podolie]]) without much result. 
In 1739, Münnich won the [[Battle of Stavuchany]], took [[Khotyn]] two days later, and established himself firmly in [[Moldavia]]. 
His victory in this campaign was later mentioned in one of the Lomonosov's odes, considered to be the first poem of Russian literature. Threatening to burn down the capital of [[Moldavia]], the city of [[Iași]], he forced the Moldavian boyars to sign the annexation of Moldavia. 
After the Ottoman war he was awarded the [[Order of St. Andrew]] and the Golden Weapon for Courage. 
Due to military losses of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and worsening of the relationship with the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)|Swedish Hats]], the [[Russian Empire]] had to sign the [[Treaty of Niš (1739)|Treaty of Niš]] by which it had to return the newly acquired Nogai steppes while keeping the fortress of Azak.

Marshal Münnich now began to take an active part in political affairs, the particular tone of which was given by his rivalry with [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Biron]], [[duke]] of [[Courland]].
Münnich's activity was brought to a close by the [[Elizabeth of Russia|revolution of 1741]]; he was arrested on his way to the border, and condemned to death. Brought out for execution, and withdrawn from the [[Gallows|scaffold]], he was later sent to [[Pelym, Garinsky District, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Pelym]], [[Siberia]], where he remained for several years, until the accession of [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] brought about his release in 1762. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], who soon displaced Peter, employed the old field marshal as director-general of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports.
Münnich died four years later in [[Tartu]] and was buried at his estate nearby, where his grave was damaged{{citation needed|reason=The desecration/damage should be sourced, presented without contradictions, and the approximate time given, at at least one of the places it is mentioned; cf the talk page|date=May 2015}} by the Soviets. The Russian [[37th Dragoons Regiment (Russia)|37th Dragoons Regiment]] used to bear his name.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Charles Rufus Baxter''' (November 4, 1929 – March 10, 2005) was an American medical doctor. Baxter was one of the [[Physician|doctors]] who unsuccessfully tried to save U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] after he [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|was shot]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, in 1963.

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris, Texas]], Baxter graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1950. He then attended the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] at Dallas where he received his medical degree in 1954.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news | title=Chales Baxter Obituary | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30370-2005Mar12.html | accessdate=2006-03-16 | date=2005-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxter was the emergency room director at [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]] when Kennedy was shot, and famously said of the event in 1988:

{{quote|As soon as we realized we had nothing medical to do, we all backed off from the man with a reverence that one has for one's president, and we did not continue to be doctors from that point on. We became citizens again, and there were probably more tears shed in that room than in the surrounding hundred miles.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | title=Chales Baxter Obituary | work=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/15/obituaries/15baxter.html?ex=1142658000&amp;en=3fe3040c38969b4a&amp;ei=5070 | accessdate=2006-03-16 | date=2005-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also operated on Texas Governor [[John Connally]], who had been wounded in the attack.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Baxter made advances in the treatment of burn victims, and founded the burn unit{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and a skin-graft bank at Parkland.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

He died in Dallas, Texas, on March 10, 2005, of [[pneumonia]], aged 75.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

==Early life==
Beckham was born at [[Whipps Cross University Hospital]] in [[Leytonstone]], London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=BECKHAM – Working-class boy to Man U |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/09/sports/sp-beckham9 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |first=Chuck |last=Culpepper }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b.

Random House,&lt;/ref&gt; He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise.

His parents were fanatical [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] supporters who frequently travelled to [[Old Trafford]] from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of [[Bobby Charlton]]'s football schools in [[Manchester]] and won the chance to take part in a training session with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers&amp;nbsp;, which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and attended [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for [[Brimsdown Rovers F.C.|Brimsdown Rovers]]' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becks' Brimsdown boost, article from 24 September 2004|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFAVase/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/09/BecksBrimsdownBoost.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20041011163715/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFAVase/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/09/BecksBrimsdownBoost.htm|dead-url=yes|archivedate=11 October 2004|work=TheFA.com|accessdate=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a [[Youth Training Scheme]] contract on 8 July 1991.&lt;ref name="YTS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A1138600|title=David Beckham – Rise of a Footballer|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Manchester United===

====Youth and early career====
Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,&lt;ref name="H2G2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A1138600 |title=David Beckham – Rise of a Footballer |website=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition |publisher=Not Panicking |accessdate=14 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham was part of a group of young players, including [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Gary Neville]], [[Phil Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who were coached by [[Eric Harrison (footballer)|Eric Harrison]], and helped the club win the [[FA Youth Cup]] in [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1990s#1991/92: Manchester United v. Crystal Palace (3-1 and 3-2, 6-3 Aggregate)|May 1992]]. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.&lt;ref name="H2G2" /&gt;

Manchester United again reached the [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1990s#1992/93: Leeds United v. Manchester United (2-0 and 2-1, 4-1 Aggregate)|final of the FA Youth Cup]], where they faced [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute [[Robbie Savage]]. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his [[UEFA Champions League]] debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1994/standings/index.html|title=Champions League 1994/95 Standings|work=UEFA.com|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Preston North End====
Beckham then went to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on loan for part of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a [[corner kick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2988104.stm |title=Beckham's pride at OBE |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2003 |accessdate=4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Manchester United====
Beckham returned to Manchester and made his [[Premier League]] debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the [[1995 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 20 May, which United lost 1–0, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hart (1995). "The Guinness football encyclopedia". p. 69. Guinness&lt;/ref&gt;

United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as "[[Fergie's Fledglings]]"), which included [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Gary Neville|Gary]] and [[Phil Neville]]. When experienced players [[Paul Ince]], [[Mark Hughes]], and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including [[Darren Anderton]], [[Marc Overmars]] and [[Roberto Baggio]], but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;The most famous comment was [[Alan Hansen]]'s "You can't win anything with kids", quoted in ''The Boss'' 405. Beckham scored United's goal (his first for them in the league) from a distance of around 30&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;/ref&gt; with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Sir-Alex-25-Years/Trophies/Trophy-Articles/League-199596.aspx|title=Man Utd season review 1995/96|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232144/http://www.manutd.com/en/Sir-Alex-25-Years/Trophies/Trophy-Articles/League-199596.aspx|archive-date=25 May 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and [[FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and also providing the [[corner kick|corner]] from which [[Eric Cantona]] scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the [[Tyneside]]rs at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euro 96 stars going strong |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/01/Euro96_Feature.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050326090133/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/01/Euro96_Feature.htm |dead-url=yes |archivedate=26 March 2005 |work=The Football Association |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud nine. I just wanted to shake everybody's hand and be out on the pitch for an hour."|source=—Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen Russell (2011). "Arise Sir David Beckham: Footballer, Celebrity, Legend – The Biography of Britain's Best Loved Sporting Icon". John Blake Publishing,&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the beginning of the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97 season]], Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the [[Premier League]] season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper [[Neil Sullivan]] was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line – 60 yards out – that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sky Sports]]' commentator [[Martin Tyler]]'s words ''"You'll see that over and over again"'' proved prophetic as the goal was voted Premier League Goal of the Decade in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[goal celebration]] for his 60-yard strike saw him raise his arms as usual, but he walked away smiling rather than run as he often would.&lt;ref name="Sky Beckham"&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering that David Beckham wonder goal 20 years on... |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/10540496/remembering-that-david-beckham-wonder-goal-20-years-on |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Beckham scored the goal he was wearing [[Adidas Predator]] boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://specials.rediff.com/sports/2004/apr/27pic2.htm|title=Beckham's Golden Boots|publisher=Rediff.com|date=27 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a UK poll conducted by [[Channel 4]] in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the [[100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest_sporting/results.html|title=100 GREATEST SPORTING MOMENTS – RESULTS|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 [[Sky Sports]] poll it was ranked the best opening day goal in Premier League history.&lt;ref name="Sky Beckham"/&gt; During the 1996–97 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping them to retain the Premier League championship, and was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] by his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/football/awards/pfayoung.php|title=English PFA Young Player of the Year Award|publisher=napit.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United started the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]] well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Track/5880/fix1998.html|title=Fixture List for 1997/98 Season|publisher=geocities.com|accessdate=16 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731113715/http://geocities.com/Colosseum/Track/5880/fix1998.html|archivedate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1999 FA Cup Final Beckham corner.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham preparing to take a corner kick for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] during the [[1999 FA Cup Final]] at Wembley Stadium]]
In the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]], he was part of the United team that won the [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the Premier League, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], a unique feat in English football.&lt;ref name="treble"/&gt; There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/David-Beckham.aspx?pageNo=2|title=Manchester United Legends: David Beckham|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007021554/http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/David-Beckham.aspx?pageNo=2|archive-date=7 October 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.&lt;ref name="treble"/&gt; Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.&lt;ref name="treble"/&gt;

Beckham played in central midfield in United's win over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]], since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and [[Roy Keane]] were suspended for the match.&lt;ref name="treble"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354262.stm|title=The Kings of Europe|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.&lt;ref name="treble"/&gt; Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to [[Rivaldo]] for 1999's [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] and [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/ballondor/archive/edition=1999901999/|title=Rivaldo on top of the world|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's [[FIFA Club World Cup|World Club Championship]] match against [[Club Necaxa|Necaxa]]. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Man Utd's flawed genius? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/593905.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=6 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000]] by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/738587.stm|title=Man Utd celebrate in style|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had [[gastroenteritis]], but Ferguson was furious when [[Victoria Beckham]] was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been "fair to his teammates"&lt;ref&gt;''The Boss'' 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part."' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ferguson-will-never-talk-to-the-bbc-again-401487.html|title=Ferguson will never talk to the BBC again|last=Harris|first=Nick|date=6 September 2007|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was a key player in United's third successive league title in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]], only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.

On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], breaking the second [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine [[Aldo Duscher]], and [[England national football team|England]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were due to meet in that year's World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did 'hatchet man' target Beckham? |publisher=ESPN Socernet |date=2 April 2002 |url=http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0402/20020411featwright.html |accessdate=7 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716052613/http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0402/20020411featwright.html |archivedate=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham signs new contract |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/newsid_1976000/1976699.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2002 |accessdate=7 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.

Following an injury early in the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]], Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2778985.stm|title=Man Utd play down Arsenal rift|date=19 February 2003|publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matrix: Milan are favourites|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia//dec21o.html|work=Football Italia|publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=21 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224070722/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia//dec21o.html|archivedate=24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/04/28/1234261/silvestre-reminisces-about-fergusons-infamous-boot-throwing-at-be |title=Silvestre Reminisces About Ferguson's Infamous Boot-Throwing at Beckham Incident |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Revealed:_What_happened_when_Beckham_was_hit_by_a_boot_in_the_face&amp;in_article_id=638192&amp;in_page_id=43 |title=Revealed: What happened when Beckham was hit by a boot in the face |work=Metro |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/18653/Silvestre_relives_Ferguson_throwing_boot_at_Beckham.aspx |title=Silvestre relives Ferguson throwing boot at Beckham |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and was appointed an [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham's pride at OBE |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2988104.stm |accessdate=6 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind [[Ryan Giggs]] (having joined them at the same time as [[Nicky Butt]], [[Gary Neville]] and [[Paul Scholes]]).

As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham to stay in Spain |work=The Guardian |date=11 June 2003 |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,974864,00.html |accessdate=24 May 2006 |location=London |first=Daniel |last=Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barcelona's bid for Man Utd star begs questions |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/gabriele_marcotti/news/2003/06/12/marcotti_insider/ |publisher=CNNSI.com |date=12 June 2003 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |first=Gabriele |last=Marcotti |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040709085103/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/gabriele_marcotti/news/2003/06/12/marcotti_insider |archivedate=9 July 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for €37&amp;nbsp;million on a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to, at the time, £25&amp;nbsp;million or US$41&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham was the latest signing in the ''[[Galácticos]]'' era of global stars signed by club president [[Florentino Pérez]] every summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2001&amp;nbsp;– present&amp;nbsp;— Real Madrid surpasses the century mark |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/history/football/2001-2010-the-ninth-with-zidane-beckham-ronaldo-and-figo |publisher=Realmadrid.com |accessdate=5 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president [[Joan Laporta]], who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham joins Real Madrid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/2998868.stm |accessdate=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after [[Laurie Cunningham]] and [[Steve McManaman]]. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real unveil Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3037824.stm |accessdate=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player [[Michael Jordan]], who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,,990894,00.html|title=The number 23|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 June 2003|accessdate=9 June 2007 |first=Sally |last=Bolton }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beckham zidane.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beckham (top) and [[Zinedine Zidane]] at Real Madrid in August 2003]]
In the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named [[Carlos Queiroz]] as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for ''los Merengues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Did the Real Madrid Leave behind for Asia? |work=China Daily |date=21 August 2003 |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-08/15/content_255106.htm |accessdate=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of [[Live Nation Entertainment|SFX Europe]], who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with [[Simon Fuller]] and his company [[19 Entertainment]], which already managed the career of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham also appointed close friend [[Terry Byrne]] to be his personal manager.&lt;ref name="galaxy-millions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3229703.stm |title=Beckham bags Watford man |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 October 2003 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="We knew before he was a good player, but we did not expect him to be such an influential player, to show such commitment to the team spirit.

In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the [[2003 Supercopa de España|Spanish Super Cup]] over two legs versus [[RCD Mallorca]], with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] recipients, [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Luís Figo]], in addition to [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]] and [[Iker Casillas]], Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation, with two fullbacks [[Míchel Salgado]] and [[Roberto Carlos]], often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t2003-042.html |title=2003–04 Real Madrid |publisher=Bdfutbol.com |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Madrid were runners-up in the [[2003–04 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of [[gasoline|petrol]]. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intruder alert for Victoria Beckham |publisher=Manchester Online |date=20 July 2004 |url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/124/124434_intruder_alert_for_victoria_beckham.html |accessdate=9 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222010135/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/124/124434_intruder_alert_for_victoria_beckham.html |archivedate=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league season began with new head coach [[José Antonio Camacho]] at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant [[Mariano García Remón]] took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling [[Ben Thatcher]] in an England match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next [[Yellow card (sports)|caution]], and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. [[The Football Association]] asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had "made a mistake" and apologised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=FA wants explanation from Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/3735276.stm |accessdate=6 October 2005 |date=14 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. Having received a [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]], he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.

By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, García Remón was dismissed, and [[Vanderlei Luxemburgo]] became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against [[Getafe CF]]. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by [[Juan Ramón López Caro]]. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.

[[File:Beckham warmingup.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Beckham warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006]]
During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maul|first=Kimberly|title=David Beckham: Soccer Star and Book Judge|url=http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001842661|publisher=The Book Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212115110/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001842661|archivedate=12 December 2007|date=11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with [[Vicente Boluda]] named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.

The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. [[Ramón Calderón]] became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach [[Fabio Capello]], Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier [[José Antonio Reyes]] was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director [[Predrag Mijatović]] announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/10/sports/web.0110beckham.php |title=Uncertainty over Beckham's future at Real Madrid |work=International Herald Tribune |date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220071830/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/10/sports/web.0110beckham.php |archivedate=20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the [[LA Galaxy]] beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6259063.stm|title=Real coach calls time on Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2007|accessdate=13 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said that Beckham is "going to Hollywood to be half a film star", adding "our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jack |last=Bell |title=Real Madrid Club President Says a Mouthful

About a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against [[Real Sociedad]] on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6346573.stm|title=Beckham scores on Madrid return |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2007|accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League knockout stage|round-of-16 stage]] (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper [[Oliver Kahn]] describing his performance as "world class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/21/match.realmadrid|title=Beckham shines to give Real a slight advantage|first=Simon|last=Talbot|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beckham 2 (2114756146).jpg|thumb|left|Beckham during his last season with Real Madrid]]
On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's [[2006–07 La Liga|La Liga title]], their first since Beckham had signed with them and [[Real Madrid C.F.#Domestic competitions|30th overall in the club's history]]. Although Real and Barçelona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.&lt;ref name="Liga"/&gt; With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Katie Holmes]], watching from a luxury box at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]], it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.&lt;ref name="Liga"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6759697.stm|title=Beckham bows out with Liga title|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Millward |first=Robert |title=Agent: Beckham Sticking to Galaxy Deal |work=The Washington Post |date=10 June 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/10/AR2007061000751.html |accessdate=14 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600&amp;nbsp;million during Beckham's four years at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Paul |last=Maidment |title=Becks And Bucks |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/sports/2007/07/07/beckham-soccer-marketing-face-markets-cx_pm_0707autofacescan01.html |work=Forbes |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101184121/http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/sports/2007/07/07/beckham-soccer-marketing-face-markets-cx_pm_0707autofacescan01.html|archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham's involvement with [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side [[LA Galaxy]]. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the [[2007 MLS SuperDraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Halpin |first=Jason |title=Events surround MLS SuperDraft |url=http://la.galaxy.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070110&amp;content_id=81545&amp;vkey=news_mls&amp;fext=.jsp|publisher=MLSnet.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211351/http://la.galaxy.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070110&amp;content_id=81545&amp;vkey=news_mls&amp;fext=.jsp |archivedate=27 May 2008 |date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beckham first goal LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham scores his first goal for LA Galaxy with a trademark free-kick.]]
The announcement made global headlines and elevated the league's profile. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/01/11/beckham.mls/ Beckham will play for MLS' L.A. Galaxy in $250M deal]; ''Sports Illustrated'', 11 January 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725000850/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/01/11/beckham.mls/ |date=25 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency [[19 Entertainment]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5&amp;nbsp;million in total or $6.5&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name="galaxy-millions"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham rejected Milan and Inter to take Galaxy millions |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/beckham-rejected-milan-and-inter-to-take-galaxy-millions-431736.html |work=The Independent |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |location=London |first=Sam |last=Wallace }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[Herbalife]] nutrition company worth US$20&amp;nbsp;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the [[StubHub Center|Home Depot Center]]).&lt;ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.44"&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]] for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO [[Tim Leiweke]] put it as follows: "Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed".&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25&amp;nbsp;million whenever he stopped playing in the league&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/51723/beckham-is-mls-expansion-story-du-jour.html|title=Beckham is MLS expansion story du jour|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|date=20 May 2013|work=Soccer Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.&lt;ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.44"/&gt; The league had a [[salary cap]] in place, requiring the creation of the [[Designated Player Rule]] for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2&amp;nbsp;million home on San Ysidro Drive in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.66"&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Beckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team]]
Beckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.socceramerica.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&amp;s=22622&amp;Nid=32279&amp;p=406999|title=The Beckham has Landed|publisher=socceramerica.com|accessdate=14 July 2007|date=13 July 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign "Fútbol meets Football" starring Beckham and [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&amp;nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007]]
On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&amp;nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Frank Lampard]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.&lt;ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.66"/&gt; As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.&lt;ref name="The Beckham Experiment p.66"/&gt;

The day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood [[A-list]]ers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the [[North American SuperLiga]] and an MLS game away at [[Toronto FC]] though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le Méridien King Edward]] in [[downtown Toronto]] (an expense paid for by the local [[Toronto]] promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85–87&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]
Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C. United]] in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]], coming on for [[Quavas Kirk]] in the 71st minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2007-08-09-beckham-debut_N.htm |title=Beckham makes MLS debut but Galaxy stumbles in D.C. |work=USA Today |accessdate=15 August 2007 |first=Beau |last=Dure |date=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that [[Carlos Pavón]] failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into [[Landon Donovan]]'s path that United's keeper [[Troy Perkins]] managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at [[New England Revolution]] and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the [[Gillette Stadium]]'s artificial surface.

Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=453684&amp;root=mls&amp;cc=5901|title=Beckham takes captain's armband to great effect|publisher=ESPN |date=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the [[2007 North American SuperLiga|North American SuperLiga]] final versus [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] on 29 August.

During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan revealing that he had sprained his [[medial collateral ligament]] and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league). Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7171836.stm |title=Beckham begins Arsenal training |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the ninth minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&amp;cc=5901 |title=Beckham, Donovan propel L.A. past Quakes |publisher=ESPN |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408050045/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&amp;cc=5901 |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70&amp;nbsp;yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] at [[Selhurst Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=538785&amp;root=mls&amp;cc=5901 |title=ESPNsoccernet – MLS – Canales: Beckham shows scoring touch against Wizards |publisher=ESPN |first=Andrea |last=Canales |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.

====Loan to A.C. Milan====
[[File:David Beckham at Al Saad (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Beckham playing for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]]]
In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under [[Fabio Capello]] led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying matches]] in 2009. On 30 October 2008, [[A.C.

Beckham was unveiled at Milan's [[Milanello|training facility]] by the club's chief executive [[Adriano Galliani]] on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by [[Christian Vieri]], as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by [[Alexandre Pato]] and club vice captain [[Massimo Ambrosini]], respectively. The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to [[San Siro]] where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] and proclaiming "Forza Milan" over the public address system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/3899667/David-Beckham-makes-San-Siro-entrance-with-Forza-Milan.html |title=David Beckham officially unveiled in Milan |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3WnTU88M40 |title=Intervista Sky Sport a Beckham all'intervallo di Milan-Udinese |publisher=Sky Sport 24 |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar [[Kaká]] in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old [[Ronaldinho]], and 29-year-old [[Andrea Pirlo]] – as well as club veterans [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], Massimo Ambrosini, [[Giuseppe Favalli]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Filippo Inzaghi]] and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the ''rossoneri'' in Serie A as a starter away at [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] on 11 January 2009, playing 89&amp;nbsp;minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=251467&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ITA.1 |title=AS Roma 2–2 AC Milan |publisher=ESPN |date=11 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510203728/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=251467&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ITA.1 |archivedate=10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s decision to play him from the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/12/david-beckham-serie-a-milan-roma |title=Beckham proves a big draw but fails to make major impression on debut for Milan |work=The Guardian |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Kington}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Beckham's home debut against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] a week later, he turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/18/milan-kaka-manchester-city-fiorentina-berlusconi-ancelotti |title=Fans beg Kaka to stay but Pato is the hero in Milan victory |work=The Guardian |date=18 January 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Kington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=612673&amp;&amp;cc=5901 |title=Beckham scores first goal for AC Milan |publisher=ESPN |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15&amp;nbsp;million range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=616973&amp;cc=5901 |title=Galaxy reject AC Milan's opening gambit for Becks |publisher=ESPN |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=619909&amp;cc=5901 |title=Beckham's future to be resolved on Friday? |publisher=ESPN |date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jones |first=Grahame L. |title=Beckham agrees to return to Galaxy in mid-July |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-beckham-milan-galaxy3-2009mar03,0,6510100.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303222556/http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-beckham-milan-galaxy3-2009mar03%2C0%2C6510100.story |archivedate= 3 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique "[[timeshare]]" deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July until the end of the 2009 MLS season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article5871341.ece |title=David Beckham 'dream' deal |work=The Times |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2009 |location=London |first=Nick |last=Szczepanik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Galaxy===
After his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying "Go home fraud", and "Part-time player".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham booed by furious fans |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8159287.stm |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galaxy, however, had [[2009 Los Angeles Galaxy season|a much more successful season]] than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference final]] after a 2–0 overtime victory over the [[Houston Dynamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/sports/soccer/15galaxy.html|title=Two Blackouts and Two Goals Send Galaxy to M.L.S. Final |date=14 November 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[2009 MLS Cup|final]] on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to [[Real Salt Lake]] by 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=702587&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=5739|title=Salt Lake beat L.A.

====Return to Milan (loan)====
In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/02/david-beckham-milan-loan|title=David Beckham's loan move to Milan from LA Galaxy is confirmed|date=2 November 2009|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75&amp;nbsp;minutes of a 5–2 victory over [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8444755.stm|title=David Beckham makes winning return for AC Milan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2010|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76&amp;nbsp;minutes of the match at the San Siro – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Lyon |title=AC Milan 2–3 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8515983.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for [[Ignazio Abate]] in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 4–0 AC Milan (agg 7–2) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8558023.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner [[Malcolm Glazer]]. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around [[Manchester United Supporters' Trust]] gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Beckham shows true colours |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2010/03/beckham_shows_true_colours.html |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Milan's next game, against [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]], Beckham suffered a [[Achilles tendon rupture|torn left Achilles tendon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England's David Beckham is injured playing for AC Milan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8567353.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the [[2010 Major League Soccer season|MLS season]] due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor [[Sakari Orava]] performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in [[Turku]], Finland, on 15 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Milan/15-03-2010/beckham-stagione-finita-603312286519.shtml |title=Beckham, stagione finita È sicuro: salta il Mondiale – Risultati e ultime notizie calcio e calciomercato |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the operation, Orava affirmed that, "it went quite fine. The prognosis is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2010/03/15/1834650/dr-sakari-orava-confirms-david-beckham-will-make-a-full-recovery- |title=Dr Sakari Orava Confirms David Beckham Will Make A Full Recovery From Achilles Tendon Injury |publisher=Goal.com |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second return to Galaxy===
[[File:David Beckham 2010 LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|upright|Beckham in 2010]]
On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over [[Columbus Crew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8991596.stm|title=David Beckham returns to action after Achilles injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2010|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over [[Chivas USA]] to mark his first goal in [[2010 Major League Soccer season|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=829955&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=5739|title=Beckham goal sends Galaxy top of Western Conference|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2–1 win over [[FC Dallas]] which secured them their second successive [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference]] title and first [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] since [[Major League Soccer 2002 Season|2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9122837.stm|title=David Beckham helps LA Galaxy win Supporters' Shield |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2010|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager [[Harry Redknapp]], the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AEG blocked Becks switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11675_6742492,00.html |work=Sky Sports |date=9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.&lt;ref name="MLS final"/&gt;

====MLS Cup champion====
[[File:David Beckham 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham with LA Galaxy in 2012]]
On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over Sporting Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/los-angeles/soccer/post/_/id/8106/galaxy-donovan-possession-spark-big-win|title=Donovan, possession spark big win|publisher=ESPN Los Angeles|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2–1 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2011-07-10-948918221_x.htm|title=Beckham scores from corner to give Galaxy victory|work=USA Today|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third [[MLS Cup]] against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player [[Robbie Keane]].&lt;ref name="MLS final"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7263458/mls-cup-landon-donovan-goal-powers-galaxy-third-mls-title |title=MLS Cup – Landon Donovan's goal powers Galaxy to third MLS title |publisher=ESPN |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Grant|last=Wahl|title=Hollywood Ending: If this was indeed David Beckham's final game in MLS, he went out in style, carrying the Galaxy to a championship and affirming the value of star power in America|date=28 November 2011|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1192446/index.htm|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive [[Supporters' Shield]], having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2012/01/la-galaxy-re-sign-david-beckham |title=David Beckham re-signs with LA Galaxy, LA Galaxy official website |publisher=Lagalaxy.com |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/16625942 |title=CBBC Newsround – Beckham stays with LA Galaxy and signs two-year deal |publisher=BBC |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/beckham-signs-year-deal-la-galaxy-15389465 |title=Beckham Signs New 2-Year-Deal With LA Galaxy |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay |first=Simon |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/887779-david-beckham-signs-new-two-year-la-galaxy-deal |title=David Beckham signs new two-year LA Galaxy deal |work=Metro |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18081171|title=President Obama teases David Beckham at White House|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]], the San Jose Earthquakes, and [[Seattle Sounders FC]] on their way to the [[MLS Cup 2012|MLS Cup final]], where they defeated the Houston Dynamo 3–1 to retain the cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/01/la-galaxy-mls-cup-2012-dynamo_n_2225115.html |title=L.A.

==International career==
[[File:David Beckham.jpg|thumb|Beckham as England captain]]
Beckham made his first appearance for the [[England national football team|England national team]] on 1 September 1996, in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying match against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandstats.com/matchreport.php?mid=727|title=Moldova 0 – England 3|publisher=englandstats.com|accessdate=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 FIFA World Cup===
Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/CmpWC/CmpWC1998Squad.html|title=England in World Cup 1998 Squad Records|publisher=englandfootballonline.com|accessdate=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the team's manager [[Glenn Hoddle]] publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beckham Blasts Hoddle |work=Daily Dispatch |date=29 June 1998 |url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/06/29/sport/HODDLE.HTM |accessdate=5 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514100417/http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/06/29/sport/HODDLE.HTM|archivedate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he did not start in either of England's first two games.

===Euro 2000, and England captaincy===
The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during [[UEFA Euro 2000 Group A#Portugal vs England|England's 3–2 defeat]] by [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to Brooklyn {{cite web |title=Leader – Play games behind closed doors |work=New Statesman |date=26 June 2000 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200006260003 |accessdate=4 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127032613/http://www.newstatesman.com/200006260003|archivedate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham responded by [[finger (gesture)|raising his middle finger]] and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Media sympathy for Beckham's gesture |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 June 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/790657.stm |accessdate=4 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2000, following [[Kevin Keegan]]'s resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]], and then kept the role under new manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]].&lt;ref name="captain"/&gt;

Beckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on 6 October 2001.&lt;ref name="Greece"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2002/1575190.stm|title=England reach World Cup finals|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining. When [[Teddy Sheringham]] was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark.&lt;ref name="Greece"/&gt; Beckham was voted the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] for 2001, and finished runner-up, to [[Luís Figo]] of Portugal, for the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1715960.stm|title=Figo best in world|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002 FIFA World Cup===
[[File:020607beckhamPK.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham scoring a penalty against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the 2002 World Cup]]
Beckham was partially fit by the time of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/argentina_v_england/default.stm|title=England's revenge|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; England defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3–0 win.

The following month, at the opening ceremony of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester, Beckham escorted [[Kirsty Howard]] as she presented the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Jubilee Baton to the Queen]]. Beckham played in all of England's matches at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. He had a penalty saved in England's 2–1 defeat to France and missed another in a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] in the quarter-final match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Euros"/&gt; England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition.&lt;ref name="Euros"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3830451.stm|title=Portugal break England hearts|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham became a [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|Goodwill Ambassador]] in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Beckham, Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=UNICEF official website |url=http://www.unicef.org.uk/celebrity/celebrity_biography.asp?celeb_id=27&amp;nodeid=celeb27&amp;section=2 |accessdate=9 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101114432/http://www.unicef.org.uk/celebrity/celebrity_biography.asp?celeb_id=27&amp;nodeid=celeb27&amp;section=2|archivedate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.&lt;ref name="captain"/&gt;

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
In England's opening game at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an [[own-goal]] by [[Carlos Gamarra]] as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a [[Peter Crouch]] goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham gave another assist to [[Steven Gerrard]]. In the end they won 2–0. He was named [[Man of the Match]] by tournament sponsor [[Budweiser]].

During England's second round match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,&lt;ref name="Ecuador"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5103974.stm |title=England 1–0 Ecuador |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of [[dehydration]] and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.&lt;ref name="Ecuador"/&gt; In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991618.stm|title=England 0–0 Portugal|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/football/07/01/worldcup.portugal/|title=Portugal sink England on Penalties|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,&lt;ref name="captain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5138288.stm |title=Beckham quits as England captain |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, "It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95&lt;ref&gt;This was an error on Beckham's part – he had played 94 times for England by this stage.&lt;/ref&gt; games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under [[Steve McClaren]]." (Beckham had won 94 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] up to that point.) He was succeeded by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] captain [[John Terry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4782197.stm|title=Terry named new England skipper|accessdate=10 August 2006 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach [[Steve McClaren]] on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was "looking to go in a different direction" with the team, and that Beckham "wasn't included within that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4782613.stm|title=McLaren ends Beckham England era|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]], [[Kieran Richardson]], and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, [[Aaron Lennon]], were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ [[Steven Gerrard]] in that role.

===Post 2006 World Cup===
[[File:Beckhamtakesfreekick.jpg|thumb|Beckham takes the free kick against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] from which [[John Terry]] scored.]]
On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in England's first match at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain [[John Terry]]. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer [[Diego Ribas da Cunha|Diego]] equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Beckham sent two trademark assists for [[Michael Owen]] and [[Peter Crouch]], helping England to prevail 3–0. Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/06/EstoniaEngland_report.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080509055532/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/06/EstoniaEngland_report.htm|dead-url=yes|archivedate=9 May 2008|title=Three's the magic number|publisher=The Football Association|date=6 June 2007|accessdate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to [[Major League Soccer]].

On 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against [[Germany national football team|Germany]], becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Insider |first=The |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=455849&amp;root=euro2008&amp;cc=4716 |title=Becks and England suffer Wembley woe |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2–2. Following the 2–3 loss, England failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008 Finals]]. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7106741.stm |title=Beckham dismisses retirement talk |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Fabio Capello]], for a friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Beckham acknowledges lack of fitness |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/7845276/Beckham-acknowledges-lack-of-fitness |publisher=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302003736/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/7845276/Beckham-acknowledges-lack-of-fitness |archivedate=2 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===100 England caps, final appearance===
[[File:David Beckham, 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Beckham lining up a free kick for England in June 2008]]
On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against [[France national football team|France]] in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham to start in Paris for 100th cap |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/03/26/football.beckham/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329225706/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/03/26/football.beckham/index.html |archivedate=29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 28 May before the away fixture with [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from [[Bobby Charlton]], and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for [[David Bentley]], the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hart &amp; Jagielka in England Squad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7395247.stm |publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2008 |accessdate=11 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Capello names Beckham as captain for T&amp;T friendly |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/8193404/Capello-names-Beckham-as-captain-for-T&amp;T-friendly |publisher=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=31 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712104347/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/8193404/Capello-names-Beckham-as-captain-for-T%26T-friendly |archivedate=12 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in which England won 3–1 in [[Minsk]], Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-[[cap (sport)|capped]] player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with [[Bobby Moore]]'s record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for [[Stewart Downing]] in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=260599&amp;cc=5901 |title=Report: Spain vs England – International Friendly |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215121358/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=260599&amp;cc=5901 |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]], providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fletcher |first=Paul |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7966672.stm |title=International football as it happened |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt; His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|England 3 – 0 Belarus]].&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt;

After a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G|UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign]]. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt; In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that "I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think we need new players for the future", referring to the new players that play in Beckham's right midfield position, including [[Theo Walcott]] and [[Adam Johnson (footballer)|Adam Johnson]], adding "This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or another manager."&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt; He said that Beckham may be selected for one last friendly game, stating, "If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye." In response to the comments, Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed.&lt;ref name="BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8906692.stm |title=David Beckham has no England future, says Fabio Capello |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]], for a player of any position.&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt; Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the [[Great Britain Olympic football team]] at the 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/david-beckham-set-to-be-included-in-provisional-team-gb-olympic-squad-7830913.html|title=David Beckham set to be included in provisional Team GB Olympic squad|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not included in the final selection by manager [[Stuart Pearce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18673893|title=Team GB: David Beckham left out for football reasons – Stuart Pearce|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Platt''' (also '''Tilsley''')&lt;!--DO NOT REMOVE TILSLEY! DAVID WAS ORIGINALLY CREDITED AS THIS BECAUSE GAIL DIDN'T REGISTER HIM UNDER MARTIN'S NAME UNTIL LATER. HE WAS CREDITED AS 'DAVID TILSLEY' AFTER HIS BIRTH!--&gt; is a fictional character from the British soap opera, ''[[Coronation Street]]''. He was born on-screen during the episode broadcast on 25 December 1990. He was played by Thomas Ormson from his first appearance until 15 March 2000 when Ormson left. [[Jack P. Shepherd]] took over the role and made his first on screen  appearance on 26 April 2000.

==Storylines==
David is the son of [[Martin Platt|Martin]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]) and [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]). David was born on [[Christmas Day]] 1990. Martin's friend [[List of Coronation Street characters (1992)#Carmel Finnan|Carmel Finnan]] ([[Catherine Cusack]]) tried to kidnap David when he was a toddler. She also posed as his mother to other characters. Carmel then tries to frame Gail for pushing her down the stairs and is revealed to be mentally ill. In 2000, a nine-year-old David becomes jealous of the attention being paid to his newborn niece [[Bethany Platt]] (Amy and Emily Walton). He decides to gain attention by getting arrested for shoplifting. In 2001, Gail and Martin divorce after Martin has an affair with [[Rebecca Hopkins (Coronation Street)|Rebecca Hopkins]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]). David is unhappy and begins misbehaving in the hope that they will get back together. David becomes the target of a school bully and, despite Gail's advice to ignore the bully, he becomes violent and gets into fights. His behaviour worsens when Gail marries [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]) in July 2002, but he comes to accept Richard. In March 2003, Richard is revealed to be a serial killer, and tries to kill himself, Gail, David, Bethany, and her mother - David's sister - [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) by driving them into the local canal. Gail, Sarah, David and Bethany are all rescued, while Richard drowns. In the years following, David develops a penchant for lying and scheming at home and at school.

He is unhappy with Gail's relationship with Phil Nail ([[Clive Russell]]) and begins a hate campaign against Phil. David does not trust Phil, as a result of Richard's behaviour. Phil reaches breaking point with David and throws him up against a wall, threatening to beat him up. David tells Gail, but Phil lies to her, and Gail believes him and slaps David, unaware that he is telling the truth. Gail receives a card addressed from Richard. She suspects Phil of sending the cards. Realising David is behind the scam, Phil throws David across the table in front of Gail. An angry Gail ends their relationship. The Platt family still receive cards from Richard, and Gail realises David is the culprit. Gail blames herself for David's behaviour. In December 2006, David discovers Sarah's grandmother [[Ivy Tilsley]]'s ([[Lynne Perrie]]) diary and reads it, and is shocked that Gail had wanted to abort him, but he understands this after Gail told him that Ivy had been having a rough time since the death of her son and Gail's husband, [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]). He develops romantic feelings for [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie|Samia Smith]]), but is annoyed she is enjoying an affair with [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). Charlie threatens David into silence. David tries to blackmail Charlie, who tries drowning David in a bath to rid of him, but Maria walks in and saves him. In January 2007, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) murders Charlie, staging it to look like self-defence. David offers to testify for Tracy that he saw Charlie attack her, on the condition that she sleeps with him. Tracy agrees, but the prosecution proves David's testimony to be lies.

In January 2008, David begins a relationship with [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) and she becomes pregnant. In March 2008, Gail pays for an abortion and they decide not to tell David. He finds out and, in an argument, he pushes Gail down the stairs. He persuades Tina to give him an alibi, but she ends their romance. David smashes various vehicles and windows on the Street, attacks [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) and hits a policewoman. He is sentenced to four months in a [[Young Offender Institution|Young Offenders Institution]]. When he is released Tina reconciles with him, but faces more issues when a jealous David reads her emails. He dates [[Amber Kalirai]] ([[Nikki Patel]]) in an attempt to make Tina jealous, which has the desired effect and they get back together.

In November 2008, David feuds with the Windass family when they refuse to pay for work Tina's father [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe McIntyre]] ([[Reece Dinsdale]]) has carried out. David threatens [[Eddie Windass|Eddie]] ([[Steve Huison]]) and [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) with a crowbar. [[Len Windass|Len]] (Conor Ryan) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) steal Joe's work tools in retaliation. David then destroys their kitchen, so the Windass family remove the kitchen from the house. Gail and Anna are forced to call a truce to avoid more problems. David spends time away from Weatherfield when Tina wants nothing more to do with him. Upon his return he becomes jealous of Tina and Gary's friendship. David frames Gary for theft and also tricks him into buying stolen goods. He then enlists Gary to commit robbery, which goes wrong when Gail's father [[Ted Page (Coronation Street)|Ted Page]] ([[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]]), interrupts them, calls the police and has a heart attack. Gary decides to confess to the police, which leads to David being arrested. David becomes jealous when Tina begins a relationship with [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]). David discovers that Joe is addicted to prescription medication and agrees to supply him with drugs as long as he tries to break Tina and Jason up. In February 2010, Joe commits suicide, but the police presume he has been murdered and arrest Gail. David has to scheme in order to prove Gail's innocence. In late 2010, Tina begins a relationship with [[Graeme Proctor]] ([[Craig Gazey]]). This upsets David and he feels betrayed. David suffers a black-out while driving and knocks Graeme over. No one believes David's versions of events and the police arrest him for attempted murder. Before the court case is about to begin David passes out again and everyone begins to realise he was telling the truth. He is found to be suffering from [[epilepsy]].

David returns from a holiday engaged to [[Kylie Platt|Kylie Turner]] ([[Paula Lane]]). Gail is angry and tries to convince David to change his mind. David and Kylie then get married in April 2011. David fights to take custody of Kylie's son [[List of Coronation Street characters (2010)#Max Turner|Max Turner]] (Harry McDermott), but ends up feuding with her sister [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), with Kylie trying to avoid it. David insists that Steve and Becky aren't fit to look after Max, proving this when he saves Max from being run over. David has to deal with Gail and Kylie feuding. But when he learns that Gail has tried to bribe Kylie to leave, he threatens to leave home. Kylie gets a job at the salon with David. He is upset when Max is put up for adoption and she does not want to prevent this. He convinces her they must change their ways and convince social services to allow Max to live with them.

In August 2013, David discovers that Kylie has slept with Nick but does not confront them. He vandalises Nick's flat and writes poison pen letters to his wife Leanne. Nick tells David he knows he is behind the trouble and suggests they discuss it with Kylie. To prevent Kylie from finding out David causes a car accident. Nick is left in a coma which results in permanent brain damage. David learns he is Lily's biological father, but when Kylie discovers his acts of revenge she throws him out. Following their reconciliation, Max is diagnosed with [[ADHD]] in August 2014 and Kylie becomes addicted to his medication. David restricts Kylie's access to the medication, but she compensates with an amphetamine addiction. He throws Kylie out and she leaves Weatherfield on Christmas Day 2014.

In January 2015, Max's father [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward) arrives and wants access to Max. When David refuses Callum starts a custody battle, which begins a violent feud. Kylie returns in May 2015 and helps strengthen David's claim to Max. Their feud escalates, and he manipulates Sarah and Bethany (now played by [[Lucy Fallon]]). When they try to frame Callum for a crime in September 2015, he attacks Sarah and Kylie kills Callum to protect her. David decides to help cover the murder up and buries the body down a man hole in their home. When a car crash occurs in May 2016, rescue workers find Callum's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Coronation Street|title=Callum's Body Is Discovered - Coronation Street|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX6h1FEZzuA|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is initially the main suspect, but they frame the recently deceased [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), Jason's father, another of Callum's enemies, who happens to be dead. In July 2016, Kylie decides she cannot live in the house Callum died in any longer. David agrees to relocate their family to Barbados. Their plans are ruined when [[Clayton Hibbs]] (Callum Harrison) stabs Kylie in the street and she dies in David's arms. David then attacks Clayton who is then charged with Kylie's murder. Gail is concerned about David and his calm attitude towards planning Kylie's funeral.

In October 2016, David wants revenge for Kylie's murder, believing their will be no justice for Kylie. He publicly names Clayton, despite Clayton being aged under 18, as Kylie's killer and attempts to kill Macca Hibbs, Clayton's step-brother, whilst he's in hospital. David plans his final act of revenge on Clayton by crashing his new car into the police van Clayton is in whilst igniting a large amount of petrol to blow them both up. After he makes a suicide video, Gail, Nick and Sarah see it and lock David in the Bistro cellar until the trial is over. After tricking Gail into thinking that he has committed suicide, David escapes the Bistro, gets into his car that is covered in petrol and drives off. However, as he speeds along, David spots Lily on the road and swerves to avoid her, but ends up flipping the car, which lands on Lily and Gary (who had attempted to get Lily to safety). Some of the residents are able to get Gary and Lily out as David manages to get out of the car. However, a spark causes the car to catch fire and cause an explosion, setting Anna on fire and badly injuring her, whilst David looks on in horror. Sarah admits to Gary, who she is in a relationship with, what David did, but Sarah persuades him not to tell anyone for the sake of Max and Lily. David inherits £20,000 from a client who dies, as well as a dog. Gary finds out from Sarah about the money, so David gives Anna and Kevin £19,000. In 2017, he begins a relationship with an older woman called [[Shona Ramsey]] ([[Julia Goulding]]), not knowing that she is Clayton's estranged mother. 

In March 2018, David is drugged and raped by his new friend [[Josh Tucker]] (Ryan Clayton) following a night out. He is left ashamed and embarrassed. He then goes to visit Martin, who is moving to [[New Zealand]], in Liverpool with Max and Lily. Martin, sensing something is wrong with David, goes back to Weatherfield to speak to him.   Following the rape David starts lashing out at everyone, worrying Shona, Gail, Martin, Sarah, Gary, Bethany and Audrey as well as many other residents. He takes Tyrone's place in the charity boxing event, his opponent is Gary when they fight, David has flashbacks and he brutally attacks Gary while everyone watches in horror. This leaves Gary fighting for his life, Sarah doesn't believe her own brother would do such a thing. But what no one knows but David himself is he's still suffering mentally and emotionally from when Josh drugged and raped him, this leads to him breaking up with Shona, saying he doesn't love her anymore. This leads to her moving out and moving in with [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) at Roy's rolls. He later starts a relationship with [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell) who is a year older than Bethany. On the day of his trial for attacking Gary, he runs off while his solicitor [[Imran Habeeb]] (Charlie De Melo) is distracted. Shona finds him and he reveals his rape to her after finding out about [[Aidan Connor]]'s ([[Shayne Ward]]) suicide. They get back together and Shona promises to stay by his side. David later tells Gail and Audrey about the rape while Gail tells Sarah. While doing community service for beating up Gary, he and another man make homophobic jokes towards gay vicar [[Billy Mayhew]] ([[Daniel Brocklebank]]). When Billy later asks him to apologize, David refuses and Billy locks the door. David breaks down and admits to Billy that he was raped. Billy later follows David when he follows Josh and a potential victim. Billy tells him to go home and to do nothing. Billy later contridicts himself and warns the man of Josh. Josh gets beaten up by this man and ends up in hospital. He becomes blind and Billy regularly visits him out of guilt. Billy then let’s Josh live with him. David and Shona find out and are disgusted with Billy. He is also furious when he finds out that Bethany knew about Billy visiting Josh in hospital. After Josh re evaluates his behaviour, he visits David in the salon, however he still won't admit to raping him. David kidnaps him and tricks him into thinking they are outside a police station.

Fearing real-life imitation of the scene in which David was tortured by [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]], many formal complaints were filed by viewers with the Government’s Office of Communications.  In the end, "''Coronation Street'' was cleared by TV watchdogs after 31 complaints about scenes of 'bullying and torture'". Investigators eventually ruled that the torture scenes "were editorially justified by plot development, characters involved and the manner of editing."&lt;ref name="stubbs"&gt;{{cite news |title=Coronation Street in the clear |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |publisher=([[News UK]]) |date=13 March 2007 |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article16967.ece |accessdate=16 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209111248/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article16967.ece |archivedate=9 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Stewart of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''  refers to the character as "David Pratt" when writing reviews of any storyline he features in, due to the character's way of seemingly always getting away with outlandish things. In magazine articles he is often referred to as "Demon David", "Teen Tormenter" or "Psycho Platt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/soapland/2009/05/coronation-street-ted-man-walk.html |title=Coronation Street: Ted man walking |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]]) |first=Tony|last=Stewart |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603072102/http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/soapland/2009/05/coronation-street-ted-man-walk.html |archivedate=3 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/soapland/2008/11/coronation-street-kitchen-sink.html |title=Coronation Street: Kitchen sink dramas |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]]) |first=Tony|last=Stewart |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202233341/http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/soapland/2008/11/coronation-street-kitchen-sink.html |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dolores Jiménez y Muro''' (June 7, 1848 – October 15, 1925) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] schoolteacher and revolutionary.  A native of [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes]], Mexico, she rose to prominence during the [[Mexican Revolution]] as a [[Socialist]] activist and reformer and as a supporter and associate of General [[Emiliano Zapata]].

==Biography==
Dolores Jiménez y Muro was born June 7, 1848, in Aguascalientes, Mexico, but while young her family moved [[San Luis Potosí]].&lt;ref name="GOB (1990)"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dolores Jiménez y Muro|url=http://www.aguascalientes.gob.mx/Aguascalientes2010/1910/personajes.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=Gobierno del  Estado de Aguascalientes|year=1990 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423050628/http://www.aguascalientes.gob.mx/Aguascalientes2010/1910/personajes.html |archive-date=2017-04-23 |language=es |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in the upper middle class of San Luis Potosí, where her father was a senior government official. The family had many liberal friends and from her childhood Jiménez was exposed to foreign and liberal ideas. She had no formal schooling, studying at home, but was encouraged to pursue her talent for poetry.&lt;ref name="López (2001)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=López|first1=Oresta|last2=Hernández|first2=Varinia| title=Olvidadas mujeres de la revolución|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/11/05/arts_39/39_dolores_imuro.htm|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=Jornada|date=5 November 2001|publisher=National Autonomous University of Mexico|language=Spanish |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, she was invited by the state government to read her poems at an official celebration of the September independence festivals. These poems were later collected into a book and published as ''Un rayo de luz'' (A Ray of Light).&lt;ref name="Rivera (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivera|first1=Amalia|title=Dolores Jiménez y Muro|journal=Toda Mujer|year=2008|url=http://qacontent.edomex.gob.mx/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=134955&amp;dDocName=DOLORES_JIM%C3%89NEZ_Y_MURO&amp;allowInterrupt=1|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=GOB de Edomex|language=Spanish|df=mdy-all}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 Jiménez lost both of her parents&lt;ref name="López (2001)" /&gt; and she began teaching school.&lt;ref name="Rivera (2008)" /&gt; She became aware of how easily one could fall into poverty or become exploited.&lt;ref name="López (2001)" /&gt;

===Pre-Revolutionary radicalism===
Dolores Jiménez published in La Esmeralda and La Sombra de Zaragoza and by 1902 had become the director of La Potosina Magazine.&lt;ref name="GOB (1990)" /&gt; She continued to teach in the rural school system until 1904, when she moved to Mexico City. She published articles against the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport (2001)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Helen|title=Encyclopedia of Women Wocial Reformers|date=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.

In prison, she met [[Elisa Acuña|Elisa Acuña Rossetti]], [[Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza]], and [[Inés Malváez]]. From prison, the woman began publishing a radical journal, ''Fiat Lux''.&lt;ref name="Mirandé (1981)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mirandé|first1=Alfredo|last2=Enríquez| first2=Evangelina|title=La Chicana: The Mexican-American Woman|date=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-53160-0|pages=205–206|edition=Phoenix|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=Q9Bgyns4suYC&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;ots|accessdate=4 April 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, she joined the staff of the ''La Mujer Mexicana'' (Mexican Women) for whom she worked until 1908. She also published articles in ''Diario del Hogar'' (Newspaper of the Home).&lt;ref name="Rappaport (2001)" /&gt;

In 1907, Acuña, Belén and Jiménez y Muro founded the "Daughters of Anahuac", a group of about three hundred libertarian women, who demanded improved working conditions for women and advocated labor strikes. In 1908, Jiménez founded, with Acuña, Belén, and [[Jose Edilberto Pinelo]], a worker's organization in Mexico City called "Mexican Socialism." They continued to publish the newspaper ''Fiat Lux'', as the voice of an organization called the Mutual Society for Women.&lt;ref name="Fair (2011)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fair|first1=José A.|title=Elisa Acuña maestra anarcofeminista de Mejico|url=http://puertoreal.cnt.es/bilbiografias-anarquistas/4020-2013-10-12-05-44-44.html|accessdate=4 April 2015|publisher=Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo uerto Real|date=May 12, 2011|language=Spanish |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Jiménez and others founded the Club Femenil Antirreeleccionista Hijas de Cuauhtémoc (Anti-Reelectionist Women's Club: Daughters of Cuauhtémoc).&lt;ref name="Rivera (2008)" /&gt; The club, including members [[Mercedes Arvides]] and [[Julia Nava de Ruisánchez]] staged a demonstration in Mexico City on 11 September 1910 protesting election fraud.&lt;ref name="López (2001)" /&gt; These activities and a failed attempt at rebellion by supporters of Arriaga resulted in the arrest of Jiménez, Acuña, Belén, and [[María Dolores Malváes]] and their imprisonment at [[San Juan de Ulúa]] fortress in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Fair (2011)" /&gt;

===Revolutionary radicalism===
In prison in 1911, Dolores Jiménez continued to be politically active in jail and founded ''Regeneración y Concordia''.&lt;ref name="Rappaport (2001)" /&gt; Through this she sought to further the changes that she desired to see in Mexico. She envisioned a country where there were significant improvements to the economy and land reforms. She also wanted changes to improve the living conditions of women and indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Mirandé (1981)" /&gt; ''Regeneración y Concordia'' had feminist aims which her partners, Acuña, Belén and  Sara Estela Ramírez joined her work.&lt;ref name="Palomo Acosta (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palomo Acosta|first1=Teresa|title=Sara Estela Ramírez|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fra60|accessdate=4 April 2015|agency=Texas State Historical Association|publisher=Handbook of Texas Online|date=June 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 1911, [[Francisco I. Madero]] called for demonstrations in Guerrero, Michoacan, Tlaxcala, Puebla and Campeche, and Jiménez organized the protests.&lt;ref name="Rivera (2008)" /&gt; She was a notable contributor to the [[Complot de Tacubaya]], which sought to depose President [[Porfirio Díaz]] in favor of [[Francisco I. Madero]]. She is credited with writing "The Political and Social Plan", published on March 18, 1911, which outlined the ideas and aims of the conspirators. The "Plan" advocated a continuation of the demands the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] had made in 1906, including fair wages, affordable housing, improved working conditions, and curbs on foreign investment. It also promoted the decentralization of the country's education system, on the premise that a school's needs are best met when it is locally funded and controlled. Unlike earlier revolutionary theorists, however, Jiménez insisted that wage should be increased for women as well as for men. She also insisted that foreign firms operating in Mexico should be required to have at least half of their workforce made up of Mexicans.&lt;ref name="Rappaport (2001)" /&gt;

After the plan was read in Mexico City on 31 October 1911, interim president [[Francisco León de la Barra]] had Jiménez arrested. In spite of her age, (she was in her 60s and most of her compatriot revolutionaries were in their 20s), she was refused release until she staged a hunger strike.&lt;ref name="GOB (1990)" /&gt; She realized that Madero was not a supporter of the radical reforms she supported and switched her loyalty to [[Emiliano Zapata]].&lt;ref name="Rappaport (2001)" /&gt; In 1913, she joined the Zapatista forces and developed the prologue to the [[Plan de Ayala]]. She directed the newspaper ''La voz de Juárez'' from which denounced the coup led by [[Victoriano Huerta]] to overthrow Madero.&lt;ref name="GOB (1990)" /&gt; Zapata appointed her to a position of brigadier general but that was insufficient to prevent an eleven-month imprisonment ordered in 1914 by Huerta.&lt;ref name="López (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rivera (2008)" /&gt; She was released from prison and rejoined Zapata until his assassination in 1919.&lt;ref name="Rappaport (2001)" /&gt;

===Post-revolution===
Between 1921 and 1924, Jiménez worked in the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]]'s Cultural Missions program.&lt;ref name="Rivera (2008)" /&gt;

She died on October 15, 1925, in [[Mexico City]], at the age of 77.&lt;ref name="GOB (1990)" /&gt;

== Career ==

Vianna came to the wine world by happenstance. She studied Biology in undergrad at Vassar College in New York and worked as a clinical toxicologist after completing her undergraduate education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winetable.com/blog/winemaker-in-the-spotlight-elizabeth-vianna/|title=Winemaker in the Spotlight: Elizabeth Vianna - WineTable.com|last=Wines|first=Brian|date=2012-11-16|website=WineTable.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in New York City an working in [[New York Hospital]]-[[Weill Cornell Medicine|Cornell Medical Center]], she tasted a glass of 1985 Sociando Mallet while at an auction at [[Christie's|Chrisie's Auction House]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webpages.scu.edu/womenwinemakers/view.php?id=271|title=Women Winemakers of California {{!}}Elizabeth Vianna|website=webpages.scu.edu|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This newfound appreciation for wine led her to apply to the [[University of California, Davis]] for a masters program in [[winemaking]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chimneyrock.com/Philosophy/WinemakingTeam|title=Chimney Rock - Winemaking Team|last=Solutions|first=eWinery|website=www.chimneyrock.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in school, Vianna began an internship at Chimney Rock.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When she graduated in 1999, Vianna became an enologist at that Napa company, and was named assistant winemaker there in 2002.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She then advanced to the position of winemaker in 2005.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2011, Vianna was promoted to General Manager of the winery, while continuing in her role as head winemaker of this Stags Leap District estate enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDAtAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Elizabeth+Vianna&amp;dq=Elizabeth+Vianna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi68bL45oDYAhXHRt8KHaX9DBM4FBDoAQgvMAE|title=Bon Appétit|date=January 2010|publisher=Bon Appétit Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annia Galeria Faustina''', sometimes referred to as '''Faustina I''' ([[Latin]]: '''Faustina Major''';&lt;ref&gt;An inscription from Liguria ({{CIL|05|07617}}) refers to her (in the genitive) as &lt;small&gt;DIVAE FAVSTINAE MAIORIS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; born on February 16&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levick|2014|page=137}}, citing the ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'' 3.7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Italiae'' [http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi_einzel_en.php?p_belegstelle=InscrIt-13-02,+00043 '''13'''(02): 43].&lt;/ref&gt; around 100 CE;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levick|2014|page=169}}, estimates Faustina the Elder's birth year as {{circa|97}} CE, while noting the estimate of {{circa|105}} in {{cite book|author=D. Kienast |title=Römische Kaisertabelle: Grunzüge einer römischen Kaiserchronologie |location=Darmstadt |publisher=Wissenschaflische Gesellschaft |date=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; died in October or November of 140 CE&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony. ''Marcus Aurelius'', Routledge, p. 243. Routledge, 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-17125-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to S. Vidman's interpretation of the ''Fasti Ostienses'' (1982, p. 122; cited by {{harvp|Beckmann|2012|page=22}}), Faustina died sometime in the range 21-23 October, while her funeral occurred sometime between 6 and 12 November. See Beckmann (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;), was a Roman empress and wife of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]]. The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] was her nephew and later became her adopted son, along with Emperor [[Lucius Verus]].  She died early in the principate of Antoninus Pius, but continued to be prominently commemorated as a ''[[Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#divus|diva]]'', posthumously playing a prominent symbolic role during his reign.&lt;ref name="pietas"/&gt;

==Early life==
Faustina was the only known daughter of [[Roman consul|consul]] and prefect [[Marcus Annius Verus]] and [[Rupilia|Rupilia Faustina]].&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/faustina/faustina_i.html |title=Faustina I |website=Livius.org |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brothers were consul [[Marcus Annius Libo]] and [[praetor]] [[Marcus Annius Verus (praetor)|Marcus Annius Verus]]. Her maternal aunts were Roman Empress [[Vibia Sabina]] and [[Matidia Minor]]. Her paternal grandfather was named Marcus Annius Verus, like her father, while her maternal grandparents were [[Salonia Matidia]] (niece of Roman Emperor [[Trajan]]) and suffect consul [[Libo Rupilius Frugi|Lucius Scribonius Libo Rupilius Frugi Bonus]]. Faustina was born and raised in [[Rome]].

While a private citizen, she married Antoninus Pius between 110 and 115 CE. Faustina bore Antoninus four children: two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/art/buerger/catalogue/098.html |title=Draped bust of Faustina the Elder (aureus of Antoninus Pius) |website=Bearers of Meaning: The Ottilia Buerger Collection of Ancient and Byzantine Coins at Lawrence University |author=K.L.M. |date=1996 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were:
* Marcus Aurelius Fulvius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forvm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=Faustina%20Senior |title=Faustina Senior |website=FORVM ANCIENT COINS |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forvm"/&gt; He is commemorated by a high-quality series of bronze coins, possibly struck at Rome, though their language is Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beckmann|2012|page=83}}. His name appears as &lt;small&gt;ΓΑΛΕΡΙΟϹ ΑΝΤⲰΝΙΝΟϹ&lt;/small&gt; (''Galerios Antôninos'') on these coins.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Aelius Lamia Silvanus or Syllanus. She appears to have had no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forvm"/&gt;
* Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or [[Faustina the Younger]] (between 125-130 to 175), a future Roman Empress; she married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. She was the only child who survived to see Antoninus and Faustina elevated to the imperial rank.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forvm"/&gt;

According to the unreliable ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', there were rumours while Antoninus was proconsul of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] that Faustina conducted herself with "excessive frankness and levity".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]: Antoninus Pius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Antoninus_Pius*.html 3.7] (the original phrase is ''nimiam libertatem et uiuendi facilitatem''). {{harvp|Levick|2014|pages=79-80}}, analyzes this passage with some scepticism. The ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]''’s reliability as a historical source is considered to be patchy (see the caveats in, for example ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Volume 2, Latin Literature, Part 5, The Later Principate'', E. J. Kenney, Wendell Vernon Clausen, pp.&amp;nbsp;43, 45, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1983, {{ISBN|0521273714}}; or at {{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/hi-hn/ha/hist_aug.html |title=Historia Augusta |accessdate=2015-09-21 |author=Jona Lendering}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empress==
[[File:Buste de Faustine l'Ancienne 3a.jpg|left|thumb|Bust of Faustina in the Musei Capitolini (side view; note the distinctive hairstyle)]]

On July 10, 138, her uncle, the emperor [[Hadrian]], died and her husband became the new emperor, as Antoninus was Hadrian's adopted son and heir. Faustina became Roman Empress and the Senate accorded her the title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]''.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;  As empress, Faustina was well respected and was renowned for her beauty and wisdom.  Throughout her life, as a private citizen and as empress, Faustina was involved in assisting charities for the poor and sponsoring and assisting in the education of Roman children, particularly girls.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} A letter between [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] has sometimes been taken as an index of the latter's devotion to her.&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Pius declares that he would rather live in exile on the island of [[Gyaros]] with Faustina than on the Palatine Hill without her. Fronto ''ad Antoninum Pium'' 2.2. However, the "dear Faustina" referred to may instead have been [[Faustina the Younger|Pius' daughter]]. {{harvp|Levick|2014|pages=60-61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Antoninus Pius' accession to the principate, the couple never left Italy; instead, they divided their time between Rome, Antoninus' favourite estate at [[Lorium]], and other properties at [[Lanuvium]], [[Tusculum]], and [[Segni|Signia]].{{sfnp|Levick|2014|page=57}}

Faustina's personal style was evidently much admired and emulated. Her distinctive hairstyle, consisting of braids pulled back in a bun behind or on top of her head, was imitated for two or three generations in the Roman world.{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|pages=10, 16}}

Several provincial groups chose to honour her while she was empress: a company of couriers in [[Ephesus]] named themselves after her,{{sfnp|Levick|2014|page=122}} while a company of [[Clapper (musical instrument)|clapper]]-players in Puteoli dedicated an altar to her in her own lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levick|2014|page=122}}. The inscription in question is {{CIL|10|1643}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==

Faustina died near Rome in 140, perhaps at Antoninus Pius' estate at [[Lorium]].{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=22}} Antoninus was devastated at Faustina's death and took several steps to honor her memory. He had the Senate [[Imperial cult (Rome)|deify her]] (her ''[[apotheosis]]'' was portrayed on an [[column of Antoninus Pius|honorary column]]) and dedicate the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina|Temple of Faustina]] to her in the [[Roman Forum]].&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt; The Senate authorized gold and silver statues of her, including an image to appear in the [[Circus (building)|circus]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|HA]]'' Pius 6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; where it might be displayed in a ''carpentum'' (a kind of covered waggon) or ''currus elephantorum'' (a cart drawn by elephants).{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|pages=32-33}} Antoninus also ordered various coins with her portrait struck, inscribed &lt;small&gt;DIVA FAVSTINA&lt;/small&gt; ("Divine Faustina") and elaborately decorated. He also established a charity called ''Puellae Faustinianae'' ("Girls of Faustina") to assist orphaned Roman girls and created a new ''alimenta'' (see [[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/tonypis.htm |title=Antoninus Pius |website=De Imperatoribus Romanis: An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors |author=Richard D.

The spelling ΦΑΥΣΤΙΝΑ was used in Alexandria, ΦΑΥΣΤΕΙΝΑ elsewhere in the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|East]]; both spellings could be found in Delphi.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Beckmann suggests that the coins of Nicopolis might have been minted at Rome and given out as imperial largesse at the [[Actia|Actian Games]].{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=81}} The coins issued in the wake of Faustina's funeral illustrate her elaborate funeral pyre, which may have influenced the design of later private mausolea;{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|pages=23-27}} the deities [[Pietas]] and [[Aeternitas]], among others;&lt;ref&gt;Beckmann (2012) considers that Pietas and Aeternitas are evocative of "the 'spiritual side' of Faustina's divinisation" (p. 19).&lt;/ref&gt; and an eagle (or less often a winged genius) bearing a figure aloft, with the legend &lt;small&gt;CONSECRATIO&lt;/small&gt; (i.e. Faustina's ascension into heaven).{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|pages=23, 28-30}} Coins of Faustina were sometimes incorporated into jewellery and worn as amulets.{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|pages=17-18}}

[[File:Base de la columna Antonina 01 crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.33|Depiction of Pius and Faustina being borne aloft on the back of a winged figure. From the base of the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]].]]

The posthumous cult of Faustina was exceptionally widespread, and Faustina's image continued to be omnipresent throughout Antoninus Pius' principate.{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|page=6}} A colossal marble head, believed to be that of Faustina and discovered in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7560833.stm |title=Head of Roman empress unearthed |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; figured as one of several monumental imperial statues at the ancient site of [[Sagalassos]] in today's [[Turkey]]. In Olympia, [[Herodes Atticus]] dedicated a nymphaeum that displayed statues of Faustina and other Antonines as well as his own ancestors.{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|page=11}} Faustina also appears on the [[:commons:Category:Parthian Monument|Parthian Monument]] at Ephesus commemorating members of the imperial family.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=91}} Bergmann and Watson have characterized the commemoration of Faustina as central to Antoninus Pius' political persona.&lt;ref name="pietas"&gt;{{harvp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|page=6}}: “Antoninus’s ideological program was based upon his ''pietas'' (loyalty to family, state, and the gods) and the most concerted expression of Antoninus’s piety was Faustina’s consecration.”&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|page=11}} One larger-than-life statue, discovered ''in situ'' near the Termini railway station at Rome, appears to depict Faustina as [[Concordia (goddess)|Concordia]], with a [[patera]] and cornucopia; it would have been displayed alongside statues of [[Diana (goddess)|Diana Lucifera]] and [[Apollo]]-[[Sol (god)|Sol]] in [[Thermae|baths]] privately owned but available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beckmann|2012|pages=85-86}}. The statue is [http://capitolini.info/scu00048/?lang=en now on display] in the Musei Capitolini.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus and Faustina were officially held up as such exemplars of conjugal harmony that newlyweds were directed to pray at an altar of Antoninus and Faustina that they might live up to their example.{{sfnp|Freisenbruch|2010|page=209}} This was evidently the case in Ostia,&lt;ref&gt;Thus {{harvp|Beckmann|2012|pages=36-37}}, arguing from the evidence of an inscription from Ostia ({{CIL|14|5326}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and probably so in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beckmann|2012|page=37}}, suggests that [[Cassius Dio]] (''Roman History'' 72.31.1) may have been mistaken in stating that such a practice in Rome at the temple precinct of Venus and Dea Roma concerned an altar of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Faustina the Younger]] rather than one of Antoninus Pius and Faustina the Elder.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina|Temple of Faustina]] is thought to have been dedicated in 144 CE.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=19}} It is a grand{{sfnp|Levick|2014|pages=123-124}} [[Portico#Roman hexastyle|hexastyle]] structure{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=44}} with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]],{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=46}} possibly designed originally to be a temple of [[Ceres (goddess)|Ceres]].{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=48}} Depictions on coins appear to show a cult image of Faustina seated on a throne and holding a tall staff in her left hand.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=67}} Faustina's portrait on coins from this period is often crowned as well as veiled, which may also recall a feature of Faustina's cult image from the temple.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=50}} 

[[File:Piranesi-16063.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|The church of [[Sant'Urbano alla Caffarella, Rome|Sant'Urbano alla Caffarella]] near Rome, originally built as a private shrine of Ceres and Faustina]]
The deified Faustina was associated particularly closely with [[Ceres (goddess)|Ceres]], who featured prominently on coins of Faustina; for some years, the torch-bearing Ceres was the dominant motif in her gold coinage.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=62}} Herodes Atticus venerated Faustina as the “new [[Demeter]]” (the Greek equivalent of Ceres) at a private sanctuary he established outside Rome,{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|page=14}} now the church of [[Sant'Urbano alla Caffarella, Rome|Sant'Urbano]].{{sfnp|Levick|2014|page=127}} In addition to Ceres, [[Vesta (deity)|Vesta]] and [[Juno (deity)|Juno]] feature prominently in Faustina's coinage.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|page=71}} She was also associated with the [[Cybele|Magna Mater]] and at Cyrene with [[Isis]]; at [[Sardis]] she was worshipped conjointly with [[Artemis]].{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|page=14}} 

Ten years after Faustina's death, a new commemorative coinage was introduced, featuring the legend [[Aeternitas]] ('eternity'); such coins may have been introduced to be distributed at a public ceremony in her memory.{{sfnp|Beckmann|2012|pages=63-64}}

After Antoninus Pius' death, his adoptive sons and successors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]] erected the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]], which dramatically depicted Antoninus and Faustina being elevated heavenward together on the back of a winged figure.{{sfnp|Freisenbruch|2010|page=210}}

Faustina continued to be commemorated in certain Renaissance depictions as a “model wife”.{{sfnp|Bergmann|Watson|1999|pages=12-13}}

==The Great Migration==
{{Main|Finnish American|Finnish Canadian}}
The years between 1870 and 1930 are sometimes referred as 'the Great Migration' of Finns into North America. In the 1870s, there were only 3,000 migrants from Finland, but this figure was rapidly growing. New migrants often sent letters home, describing their life in the New World, and this encouraged more and more people to leave and try their luck in America. Rumors began of the acres of land that could be cleared into vast productive fields and the opportunity to earn "a barrel of American dollars" in mines, factories, and railroads. There were also professional recruiters, or 'agents', employed by [[mining]] and [[shipping]] companies, who encouraged Finns to move to the United States. This activity was frowned upon by the authorities of the Grand Duchy, and was mostly done in secret. It was eventually brought to an end in the late 1880s by legislation in the United States, but the decade still saw a 12-fold increase in the number of Finnish migrants compared to the previous decade, as 36,000 Finns left their home country for North America.

'''Francis J. Underwood''' is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American adaptation of ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', portrayed by [[Kevin Spacey]]. He is depicted as a ruthless politician who rises from [[House Majority Whip]] to [[President of the United States]] through treachery, deception and murder.  He is based on [[Francis Urquhart]], the protagonist of the British novel and television series ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'', from which the American [[Netflix]] series is drawn. He is married to [[Claire Underwood]] ([[Robin Wright]]), but also had a sexual relationship with Zoe Barnes ([[Kate Mara]]) in [[House of Cards (season 1)|season 1]]. He made his first appearance in the series' [[pilot episode]], "[[Chapter 1 (House of Cards)|Chapter 1]]".

Underwood is from [[Gaffney, South Carolina]]. He graduated from The Sentinel (a fictionalized version of [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]]) in 1981 and, subsequently, [[Harvard Law School]] in 1984. Some of Underwood's dialogue throughout the series is presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the [[fourth wall]]. The character speaks with a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]]. During season 1, he is the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. In [[House of Cards (season 2)|season 2]], he is the newly appointed [[Vice President of the United States]], before becoming [[President of the United States]] in the season finale.

Underwood has been described as conniving, [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]], [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]], and a symbol of political corruption. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his own ends. Among other crimes, he personally commits murder twice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the deaths of two former employees, critically injures a member of his cabinet to prevent her testifying against him, and [[False flag|indirectly allows the murder of a civilian for political ends]].

Spacey has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Frank Underwood, but the character itself has been criticized for its repetitive nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rachel|last=Handler|title='House Of Cards' Has Been Renewed For A Fifth Season, But Not Everybody Is Coming Back|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/house-of-cards-beau-willimon-exit/|publisher=uproxx.com|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margaret|last=Lyons|title=House of Cards Has a Frank-and-Claire Problem|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/house-of-cards-frank-claire.html|website=[[Vulture.com]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=March 3, 2015|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one-dimensionality.&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Bady|title='House of Cards' Should Stop Trying to Be 'The West Wing'|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121214/house-cards-should-stop-trying-be-west-wing|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=March 4, 2015|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|title='House of Cards' season 2 in review: It gets weaker the more you watch |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/house-of-cards-season-2-in-review-it-gets-weaker-the-more-you-watch|website=hitfix.com|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey was one of the first three actors playing leading roles in web-television series to be nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s at the [[65th Primetime Emmy Awards]].

On November 3, 2017, following [[sexual assault]] claims made against Spacey, Netflix cut ties with the actor, putting the character's fate in question.&lt;ref name="suspended"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Kate|last=Stanhope|title=Netflix Severs Ties With Kevin Spacey|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-officially-severs-ties-kevin-spacey-1054981 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date= November 3, 2017 |accessdate= November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a teaser trailer for the [[House of Cards (season 6)|sixth season of ''House of Cards'']], it is shown that Underwood died in 2017 and is now buried next to his father in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Denise|last=Petski|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/house-of-cards-frank-underwood-fate-revealed-season-6-teaser-kevin-spacey-robin-wright-1202457517/ |title=‘House Of Cards’: Frank Underwood’s Fate Revealed In Season 6 Teaser |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 5, 2018|access-date=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and description==

===Early life===
Francis J. Underwood was born on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in [[Gaffney, South Carolina]]. He is an only child.&lt;ref name="WwFUaD" /&gt; He was raised in impoverished circumstances, with the threat of bank foreclosure on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], loosely based on [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]], in the fall of 1976. He graduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into [[Harvard Law School]]. He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from there in 1984.&lt;ref name="WwFUaD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santos|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/2/27/8119829/house-of-cards-spacey-southern-accent|title=What linguists say about Kevin Spacey's bizarre Southern accent on House of Cards|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=New York City|date=February 27, 2015|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADSP" /&gt; While at the Sentinel, he had a [[homosexual]] relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]), which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian, but holds God in complete contempt.&lt;ref name="Jeffries, Stuart"&gt;{{cite web|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/feb/27/house-of-cards-recap-episodes-two-three-and-four-frank-speaks-to-god|title=House of Cards recap: episodes two, three and four= Frank speaks to God|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=February 27, 2015|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Underwood's great-great-great-grandfather, Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood, was a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldier who served in the 12th [[South Carolina]] [[Infantry]] [[Regiment]] of McGowan's Brigade at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Battle of Spotsylvania]]. He served at the Bloody Angle on May 12, 1864, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and was killed by a bludgeon to the back of the head from his own regiment during the middle of the night. Underwood is fascinated by his ancestry. When Underwood falls into a coma following an assassination attempt, Augustus appears in several of his hallucinations. However, he dismisses the Confederacy as weak and calls their cause of preserving the institution of slavery "asinine". His great-great grandfather was two when Augustus was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = | year =2014 | title =House of Cards (U.S. TV series) |trans-title=House of Cards (season 2) | medium =Streaming video | language = | accessdate =February 15, 2014 | format = | time = | location =Chapter 18, 29:10 remaining | publisher =[[Netflix]] | id = | isbn = | oclc = | quote = | ref =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach farmer in his home town of Gaffney who died at the age of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father attended a meeting of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = | year =2013 | title =House of Cards (U.S. TV series) |trans-title=House of Cards (season 1) | medium =Streaming video | language = | url =http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70178217&amp;trkid=222336&amp;strkid=1298074483_0_0&amp;strackid=1c708963a16703dd_0_srl&amp;fdvd=true#MovieId=70178217&amp;EpisodeMovieId=70248291 | accessdate =March 16, 2014 | format = | time = | location =Chapter 3, 20:05 remaining | publisher =[[Netflix]] | id = | isbn = | oclc = | quote = | ref =}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Aaron|last=Couch|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/house-cards-frank-underwoods-10-680304|title='House of Cards': Frank Underwood's 10 Most Ruthless Moments (Poll)|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 13, 2014|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3.

Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/mar/05/house-of-cards-recap-season-two-episode-13|title=House of Cards recap, series two, episode 13 – 'Cut out his heart and put it in his hands'|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=March 5, 2014|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood is utterly ruthless and [[Machiavellian]], and is willing to commit any crime, including murder, to further his goal of attaining power. Many critics have described him as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Shaili|last=Jain|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-aftermath-trauma/201503/the-case-francis-underwood|title=The Case of Francis Underwood|magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "pure evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Daw|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-03-04/11-despicable-crimes-frank-underwood-has-committed-in-house-of-cards/|title=11 despicable crimes Frank Underwood has committed in House of Cards|magazine=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|location=London, England|date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, Underwood's thoughts throughout the series are presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref name="NOSHOC"&gt;{{cite web|first=Roth|last=Cornet|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/01/netflixs-original-series-house-of-cards-from-david-fincher-and-kevin-spacey-may-be-the-new-face-of-television|title=Netflix's Original Series House of Cards -- From David Fincher and Kevin Spacey -- May be the New Face of Television|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately prior to starring in ''House of Cards'', Spacey had starred in a production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' as [[Richard III of England]],&lt;ref name="NOSHOC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KSL" /&gt; a character that serves as a partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood.&lt;ref name="Uidd" /&gt; His last name is derived from [[Oscar Underwood]], who served as the first Democratic [[House Minority Whip]] from about 1900 to 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kirsty|last=McCormack|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/459786/Kate-Mara-joins-Kevin-Spacey-at-the-premiere-of-House-of-Cards-season-two|title=Kate Mara steals the show at 'House of Cards' season premiere in sexy cut-out dress|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=[[Northern and Shell Media]]|location=London, England|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing [[video games]];&lt;ref name="RHoCRfST"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=James|last=Poniewozik|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/02/12/review-house-of-cards-returns-for-season-two/|title=Review: House of Cards Returns for Season Two: Kevin Spacey's D.C. power play still has cynical bite, but some old problems remain.|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.

Spacey viewed portraying Underwood for a second season as a continuing learning process. "There is so much I don't know about Francis, so much that I'm learning... I've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective... We are given clues by writers... Then you lay them all out and try to make them come alive as a character who's complex and surprising, maybe even to yourself."&lt;ref name=KSdS2oHoC&gt;{{cite web|first=Frazier|last=Moore|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/2014/02/12/kevin-spacey-dealing-season-house-cards/tnmxGYqDuEe4DMekzXBOfO/story.html|title=Kevin Spacey dealing Season 2 of 'House of Cards'|website=[[Boston.com]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' television critic [[James Poniewozik]], by the end of the first episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because "I'm feelin' hungry today!", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: "She's as tough as a two-dollar steak" and plans to destroy an enemy the way "you devour a whale. One bite at a time".&lt;!--not sure if the last one is from Ch1 or Ch2--&gt; He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by "[imagining] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet."&lt;ref name=RHoCSISTiW&gt;{{cite magazine|first=James|last=Poniewozik|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/01/31/review-house-of-cards-sinks-its-sharp-teeth-into-washington/|title=Review: House of Cards Sinks Its Sharp Teeth into Washington|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Goodman of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' notes that, in Season 2, with Underwood's new position as Vice President, "He's got more power now and that means he instills more fear in his enemies".&lt;ref name=HOCTRTHR/&gt; At one point during the season, he states "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties.

====Sexuality====
Underwood's sexuality is ambiguous throughout much of the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in "Chapter 8" he had an experience with homosexuality in college.&lt;ref name=HoCRE8&gt;{{cite news|first1=David|last1=Carr|first2=Ashley|last2=Parker|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/house-of-cards-recap-episode-8-you-can-go-home-again-it-just-might-get-complicated/|title='House of Cards' Recap, Episode 8: You Can Go Home Again, It Just Might Get Complicated|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 21, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1.&lt;ref name=HoCRE8/&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' journalist [[Hanna Rosin]] noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being "secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hanna|last=Rosin|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/03/house_of_cards_do_frank_and_claire_underwood_have_an_ideal_marriage.html|title="More Than Sharks Love Blood": Do Frank and Claire Underwood have the ideal marriage?|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=McGee|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/house-of-cards-the-complete-first-season-93614|title=House Of Cards: "Chapter 8"|work=[[The A.V.

The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.

=== Relationships ===

====Relationship with Claire Underwood====
Stelter described Frank and Claire Underwood as a "scheming" couple.&lt;ref name="NDWi2PEN" /&gt; [[Michael Dobbs]], the author of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] and [[Lady Macbeth]].&lt;ref name="Uidd" /&gt; Underwood says, "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood."&lt;ref name="FAER" /&gt; While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joanne|last=Ostrow|url=http://www.denverpost.com/television/ci_22483448/kevin-spacey-shines-house-cards-political-drama-netflix|title=Ostrow: Kevin Spacey shines in "House of Cards" political drama on Netflix|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|location=Denver, Colorado|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PATS" /&gt; [[Hank Stuever]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' describes her as an ice-queen wife.&lt;ref name="HoCPC"&gt;{{cite news|first=Hank|last=Stuever|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/house-of-cards-power-corrupts-plus-other-non-breaking-news/2013/01/31/b72c54b6-6bd0-11e2-8740-9b58f43c191a_story.html|title='House of Cards': Power corrupts (plus other non-breaking news)|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, "My husband doesn't apologize... even to me."&lt;ref name="PATS"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/arts/television/house-of-cards-on-netflix-stars-kevin-spacey.html|title=Political Animals That Slither: 'House of Cards' on Netflix Stars Kevin Spacey|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis.&lt;ref name="RHoCSISTiW" /&gt; Smith says "The Underwoods have proven themselves almost robotic in their pursuit of power."&lt;ref name="SsoHoCiavfv" /&gt; Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good."&lt;ref name="HOCTRTHR"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Tim|last=Goodman|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/house-cards-tv-review-676602|title=House Of Cards: TV Review|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willimon notes that "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do."&lt;ref name="HoCpmpas"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Oldenburg|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/02/12/house-of-cards-season-2-kevin-spacey-more-plotting-scheming/5420181/|title='House of Cards' promises more 'plotting and scheming'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=February 13, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Mary McNamara makes the case that ''House of Cards'' is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=McNamara|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-house-of-cards-review-20140214,0,3657138.story#axzz2tK1ANdYr|title=Review: 'House of Cards' plays new hand with brutal, clear resolve|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood and Claire engage in a threesome with their Secret Service bodyguard Edward Meechum at one point in season 2, but have otherwise largely given up intramarital and extramarital sex in favor of their pursuit of power. ''[[International Business Times]]'' critic Ellen Killoran notes that this may relate back to Underwood's quotation of [[Oscar Wilde]] to Zoe Barnes in Season 1: "A great man once said, 'everything is about sex ''except'' sex. Sex is about ''power''.'" Avoiding sex may retain the balance of power in their relationship.&lt;ref name=HoCS2RBQRANB&gt;{{cite web|first=Ellen|last=Killoran|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/house-cards-season-2-review-burning-questions-remain-after-netflix-binge-1556355|title='House of Cards' Season 2 Review: Burning Questions Remain After Netflix Binge|work=[[International Business Times]]|publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=February 18, 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with Claire is the epicenter of season 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Baynard|last=Woods|url=http://citypaper.com/film/review-house-of-cards-season-2-1.1640752|title=Review: House of Cards Season 2: Francis Underwood gives liberals their own Dick Cheney: a vice president able to push through his agenda.|newspaper=[[Baltimore City Paper|City Paper]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=February 26, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2014|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025543/http://citypaper.com/film/review-house-of-cards-season-2-1.1640752|archivedate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with Zoe Barnes====
Underwood develops an intimate relationship with ''Washington Herald'' and ''Slugline'' reporter Zoe Barnes ([[Kate Mara]]), with Claire's knowledge.&lt;ref name="DFBW&amp;KMONHoC" /&gt; As the show begins, Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the Fairfax County Council beat to covering what's going on "behind the veil of power in the Capitol hallways."&lt;ref name="HoCPC" /&gt; By the end of the first episode, Barnes is among the cadre of Underwood's accomplices. They begin a relationship, with Barnes promising to earn his trust and not "ask any questions" in return for his supplying her with sensitive political information.&lt;ref name="PATS" /&gt; Toward the end of Season 1, she ends their personal relationship and begins investigating his connection to Congressman Peter Russo's apparent suicide (Underwood had in fact killed him by flooding his car with [[carbon monoxide]] while the Congressman was passed out drunk).&lt;ref name="SsoHoCiavfv" /&gt; Underwood ultimately kills Barnes in the season 2 premiere, by pushing her in front of an oncoming [[Washington Metro]] train after she begins to follow clues related to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=D'Addario|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/02/15/yes_that_really_just_happened_on_house_of_cards/|title=Yes, that really just happened on "House of Cards"|website=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 15, 2014|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with Edward Meechum====
Underwood is fond of the head of his Secret Service detail, Edward Meechum ([[Nathan Darrow]]), and it is hinted several times that they harbor unacknowledged sexual feelings for each other. When Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography, Underwood and Claire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men.  Shortly after Underwood becomes vice president, he, Claire and Meechum have a [[threesome]].

Meechum remains Underwood's bodyguard once he becomes the president, and there does not appear to be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates ([[Paul Sparks]]) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.

When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood during a campaign event, Meechum trades fire with the would-be assassin, and both die at the scene. Meechum's death is one of the tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them.

===Underwood-Urquhart comparisons===
Underwood is an Americanized version of the original BBC series lead character [[Francis Urquhart]], a [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] post-[[Margaret Thatcher]] [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party]]. Urquhart employs deceit, cunning, murder, and blackmail to influence and pursue the office of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. According to series producer [[Beau Willimon]], the change in last name stemmed from the "[[Dickensian]]" feeling and "more legitimately American" sounding resonance of the name 'Underwood'. Whereas Urquhart is an aristocrat by birth, Underwood is a [[self-made man]], having been born into a poor Southern family with an alcoholic father.&lt;ref name="DFBW&amp;KMONHoC" /&gt; Urquhart was one of television's first [[antihero]]es,&lt;ref name="Uidd" /&gt; whereas Underwood follows the more recent rash of antiheroes that includes [[Tony Soprano]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', and [[Dexter Morgan]] of ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]''.&lt;ref name="KSL" /&gt; However, unlike most other antiheroes, Underwood is not forced into immorality either by circumstance (White), birth (Soprano) or upbringing (Morgan). In his review of Season 2, ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Alan Jones writes that Underwood is evil by choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Jones|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/house-of-cards-season-two|title=House of Cards: Season Two|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|publisher=Slant Magazine LLC|location=Brooklyn, New York|date=February 18, 2014|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the character is based on the BBC show's lead character, in interviews during the writing and filming of [[House of Cards (season 2)|season 2]], creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] as a source of themes and issues addressed in ''House of Cards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=Leopold|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/28/showbiz/tv/beau-willimon-house-of-cards-q-and-a/index.html|title='House of Cards' creator Beau Willimon plays a solid hand|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 28, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[center-right]] Urquhart, who leads the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], the [[center-left]] Underwood is a member of the Democratic Party, but cares little for ideology in favor of "ruthless pragmatism" in furthering his own political influence and power.&lt;ref name="WwFUaD"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Sirota|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/12/why_is_francis_underwood_a_democrat/|title=Why was Francis Underwood a Democrat?|website=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 12, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breaking the fourth wall===
Spacey summed up Underwood's relationship with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks [[Meta-reference|the fourth wall]] - as being like that of a "best friend" and "the person [he trusts] more than anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tanya|last=Gharemani|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/14708-house-of-cards-kevin-spacey-isnt-talking-to-you-when-he-speaks-into-camera|title='House of Cards' Kevin Spacey Isn't Talking To You When He Speaks Into Camera|website=[[Bustle.com]]|publisher=Bustle Digital Group|location=New York City|date=February 5, 2014|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, "Did you think I had forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had."&lt;ref name="SsoHoCiavfv" /&gt; In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Underwood vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps "What're you lookin' at?!"

For the first four seasons, Underwood was the only character to break the fourth wall until the very end of the fourth season, during which Claire - though silent - addresses the camera directly with him. In the fifth season, Claire also addresses the camera directly, on one occasion explaining that she had always known they were there, but didn't know if she could trust them. At the end, after usurping the Presidency from Underwood and deciding not to grant him a pardon, she looks into the camera again and states "My turn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jackie|last=Strause|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/house-cards-season-5-finale-claire-breaks-fourth-wall-showrunners-q-a-1010414|title='House of Cards' Bosses Break Down Those Final Two Words of Season 5|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 7, 2017|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the show, Underwood is a Democratic Majority Whip in the House of Representatives, where he has represented [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]] since 1990.&lt;ref name="WwFUaD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aaron|last=Blake|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/12/17/obama-wishes-d-c-worked-more-like-it-does-in-house-of-cards/|title=Obama wishes D.C. worked more like it does in 'House of Cards'|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web|first=Terry|last=Plumb|url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/09/29/5244416/humble-pie-on-the-menu.html |title=Humble pie on the menu |work=[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=Rock Hill, South Carolina|date=September 29, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2014 |dead-url=yes| archive-url=https://archive.is/20140118022043/http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/09/29/5244416/humble-pie-on-the-menu.html |archive-date=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood is passed over for an appointment as [[United States Secretary of State]] even though he had been promised the position after ensuring the election of [[Governor of Colorado|Colorado Governor]] Garrett Walker ([[Michel Gill]]) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez ([[Sakina Jaffrey]]) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 [[United States presidential inauguration]]. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper ([[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]]), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with ''Washington Herald'' reporter Zoe Barnes ([[Kate Mara]]), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=McGee|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/house-of-cards-the-complete-first-season-93105

Peter Russo ([[Corey Stoll]]), encouraging him to quit drinking and run for Governor of Pennsylvania; then his underlings create enough pressure in the race to push Russo into publicly falling off the wagon and ruining his career. Underwood finally murders him and makes it look like suicide. He persuades Vice President Jim Matthews ([[Dan Ziskie]]) to resign so he can run for the office he previously held, Governor of Pennsylvania, the race being wide open following Russo's death. In the season finale, "Chapter 13", Underwood is appointed Vice President to replace Matthews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Jancelewicz|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/chris-jancelewicz/house-of-cards-season-1-episode-13-finale-recap_b_3214841.html|title=House Of Cards Season 1, Episode 13 Recap: All's Well That Ends Well (Or Not)|website=[[Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=May 4, 2013|accessdate=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood assumes the position of [[Vice President of the United States]].

Season 3 begins with Underwood's presidency off to a rocky start: six months into his term, he is unpopular with the public, and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward. He plans to secure his legacy with an ambitious jobs bill, America Works, but the Democratic Congressional leadership refuses to support it; they also tell him that they will not support him if he seeks the presidential nomination in the next election. He nominates Claire for [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], but her nomination is defeated after she makes a gaffe during a Senate nomination hearing.&lt;ref name="Jeffries, Stuart"/&gt;

Underwood announces that he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by stripping entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar ([[Elizabeth Marvel]]) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women's votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the [[Iowa caucuses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Richard|last=Lawson|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/house-of-cards-season-3-recap|title=Where Does Frank Underwood Go From Here, and Other House of Cards Season 3 Questions|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Underwoods' marriage is faltering. Underwood gives Claire the ambassador job in a [[recess appointment]], but she is forced to resign in order to solve a diplomatic crisis. Claire begins to question whether she still loves her husband, and they get into an ugly fight in which he tells her that she is nothing without him. Season 3 ends with Claire leaving Underwood as he prepares for the [[New Hampshire primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Chapter 39|series=House of Cards|network=Netflix|airdate=February 27, 2015|season=3|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Warlow|last=Stern|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-explosive-house-of-cards-finale-creator-beau-willimon-on-the-state-of-the-underwoods.html|title=The Explosive 'House of Cards' Finale: Creator Beau Willimon on the State of the Underwoods|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]]|location=New York City|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood trails Dunbar in the polls, eventually losing the New Hampshire primary. Realizing that he needs Claire to win, he persuades her to come back by promising to support her run for a congressional district in Texas. However, he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally's daughter, in order to keep Claire focused on his campaign. On the day of the [[South Carolina primary]], Claire retaliates by arranging for two compromising photos to be leaked: one of Underwood's father with a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]], and one of Underwood posing with a Confederate Civil War re-enactor. Underwood deduces that Claire was behind the leaks, and confronts her. Claire calmly admits what she did, and puts forth a proposition: that she run as his vice president. He angrily rejects the idea.

Lucas Goodwin is released from prison and, seeking revenge for Barnes' death, shoots Underwood at a campaign rally, hitting him in the liver. He also mortally wounds Meechum, who manages to kill him before succumbing to his injuries. Underwood is rushed to the hospital for immediate surgery, and falls into a coma. It is soon discovered that he needs a liver transplant. Stamper manages to bump him to the top of the transplant list, and he survives. Once he recovers, he agrees to let Claire run as his vice president.

Dunbar drops out of the race due to the discovery of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin a few days before the attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway ([[Joel Kinnaman]]). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting [[brokered convention|open convention]], Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant ([[Jayne Atkinson]]), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Lowery|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/columns/house-of-cards-review-kevin-spacey-robin-wright-complete-fourth-season-binge-viewers-spoilers-1201725921/|title=Review: 'House of Cards,' The Complete Fourth Season for Binge Viewers (SPOILERS)|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When American extremists loyal to the [[terrorist]] group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a suburban family, Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them, making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt ([[Boris McGiver]]) exposes Underwood's crimes in the ''Washington Herald''. Facing disgrace and possible [[impeachment]], Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit in the weeks before the election.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Chapter 52|series=House of Cards|network=Netflix|airdate=March 4, 2016|season=4|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days before the election, Underwood pushes Congress to formally declare war on ICO, and orders the CIA to kill one of the terrorists and make it look like he had died fleeing capture. Underwood still lags in the polls, however, and on election night it appears he is going to lose to Conway. With help from Stamper and campaign strategist LeAnn Harvey ([[Neve Campbell]]), Underwood has NSA contractor Aidan Macallan ([[Damian Young]]) stage a [[cyberattack]] on several election stations. He also uses the fear of a possible terrorist attack to pressure the governors of Tennessee and Ohio to halt voting. The tactics work; the two states refuse to declare a winner, and the election drags on unresolved for several weeks.

The presidency is finally set to be decided by a [[contingent election]] in the House. Neither Underwood nor Conway receive enough votes, however, so Underwood appoints Claire Acting President until the House votes again. Underwood tries to convince Arizona Congressman Alex Romero ([[James Martinez (actor)|James Martinez]]) to vote in his favor, but when Underwood refuses to help him with his own agenda, Romero forms a committee to impeach him.

The Underwoods blackmail Conway's influential campaign manager Mark Usher ([[Campbell Scott]]) into joining their side by threatening to release recordings  of Conway berating a pilot and his running mate Ted Brockhart ([[Colm Feore]]) threatening to kill Frank. Once Usher begins working for them, they release the tapes anyway, which costs Conway the election. Underwood is now [[President-elect]], but his past once again comes back to haunt him when Hammerschmidt writes a story linking him to Barnes' death.

When Romero's committee intensifies its investigation, Underwood tries to divert public attention by ordering troops into [[Syria]] under the pretense of preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her down a flight of stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation is part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed, and persuades Stamper to "confess" to murdering Barnes.

For Underwood's plan to work, however, Claire has to [[presidential pardon|pardon]] him and Stamper, which would damage her credibility with the public. Claire promises him that she will grant the pardons, but makes no mention of them during her first address to the nation as president. Angered, Underwood calls her several times, but each time he gets her [[voicemail]], causing him to worry that she has abandoned him. He breaks the fourth wall and says, "If she doesn't pardon me, I'll kill her."

Spacey's portrayal was not without detractors: ''[[Hitfix]]'' reviewer [[Alan Sepinwall]] accused him of "hamming it up" and "phoning it in on a not very good show to begin with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|website=Ask Alan|title=Best movie star on TV, 'Constantine' and best-cast TV show ever|url=http://www.hitfix.com/videos/ask-alan-best-movie-star-on-tv-constantine-and-best-cast-tv-show-ever|accessdate=May 1, 2016|format=movie|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531155424/http://www.hitfix.com/videos/ask-alan-best-movie-star-on-tv-constantine-and-best-cast-tv-show-ever|archivedate=May 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
Reviews for season 3 of ''House of Cards'' were mostly positive. However, a few critics found the Underwood character was becoming repetitive: the critical consensus on the review aggregation site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] held that, "Season three introduces intriguing new political and personal elements to Frank Underwood's character, even if it feels like more of the same for some."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/house-of-cards/s03/&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Power of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "Everyone in House of Cards has an agenda - a secret twitching in the attic. The thrill, and the horror, may lie in the degree to which we catch reflections of real life in its dark, cool contours." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed|last=Power|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11438369/House-of-Cards-season-3-episode-1-review.html|title=House of Cards, season 3, episode 1, review: 'an underwhelming return'|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media]]|location=London, England|date=February 27, 2015|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics opined that the Underwood character is less interesting once he achieves his goal of becoming president and actually has to govern. "You could take the show seriously just as long as you didn't have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," wrote Aaron Bady of ''[[The New Republic]]'', who compared Underwood unfavorably with [[Josiah Bartlett]] of ''[[The West Wing]]''. "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage."&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com"/&gt;

Critics continued to praise Spacey's performance, however. Don Kaplan of ''[[The New York Daily News]]'' wrote, "Underwood's bottomless appetite for dark dealing keeps Spacey so deliciously detestable you can't help but keep rooting for the bad guy to win." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Don|last=Kaplan|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/house-cards-tv-review-article-1.2129365|title='House of Cards' TV review: Season 3 is worth your weekend|newspaper=[[The New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 4===
In season 4, Jacob Solworthy wrote in his review of the first six episodes of season four: "Until now, 'House of Cards' has centred on the character's outward expression of power -- not to mention his hunger for it -- but the writers have shrewdly stripped that back, instead focusing on the character's internal fears in a way not dissimilar from [[Tony Soprano|Tony]]'s dream sequences in '[[The Sopranos]]'," he later added, "You'll never root for Frank more than you do by the end of these six episodes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jacob|last=Stolworthy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/house-of-cards-season-4-spoiler-free-thoughts-on-first-six-episodes-a6907091.html|title=House of Cards season 4: Spoiler-free thoughts on the first six episodes|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Daniel Fienberg from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' was critical of Spacey's performance, writing: " Spacey's performance, which at least had an appealingly theatrical extravagance when the series began, has grown less enjoyable. Having reached a pinnacle, there's no way to root for Frank's striving anymore, if you ever were, but House of Cards has yet to commit to urging us to root for Frank's downfall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Fienberg|title='House of Cards' Season 4: TV Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/house-cards-season-4-tv-872024|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also considerable mention of the evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. "[T]heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds," wrote Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a "[[jump the shark]]" moment for the series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/house-of-cards-season-4-episode-13-the-live-binge-review-chapter-52-season-finale/472518/ |title=House of Cards season 4, Episode 13: The Live-Binge Review|magazine=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brandon|last=Griggs|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/entertainment/house-of-cards-season-4-reviews-feat/index.html|title=House of Cards Season 4: What's the Verdict?|publisher=[[cnn.com]]|date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Moyland of ''[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''House of Cards'' has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of [[Donald Trump]], [[Ted Cruz]], [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Bernie Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Moyland|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/04/house-of-cards-kkk-connection-frank-underwood-donald-trump-share |title=House of Cards: A KKK connection isn't all Frank Underwood and Donald Trump share|newspaper=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Season 5===
Spacey's performance as Frank Underwood in Season 5 - along with the series itself - received mixed reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of [[Vox Media]] called Spacey's performance "hamstanding", and said, "It’s as if House of Cards wants to make Frank go full authoritarian dictator, but lacks the wherewithal to actually push its reality toward some sort of alternate dystopia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|title=House of Cards season 5 review: Netflix’s drama plays differently in 2017 — but the reason has little to do with Trump|website=[[Vox (magazine]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=New York City|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Daniel Flenberg called Spacey's Underwood "increasingly broad and hammy" in season 5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Flenberg|title='House of Cards' Season 5: TV Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/house-cards-review-1008300|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 29, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Time''{{'}}s Daniel D'addario wrote that the character was too one-dimensional to elicit a good performance from Spacey: "Underwood isn’t [[Richard Nixon|Nixonian]] or [[Bill Clinton|Clintonian]] (pick your villain); he’s a flat character for whom recognition is its own reward. This may make the show a surprisingly good fit for our times. But onscreen as in life, the desire for fame alone is insufficient motivation to compel viewers to stay tuned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=D'addario|url=http://time.com/4793881/house-of-cards-returns-review/|title=Review: House of Cards Returns With a Thud|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 25, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics praised him, however. "Spacey’s honeysuckle drawl and flinty-eyed leer are as amusing as ever. He’s almost always the broadest performer in any given room, but that’s part of the show’s design — a way of drawing us into the character’s almost omnisciently evil mindset," wrote [[Vulture.com]]'s Matt Zoller Seitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Zoller Seitz|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/house-of-cards-season-five-review.html|title=House of Cards’ Fifth Season Is Bonkers, in a Good Way|website=[[Vulture.com]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|date=May 29, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen wrote, "Spacey seems invigorated by the material, and perhaps, our moment. He’s certainly buffed and honed Frank to a shine while grounding it, scuffing it, by playing to mortality and age. He’s an All-Star Survivor, but a gray one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jeff|last=Jensen|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/02/house-of-cards-season-5-review/|title=House of Cards review: Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright infuse 'wicked fun' into season 5|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 2, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics noted that the character of Frank Underwood gained a new resonance when considered in the context of the [[Trump administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Johana|last=Desta|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/house-of-cards-season-5-trump|title=Trump vs. Underwood: 7 Times House of Cards Hit a Little Too Close to Reality|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=May 30, 2017|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In a deliciously cynical flourish, the commander-in-chief’s response to whisperings about his misdeeds is to conjure a bogeyman in the shape of terrorist group Ico, which he presents as a clear and imminent danger to America," Ed Power wrote for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. "This yields the returning series’s first stone-cold Trump-ism as Underwood announces plans to shut America’s borders to unwelcome outsiders. Real world events are further echoed as protestors gather outside the White House chanting 'not my President'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|first=Ed|last=Power|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/house-cards-back-pitch-black-best-season-5-review/|title=House of Cards is back to its pitch-black best – season 5 review|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=June 1, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and nominations===

'''Gian-Carlo Coppola''' (September 17, 1963 – May 26, 1986) was an American film producer.

==Early life==
Coppola was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the son of set decorator/artist [[Eleanor Coppola]] ([[married and maiden names|née]] Neil) and famed film director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. As the eldest Coppola sibling, he was the older brother to [[Roman Coppola|Roman]] and [[Sofia Coppola|Sofia]].

Gian-Carlo was close friends and once a couple with [[Tracy Reiner]], daughter of director [[Penny Marshall]].

==Career==
Gian-Carlo began his professional filmmaking career at the age of 16, working closely with his father. Like his brother and sister, Gian-Carlo—known to his family and friends as Gio—often featured in his father's movies as background characters (''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[The Conversation]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now#Redux|Apocalypse Now Redux]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]''), later acting as associate producer for ''Rumble Fish'' and ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', and second unit director on ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]].''

In ''The Godfather'', he appeared with his brother Roman as the two sons of [[Robert Duvall]]'s [[Tom Hagen]] character, and they can be seen during the street fight and [[Vito Corleone]]'s funeral right behind Duvall and [[Al Pacino]].

During the pre-production phase of ''Gardens of Stone'', Gian-Carlo was given the responsibility of filming the rehearsals and supervising the electronic cinema staff. There was also potential for Gian-Carlo to intern with director Steven Spielberg to work on the television series ''Amazing Stories'' before his passing. Director Penny Marshall had also hired him to work on the second unit for her feature film ''Jumpin' Jack Flash.''

==Death==
Coppola was killed in a speedboating accident on Memorial Day, 1986, aged 22, in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. [[Griffin O'Neal]], who was piloting the boat, had attempted to pass between two slow-moving boats, unaware that both boats were connected by a towline. While O'Neal barely had time to duck, Coppola was struck and killed.&lt;ref&gt;Tatum O'Neal, ''A Paper Life'', 0-060-75102-9 p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the incident, O'Neal was being directed by Francis Ford Coppola in ''[[Gardens of Stone]]'' and was subsequently replaced. O'Neal was later charged with manslaughter over the accident. He ultimately pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of "negligent operation of a boat", was fined $200 and sentenced to 18 months' probation in 1987. He eventually received an 18-day jail sentence for not performing 400 hours of community service as ordered.

At the time of his death, Coppola's fiancée, Jacqui de la Fontaine, was two months pregnant with their only daughter, [[Gia Coppola|Gian-Carla "Gia" Coppola]] (born on January 1, 1987). Gia is a writer-director, having made the 2013 film ''[[Palo Alto (2013 film)|Palo Alto]]''.

Francis Ford Coppola subsequently dedicated 1988's ''[[Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]'' to his son. A scene in Francis Ford Coppola's 2011 film ''[[Twixt (film)|Twixt]]'' shows the death of a character as being similar to his son's death.

At the Inglenook winery, owned by Eleanor and Francis in Napa, California, there is a 12-acre vineyard named the 'Gio vineyard,' after Gian-Carlo by the workers, which was planted in 1988.

Eleanor Coppola's touring art installation, 'Circle of Memory,' commemorates the life of Gian-Carlo and has been exhibited in San Diego, Oakland, Sante Fe, Montpellier, Salzburg, Stockholm, and Oslo.

'''Hemendra Mohan Bose''' ({{lang-bn|হেমেন্দ্রমোহন বসু}}) (1864 – 28 August 1916) was an Indian [[entrepreneur]], manufacturer of Kuntalin hair oil and Delkhosh brand of perfume.&lt;ref name="sbc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=Sengupta |editor1-first=Subhodh Chandra |editor2-last=Basu |editor2-first=Anjali |encyclopedia=Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Bibliographical Dictionary) |title=হেমেন্দ্রমোহন বসু |trans-title=Hemendramohan Basu |language=Bengali |edition=4th |date=January 2002 |publisher=Shishu Sahitya Samsad |volume=Volume 1 |location=Kolkata |isbn=81-85626-65-0 |pages=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Indian to manufacture [[phonograph|gramophone]]s.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Bose, Hemendra Mohan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bose,_Hemendra_Mohan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his businesses spurred from [[amateur|amateur pursuit]]s.&lt;ref name="hin"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/08/07/stories/2002080700200400.htm | title=Centenarian of the musical kind | newspaper=[[The Hindu]] | date=7 August 2002 | accessdate=22 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Bose was born in 1866 in [[Mymensingh]], where his father Haramohan Bose used to stay, the ancestral home of the family was in the village of Jaysiddhi, in [[Mymensingh District]]. According to Michael Kinnear, Bose was born in 1864 at his ancestral village.&lt;ref name="kinnear"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gramaphone Company's First Indian recordings, 1899-1908 |last=Kinnear |first=Michael S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location= |isbn=81-7154-728-1 |pages=42–44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DjL3WcQ2kEC |accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing I.A. he took admission in the [[Medical College Kolkata]]. While a student at the college, he suffered an accident where his eyes were scarred in acid. After recovering, he quit his medical career. In 1890, Bose began experimenting with perfume, and started his move into business.&lt;ref name="kin"&gt;Kinnear 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1894, Bose started his own business in perfume manufacturing, the H-Bose Perfumers at 62 [[Bowbazar Street]] in [[Kolkata]], where he distilled the perfumes. After the initial success, he added hair oil and other toiletries like lavender water, [[Eau de Cologne]], milk of rose etc. to his range of products.&lt;ref name="sbc"/&gt; He also set up a new manufacturing unit at 6 Shib Narayan Das Lane in Kolkata.&lt;ref name="kinnear"/&gt; His products included the famous Kuntalin hair oil and Delkhosh perfume.

By 1900, he had created a [[printing press]] and publishing house titled ''Kuntaline Press'' at 5 Shib Narayan Das Lane in [[Kolkata]] which incidentally was next door to his perfume business. In 1903, he instituted the Kuntalin Puraskar and encouraged young writers to showcase their talent. A short story written by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] was the first recipient of the Kuntalin Puraskar. Later Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's first printed publication ''Mandira'' won the Kuntalin Puraskar.&lt;ref name="sbc"/&gt;

Bose was a bicycle enthusiast. He himself could ride the bicycle and taught his friends how to ride it. In 1903, he along with his brother Jatindra Mohon Bose established the first Indian-owned cycle works the H. Bose and Co, - Cycles at 63-1, Harrison Road. The company was also the distributors of the [[Rover (motorcycles)|Rover]] bicycles.&lt;ref name="kinnear"/&gt; It was one of the first among his [[Swadeshi movement|Swadeshi]] ventures.&lt;ref name="bp" /&gt; He also learnt how to drive a motor car. In 1900, he bought a two sitter motor car and used to drive it himself.&lt;ref name="sbc"/&gt; He established the Great Eastern Motor Company and set up a repairing unit, the Great Eastern Motor Works in Park Street.&lt;ref name="sbc"/&gt;

=== Sound recording ===
In 1900, Bose began to make [[sound recordings]] privately,&lt;ref&gt;Vernon 53&lt;/ref&gt; after he had acquired an Edison [[phonograph]]. He began recording his friends in a leisurely fashion. Some of the first people recorded by H. Bose included his uncle, [[Jagadish Chandra Bose|Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose]], [[Prafulla Chandra Roy|P. C. Roy]], and his good friend [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="kin"/&gt; His company became known as "Bose Pathe Recordings" which later became "H. Bose Swadeshi Records". By 1907, the demand for Bose's recordings grew so great that he began producing his own [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinders]] for recording. H. Bose was a well known patron of the Swadeshi movement and many of his records covered this subject.&lt;ref name="bp" /&gt;

== Achievements ==
Bose was the pioneer of [[color photography]] in India. He used [[Autochrome Lumière]] slides for his photographs. He was the founder president of Sporting Union.

'''Hubie and Bertie''' are [[animation|animated cartoon]] [[mouse]] [[fictional character|characters]] in the [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series of cartoons. Hubie and Bertie represent some of [[animator]] [[Chuck Jones]]' earliest work that was intended to be funny rather than cute.

All of their cartoons were given Blue Ribbon reissues.

==First film==
Jones introduced Hubie and Bertie in the [[short film|short]] ''[[The Aristo-Cat]]'', first released on June 19, 1943.&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/hub-bert.htm Hubie and Bertie] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6f3zi5vEG?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/hub-bert.htm Archived] from the original on February 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the cartoon would serve as the template for most future Hubie/Bertie outings: a character with some mental illness or degree of naïveté (here, a cat who doesn't know what a mouse looks like) is psychologically tormented by the pair. They tell the hungry cat that he is a lion and a bulldog his prey, leading to several painful encounters for the cat.&lt;ref name=crave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/194407-the-top-5-chuck-jones-mouse-cartoons |title=The Top 5 Chuck Jones Mouse Cartoons |date=August 21, 2012 |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |accessdate=October 22, 2016 |archivedate=October 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161022155750/http://www.craveonline.com/culture/194407-the-top-5-chuck-jones-mouse-cartoons |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--on some browsers, the title may be obscured on the live CraveOnline page, but appears in the archived link--&gt;

Hubie and Bertie as designed by Jones are nearly identical mice with long snouts, large ears, and big, black noses. The two are [[anthropomorphic]], walking on their stubby hind legs and using their forelimbs as arms. They are primarily distinguished by their color: one is brown with a lighter-colored belly and face, while the other is gray. (Which mouse is which color changes from film to film.){{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Hubie has a [[Brooklyn]] accent. Bertie has large buck teeth, and a habit of responding to Hubie with "Yeah-yeah, sure-sure!" or snickering "Riot!" if Hubie has just proposed some scheme with comic potential.

[[Mel Blanc]] voiced Hubie. While historians differ on who voiced Bertie in the initial cartoon, [[Stan Freberg]] voiced him subsequently.&lt;ref name=toonopedia /&gt;

==Later films==
Bertie made a cameo in ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''.

''[[Trap Happy Porky]]'' (February 24, 1945) was their second appearance. Nameless, indistinguishable except for color, they appear only in the first act, stealing food from a Porky in nightshirt &amp; cap. They are silent except for a single "I'm only three and a half years old", and retreat when a cat shows up.

Jones would repeat the theme of mind-games several more times in his Hubie and Bertie shorts, as in their third cartoon, ''Roughly Squeaking'' on November 23, 1946. This time, Jones has the mice exploit a cat's stupidity by convincing him he's a [[lion]] and a [[dog]] is a [[moose]] he wants to eat. By the short's end, the cat thinks he's a lion, the dog believes he's a [[pelican]], and a bystanding bird (driven mad from watching the two) has pulled his feathers out and imagines himself a [[Thanksgiving]] [[turkey meat|turkey]]. The mice are here voiced by [[Mel Blanc]] (Hubie) and [[Stan Freberg]] (Bertie).

The short was followed by ''[[House Hunting Mice]]'' on September 6, 1947, where Hubie and Bertie run afoul of a housekeeping [[robot]].

In the next cartoon, ''[[Mouse Wreckers]]'', and for the remainder of the series, Blanc and Freberg would handle the voices of Hubie and Bertie, respectively.

==Cat and mouse==
Jones introduced a permanent "antagonist" of sorts for the mice in ''[[Mouse Wreckers]]''. The short was released in 1949 and was the first in which they are officially called "Hubie" and "Bertie". In the cartoon, the duo moves into a new home, only to discover that it is protected by champion mouser [[Claude Cat]] (the character's debut), voiced by Mel Blanc. The mice torment the cat both physically and mentally. The short was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award]].&lt;ref name=Cartoon&gt;{{bcdb title|407|Mouse Wreckers}} Retrieved on May 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mice would antagonize Claude in two more films: ''[[The Hypo-Chondri-Cat]]'', released in 1950, featured Hubie and Bertie making Claude think he's sick with various ailments and, ultimately, that he has died. In 1951's ''[[Cheese Chasers]]'', Hubie and Bertie inadvertently torment Claude when, after going overboard on a cheese raid and getting sick of their favorite food, they decide to commit suicide by trying to get Claude to eat them.

After these seven cartoons, Jones retired Hubie and Bertie but continued to use the characters (or mice resembling them) in [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles in other shorts whenever he needed a generic mouse for a gag, such as the unnamed mouse in ''[[Chow Hound]]'', who resembles Bertie, or the "killer" mice in ''[[Scaredy Cat]]''.

==Home Video==
All of the Hubie and Bertie cartoons are available, remastered, on ''[[Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: The Chuck Jones Collection]]'' on DVD and Blu-Ray.

==Later appearances==
Hubie and Bertie have made several cameos in Warner Bros. productions:

* They have also appeared in ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.

* Hubie and Bertie appear in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]''.

* In the 1996 movie ''[[Space Jam]]'', Hubie and Bertie play the [[public address]] [[announcer]]s during the basketball game where [[Michael Jordan]] and the Looney Tunes compete against the MonStars. Bertie's announcer voice was provided by [[Steve Kehela]].

* Hubie and Bertie make a cameo in ''[[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure]]''.

* Hubie and Bertie appear in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode "Too Close for Combat." They are hired by Queen Tyr'Ahnee and Martian Commander X-2 to break up Duck Dodgers and the Eager Young Space Cadet with their vocal impersonations of them. It nearly worked until Duck Dodgers and Cadet discovered them. They managed to persuade Hubie and Bertie into using their tricks on Queen Tyr'Ahnee and Martian Commander X-2.

* Hubie and Bertie briefly appear in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' opening.

* Hubie and Bertie appear in the ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'' segments "Appropriate Technology", "Daffy the Stowaway" and "Tweet Team".

* Hubie and Bertie have also appeared in some video games.

* Hubie is seen alone in the ''[[Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time]]'' level "The Carrot Factory".

* Both can be seen in the ''[[Space Jam (video game)|Space Jam]]'' video game.

Komol played at Rail FC in Douala&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitesse-agovv.nl/Oud_spelers/Speler/Job-Komol.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and was spotted at a youth tournament in France with the Cameroonian youth squad by [[Jan Streuer]] who brought him alongside [[Émile Mbamba]] and [[Soné Masué Kallé]] in the [[Vitesse Arnhem]] youth academy in the [[Netherlands]] in 1997. Komol was doing well in the youth and in the second team and he was training with the first team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/nieuws/article/detail/1203028/2008/11/22/Ook-toptalent-strandt-soms-onderweg.dhtml Ook toptalent strandt soms onderweg], Trouw, 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2000, Vitesse chairman Jos Vaessen announced that Komol tested positive for [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archief.nrc.nl/?modus=l&amp;text=Job+Komol&amp;hit=3&amp;set=1&amp;check=Y Vitesse: speler met hiv besmet], NRC Handelsblad, 16 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Komol was the first player in Dutch football with HIV and this caused a shock. Clubs started testing their players and questions arose over whether the disease could be transmitted during the game. Komol's playing license was suspended by the [[KNVB]]. Research showed that the risk of transmission during the game was less than 0.1% in Komol's case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archief.nrc.nl/?modus=l&amp;text=Job+Komol&amp;hit=2&amp;set=2&amp;check=Y `Besmettingsgevaar sporters is nihil'], NRC Handelsblad, 21 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

He was allowed to play again but the treatment of his disease prevented him from making the Vitesse team again. Because of his disease, Komol was granted [[permanent residency]] in The Netherlands. In 2005, he had an unsuccessful trial at [[Go Ahead Eagles]] and he played in the 2007/08 season at [[De Bataven]] in the [[Hoofdklasse]]. In 2008, he started playing at lower amateurside SMC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/nieuws/article/detail/1203028/2008/11/22/Ook-toptalent-strandt-soms-onderweg.dhtml Ook toptalent strandt soms onderweg], Trouw, 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2010 he plays at vv Erica'76, which merged to VV Dieren in 2012.

For some time, Wellings worked in journalism with journal New Society until continuing on to work with the Family Planning Association in health policy research. The next few years brought on the continuing [[HIV]]/[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic in which Wellings monitored responses amongst the public as Senior Research Officer at the Health Education Authority (HEA). There was some conflict with methods used to handle and distribute research to the media, where Wellings and other researchers had one idea of presentation while politicians had another. “My experience there made me seek a safe haven in academia, where I could tell the story as it was, without having to suppress data or manipulate angles”, states Wellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=Richard|date=2013-11-30|title=Kaye Wellings: pioneering figure in sexual health|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62346-6/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=382|issue=9907|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62346-6|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Wellings is a Professor of Sexual and Reproductive Health Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/|title=The London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine|website=LSHTM|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-leader of the third British [[National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles]].

Wellings co-writes several academic research papers with purpose to describe time trends and current patterns in sexual practices with opposite-sex partners among men and women aged 16–24 years in Britain, noting that more and younger folk are participating in sexual practices in more diverse ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42051827|title=Millennials 'experimenting more in bed'|date=2017-11-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucy, Lady Houston.jpg|thumb|Lucy, Lady Houston]]
'''Lucy, Lady Houston, [[Order of British Empire|DBE]]''' (8 April 1857 – 29 December 1936), born '''Fanny Lucy Radmall''', was a British philanthropist, political activist, and suffragette.&lt;ref name=Sentinel&gt;{{cite news|title=Astonishing Exploits of England's "Lady Bountiful"|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]|date=7 February 1937|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19370207&amp;id=0RhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ywwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6548,1096371&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1933, she published Britain's ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'',&lt;ref name=Sentinel/&gt; which was best known for its attacks on what the paper labelled the "unpatriotic" [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. She has been acknowledged as an aviation pioneer, "the saviour of the [[Spitfire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/battle-of-britain/8002754/Saviour-of-the-Spitfire.html |title=Saviour of the Spitfire |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Fanny Lucy Radmall was the daughter of Thomas Radmall, a woollen warehouseman and draper, and Maria Isabella Clark. She was born at 13 Lower Kennington Green, [[Lambeth]], the ninth child of ten children. As a young woman, she was a professional dancer, a [[chorus girl]] known as "Poppy". At the age of sixteen, she ran off to Paris with a wealthy man twice her age, Frederick Gretton, [[Baron Gretton|whose family]] owned the [[Bass Brewery]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Saviour of the Spitfire|author=Peter Almond|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=15 September 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/battle-of-britain/8002754/Saviour-of-the-Spitfire.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married at the time. Despite a tumultuous relationship, Gretton bequeathed Poppy £6,000 per year for life when he died in 1882.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==First two marriages==
On 3 September 1883, she married [[Lieutenant-Colonel|Lt.-Col.]] Sir Theodore Francis Brinckman, [[Brinckman baronets|3rd Baronet]] (1862–1937), the couple divorcing in 1895 after a long separation. She remarried in 1901, to [[George Byron, 9th Baron Byron|George Frederick William Byron, 9th Baron Byron]]. During their marriage, she was an active [[suffragette]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He died in 1917, the same year Lucy, then Baroness Byron, was appointed [[Dame (title)|Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) for her support of a home for nurses who had served in the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==Marriage to Sir Robert Houston==
Her third and final marriage was to [[Sir Robert Houston, 1st Baronet]], Member of Parliament for [[Liverpool West Toxteth (UK Parliament constituency)|West Toxteth]], and a shipping [[Business magnate|magnate]], on 12 December 1924. Houston is described in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' as "a hard, ruthless, unpleasant bachelor". They lived as [[tax exile]]s on the island of [[Jersey]]. When Sir Robert showed her his will, Lady Houston reportedly tore it up, telling him that £1,000,000 was insufficient.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Sir Robert then suffered a series of mental disorders and reportedly employed a [[food taster]] to ensure that he was not being poisoned. Sir Robert died on his yacht ''[[SY Liberty|Liberty]]'', on 14 April 1926, leaving his widow roughly £5.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Lady Houston left Jersey on the ''Liberty'', negotiating with the British Government during passage to England the payment of £1.6&amp;nbsp;million in death duties. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', "she paid for nine by-election meetings by the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|British National Government]] to be disrupted".&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004 edition), volume 28, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Schneider Trophy==
{{main|Schneider Trophy}}
Lady Houston gave generously to British aviation. In 1931, she donated £100,000 to [[Supermarine]], allowing them to win the [[Schneider Trophy]] in that year. The [[Royal Air Force]]'s entry for the 1931 race for the trophy was hindered by political opposition. On 15 January 1931, the [[Air Ministry]] refused a last-minute request by the [[Royal Aero Club]] for funds for an entry. The Ministry forbade the use of the aircraft that competed in the 1929 race; forbade RAF pilots of the [[High Speed Flight RAF|High Speed Flight]] who were trained to fly these seaplanes, to take part; and said that it would not police the race course in 1931 in the busy shipping lanes in the [[Solent]]. The Royal Aero Club sent a statement to the Cabinet on 22 January 1931, offering to raise £100,000, if the Government would rescind the Air Ministry's decrees on planes, pilots and policing.

Many newspapers backing the opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] wanted to put pressure on [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Second MacDonald ministry|Labour government]]. One newspaper sent a telegram to MacDonald stating that, "To prevent the socialist government from being spoilsports, Lady Houston will be responsible for all extra expenses beyond what Sir [[Philip Sassoon]] (President of the Royal Aero Club) says can be found, so that Great Britain can take part in the race for the Schneider trophy." The gift gave Lady Houston an opportunity to attack the Labour government, with the declaration "Every true Briton would rather sell his last shirt than admit that England could not afford to defend herself."&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

There were only nine months to prepare, and so Supermarine's designer [[Reginald Mitchell]] could only update the existing airframes. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] increased the power of the [[Rolls-Royce R|R-Type engine]] by 400&amp;nbsp;hp to 2,300&amp;nbsp;hp. The improved [[Supermarine S.6B]] won the trophy, though the technical achievement is slightly tarnished{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} by the fact two S6Bs and an S6 were the only participants. (One S6B later broke the air speed record.) 

Lady Houston's  gift provided a valuable impetus to the development of the engine technology that would ultimately be vital in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and in particular the [[Battle of Britain]]. The lessons learned in building racing seaplanes also helped Mitchell to develop the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. As [[Arthur Sidgreaves]], the managing director of Rolls-Royce, commented at the time, "It is not too much to say that research for the Schneider Trophy contest over the past two years is what our aero-engine department would otherwise have taken six to ten years to learn."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Later life==
In 1932, she offered to give £200,000 to strengthen the British army and navy. The [[National Government 1931–1935|National Government]] refused. She hung a huge electric sign, "DOWN WITH MACDONALD THE TRAITOR", in the rigging of ''[[HMNS Liberty|Liberty]]'' and sailed round Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758839,00.html#ixzz1IRmvyLzH|title=Names make news|publisher=CNN/Time Magazine|date=10 January 1938|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a telegram to the Prime Minister, she wrote: 

{{quote|I alone have dared to point out the dire need for air defence of London. You have muzzled others who have deplored this shameful neglect. You have treated my patriotic gesture with a contempt such as no other government would have been guilty of toward a patriot.}}

In 1933, she financed the [[Houston-Mount Everest Flight Expedition]], in which aircraft flew over the summit of [[Everest]] for the first time. This was to show opposition to granting [[Indian independence movement|independence to India]]. In October 1934, Lady Houston sent a cable to the winners of the [[MacRobertson Air Race|MacRobertson England to Melbourne Air Race]], [[Tom Campbell Black]] and [[C. W. A. Scott]]: "Your achievement has thrilled me through, oh brave men of my heart... If this does not make the Government sit up, nothing will ... Sleep well and feel proud of yourselves, as we all are ... [[Rule Britannia]]. God bless you both."&lt;ref&gt;Transcript from ''The Daily Mirror'' newspaper, Wednesday, 24 October 1934, p. 3. "Brave Men Of My Heart" telegram by Lady Houston to Mr CWA Scott.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lady Houston was so upset by the [[Abdication Crisis]] in 1936 that she stopped eating and died of a heart attack on 29 December 1936, aged 79, at her home, Byron Cottage, [[Hampstead Heath]]. She had no children and left no current will,&lt;ref name=Sentinel/&gt; so administration was granted to her sole surviving sibling, Mrs Florence Wrey, of more than 1.5 million pounds.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==In film==
Lady Houston, her donation to Supermarine and the electric sign in the rigging were depicted in the 1942 film ''[[The First of the Few]]'', though the sign more diplomatically states: "Down with the government. Wake up, England!"{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

During the 1970s, she was an activist for the rights of [[transsexual]]s and was instrumental in winning the right of [[California]]ns to have their gender changed on their birth-certificates and driver's licenses. In 1980, she founded and led the ACLU Transsexual Rights Committee.

In the 1980s, she felt a religious calling and worked to become an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] sister. Conflict with the church led to her leaving it shortly after she took her vows in 1988, and she has since become a sister of the [[American Catholic Church in the United States|American Catholic Church]], a small independent church using [[Catholic]] rites.

Also in the 1980s she continued the work of the [[Erickson Educational Foundation]], aiding transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment|last=Green|first=Richard|last2=Money|first2=John|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1969|isbn=978-0801810381|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallasdenny.com/Writing/2013/08/22/the-impact-of-emerging-technologies-on-one-transgender-organizationthe-impact-of-emerging-technologies-on-one-transgender-organizationthe-impact-of-emerging-technologies-on-one-transgender-organizatio/|title=The Impact of Emerging Technologies on One Transgender Organization|last=Denny|first=Dallas|authorlink=Dallas Denny|date=August 22, 2013|website=[[Dallas Denny]]: Body of Work|publisher=Dallas Denny|access-date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, inspired by meeting an isolated young man with [[AIDS]] in rural [[Missouri]], she returned to her family home in [[San Juan Capistrano]], taking on the [[bulletin board system]] AEGiS begun by [[Jamie Jemison]] and eventually building it into the largest AIDS information database in the world.

Born Melanie Kaye in 1945 in [[Brooklyn, New York]], her parents had anglicized their last name from Kantrowitz prior to her birth.&lt;ref name=JTA/&gt; Her grandparents emigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="Kantrowitz, Klepfisz 1986, p264"&gt;Kaye/Kantrowitz and Klepfisz. ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', 1986, {{ISBN|0-931103-02-9}}, pg. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

She later added Kantrowitz to her name to honor her Jewish roots. Kaye/Kantrowitz was active in the [[Harlem]] [[Civil Rights Movement]] as a teenager. When she was 17, she worked with the [[Harlem Education Project]]. About this she said "It was my first experience with a mobilizing proud community and with the possibilities of collective action."&lt;ref&gt;Kaye/Kantrowitz and Klepfisz. ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', 1986, {{ISBN|0-931103-02-9}}, pp. 266, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaye/Kantrowitz associated her activism with her [[Jewish]] upbringing,&lt;ref name="Kantrowitz, Klepfisz 1986, p324"&gt;Kaye/Kantrowitz and Klepfisz. ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', 1986, {{ISBN|0-931103-02-9}}, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that it was related to her family's Jewish cultural and political heritage "as much as the candles we lit for [[Hanukkah]], or the [[Passover Seder|Seders]] where bread and [[matzoh]] shared the table." She wrote in her essay "To Be a Radical Jew in the Late 20th Century" that her "parents had not pushed [her] into activism, yet clearly they raised [her] to do these things".&lt;ref name="Kantrowitz, Klepfisz 1986, p264"/&gt;

In 1966, she left New York to attend graduate school in [[Berkeley, California]]. Later, she moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], where she remained until 1979 before spending several years in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaye/Kantrowitz and Klepfisz. ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', 1986, {{ISBN|0-931103-02-9}}, pp. 267-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Kaye/Kantrowitz described herself as a "Conscious Jew".&lt;ref name="Kantrowitz, Klepfisz 1986, p324"/&gt; Along with [[Irena Klepfisz]] and [[Adrienne Rich]], among others, Kaye/Kantrowitz was a member of Di Vilde Chayes  (English: The Wild Beasts), a Jewish feminist group that examined and responded to political issues in the [[Middle East]], as well as to [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaye/Kantrowitz and Klepfisz. ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', 1986, {{ISBN|0-931103-02-9}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mankiller, Wilma Pearl. ''The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History'', Houghton Mifflin, 1998; {{ISBN|0-618-00182-4}}, pg. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, she served as a founding director for [[Jews for Racial and Economic Justice]] (JFREJ), a progressive Jewish organization focused mostly on [[anti-racist]] work and issues of [[economic justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Dykewomon, Elana. "Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz: Phone Interview from NYC, Nov. 27, 1993", ''Sinister Wisdom'', Issue 52, Allies, Spring/Summer 1994, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Women's Archive"/&gt; Kaye/Kantrowitz served on the JFREJ board from 1995 to 2004.&lt;ref name="Jewish Women's Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/feminism/kaye-kantrowitz-melanie|title=Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz|publisher=[[Jewish Women's Archive]]|accessdate=November 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her work with JFREJ, Kaye/Kantrowitz said: "Though the content of our mission is not specifically feminist, we have modeled feminist activism and included a feminist spin on issues such as hate violence, right of workers to organize, police brutality, and [[educational equity]]."&lt;ref name="Jewish Women's Archive"/&gt;

Around 1990, she also co-founded ''Beyond the Pale: The Progressive Jewish Radio Hour'', a radio program that aired weekly on [[WBAI]] (99.5 FM) which "mixes local, national, and international political debate and analysis, from a progressive Jewish perspective with the voices and sounds of contemporary Jewish culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfrej.org/radio.html |title=Beyond the Pale: The Progressive Jewish Radio Hour |publisher=Jews for Racial and Economic Justice |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213035344/http://www.jfrej.org/radio.html |archivedate=February 13, 2005 |accessdate=November 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaye/Kantrowitz also served on the steering committee of [[New Jewish Agenda]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, Judith. ''An Intimate Wilderness: Lesbian Writers on Sexuality'', The Eighth Mountain Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-933377-09-6}}, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metod Trobec''' (June 6, 1948 – May 30, 2006)  was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[serial killer]].

== Life and death ==
Trobec was born as an illegitimate child in [[Planina nad Horjulom]]. At the age of 14 he is said to have burned his neighbor's hay, and to have stolen a moped at age 18. After doing his military service he worked for [[Yugoslav Railways]] and then emigrated to Germany. 

He returned to Slovenia in 1974 and committed several crimes, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison. Between 1976 and 1978&lt;ref name="Zakrajšek"&gt;[http://www.slovenskenovice.si/crni-scenarij/doma/dolenja-vas-kraj-nesrecnega-imena Zakrajšek, Vojko. 2012. "Dolenja vas, kraj  nesrečnega imena".

After his sentencing, the identity papers of Olga Pajić were also found in his house in [[Dolenja Vas pri Polhovem Gradcu]] and he is believed to have killed her.&lt;ref name="Zakrajšek"/&gt;|group=Note}}  

He was sentenced to death (the last death sentence in Slovenia), but this was commuted to 20 years in prison. During his imprisonment he tried to kill fellow prisoners twice, and 15 years were added to his sentence. He committed suicide at Dob pri Mirni Prison in [[Slovenska Vas, Šentrupert|Slovenska Vas]] on 30 May 2006.&lt;ref name="Zakrajšek"/&gt; He was buried at state expense in an anonymous grave in [[Šentrupert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casnik.si/index.php/2011/05/30/serijski-morilec-metod-trobec/ Koncilja, Franci. 2011.

On 6 October 1998, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Nawaz Sharif]] relieved the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] and the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] of Pakistan, General '''[[Jehangir Karamat]]''', from the command of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] for making public statements regarding and contradicting the policies of public administration.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=CELIA W. DUGGER|title=Pakistani Premier Prevails in Clash With General|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/pakistani-premier-prevails-in-clash-with-general.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a public and political science circles, General Karamat had a popular support and occupied a prestigious image in the country for his role to promote [[Democracy in Pakistan|democratic]] process in the country. His dismissal remains a controversial topic in the field of [[civil-military relations]], and the move remains still questionable at the political science circles of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="STory of Pakistan"/&gt;

A war veteran of [[Indo-Pakistani wars]] and former professor of [[political science]] at the [[National Defence University, Pakistan|National Defence University]] (NDU), General Karamat was an apolitical and professional military leader, but confrontation involving the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Fourteenth Amendment]] and matters of principle of [[civilian control of the military]] was ingrained, which eventually led the relieving of General Jehangir Karamat from his command of the military by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on October 1998.&lt;ref name="STory of Pakistan"/&gt;

==Background==

===Nawaz Sharif===

As scheduled, the [[Pakistani general elections, 1997|general elections]] were held on 3 February 1997, which marked the return of [[Nawaz Sharif]] with an exclusive, [[Majority government|two-third majority]] in the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="STory of Pakistan"/&gt; Just after days of re-electing for his second term, Prime Minister Sharif faced serious constitutional crises with the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and the [[President of Pakistan|Presidency]] on the other side. Nawaz Sharif made very important Constitutional Amendments that inserted in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] which introduced termination of the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Eighth Amendment]] and passing of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Thirteenth Amendment]], with the enaction of the anti-corruption bill in 1997.&lt;ref name="STory of Pakistan"/&gt;

Sharif's constitutional moves were challenged by the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Syed Sajjad Ali Shah|Sajjad Ali Shah]] and President [[Farooq Leghari]]; both were forced to reign by Nawaz Sharif on 2 December 1997.&lt;ref name="STory of Pakistan"/&gt; After Sharif ordering the [[nuclear tests]] in 1998 and his unsuccessful attempt to pass the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Fifteenth Amendment]], a number of military officers publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over administration.&lt;ref name="STory of Pakistan"/&gt; This confrontation led to the resignation of General Jehangir Karamat on 7 October 1998.

==Events leading up to the relief==

===Problems with Supreme Court and Presidency===
{{Main|Supreme Court of Pakistan#The attack on the Supreme Court in 1997|l1=1997 Pakistan Supreme Court incident|Farooq Leghari}}

The conservative mass led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come to the power with a two-majority as a result of [[Pakistani general elections, 1997|1997 general elections]]. Sharif established the [[Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan|Anti Terrorism Courts]] (ATC), [[National Accountability Bureau|Anti-Corruption Bill]] and passed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the constitution, all in 1997.&lt;ref name=PublicAffairs&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieven|first=Anatol|title=Pakistan : a hard country|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61039-021-7|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ztr4xfSjH_4C&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Nawaz+Sharif+attack+on+supreme+court&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftI_UY6lMsblyQGB54GIAQ&amp;ved=0CDgQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nawaz%20Sharif%20attack%20on%20supreme%20court&amp;f=true|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; After criticising the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]], the supreme court summoned Nawaz Sharif of [[Contempt of court]] and appeared in supreme court with party workers, members, chief ministers, and constituents to hear the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"/&gt; Unruly party workers stormed into the Supreme Court, forcing Chief Justice [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] to remove the finding of contempt against Prime minister Sharif.&lt;ref name=PublicAffairs/&gt; Hundreds of PML-N supporters and members of its youth wing, the Muslim Students Front (MSF), breached the police barrier around the courthouse when defence lawyer [[S.M.

Chief Justice Shah wrote a letter to President [[Farooq Leghari]] to call for armed forces actions against Sharif.&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"/&gt; However, the constant pressure of Farooq Leghari deteriorated his health and resigned from the presidency.&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"/&gt; Chief Justice Shah's tenured was cut short when Sharif appointed Justice [[Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui]] in his place, and his appointment was approved by the new president; Shah also resigned from the supreme court after hearing the news on television channels.&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"/&gt;

===Public statements and relief===

After ordering the [[nuclear tests]] in 1998, Prime minister Sharif chaired the [[Defence Committee of the Cabinet (Pakistan)|Defence Committee of the Cabinet (DCC)]] session with the chairman and chiefs of armed forces to overview the situation with India.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Although both [[Nawaz Sharif]] and general [[General Jehangir Karamat|Jehangir Karamat]] were educated and hold common beliefs concerning the national security, but problems arose with chairman joint chiefs and chief of army staff general Karamat on October 1998.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt;

While addressing the naval officers and cadets at the [[Pakistan Naval War College|Naval War College]], general Karamat stressed the re-creation of [[National Security Council of Pakistan|National Security Council]] (instead of DCC)&lt;ref name="nytsoldier"&gt;Crossette, Barbara. [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/13/world/coup-pakistan-man-soldier-s-soldier-not-political-general-pervez-musharraf.html "Coup in Pakistan – Man in the News; A Soldier's Soldier, Not a Political General."] New York Times (13 October 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; which would be backed by a "team of civil-military experts"&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; for devising policies to seek resolution ongoing problems relating the civil-military issues; also recommended a "neutral but competent [[Civil Service of Pakistan|bureaucracy]] and administration of at federal level and the establishment of [[Local government in Pakistan|Local governments]] in [[Provinces of Pakistan|four provinces]].&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt;

This proposal was met with hostility, and it succeeded all in accomplishing was pricking the Prime minister's highly inflated altered ego.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"/&gt; Nawaz Sharif's dismissal of general Karamat,&lt;ref name="nytsoldier"/&gt; plummeted his mandate in the public circles and criticism he received from [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] was rogue.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbas|first=Hassan|title=Pakistan's Drift to Extremism|year=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=United States|isbn=9780765614964|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GiKm-ahTpS8C&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=lieutenant+general+ali+kuli+khan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UpG4T9WYAYmJiAKktvH1Bg&amp;ved=0CGQQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=lieutenant%20general%20ali%20kuli%20khan&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Response and fallout===
With Karamat's dismissal, it was widely felt in the armed forces that Sharif had ruthlessly established his control all over the country, including the military.&lt;ref name="Rosen Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniel E. Harmon|title=Pervez Musharraf: President of Pakistan|year=2008|publisher=Rosen Publications|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-4270-9208-3|pages=65–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jisbSz2h9zYC&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismissal of General Karamat was least popular decision in Sharif's prime ministerial ship, and his approval ratings plummeted.&lt;ref name="Rosen Publications"/&gt; Media Minister [[Syed Mushahid Hussain]] and later Prime minister himself justified his actions on national and international media:

Writing a thesis in his book, ''Between Dreams and Realities: Some Milestones in Pakistan’s History'', Aziz maintained: "Blunder of firing of General Karamatt; others will blame Nawaz Sharif for many mistakes he made. But in my view, the most serious of these mistakes was Nawaz Sharif’s decision to remove General Jehangir Karamat as chief of army staff in October 1998". Aziz was extremely confident and certain that [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Ali Kuli Khan]] would be appointed as the Chief of Army Staff based on his seniority, merit, among a very competent officer, and next in seniority to General Karamat.&lt;ref name=OUP/&gt;

[[File:Tanami Desert Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=panarama of the desolate Tanami Desert|The Tanami Desert where Ricky Megee was stranded for 71 days]]
'''Ricky Megee''' (born 1971) is an Australian, most notable for having been stranded in the [[Outback]] and surviving for 71 days in 2006. Megee later gave contradictory statements as to how he came to be stranded crossing the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Western Australia]]. On one occasion he said that his car broke down, and on another that he had been [[carjacked]] by an armed gang. However, a doctor later confirmed that Megee's appearance was consistent with having lived in extreme conditions. Like most deserts, the Tanami can reach {{convert|40|C|F}} during the day but still be very cold at night. Megee made his own primitive shelters and survived by drinking rainwater and eating small animals and available vegetation for nourishment. He was eventually discovered by a group of station hands near [[Katherine, Northern Territory]], and taken to Darwin for medical assistance. Although some doubts were later raised as to the exact chain of events as Megee related them, the police did not find evidence that a criminal offence had occurred. 

==Early life==

Ricky Megee was born in 1971 in [[Gippsland, Victoria]]; he later described his childhood as a happy one, until the family moved to [[Melbourne]], where his father later killed himself. Megee worked at a variety of jobs. He was, variously, a carpet salesman, prawn fisherman, nightclub [[doorman (profession)|doorman]], and an electrician. He eventually became a [[bailiff]]. Eventually, he went to jail after being involved in a fight in [[Perth]],{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} as well as for drug offences.{{sfn|Squires|2006b}} In 2006 he was 35 years old{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} and living in [[Queensland]].{{sfn|Colvin|2006}}

==Journey to Port Hedland and attack==
[[File:Buntine Highway map.png|left|upright=1.3|thumb|alt=Buntine Highway map|Map of the Buntine Highway]]
In January 2006{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} Megee had been offered work in  a government department in [[Port Hedland]],{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} Western Australia.{{sfn|BBC News|2006}} He accepted the job, and set off on the long drive, which he had made multiple times before.{{sfn|Rajok|2009}} Driving a 2001 [[Mitsubishi Challenger]]{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} he took the [[Buntine Highway]], which for much of his journey was a desert track{{sfn|Squires|2006b}} across the outback of the [[Northern Territory]].{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}}

The events leading to Megee being stranded are somewhat confused, and indeed, Megee's version of how events unfolded changed significantly over time. He first told his rescuers that his car had broken down,{{sfn|BBC News|2006}} but then, [[The Washington Post]] reported, he claimed "that he'd been drugged by hitchhikers and left for dead".{{sfn|Rupar|Fisher|2014}} Megee later elaborated on how this scenario unfolded, saying he had picked up a lone [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]]{{sfn|BBC News|2006}} [[hitchhiker]] between the towns of [[Kalkaringi]] and [[Halls Creek]]. He believed that at some point the hitchhiker drugged Megee's drink at some point.{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} Megee said that although he normally always opened his own drinks from the car refrigerator, on this occasion he allowed his passenger to open one for him.{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} 

Later, in his 2010 autobiography,{{sfn|Allen and Unwin|2010}} Megee said that there had been three men sitting on the roadside, who had run out of petrol, and that he had offered to give one of them a lift to a petrol station.{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} Megee also posited that he could have been stabbed with a drugged-syringe during a struggle.{{sfn|Squires|2006b}} Either way, Megee later recalled feeling increasingly "dazed and confused", and then blacked out before he recovered consciousness hours later.{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} He also said that his attackers did not leave him immediately: they over-powered and stunned him. He later awoke in their camp. They had a gun, wrote Megee, but never used it; they did bring him water. After an unknown period, the carjackers lifted camp and disappeared.{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} Before they left, they stole his shoes,{{sfn|Megee|McLean|2008|p=2}} but left him with $12.30 which had been in his pocket.{{sfn|Rajok|2009}}  

When he regained consciousness, he said, he was in a hole, covered in black plastic, which had had "some rocks and dirt thrown on top".{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} Megee suggested that it was only the attempts by four{{sfn|BBC News|2006}} [[dingoes]] to claw him that woke him up.{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}}

===Journey across the desert===
{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=I ate the leeches raw, straight out of the dam, grasshoppers I just ate them...But the only thing I really sort of had to cook was the frogs which (I) slipped onto a bit of wire and stuck the wire on top of my humpy, let the sun dry them out a fair bit until they were a bit crispy and then just ate them.|qalign=center|salign=left|source=Ricky Megee talking to [[ABC News (radio)|ABC Radio]]|width=25em|quoted=yes}}

Megee walked for ten days through the northeastern fringe of the [[Tanami Desert]].{{sfn|Squires|2006a}} He often lost consciousness through [[heat exhaustion]],{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} as temperatures regularly went above {{convert|40|C|F}}.{{sfn|Polley|2018|p=96}} According to Mark Clifford, a local man who later witnessed Megee's arrival, although the temperatures were high, it was also the middle of the wet season, which was in Megee's favour. When combined with the abundance of small wild animals and Megee's "hardy constitution", his chances of survival were, with hindsight, relatively good.{{sfn|Jones|2006}} However, it was never clearly established precisely how Megee became as lost as he did.{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}}

Megee said that he survived by eating [[leech]]es, insects,{{sfn|Rupar|Fisher|2014}} snakes, ants and lizards,{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} and edible plants.{{sfn|Mann|Pezzullo|2012|p=106}} He drank water from "various dams and waterholes" and [[foraged|scavenged]] in [[the bush]]{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} every evening, eating "one meal a day, just enough to stay alive".{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} When water was unavailable, he drank his [[urine]] after chilling it to suppress the flavour.{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}}

Megee—"baked in the day and frozen at night"{{sfn|Mann|Pezzullo|2012|p=106}}—created temporary shelters from the sun out of old branches, and eventually found a decrepit windmill.{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} Megee said that he made "a little humpy{{refn|A [[humpy]] is described in the ''Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms'' as "an Aboriginal bark hut [or] any rude shelter or hut".{{sfn|DAC|2018}}|group=note}} out of a feed trough that was at some cattle yards, obviously a mustering point, I thought to myself, so I've dragged it up on top of the dam, flipped it over and dug a hole and just lived in there for 10 weeks."{{sfn|Kerin|2006}} Megee became dangerously weak, to the extent that he was unable to travel as far on his daily foraging expeditions.{{sfn|Mann|Pezzullo|2012|p=106}} At one point he suffered an [[abscess]] of the tooth that—weakened as he was—could have been fatal,{{sfn|Polley|2018|p=96}} and which he prised out of his mouth with his car keys.{{sfn|Rajok|2009}}

===Rescue and recovery===
{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote="It's a bit unclear what the trouble was with the car, and why he ended up off the road. He's walked for about 10 days to get to where he is before he's realised that he's got to set himself up some shelter and start trying to get some food into himself. He basically sat where he was for about 10 weeks.{{sfn|Squires|2006a}}|qalign=center|salign=left|source=Mark Clifford, manager of the Birrindudu cattle station|width=25em|align=left|quoted=yes}}
Megee was eventually discovered about {{convert|50|km|mi}} from [[Birrindudu Station]], about {{convert|500|km|mi}} southwest of [[Katherine, Northern Territory]].{{sfn|BBC News|2006}} His rescuers were local [[Station (Australian agriculture)#Personnel|station hands]]{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} and their trainees,{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} known as [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroos]].{{sfn|Squires|2006a}} By now, Megee was starving, sunburnt,{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} and suffering from [[malnutrition]] and exposure.{{sfn|Jones|2006}} Birrindudu Station manager, Mark Clifford, described Megee as "just a walking skeleton" when he was brought to the station,{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} and said that the area he was found in was one of the "most isolated places in Australia".{{sfn|Jones|2006}}

On 5 April 2006{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} Megee was [[Air ambulance|flown]] to the [[Royal Darwin Hospital]],{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} where medical staff described him as "emaciated, but...well hydrated".{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} While in Darwin Hospital, Megee was interviewed by [[Northern Territory Police|Northern Territory police]], although they dismissed suggestions that there was any question of criminal activity on Megee's part.{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}}{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} Indeed, they said they were unable to find any evidence of criminality at all, or even Megee's stolen car.{{sfn|Jones|2006}}{{sfn|Squires|2006a}} Megee discharged himself from hospital after six days.{{sfn|Kerin|2006}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Royal Darwin Hospital.JPG|thumb|upright=1|alt=Royal Darwin Hospital|Royal Darwin Hospital, where Megee began his recovery]]
Megee's Challenger was never recovered,{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} and Megee himself lost {{convert|60|kg|lb}},{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} or over half his original bodyweight,{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} which was over {{convert|100|kg|lb}}.{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}}

The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' subsequently suggested that there were "some doubts"  over elements of Megee's account, and reported that Megee was attempting to sell his story to "a commercial television station".{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} It was also reported that the police, too, initially "had doubts about the story because of Megee's previous minor drug convictions".{{sfn|Mann|Pezzullo|2012|p=106}} Megee refuted allegations that his account was in any way misleading and even offered to appear live on television and eat frogs to prove he was telling the truth.{{sfn|Squires|2006b}} ABC Radio reported that Megee had told his story to them for free—although only after trying, unsuccessfully, to persuade the station to match a [[A$]]15,000 offer he said he had received from elsewhere.{{sfn|Kerin|2006}} The doctor who treated Megee in Darwin commented that it was "very difficult to either deny or validate" his story, as he had responded so well to the treatment provided by [[dietician]]s, [[nutritionist]]s and physicians.{{sfn|Colvin|2006}}

[[Bush Tucker]] Man [[Les Hiddins]]—considered an expert on outback survival{{sfn|Colvin|2006}}—acknowledged that Megee's survival was not as surprising as might have been thought. It was possible, he said, to survive in the bush for up to three years, and that "there are some areas where it's difficult to survive, and others where you can".{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald|2006}} For example, the area where Megee was, Hiddins described as "dry country which is, you know, that's pretty severe country in there".{{sfn|Colvin|2006}} Other survival experts credit Megee's survival on his "instinctively solving the basic requirements of water, food and shelter—and adopting a survival mindset that pulled him through".{{sfn|Mann|Pezzullo|2012|p=106}} 

Megee subsequently wrote a book on his experience and emigrated to [[Dubai]]{{sfn|Lamparska|2012}} to work in construction.{{sfn|H&amp;S|2009}}

'''''Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired''''' is a 2008 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Marina Zenovich]].&lt;ref&gt;DiMare, Phillip C. Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia ABC Clio Publishing Santa Barbara California 2011 pages 780-781&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns film director [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|his sexual abuse case]]. It examines the events that led to Polanski [[Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case#Conviction_and_flight|fleeing]] the United States after being embroiled in a controversial trial, and his unstable reunion with his adopted country. A follow-up to the film, also directed by Zenovich, titled ''Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out'' was released on 26 March 2013, detailing Polanski's successful legal battle to avoid [[Extradition_law_in_the_United_States#Extradition_to_the_United_States|extradition to the US]], a battle that took place after ''Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired'' came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/roman-polanski-odd-man-out-and-the-seagull-secure-financing-through-new-investment-hub-slated#.UAQZh3VPfQc |title='Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out' and 'The Seagull' First Projects to Secure Financing Through New Investment Hub Slated&amp;#124;Filmmakers,FilmIndustry,FilmFestivals, Awards &amp; Movie Reviews |publisher=Indiewire |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsdistribution.com/fd_film.php?id_film=409 FILMS DISTRIBUTION] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217075405/http://www.filmsdistribution.com/fd_film.php?id_film=409 |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/roman-polanski-odd-man-out/trailers/3513929 |title=Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out  |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Metacritic]] rates ''Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired'' a score of 78/100 based on 16 reviews ("generally favorable").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/roman-polanski-wanted-and-desired |title=Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] scores the film at 89% positive reviews based on 46 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/roman_polanski_wanted_and_desired/ |title=Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathleen McGuigan, reviewing the film for [[Newsweek]], referred to the film as "deft and subtle" and particularly noted "an enigmatic little scene near the end [where] [y]ou see a fierce old whale of a man in a chair, banging a drum while an elfin youth jumps and hops to the beats, like a puppet on a string. The hopping boy finally escapes his tormentor by scurrying and tumbling across a field, running toward the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The tyrannized, barefoot kid is [[Roman Polanski|Polanski]] himself, and the footage is from a 16-minute short called '[[The Fat and the Lean]]' that he made in 1961, on the brink of his fame as a brilliant new European director. The wordless scene may last less than a minute in [[Marina Zenovich]]'s documentary, but it sticks with you, and it echoes another clip in her film. This one is from a television interview Polanski did decades later where he says he felt like 'a mouse with which an abominable cat was making sport.' The cat in question was Los Angeles Judge [[Laurence J. Rittenband]], who'd presided over the director's 1977 criminal case for having sex with a 13-year-old girl."&lt;ref name="Newsweek_2009_2_19"&gt;{{cite web

One negative review by Bill Wyman, writing for [[Salon (website)|Salon]], stated: "The film, which has inexplicably gotten all sorts of praise, whitewashes what Polanski did in blatant and subtle fashion[.] The tone is set early on, when a friend of Polanski's tells of being woken up and informed that the director had to call his attorney. The moment is actually played for laughs, with interspersed shots of a worried [[Mia Farrow]] using the phone in a scene from '[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]' — that, too, about a horrifically abused woman. But the scene isn't used to illustrate the victim's story -- it's about poor Roman. He's the person making the desperate phone call. It's an odd juxtaposition when you think about it."&lt;ref name="Salon_2009_2_19"&gt;{{cite web

Nathan Southern of [[Allmovie]] writes that, "filmmaker [[Marina Zenovich]] revisits this difficult case via extensive interviews with Geimer [the underage victim], defense attorney Douglas Dalton, Assistant DA Roger Gunson, and others. In the process, she raises pivotal questions about the U.S. legal system and the fairness of the judge, Laurence J. Rittenband (who was reportedly extremely vocal about his desire to topple Polanski) and encounters many recollections of judicial malfeasance from those who were involved."&lt;ref name="Allmovie.com"&gt;{{cite web

==Awards==
''Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired'' was nominated for five primetime [[Emmy Award]]s and won two: "Outstanding Directing For Nonfiction Programming" and "Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/shows/roman-polanski-wanted-and-desired Roman Polanski: Wanted And Desired] Emmys.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] awarded it the title of one of the top 5 documentaries of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=2008 National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516165456/http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=2008 |date=16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the "Editing Award Documentary" at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.sundance.org/events/43 2008 Sundance Film Festival] sundance.org&lt;/ref&gt; It was also listed as one of ten films in the "Hall of Shame" of the 2008 [[Women Film Critics Circle]] Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfcc.wordpress.com/women-film-critics-circle-awards-2008/ |title=WOMEN FILM CRITICS CIRCLE AWARDS 2008 |publisher=Wfcc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retraction by David Wells==
After the arrest of Roman Polanski in Switzerland in 2009, David Wells, now a retired deputy district attorney, recanted the interview he gave the director about advising the judge in the case in ''[[ex parte]]'' communication. According to Marcia Clarke of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'': 
:''"I lied,' Wells told me yesterday, referring to his comments in the movie that he told the judge how he could renege on a plea-bargain agreement and send Polanski back to jail after he had been released from a 42-day psychiatric evaluation—the heart of Polanski’s claims of prosecutorial and judicial misconduct. 'I know I shouldn’t have done it, but I did. The director of the documentary told me it would never air in the States. I thought it made a better story if I said I’d told the judge what to do."''&lt;ref name="Wells_Daily_Beast"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zenovich responded, as reported by Peter Knegt at ''[[indieWire]]'':
:''"I am perplexed by the timing of David Wells’ statement to the press that he lied in his interview with me for the documentary ‘Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,’' she said. 'Since June of 2008, the film has been quite visible on U.S. television via HBO, in theaters and on DVD, so it is odd that David Wells has not brought this issue to my attention before.''

:''Zenovich said that the day she filmed Mr. Wells at the Malibu Courthouse, he gave her a one-hour interview.  'He signed a release like all my other interviewees, giving me permission to use his interview in the documentary worldwide," she said.  "At no time did I tell him that the film would not air in the United States.''

:''She went on to say she is 'astonished' that Wells has changed his story. 'Mr. Wells was always friendly and open with me,' she said. 'At no point in the four years since our interview has he ever raised any issues about its content.  In fact, in a July 2008 story in The New York Times, Mr. Wells corroborated the account of events that he gave in my film…  It is a sad day for documentary filmmakers when something like this happens."''&lt;ref name="Zenovich_indieWire"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael Ceply commented on the affair in the ''[[New York Times]]'':
:''"The incident points to the power and the limitations of the documentary art.[...] Pat Aufderheide, director of the Center for Social Media at American University [...] pointed out that the documentarians’ tendency to focus on 'untold stories' has occasionally reopened a legal case or righted a perceived wrong.[...]''"

:"''But even an on-camera account like that of Mr. Wells, which provoked a legal challenge that is still before the appellate courts in California, has its vulnerabilities. Ms. Zenovich acknowledged on Thursday, for instance, that she had no second person describing the contacts between Mr. Wells, who was assigned to the courthouse but had no official role in the Polanski case, and Judge Rittenband, who has since died. 'There wasn’t a witness to the conversations with Rittenband,' she said.''"

:"''Since Mr. Polanski’s arrest, Ms. Zenovich said, a strong public reaction against his misdeeds in the original case seem to have overridden concerns about any misdeeds in the courts. Originally charged with seven counts, including rape and sodomy, he pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor and then fled the country before his sentencing.''"

:"''People don’t seem to connect to what this is, really, because of the crime, and the schism it has caused with finding normalcy and sanity' she said of her continuing examination of the Los Angeles legal system, with its problems with celebrity justice.''"

:"''Even if Dave Wells were to be lying' in the original film, she said, 'we still have a judge who was instructing the prosecutor and defense lawyer on how to behave, and doing it based on how he would look in the media,' she added, referring to other allegations in the documentary."''&lt;ref name="NYT_2009_10_02"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">'''Rudolph Franz Zallinger''' (November 12, 1919 – August 1, 1995) was an American-based [[Austrians|Austrian]]-[[Russians|Russian]] artist notable for his mural ''[[The Age of Reptiles]]'' (1947) at [[Yale University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]. His painting of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' heavily influenced the creature design of [[Toho Studios]]' ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954). Two of Zallinger's dinosaurs, ''T. rex'' and ''[[Brontosaurus]]'', are seen in the film as part of a slide demonstration during a lecture in the [[National Diet Building]]. A third slide showing Zallinger's ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' was planned but eventually not used in the film.

==Biography==
Zallinger was born in [[Irkutsk]], [[Siberia]] in 1919. He attended [[Yale School of Art|Yale's School of Fine Arts]] on scholarships during the [[Great Depression]], was trained as an illustrator, and he taught at Yale after graduation. The Peabody Museum hired him to paint the mural in 1943 at $40 a week, and Zallinger took a crash course in paleontology to prepare for the job. The mural is one of the largest in the world, measuring 110 feet (33.5 meters) by 16 feet (4.9 meters). It required more than 4.5 years (1943–1947) to complete.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title =  Rudolph Franz Zallinger | url = http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/archives/biography/rudolph-franz-zallinger | publisher =Yale Peabody Museum: Collections : Archives | date =  | accessdate = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the mural appeared on a United States postage stamp in 1970.&lt;ref name="Stamp"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = 1970 U.S. Postage Stamp Issues | url = http://www.1847us.com/ByYear/1970.htm | publisher =1847us.com  | date =2011  | accessdate = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After that, the museum appointed him as the “artist in residence”, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name="Wallace2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wallace, D.R.|title=Beasts of Eden|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2004|isbn=0-520-23731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Jacob Bradford''' (born November 8, 1987) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who is a free agent. He has played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Bradford attended [[Putnam City North High School]] in [[Oklahoma City]], where he starred in football, basketball and golf. As a senior quarterback in 2005, he threw for 2,029 yards and 17 touchdowns in 12 games. Bradford was not highly recruited coming out of high school, but he did receive a scholarship offer from the [[University of Oklahoma]], which he accepted. After a redshirt season in 2006, Bradford threw for 3,121 yards and 36 touchdowns as a redshirt freshman. In 2008, Bradford became only the second sophomore to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] as he led the highest-scoring offense in NCAA history, throwing for 4,464 yards with 48 touchdowns and just six interceptions. He again led the nation in passing and also added five rushing touchdowns as the Sooners went 12-1 and advanced to the BCS national title game. 

Bradford declared for the NFL Draft following the 2009 season and was drafted by the [[St. Louis Rams]] with the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall]] selection in the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. That year, Bradford set the record for most completions by a rookie in NFL history, which helped earn him the [[NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year]] award. Prior to the start of the 2015 season, the Rams traded Bradford along with a 2015 fifth round pick to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in exchange for quarterback [[Nick Foles]], a 2015 fourth-round pick, and a 2016 second-round pick. Following his 2015 campaign with the Eagles, in which he set career-highs in passing yards (3,725), completion percentage (65%) and yards per attempt (7.0), the [[Minnesota Vikings]] acquired Bradford after their starting quarterback [[Teddy Bridgewater]] was lost to a season-ending knee injury before the start of the season.

==Early years==
Bradford was born to Kent and Martha Bradford in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="soonersports.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/football-depth-chart.html |title=Official Site of the Oklahoma Sooners |publisher=SoonerSports.com |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925221001/http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/football-depth-chart.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Putnam City North High School]] in Oklahoma City, where he starred in [[high school football|football]], basketball, baseball, and golf for the Putnam City North Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.twincities.com/2016/09/24/vikings-qb-sam-bradford-was-an-all-everything-athlete-until-football-won-out/ |title=Vikings QB Sam Bradford was an all-everything athlete until football won out |date=2016-09-24 |work=Twin Cities |access-date=2018-01-25 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradford played as a [[pitcher]] in [[baseball]], but gave up after his freshman year. He earned All-City honors as a junior [[quarterback]] in [[high school football|football]] by ''The Oklahoman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/2878373|title=The Oklahoman's Big All-City Football team: Roster and player profiles|date=19 December 2004|website=newsok.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his senior season in which he threw for 2,029 yards and 17 touchdowns in 12 games, Bradford was named to the Oklahoma Coaches Association All-State Team and was a Second-Team All-State pick by ''[[The Oklahoman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/2891825|title=BOYS ALL-STATE ROSTER|date=10 April 2005|website=newsok.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS_Bio"&gt;{{cite web | title=14 Sam Bradford | publisher=SoonerSports.com | url=http://soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/bradford_sam00.html | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradford was also a Division I-caliber [[basketball]] player. As a senior, he averaged 18.6 points and 10.5 rebounds per game and played on the same elite [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] team as fellow Oklahoma City native and [[Detroit Pistons]] star [[Blake Griffin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=3134076|title=Oklahoma's rookie QB makes college game looks easy|publisher=ES-28PN|accessdate=2007-11-30|date=2007-11-30|first=Ivan|last=Maisel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[golf]], Bradford defeated future [[PGA Tour|PGA]] touring pros [[Kevin Tway]] and [[Robert Streb]] during his high school career. In addition to the aforementioned sports, Bradford also played [[hockey]] in his youth. In 1999, when Bradford was 12, his travel team, the Junior Blazers, won a regional championship, beating a team from Houston. He quit the sport that same year, and according to his former hockey coach [[Mike McEwen (ice hockey)|Mike McEwen]], who played on three [[Stanley Cup]] championship teams with the [[New York Islanders]], Bradford had the talent to make it in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. McEwen also said that Bradford was one of the best players he ever coached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Sam_Bradford_Eagles_All_American_everything.html|title=Sam Bradford: All-American everything|website=philly.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2005, by the end of Bradford's junior season, he garnered interest from several Division I programs, including [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]], [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]], and nearby Oklahoma. Following his senior season, Bradford was viewed as a two-to-three-star recruit and was not that highly ranked among the high school class of 2006, with his highest ranking being No. 12 among only pro-style quarterbacks by recruiting source ''[[Rivals.com]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Thamel |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Bradford Wins Heisman, but the Top Prize Awaits |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/sports/ncaafootball/14heisman.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradford was ranked behind [[Pat Devlin (American football)|Pat Devlin]], [[Isiah Williams|"Juice" Williams]] and [[Josh Freeman]], and was overshadowed by the likes of five-star recruits like [[Mitch Mustain]], [[Matthew Stafford]] and [[Tim Tebow]].&lt;ref name="SS_Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://recruiting.scout.com/a.z?s=73&amp;p=9&amp;c=4&amp;pid=10&amp;yr=2006 | title=Football Recruiting – Quarterback | accessdate=2007-09-11 | publisher=Scout.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Bradford received an [[athletic scholarship]] to attend the [[University of Oklahoma]], where he played for coach [[Bob Stoops]]'s [[Oklahoma Sooners football]] team from 2006 to 2009. He redshirted as a freshman in 2006 before becoming the starter in 2007 and turning in one of the best seasons ever by a quarterback, passing for 4,720 yards with 50 touchdowns and just eight interceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/sam-bradford-1/gamelog/2008/ |title=Sam Bradford 2008 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he won the [[Heisman Trophy]], becoming the fifth Oklahoma player to win the award. After Oklahoma lost the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]] 24-14 to [[Florida Gators|Florida]], Bradford, instead of declaring for the upcoming draft, elected to return to Oklahoma for another crack at the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2009-01-08-florida.html |title=BCS Championship - Oklahoma vs Florida Box Score, January 8, 2009 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up playing in just three games due to a shoulder injury, and the Sooners, ranked No. 3 to start the season, finished with a 8-5 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/oklahoma/2009.html |title=2009 Oklahoma Sooners Stats |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Oklahoma's starting quarterback [[Rhett Bomar]], then a sophomore, was dismissed from the team for violating [[NCAA]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newsok.com/article/2824545 |title=Bomar, Quinn dismissed from OU football team |date=2006-08-03 |website=NewsOK.com |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Thompson (American football)|Paul Thompson]], a senior quarterback-turned-wide receiver, converted back to quarterback and led the [[2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team]] to win the [[Big 12 Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/oklahoma/2006.html |title=2006 Oklahoma Sooners Stats |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/oklahoma/2006-schedule.html |title=2006 Oklahoma Sooners Schedule and Results |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His departure left a void at the quarterback position at Oklahoma.

===St. Louis Rams===

====2010 season====

In early Spring, Bradford met with Thom Goudy, a professional development coach in St. Louis, Missouri. Goudy helped Bradford with his pocket technique. Bradford spent three weeks in his training camp before starting the summer conditioning camp.

He got his first start in place of the injured [[A. J.

He competed for the starting quarterback position with Feeley and on September 4, Bradford was named the starting quarterback for the 2010 season opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://views.washingtonpost.com/theleague/nflnewsfeed/2010/09/sam-bradford-named-rams-starter.html |title=Sam Bradford named Rams' starter|publisher=Washington Post |first=Mark |last=Maske| date=September 4, 2010|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2010, in his first regular season game as the starting quarterback for the Rams, Bradford completed 32/55 passes for 253 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions in a 17–13 loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals]].

He was named the NFL's offensive rookie of the month.

During October and November, he established a record for most consecutive passes without an interception for a rookie (169), which ended with an interception by [[William Moore (American football)|William Moore]] in a home game against the [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] on November 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2010112110/2010/REG11/falcons@rams |work=NFL.com |date=November 21, 2010 |title=NFL Game Center: Atlanta Falcons at St. Louis Rams - 2010 Week 11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120010747/http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2010112110/2010/REG11/falcons@rams |archivedate=November 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 2010, against the [[Denver Broncos]], Bradford became the first rookie in NFL history to pass for at least 300 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions during a road victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sando |first=Mike |date=November 29, 2010 |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/28399/sam-bradfords-performance-in-perspective |title=Sam Bradford's performance in perspective |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He capped November by becoming the first rookie quarterback to win two consecutive Offensive Rookie of the Month awards.

On December 26, Bradford surpassed [[Peyton Manning]]'s record for most completed passes by an NFL rookie quarterback (326). Bradford finished the season with 354 completions out of 590 attempts, surpassing Manning's record of 575 for most attempts by an NFL rookie quarterback.

====2011 season====
Coming into the 2011 season, expectations were high for the [[St. Louis Rams]] and Bradford. After going 4-0 in the preseason, it appeared as if they would be fulfilled, but once the regular season rolled around injuries ravaged the roster. A high ankle sprain bothered Bradford for the majority of the year and he finished with 2,164 passing yards, six touchdowns, and six interceptions. The team went 1–9 in games he appeared in and had a 2–14 record overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradSa00/gamelog/2011/ |title=Sam Bradford 2011 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2011.htm |title=2011 St. Louis Rams Statistics &amp; Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 season====
During the off-season, there was much speculation that the Rams would select [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and former [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} But, new head coach, [[Jeff Fisher]] instilled hope that Bradford was still the Rams franchise quarterback, solidifying this hope when the Rams later reached a deal with the [[Washington Redskins]] for the 2nd overall selection in the [[2012 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7668243/washington-redskins-acquire-no-2-overall-pick-st-louis-rams |title=Redskins acquire No. 2 pick from Rams |last=Schefter |first=Adam |website=ESPN.com |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2016, Bradford signed a 2-year, $36 million ($26 million guaranteed) contract extension with the Eagles. However, the Eagles traded with the [[Cleveland Browns]] for the number two pick in the [[2016 NFL draft]], in order to draft a new quarterback. This led to speculation that Bradford would be traded or used as a stopgap while [[Chase Daniel]] educates the newly drafted quarterback in Pederson's offensive scheme. On April 25, 2016, it was reported that Bradford wanted to be traded and that he would no longer attend the team's off-season activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/15353852/sam-bradford-demanding-trade-philadelphia-eagles | title=Sam Bradford demands trade after Eagles' move for No. 2 pick | publisher=espn.go.com | date=April 25, 2016 | accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eagles selected quarterback [[Carson Wentz]] with the second overall pick in the 2016 draft on April 28.

On September 3, 2016, following his appearance in the Eagles' preseason matches, Bradford was traded to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for a first-round pick in the [[2017 NFL Draft]] (later used to select [[Derek Barnett]]) and a conditional fourth-round pick in the [[2018 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000694979/article/sam-bradford-traded-to-vikings-for-two-draft-picks|title=Sam Bradford traded to Vikings for two draft picks|last=Orr|first=Conor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/Sam-Bradford-Traded-To-Minnesota/390017a6-3441-4a43-b39b-eeb1a65dbe64|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521010249/https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/article-1/Sam-Bradford-Traded-To-Minnesota/390017a6-3441-4a43-b39b-eeb1a65dbe64|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-05-21|title=Sam Bradford Traded To Minnesota|last=Smith|first=Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade was made after Vikings quarterback [[Teddy Bridgewater]] suffered a season-ending ACL tear during team practice on August 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17424174/teddy-bridgewater-suffers-serious-knee-injury-minnesota-vikings-practice|title=Vikings QB Teddy Bridgewater dislocates knee, tears ACL in drill|author=Ben Goessling|publisher=espn.com|date=2016-08-30|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

15 days after being traded, Bradford made his first start for the Vikings in Week 2 against the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Despite not having much time to learn the offense, Bradford outplayed [[Aaron Rodgers]] but ended up hurting his left hand in the first half due to a hit by [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]]. Bradford finished the game completing 22-of-31 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns, helping lead the Vikings to their first win in their [[U.S. Bank Stadium|new stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201609180min.htm |title=Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings - September 18th, 2016 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first touchdown as a Viking came in the second quarter on an eight-yard pass to tight end [[Kyle Rudolph]] in the back of the end zone, while the second touchdown of the night was a 25-yarder to [[Stefon Diggs]] late in the third quarter that gave the Vikings a 17-7 lead. The connection between both players resulted in 182 yards on 9 catches for Diggs, a career-high for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dominant-sam-bradford-outplays-aaron-rodgers-in-vikings-debut-8-takeaways/|title=Dominant Sam Bradford outplays Aaron Rodgers in Vikings debut: 8 takeaways|website=cbssports.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradford received high praise from the media, with many calling it one of the best games of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vikings.com/news/lunch-break/article-1/Peter-King-on-Sam-Bradfords-Performance-vs-Packers-Best-Night-as-a-Pro/c3f2e11a-e90d-489c-949f-77dada5f9f3e|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110005804/https://www.vikings.com/news/lunch-break/article-1/Peter-King-on-Sam-Bradfords-Performance-vs-Packers-Best-Night-as-a-Pro/c3f2e11a-e90d-489c-949f-77dada5f9f3e|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 November 2017|title=Peter King on Sam Bradford's Performance vs. Packers: 'Best Night as a Pro'|website=vikings.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Bradford threw for 171 yards and one touchdown in a 22-10 win against the [[Carolina Panthers]], thanks to a strong Vikings' defense that sacked [[Cam Newton]] eight times and intercepted him three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201609250car.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Carolina Panthers - September 25th, 2016 |website= Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date= 2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vikings' win over the [[2016 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in Week 4, Bradford threw a touchdown pass and did not throw an interception for the third straight game.

'''The Sea Hag''' is a fictional character owned by [[King Features Syndicate]]. She is a tall, masculine looking [[Witchcraft|witch]] featured in comics/cartoons as a [[archenemy|nemesis]] to the character [[Popeye]]. The Sea Hag was created by [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Crisler Segar]] in 1929 as part of the ''[[Thimble Theatre]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/abandoned-love-so-who-exactly-is-the-sea-hags-son/|title=Abandoned Love: So Who Exactly is the Sea Hag's Son?|date=11 September 2015|website=Cbr.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
The Sea Hag is one of the central enemies of Popeye the Sailor. She is the last witch on earth, and a [[Piracy|pirate]] who sails the Seven Seas in her ship "The Black Barnacle." She has a headquarters on Plunder Island, where she keeps a pride of lions that she uses to dispatch her enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. C. Segar]], ''Plunder Island''. [[King Features Syndicate]], 3 December 1933 to 7 August 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; She also has a deep knowledge of magic artifacts, and has used many of them to great effect over the years. She is able to practice [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]] magic and powerful enough to capture the equally magical [[Eugene the Jeep]] (though in the 1961 cartoon, "Myskery Melody," she declares her magic is powerless against him, and is subsequently shown running as Eugene attacks her with magical electricity from his tail), and on one occasion [[Santa Claus]]. She can even alter her appearance to that of her alter ego, "Rose of the Sea." The Sea Hag has a pet [[vulture]] named Bernard as her [[Familiar spirit|familiar]]. Bernard is abnormally strong and can easily carry a human in flight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bud Sagendorf]], "Dumb Vulture", in ''Popeye the Sailor:Sea Stories''. [[Gold Key Comics]], October 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Hag also commands an army of Goons. The most famous of the Goons is [[Alice the Goon]].

Because she is a woman, Popeye cannot physically attack her. His honor says that he would never hit a woman, even someone as evil as the Sea Hag.  In such cases, it is Olive Oyl herself who steps in and does physical damage to her.  One notable exception to this is in the 1960s cartoon, "Old Salt Tale" where Popeye grabs her whip and uses it to fling her into the sea.  However this is during a story being told by Popeye, and therefore is not technically him.

Upon meeting Popeye, she falls madly in love with him. Discovering that Popeye already has a girlfriend named [[Olive Oyl]] she tries her best to be rid of Olive and win Popeye over to her favor.  Popeye makes it clear to her though that under no circumstances would he be interested in a relationship with her. Enraged, on one occasion she gave Popeye's archenemy Brutus a potion to become young and handsome as a means to win Olive Oyl's heart. Later after thinking that the Sea Hag had died, Popeye had this to say once he discovered that she wasn't: "I yam glad she ain't dead even if she is a exter bad woman. If they wasn't no bad women, maybe we wouldn't appreciate the good ones. Anyway, she yam what she yam!" Despite this, the Sea Hag has tried to kill Popeye on occasion when upset that Popeye remains uninterested in her romantically.

'''Edmond Wai-Hong Yu''' ({{lang|zh|余偉康}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2014-07-25/headline1406277092d5154524.html|author=楊婉文|title=當年患精神病港移民遭擊斃 死者姊：警配攝錄機有新意|newspaper=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|date=2014-07-25|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; October 2, 1961 – February 20, 1997) was a [[Hong Kong Canadian]] former medical student whose death after being shot by a constable of the [[Toronto Police Service]] sparked debates about the [[police]]'s [[use of force]], [[mental illness]], and the treatment of those diagnosed with a mental illness.

==Early life and mental illness==
Yu was raised in [[Hong Kong]] and immigrated to [[Canada]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Nunes; Scott Simmie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvkhbvcuiyYC&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=edmond+yu+hong+kong+toronto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ooAHTPIVAJ&amp;sig=Sp00OQDFKREVA0iKfW6JFMXHRYo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sDYKVNfGBYPeoATwx4DABQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=edmond%20yu%20hong%20kong%20toronto&amp;f=false Beyond Crazy: Journeys Through Mental Illness]&lt;/ref&gt; While young, Edmond won the Hong Kong [[city]] [[boxing]] championship. He attended [[York University]] from 1982 to 1984, studying [[pre-medicine]]. In 1984 he was accepted as a medical student at the [[University of Toronto]].

In 1985, police arrested Yu and took him to the Clark Institute of Psychiatry, where he was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].

==Death==
On February 20, 1997, Yu assaulted a woman at a bus stop, then boarded a bus. Police attempted to board the bus, at which point Yu, according to witnesses, raised a small hammer. Constable Lou Pasquino fired six shots, hitting Yu three times.

An official inquest in 1998–1999 cleared the police of wrongdoing and resulted in a number of recommendations.  The inquest concluded, "[[Affordable housing|Housing]] is a mental health issue and the absence of decent housing is a major determinant of health."[https://web.archive.org/web/20040821001901/http://www.ontario.cmha.ca/content/about_mental_illness/homelessness.asp?cID=3975]

A foundation to fund "a housing project for [[homeless]] men with mental health problems" has been set up in Edmond Yu's name.  There have been a number of other memorials to Yu, such as The Edmond Yu House, which claims to be "a low-stress, high support, and non-medical organization for psychiatric survivors of the Mental Health System who also experience homelessness and would be considered 'hard to house' people", and The Edmond Yu Project.

David Hawkins made a documentary on Yu, ''The Death and Life of Edmond Yu'', and Laura Sky made a documentary as well, ''Crisis Call''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/ylife/2006/01-30/Crisiscall01202006.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talut''' ({{Lang-ar|طالوت}}, ''Ṭālūt'') is considered to be the [[Qur’an]]ic name for [[Saul]],&lt;ref&gt;[[M. A. S. Abdel Haleem]]: ''The Qur'an, a new translation'', note to 2:247.&lt;/ref&gt; as he was the ''Malik'' ({{lang-ar|مَـلِـك}}, [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King]]) of [[Israel]], or [[Gideon#Biblical narrative|Gideon]],&lt;ref name=al-islam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=315&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2 |title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the reasoning that the Quran references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in the [[Book of Judges]] (7:5-7),&lt;ref name=Judges&gt;Judges vii. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; and other factors associated with the latter.

== Name ==
The name 'Tālūt' has uncertain [[etymology]].  Unlike some other Quranic figures, the Arabic name is not similar to the Hebrew name (''Sha'ul''). According to [[Tafsir|Muslim exegetes]], the name 'Tālūt' means 'Tall' (from the Arabic "tūl") and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which would be consistent with the Biblical account.&lt;ref name=Oliver2006&gt;Leaman, Oliver, ''The Quran, An Encyclopedia'', 2006, p.638.&lt;/ref&gt; In explanation of the name, exegetes such as [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi|Tha'labi]] hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, but no one in Israel reached its height except Tālūt (Saul).

== Narrative in the Quran ==
Israelites demanded a King after the time of [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]), to lead them into war against their foes. Talut was chosen by the Prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] (not mentioned by name explicitly, but rather as "a Prophet" of the Israelites) announced that [[God in Islam|Allah]] chose Talut as their King. The Israelites questioned Samuel about this, lacking respect for Talut as he was not wealthy. Samuel then told them that Talut was more favored than they were. He was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique. A sign of his role as King was that [[God]] brought back the [[Ark of the Covenant]] for Israel. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who took from it in "the hollow of the hand." Many drank, and only the faithful ventured on. Talut led the Israelites to victory over the army of [[Goliath]], who was killed by [[David in Islam|Dawud]] (David). Talut is not considered as a ''[[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Nabi]]'' ({{lang-ar|نَـبِي}}, [[Prophet]]), but a Divinely appointed King.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|246|e=252|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|2|246|e=252|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quranic account&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|246|e=252|s=ns"/&gt; differs from the Biblical account (if Saul is assumed to be Talut) in that in the [[Bible]], the Sacred Ark was returned to Israel before Saul's accession, and the test by drinking water is made in the [[Hebrew Bible]] not by Saul, but by Gideon.&lt;ref name=Judges/&gt;

== Hadith ==
Talut is also mentioned in a ''[[hadith]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـديـث}}, 'narration'): "Narrated Al-Bara: The companions of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], who took part in [[Battle of Badr|Badr]], told me that their number was that of Talut's companions who crossed the river ([[Jordan River|of Jordan]]) with him, and they were over three-hundred-and-ten men. By [[Allah]], none crossed the river with him, but a believer."&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari: Book 5: Volume 59: Hadith 293: Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (Al-Maghaazi).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Computers are only 36 years old
* Kids growing up now will be part of the computer generation
* Computers are simple, adaptive, and fast
* The oldest person with a degree in Computer Science is 39
* Computers are very fast. They run a million instructions per second
* Programmers build a collection of low level instructions into higher level instructions
* Early electric motors of the late 1890s initially were large thus were applied to large scale applications. They didn't proliferate quickly
* Later electric motors drove a shaft through a factory to empower multiple workstations simultaneously
* The fractional horsepower electric motor was a breakthrough because it was applied to small individual applications
* There are approximately 55 fractional horsepower motors in every household
* The history of computers parallels the history of electric motors
* [[ENIAC]] the first computer, was giant, hardly anyone got a chance to use it
* A 1960s computing breakthrough was [[Time-sharing]]. Many people could share a large computer e.g. on a college campus
* "The reason Apple exists is because we stumbled on to the fractional horsepower computer 5 years before anybody else."
* "We made a computer that was about 13 pounds"
* The first PC was invented in 1976. In 1983 the industry will ship 3 million personal computers
* By 1986, we will ship more computers than automobiles in the USA
* "...I need your help. If you've looked at computers, they all look like garbage. All of the great product designers are off designing automobiles/buildings but hardly any of them are designing computers."
* The industry will sell 10 million computers whether they look ugly or great because people are going to be spellbound/elated
* "It doesn't cost any more money to make it look great"
* They are going to be these new objects that are going to be in everyone's working environment, educational environment, and home environment
* "We have a shot at putting a great object there (work, school, home) and if we don't, we are going to put one more piece of junk object there"
* By 1986 people will be spending two or three hours a day interacting with computers
* Industrial design, the software design should be given the same consideration that we give automobiles if not a lot more
* "Most of the objects of our life are not designed in America. We've blown it"
* "Computers and society are out on a first date in the 80's."
* "We have a chance to make these things beautiful. We have a chance to communicate something through the design of the objects themselves."
* Apple alone will spend over 100 million dollars over the next 12 months on media advertising. [[IBM]] will spend at least that amount
* The personal computer is a new medium of communication. One of the media. e.g. books, radio, television, newspapers
* Computer communication is different from other mediums. Telephone demands both parties of a conversation be simultaneously present. Computers do not have this requirement.
* "One of these days when we have portable computers with radio links, they can be walking around Aspen and retrieve it. (e-mail)"
* "The process of communication changes as the mediums evolve."
* When a new media emerges, we tend to fall back into old media habits
* The first TV shows are basically radio shows with a television camera pointed at them
* It took the better part of the 1950s for television to come 'into its own' as a medium
* [[John F. Kennedy]] funeral television broadcast gave people a level of intensity that would not have been possible with radio
* The [[Apollo program]] landing. That experience was not possible with the previous medium
* It took 20 years for television to evolve away from radio
* "Optical video discs" ([[Laserdisc]]) can store 55 thousand images on a side, or an hour of video randomly accessible. What are we using it for? Movies. We're dropping back into old media habits."
* 5 to 10 years from now, random access storage will 'come into its own'
* 1979 [[MIT]] experiment, [[Aspen Movie Map]]. A precursor of [[Google Street View]] is stored on [[laserdisc]] and reveals that random access storage will differentiate itself from other media
* We are still running historic applications on personal computers e.g. business accounting, [[COBOL]]
* [[Apple Lisa]] enables a person with little talent to draw artistic pictures, transmit them via e-mail
* Computer programs are an idea expressed on paper. They enable thousands of individual experiences based on one set of underlying principles
* [[Hamurabi]] video game. 7 year old kids are playing with a macro economic model. Interactive learning
* Books were a way to learn without an intermediary teacher. "The problem was, you can't ask [[Aristotle]] a question."
* Maybe in the next 50 to 100 years we will enable computer to capture an individual's underlying spirit, set of principles, world so that after they are gone we can ask the computer a question and receive an answer consistent with that individual
* Ultimately computers are going to be used for communication and over the next 5 years the standards for interconnecting computers are going to evolve. They all speak different languages right now.
* Early [[Xerox PARC]] [[Local Area Network]] list server revealed special interest groups in the office. Soon there were more interest groups than there were employees.
* As computers are networked (on the internet), they will facilitate the creation of special interest groups and bring together the people in those groups. ([[Social Networking]])
* Office [[Local Area Network]] are about 5 years away
* Home [[Local Area Network]] are about 10 to 15 years away
* "We want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you, that you can learn how to use in 20 minutes. That's what we want to do. And we want to do it this decade. And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so that you dont have to hook up to anything. So you are in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers."
* Apple sets out "To design the computer that we want to put into the book eventually even though we cannot put it into the book now and it's called [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]."
* [[Apple Lisa]] is sold out for the first year
* Eventually we will get to the point where people can create images as good as any other way.

* [[Alexander Graham Bell]]
* [[Telegraphy|Telegraph]] took 40 hours to learn
* [[Macintosh]] hardware took more than two years to design
* Good [[Public relations|PR]] educates people
* Apple and [[IBM]] as computing standards
* Merging of the telephone and the personal computer
* Apple's roots are selling to people not [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500s]]
* Strategic mistakes of the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] computer division
* Jobs was inexperienced at running a company
* Sorrow over internal disagreements about the vision 
* The Macintosh represents Jobs' unrealized vision for the Lisa: a computer for people not corporations
* 'Insanely great' people make 'insanely great' products for themselves, to their own highest standard
* The Macintosh group wanted to build the greatest computer that has ever been seen
* The IBM PC group lacked pride in their product and were motivated by money
* Average age of Apple employees is 29
* Most people in their 30's and 40's get stuck in their thought processes with rare exceptions
* "Companies, as they grow to become multibillion-dollar entities, somehow lose their vision. They insert lots of layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work."
* "Apple is an [[Ellis Island]] company. Apple is built on refugees from other companies. These are the extremely bright individual contributors who were troublemakers at other companies."
* [[Edwin H. Land|Dr. Edwin Land]] (founder of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]]) saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that
* "...Dr. Land one of those brilliant troublemakers, was asked to leave his own company‐‑which is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard of."
* A visionary that brings together art and science is the most important thing to be, not a football player or astronaut
* In 5 to 10 years [[John Sculley]] and Jobs intend to make Apple a 10 or 20 billion dollar company 
* That scale is merely to remain competitive. The bigger concern is how that scale is achieved.
* Apple hires people that want to make large contributions today not await permission to do so years from now. 
* People/workers rarely get to contribute to the pool of innovation which we all rely upon.
* Rather than focus on [[Fortune 500]] customers, focus on how to change how small groups/businesses work.
* There should not be one computing standard. Macintosh is clearly better than IBM. Innovation emerges via competition.
* IBM will eventually crush companies that are compatible with their systems
* To reach tens of millions of people, a computer that is significantly different from IBM is needed. Hence Macintosh.
* IBM believes in service, support, security, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], and 'motherhood'. 
* "Apple’s key observation three years ago was that when you’re shipping 10,000,000 computers a year, even IBM does not have enough mothers to ship one with every computer. So you’ve got to build motherhood into the computer."
* If Apple makes a mistake and IBM wins, the world will enter a computer [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] for 20 years.
* [[Frito-Lay]], a company that dominates a market via service and support and stifles newcomers in their market.
* IBM dominated and therefore did not innovate in the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] industry for 15 years.
* The IBM platform is a repackaging of dated [[Apple II]] level technology
* Apple and IBM won't have much competition in the hardware space. The days of significant hardware start-ups are gone.
* New, innovative companies will focus on software.

*Centenary of the motion picture
*Scale and complexity of [[Toy Story]]
*Place in History of Computer Graphics
*[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] projected the first film 100 years ago in [[Paris]]
*How has technology changed the way we view motion pictures?
*1895 [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] invented their own cameras and projectors
*1927 the next technological innovation was sound (almost 40 years later)
*[[Al Jolson|Al Jolson's]] lines ended the era of silent pictures forever
*The impact of sound: 60 million movie viewers in 1927 to 110 million viewers in 1929
*[[The Jazz Singer]] was immensely popular and saved [[Warner Bros.]] studio
*1932 The next major innovation was [[Technicolor]]
*1937 first animated feature film with [[multiplane camera]]
*2D Animation was the first new form of motion picture entertainment since the first motion picture 42 years earlier
*1939 ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' became the first commercially successful color film
*1977 ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' redefined science fiction genre. Elevated [[special effect]]s to become an equal partner to live action in storytelling in motion pictures
*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[The Abyss]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]'', and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' incorporate some computer graphics special effects (but not on the scale of ''Toy Story'')
*Scale and complexity of ''Toy Story''
*''Toy Story'' is the first completely computer generated feature-length motion picture. Completely computer synthetic.
*Computer graphics are not just providing a supporting role to live action but are actually providing the entire vision for the motion picture.
*[[Pixar]] created a 'digital back (movie) lot'
*Jobs details the workflow of creating animated movies followed by numerous statistics about ''Toy Story''
*10 person years went into the modeling of Toy Story
*34 terabytes of [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]] files were [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]
*800 thousand machine hours of rendering on [[SPARCstation 20|Sun SPARCstation 20 quad processors]]
*[[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] has 723 animation control points. 58 on the mouth alone.
*[[Buzz Lightyear]] has over 600 textures
*One scene has over 1 million leaves rendered on trees
*Toy story is the classic 'buddy picture'. Two adversaries forced to work together by circumstance.
*(The [[SIGGRAPH]] computer graphics) community has finally achieved the creation of a feature length 3D animated synthetic film
*(The SIGGRAPH computer graphics community) pioneered the next major offshoot of the motion picture (3D Animation) "Its going to be a medium in its own right."

*People that succeed don't give up.
*The personal computer is entering its third great age
*The first age of the PC was productivity
*The second age was the internet
*The third age is the digital lifestyle
*It took a year to realize that the PC would become a major industry
*At first, we made the computer kits for our friends
*The circle of friends got bigger and bigger. Now 25 million people.
*Money is not a good reason to start a company
*Start a company to express an idea. Sometimes that's the only way to get people to listen.
*We try to hire very smart people and focus on doing a few things well.
*Allow people to do the best work of their lives
*Apple is in a great spot today, 3 or 4 years ago it was fragile.
*The internet has no emotion. The bandwidth isn't there to deliver emotion. 
*At Apple, we want to stand at the intersection of technology and humanities.
*We want to bring the humanist side into these tools we don't just want to serve the intellectual side.
*There are a lot of forces that attempt to funnel us into an institutionalized path.
*We have had over a million customers make movies with iMovie
*The whole personal computer industry has previously not spoken to the emotional and creative side of people. It has only spoken to the side of us that is pushing numbers.
*I think about 3 or 4 years down the road.
*Some 5 year planning is essential, but most 5 year planning changes within a few years.

'''Victorio''' ('''Bidu-ya''', '''Beduiat'''; ca. 1825&amp;ndash;October 14, 1880) was a [[warrior]] and [[tribal chief|chief]] of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh (or [[Chiricahua#bands|Chihenne]], usually called [[Mimbreño]]) division of the central [[Apache]]s in what is now the [[United States|American]] states of [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] states of [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].

== War leader and chief ==
Victorio grew up in the Chihenne band. There is speculation that he or his band had Navajo kinship ties and was known among the Navajo as "he who checks his horse". Victorio's sister was the famous woman warrior [[Lozen]], or the "Dextrous Horse Thief".

In 1853 he was considered a chief or sub-chief by the [[United States Army]] and signed a document. In his twenties, he rode with [[Mangas Coloradas]], leader of the Coppermine band of the Tchihendeh people and principal leader of the whole Tchihendeh Apache division (who took him as his son-in-law), and [[Cuchillo Negro]], leader of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh people and second principal leader of the whole Tchihendeh Apache division, as well as did [[Nana (chief)|Nana]], [[Delgadito (Apache chief)|Delgadito]], [[Cochise]], [[Juh]], [[Geronimo]] and other Apache leaders.  As was the custom, he became the leader of a large mixed band of [[Mimbreño]]s and [[Mescalero]]s (led by his friend &amp;ndash; and probably brother-in-law as husband of another daughter of Mangas Coloradas, as well the same Cochise &amp;ndash; Caballero) and fought against the [[United States Army]].

From 1870 to 1880, Victorio, chief of the Coppermine Mimbreños and principal leader of all the Tchihende, along with Loco, chief of the Warm Spring Mimbreños and second-ranking among the Tchihende, were moved to and left at least three different reservations, some more than once, despite their bands' request to live on traditional lands. Victorio, Loco and the Mimbreños were moved to [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos Reservation]] in [[Arizona Territory]] in 1877.  Victorio and his followers (including old Nana) left the reservation twice, seeking and temporarily obtaining hospitality in Fort Stanton Reservation among their Sierra Blanca and Sacramento Mescalero allies and relatives (Caballero was probably Victorio's brother-in-law and Mangus' uncle, San Juan was too an old friend and Nana's wife was a Mescalero woman), before they came back to Ojo Caliente only to leave permanently in late August 1879, which started [[Victorio's War]]. Despite [[Nautzili]]'s efforts, many Northern Mescalero warriors, led by Caballero and Muchacho Negro, joined him with their families, and San Juan and other Mescaleros also left their reservation; many Guadalupe and Limpia Mescalero too ([[Carnoviste]] and [[Alsate]] were close allies to Victorio after 1874) joined Victorio's people. Victorio was successful at raiding and evading capture by the military, and won a significant engagement at Las Animas Canyon on September 18 1879.
Within a few months Victorio led an impressive series of other brilliant fights against troops of the 9th, 10th and 6th U.S. Cavalry near the Percha River (Rio Puerco) (January 1 1880), in the San Mateos Mountains (January 17 1880) and in the Cabello Mountains near the Animas Creek (January 30, 1880), and again near Aleman's Wells, San Andres Mountains west of White Sands, (February 2 1880), then again in the San Andres Mountains (perhaps near Victorio’s Peak) routing the cavalrymen and chasing them to the Rio Grande (February 9th1889), then (April 4 1880) at Hembrillo Canyon, San Andres Mountains. In April 1880, Victorio was credited with leading the [[Alma Massacre]] – a raid on United States settlers' homes around [[Alma, New Mexico]]. During this event, 41 settlers were killed. Victorio's warriors were finally driven off by the arrival of American soldiers from [[Fort Bayard Historic District|Fort Bayard]]. However, Victorio continued his campaign with the [[Battle of Fort Tularosa|attack]] on [[Battle of Fort Tularosa|Fort Tularosa]], where his warriors had to face a detachment (K troop) of the 9th Cavalry and were repulsed by the "Buffalo Soldiers" after a harsh fight.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.huntel.com/~artpike/almamass.htm Alma Massacre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007024700/http://www.huntel.com/~artpike/almamass.htm |date=2008-10-07 }}. Retrieved 6/11/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorio's camp near the Rio Palomas, in the Black Range, was surprised and attacked on May 23–25, 1880, but the Mimbreños and Mescaleros succeeded in repulsing the soldiers. After the Rio Palomas battle, Victorio went on some raids to Mexico repeatedly fording the Rio Grande, after having been intercepted and  beaten off, with a 60 warriors' party, at Quitman Canyon (July 30, 1880). Chased by more than 4.000 armed men ([[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]], [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th]], [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Cavalry]], [[15th Infantry regiment (United States)|15th U.S. Infantry]], [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]) Victorio fooled all of them during more than one month.
On August 9, 1880 Victorio and his band attacked a stagecoach and mortally wounded retired Major General James J. Byrne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillett|first1=James B.|title=Six Years with the Texas Rangers, 1875 to 1881|date=1921|publisher=von Boeckmann-Jones Company|location=Austin, Tex|page=253|edition=1|url=https://archive.org/details/sixyearswithtexa00gill|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last stand and death ==
In October 1880, while moving along the [[Rio Grande]] in north-eastern Chihuahua (a land well-known to the Guadalupe and Limpia Southern Mescaleros), having sent Nana and Mangus to raid for food and ammunition, Victorio, with only a few warriors and even less ammunition, and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the [[Mexican Army]] under Colonel Joaquin Terrazas in the [[Battle of Tres Castillos]] ({{coord|29.967|N|105.783|W|scale:2500000}}).&lt;ref&gt;Google Maps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillett, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/gott.pdf|author=Gott, Kendall D.|title=In Search of an Elusive Enemy: The Victorio Campaign|year=2004|publisher= Fort Leavenworth, KS: Combat Studies Institute Press|ISBN =1428910344|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1886 appendix for Papers Relating to the Foreign Nations of the United States states that, contemporaneously, the [[Tarahumara]] Scout credited with killing Victorio in 1880 was Mauricio Corredor.&lt;ref name="State1887"&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=United States.

}}'''Zwelakhe Sisulu''' (17 December 1950 – 4 October 2012)&lt;ref name=jailed /&gt; was a [[South African]] black journalist, editor, and newspaper founder. He was president of the Writers' Association of South Africa, which later became the Black Media Workers Association of South Africa (or Mwasa), and he led a year-long strike in 1980 for fair wages for black journalists. He was a victim of the Apartheid-era government in South Africa and was imprisoned at least three times for his journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anthony |last=Lewis |title=Abroad at Home: To Destroy a Country |publisher=New York Times |date=14 April 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thloloe&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe |last= Thloloe |title=Zwelakhe Sisulu: leader black media could trust, 1950 – 2012 |publisher=Sunday Times (South Africa) |date=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web|first=Zwelakhe |last=Sisulu |title=Statement by Zwelakhe Sisulu on the Occasion of the 20th Anniversary of the Founding of ARTICLE 19 |publisher=ARTICLE 19 |url=http://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/other/statement-by-zwelakhe-sisulu-on-the-occasion-of-the-20th-anniversary-of-the-.pdf |type=speech |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Apartheid ended, he became the chief executive officer of the [[South African Broadcast Corporation]].&lt;ref name=activism /&gt;

==Personal history==
Zwelakhe Sisulu's family is well known for its struggle against Apartheid in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Carlin |title=A family to make Pretoria tremble: Walter Sisulu will leave his cell to join a wife and son who have themselves been restricted |publisher=The Independent |date=1989-10-12 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of anti-Apartheid activists and [[African National Congress]] members [[Walter Sisulu]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]]. He was the brother of [[Max Sisulu]], Speaker of the National Assembly, and [[Lindiwe Sisulu]], Minister of Public Service and Administration. His father was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 when Zwelakhe Sisulu was 13 years old.&lt;ref name=jailed /&gt;

Sisulu and his wife Zodwa had 2 sons and 1 daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew |last=Savides |title=Struggle icons bury Sisulu |publisher=Sunday Times (South Africa) |date=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Zwelakhe Sisulu began his career in journalism in 1975 when he worked as an intern for South African Associated Newspapers. He then became a journalist for ''[[The Rand Daily Mail]]'' where he covered the [[Soweto uprising]] in 1976 and remained there until 1978. He was news editor of the ''Sunday Post'' (South Africa) until his ban in 1980.&lt;ref name=jailed /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thloloe /&gt; While at the ''Sunday Post'', he was sentenced to prison for his refusal to reveal information about sources of one of his reporters and he led a 1980 strike which resulted in his ban from journalism for several years. After his house arrest, he was a [[Nieman Fellowship|Nieman Fellow]]. After his fellowship was complete in 1985, he worked for ''[[Sowetan]]''. In 1986, he founded the ''New Nation'' (defunct since 30 May 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=African National Congress of South Africa |title=South Africa: ANC Marks the Last Edition Of New Nation |publisher=AllAfrica |date=3 June 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before he was arrested by police and held without a trial as part of the emergency and mass arrests in South Africa at the time. The newspaper was editorially aligned with the African National Congress, which stated on its masthead: "The media of the powerless." At the time it was South Africa's largest black newspaper.&lt;ref name=newnation /&gt; After his release from a 2-year detention and after the ban was lifted on the ANC, Sisulu served as [[Nelson Mandela|Nelson Mandela's]] press secretary and also the director of information of the African National Congress.&lt;ref name=activism /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Kifner |title=The Mandela Visit: Mandela Gets an Emotional New York City Welcome |publisher=New York Times |date=21 June 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-Apartheid South Africa, Sisulu became the head of the South African Broadcast Corporation in 1994.&lt;ref name=activism /&gt;

After his stint at SABC, Sisulu founded [[New African Investments Limited]], which is known as the first black-owned business on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and black empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sapa and Mkhulu Mashau |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/zwelakhe-sisulu-laid-to-rest-1.1402516#.UQcF1x2_J8E |title=Zwelakhe Sisulu laid to rest – South Africa &amp;#124; IOL News |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=14 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holdings of the company include the publishing house David Philip, Soweto TV and [[Primedia Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name=speech /&gt;

==Early activism==
Zwelakhe Sisulu walked a fine line between journalism and activism already while at ''The Rand Daily Mail''. In 1977, he became president of the Writers' Association of South Africa. As president, he led a march with his fellow black journalists and then was briefly jailed. Sisulu's editor admonished him for his explanation that he was making use of his freedom of assembly. His editor told him, "You don't march, you write."&lt;ref name=activism&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Gevisser |work=The Mail &amp; Guardian |title=South Africa SA's Most Powerful Media Boss |publisher=Africa News |date=16 February 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sisulu first came to international attention in a case involving the surveillance of black journalists. While an editor at the ''Sunday Post'' in 1979, Sisulu was questioned by authorities about his knowledge of a source used by journalist [[Thamsanqa Gerald Mkhwanazi]]. Sisulu was sentenced for nine months in prison for refusing to co-operate. For the first time, police acknowledged in his case the practice of using wiretaps on a journalists' telephones, which had been widely suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Caryle |last=Murphy |title=S. Africa Increasingly Restricts Press |publisher=Washington Post |date=12 August 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike and arrest==
Zwelakhe Sisulu was the leader of the union during Mwasa's strike for fair wages for black journalists in 1980. It was the first strike by black journalists.&lt;ref name=jailed /&gt; After the strike was over, he lost his job, was banned from journalism, and ordered under house arrest for three years until 1983. Zwelakhe Sisulu's arrest on 30 June 1981 was attributed to the Internal Security Act. Other leaders who shared the same fate were [[Phil Mtimkhulu]], [[Mathatha Tsedu]], [[Subri Govende]] and [[Joe Thloloe]].&lt;ref name=Thloloe /&gt;

He was a Nieman Fellow from 1984–1985.&lt;ref name=Thloloe /&gt;

==New Nation and 1986 arrests==
Zwelakhe Sisulu was arrested twice in 1986.

Police swept him away from his home for the first time on 27 June 1986. Sisulu later called them "armed bandits." The government announced his detention one week later. There were calls from abroad to release him, such as one from the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] (ASNE). He was released on 18 July 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black editor abducted / Zwelakhe Sisulu in South Africa |publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=28 June 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |title=U.S. Editors' Society Urges Pretoria to Free a Journalist |publisher=New York Times |date=29 June 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister frees detained editor / New Nation newspaper editor Sisulu released by South African authorities |publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=19 July 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allafrica&gt;{{cite news|first=Tami |last=Hultman |title=South Africa: Zwelakhe Sisulu – a Remembrance |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201210050366.html |publisher=AllAfrica |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwelakhe Sisulu had already been appointed director of the Board for a new organisation [[ARTICLE 19]] at the time of his second arrest 12 December 1986. He was detained at [[John Vorster Square]] where other activists were also imprisoned.&lt;ref name=allafrica  /&gt; The organization made his case its first campaign. He was released after two years but not allowed to continue his work as a journalist.&lt;ref name=bdlive /&gt;&lt;ref name=newnation&gt;{{cite news|first=Victoria |last=Brittain |title=Editor says black South African paper is threatened with closure |publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=7 December 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Timothy |last=Findley |title=Writing: the pain and the pleasure The power to persuade is mitigated wherever you turn |publisher=Toronto Star |date=21 March 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, he stated his belief that the publicity of organisations like ARTICLE 19 during the time of his imprisonment saved his life.&lt;ref name=speech /&gt;

==South African Broadcasting Corporation==
He was the CEO of the South African Broadcasting Corporation from September 1994 to 1997.&lt;ref name=allafrica /&gt; Under Sisulu's leadership in a democratic South Africa, the SABC was reorganized and relaunched 4 February 1996. A controversy was created over the redistribution of resources for other languages besides Afrikaans, which had received special privileges under the Apartheid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jacquie |last1=Golding-Duffy |first2=Justin |last2=Pearce |title=South Africa Is TV Relaunching ... Or Re-sinking? |publisher=Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) |date=19 January 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Sisulu was appointed as a commissioner to investigate censorship at the SABC that had been alleged by whistleblower [[John Perlman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ferial |last=Haffajee |url=http://www.swradioafrica.com/pages/sabcblacklist.htm |title=Inside the SABC blacklist report |publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Sisulu was awarded an [[Order of Mapungubwe]] - Gold, posthumously for "his exceptional contribution to quality journalism; and as a reporter exposing the cruelties of apartheid and encouraging unity among the people of different political persuasions to fight for liberation.")&lt;ref name="Govza"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gov.za/speeches/president-jacob-zuma-bestows-2016-national-orders-awards-28-apr-20-apr-2016-0000 | title=President Jacob Zuma bestows 2016 National Orders Awards, 28 Apr | publisher=South African Government | date=20 April 2016 | accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
