The '''A55''', also known as the '''North Wales Expressway''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Gwibffordd Gogledd Cymru'')&lt;ref name="Trunk Road"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/transport/roads/schemes/statement/090917a55/?lang=en |title=The Chester to Bangor Trunk Road (A55), Talerdy Junction Phase 2, St Asaph - Environmental Impact Assessment |publisher=[[Welsh Government]] |accessdate=2014-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606222421/http://wales.gov.uk/topics/transport/roads/schemes/statement/090917a55/?lang=en |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a major road in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Its entire length from [[Chester]] to [[Holyhead]] is a [[dual carriageway]] [[primary route]], with the exception of the [[Britannia Bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] and several short sections where there are gaps in between the two carriageways. All junctions are [[Grade separation|grade separated]] apart from a roundabout east of [[Penmaenmawr]] and another nearby in [[Llanfairfechan]]. Initially, the road ran from [[Chester]] to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]]. In 2001, it was extended across [[Anglesey]] to the [[ferry]] [[port of Holyhead]] parallel to the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] . The road improvements have been part funded with European money, under the [[Trans-European Networks]] programme, as the route is designated part of [[International E-road network|Euroroute]] [[European route E22|E22]] ([[Holyhead]] - [[Leeds]] - [[Amsterdam]] - [[Hamburg]] - [[Malmö]] - [[Riga]] - [[Moscow]] - [[Perm]] - [[Ekaterinburg]] - [[Ishim, Tyumen Oblast|Ishim]]).

The A55 is sometimes called a [[motorway]], because of its appearance, although it is not officially a motorway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/24/dog-on-motorway-deliberately-run-down-and-killed-by-police-5714308/ e.g]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route ==

===The Chester southerly bypass===
The A55 begins at junction 12, the southern end of the [[M53 motorway]] near [[Chester]]. It is known as the Chester southerly bypass. The A55 crosses the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] and the [[England–Wales border|border]] into Wales, passing close to [[Broughton, Flintshire]], and passing north of [[Buckley]], [[Penyffordd]] and [[Northop]]. There is a major climb between Broughton and Buckley (Junctions 35a to 35) though with no crawler lane. Junction 34/33b is point at which the [[A494 road|A494]] converges and then diverges with the A55. The road briefly has a three-lane section as westbound traffic from [[Queensferry, Flintshire|Queensferry]] can leave towards [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]]. In the eastbound direction another short three-lane section allows vehicles to join the A494 or exit onto the A55 to Chester. Traffic taking the A55 into England must negotiate a tight 270 degree speed-limited single lane curve to climb up and over the A55/A494. Plans to upgrade the A494 between this junction at [[Ewloe]] and Queensferry were rejected by the [[Welsh Government]] on 26 March 2008 due to their scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2008/3991797/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government - Decision on A494 Drome Corner to Ewloe scheme] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330110105/http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2008/3991797/?lang=en |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ewloe to Colwyn Bay ===
[[File:Rhuallt hill A55 - geograph.org.uk - 29554.jpg|thumb|right|Climbing up Rhuallt Hill eastwards.]]
From Ewloe, the road is relatively flat until after Northop when it climbs up onto the flanks of Halkyn Mountain range, passing to the southwest of [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] with major climbs between [[Northop]] and Halkyn (Junctions 33 and 32b) and Halkyn and [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] Summit (Junctions 32 and 31). This section of road is notorious for poor weather conditions including fog, ice and snow in winter months. In fine weather, however there are extensive views over the [[River Dee (Wales)|River Dee]] estuary to the [[Wirral Peninsula]], [[Liverpool]] and beyond. The highest part of the road is in the vicinity of Brynford at around 790 feet (240 m). The steep descent towards [[St Asaph]] is down the new Rhuallt Hill (Junctions 29 to 28), which also provides the first views of the mountains of [[Snowdonia]] in the far distance. There is a crawler lane on Rhuallt Hill for eastbound traffic. The road bypasses St Asaph to the north, and runs past [[Bodelwyddan]] and [[Abergele]] to reach the [[North Wales]] coast at [[Pensarn]] (Junction 23A). From here onwards to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], the route is close to the [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast railway]].

=== Colwyn Bay Bypass ===
Two sections between [[Llanddulas]] (Junction 23) to [[Conwy]] (Junction 17) are signed as a 70&amp;nbsp;mph (110&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limit because they are classed as non-[[motorway]] [[special road]]s. Unlike other sections of the A55 that have [[National speed limit|National Speed Limit (NSL)]] signage and are accessible to all motor vehicles, motorway-style restrictions (although the A55 is not a motorway) apply on these stretches of road (e.g. no pedestrians, learner drivers, farm vehicles etc). As the section is not part of the UK motorway network, or classed as an all-purpose road (public [[right of way]]), the National Speed Limit does not apply so 70&amp;nbsp;mph (110&amp;nbsp;km/h) signs (the maximum speed permitted on UK roads) are used instead.

A 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) limit remains in force through the [[Colwyn Bay]] bypass ([[Old Colwyn]] to [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]]). The restriction was imposed for several reasons. First as a safety precaution because the slip-roads on this stretch are unusually short due to the road's design. Part of it was built on a narrow swathe of land through the town that was once the [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales coast railway]]; {{rws|Colwyn Bay}} had to be rebuilt and the track bed realigned to complete the underpass. The former four-track railway was reduced to two more northerly tracks to make space for the road. Second the reduced speed limit was intended to reduce road noise for residents. However, since the completion of the Colwyn Bay bypass, the lower speed limit has been an unpopular decision with drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/50mph-limit-colwyn-bay-should-2052382|title=50mph limit at Colwyn Bay should be scrapped say drivers |publisher=www.walesonline.co.uk/|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Conwy Bypass ===
[[File:Conwy Road Tunnel - geograph.org.uk - 69955.jpg|thumb|right|Approaching the tunnel from the west.]]
The crossing of the estuary of the [[River Conwy]] is by means of an [[immersed tube]] [[tunnel]], the first of its kind constructed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-15435351 | work=BBC News | title=Conwy Tunnel praised on 20th anniversary | date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 1060m, the tunnel is the longest road tunnel in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Wales Tunnels |url=http://www.northwales-tra.gov.uk/index.php?id=329&amp;L=0 |website=web.archive.org |accessdate=23 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318034456/http://www.northwales-tra.gov.uk/index.php?id=329&amp;L=0 |archivedate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to construct an immersed tube tunnel bypass followed an extensive public consultation, named the Collcon Feasibility Study. This ruled out another bridge by the castle on aesthetic grounds, since it would have damaged the view of the world heritage site [[Conwy Castle]], and the two bridges by [[Robert Stephenson]] and [[Thomas Telford]]. Another alternative bridge crossing was proposed at [[Deganwy]], but this too was ruled out for aesthetic reasons. An inland alternative with heavy grades which would have passed over [[Bwlch y Ddeufaen]] pass at {{convert|430|m}}, following the old Roman road, was also worked up but rejected for cost and utility reasons.

The tunnel was constructed by a [[Costain Group|Costain]]/[[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] joint venture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a55wales.htm Motorway archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231035729/http://www.iht.org/motorway/a55wales.htm |date=31 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as pre-formed [[concrete]] sections, and then floated into position over a pre-prepared trench in the bed of the estuary. The 3 million tonnes of silt and mud extracted to create the trench in which the tunnel sections sat, were vacuumed to one side of the construction site, as to let them drift down river would have harmed the large [[mussel]] fishing beds downstream. The silt was deposited upstream of the bridge at Conwy which created a large new area of low-lying land which was subsequently given to the [[Conwy RSPB reserve|RSPB for a wildlife preserve]]. The casting basin for the tunnel sections was later converted into a new marina in the lower estuary. Because of the valuable fishery in the river and also because of the history of [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] [[mining]] in the catchment of the river, extensive [[ecology|ecological]] assessments were made both prior to the construction of the tunnel and subsequently. These studies finally concluded that no significant environmental damage had been caused.

After five years of construction, the tunnel was opened in October 1991 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], the tunnel initially had an advisory {{convert|50|mph}} speed limit, but this was dropped in 2007 as accidents were rare in the tunnels.

=== Penmaenbach and Pen-y-clip tunnels ===
[[File:A55Penmaenmawr.jpg|right|thumb|An easterly view of the A55 at Penmaenmawr with the [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast Railway]] on the seaward side. The Penmaenbach Tunnels are in the distance]]

Leaving Conwy in a westerly direction, the construction of this section has involved major civil engineering works because it crosses two major [[headland]]s: Penmaenbach Point and Penmaenan Point. Work has involved the cutting of several hard rock tunnels beneath the sea cliffs.

The first to be built in 1932 was the Penmaenbach Tunnel which carried motor traffic to [[Penmaenmawr]]. Two smaller tunnels through Penmaenan Point, opened 1935, carried the road onto [[Llanfairfechan]]. This new route, carrying traffic in both directions, relieved the original coach road built by Telford in the early 19th century. Cut into the cliffs by hand, this narrow, winding route hugged the contours around both steep headlands. Telford's route has now been converted into a [[cycleway]] across Penmaenbach and Penmaenan Points. Originally at the western end (Llanfairfechan) of the modern Pen-y-Clip tunnel, access was only allowed in an easterly direction because travelling the other way would mean heading the wrong way up the eastbound carriageway. However, in 2011 a purpose-built bridge - over the westbound carriageway - was constructed to allow unrestricted access to cyclists and walkers.

The 1930s alignment was used until a new two-lane Penmaenbach Tunnel opened in 1989 to carry westbound traffic. Eastbound traffic would now travel through the 1932 Penmaenbach Tunnel using both its original lanes. Four years later, work to build the Pen-y-clip tunnel was completed. Like at Penmaenbach it carried westbound traffic while the original road carried vehicles in the opposite direction. Both new routes were subject to an advisory 50&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit until these were lifted in 2007 as there had been few accidents.

However traffic travelling eastbound on the 1930s cliffhugging route still faced speed restrictions at both tunnel locations. For instance the eastbound carriageway at Penmaenbach is subject to a 30&amp;nbsp;mph (50&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limit due to sharp curves and double white lines nominally preclude lane changing. Plans to rectify the awkward alignment by building another tunnel parallel to the current westbound tunnel (as originally intended when the westbound tunnel was proposed) have been discussed for several years. The work in late-2007 at Penmaenbach eastbound has seen the erection of gantries to close lanes when bidirectional working is in place.

=== Penmaenmawr to Anglesey ===
Some sections of the rest of the route are of lower standard than that of those further east. Some traffic leaves for major holiday destinations such as [[Caernarfon]] or the [[Llŷn Peninsula]], though much continues on to the port of Holyhead. As such part of the route is not classed as clearway and has two at grade junctions (roundabouts), Penmaenmawr (Junction 16) and Llanfairfechan (Junction 15). The [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] bypass, in which the road previously terminated and became the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] regains high standards and is such through the [[Anglesey]] section, bar the [[Britannia Bridge]], which is a single carriageway deck above the [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast railway]] over the [[Menai Strait]]. In 2007 the Welsh Assembly Government undertook a consultation to determine which of four options would be preferred for a second crossing. This section intersects with the [[A487]] towards [[Caernarfon]], and the west coast of [[North Wales]].

=== Anglesey ===
[[File:A55 Expressway - geograph.org.uk - 153914.jpg|right|thumb|Looking east along the road in [[Anglesey]] with the mountains of [[Snowdonia]] in the background.]]
The final section of the A55 to be constructed was the [[Anglesey]] section. This 20 mile (32&amp;nbsp;km) section from the end of the Llanfairpwll bypass to [[Holyhead]] [[Harbour]] was constructed as [[Private Finance Initiative]] scheme where the builders, a [[Carillion]] / [[John Laing plc|John Laing]] joint venture, earn a [[shadow toll]] based on usage and lane availability. They also have to maintain the road for the extended period of their shadow toll agreement. When travelling eastbound along this section there are fine views of Snowdonia. The approach to Holyhead required major work with a new section over the sea paralleling the [[Stanley Embankment]] that carries the original A5 and the [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast railway]].

==Planned improvements==
Work started in early 2017 on the upgrading of the 1960s built substandard section of dual carriageway west of Abergwyngregyn from Tai'r Meibion towards Tan-y-lon, which is relatively narrow and prone to flooding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.wales/topics/transport/roads/schemes/a55/abergwyngregyn/?lang=en Welsh Government Update 11/10/16] The Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) published its National Transport Plan in July 2009.&lt;ref [http://wales.gov.uk/consultations/transport/ntp/;jsessionid=x4DmKwKVHf5vX9J4kWTMzzYTZjxhz18cHL2MpNLN1pcG2NpvH89F!-733988527?lang=en Welsh Government | National Transport Plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes mention of improvements to the A55 including the grade separation of the two roundabouts at Penmaenmawr and Llanfairfechan planned to be completed by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.wales/topics/transport/roads/schemes/a55/junction-15-junction-16/?lang=en Welsh Government Update 16/6/2016]&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2012, the Welsh Government published two more detailed studies looking at options to improve transport in the North East Wales and the A55 / A494 areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The A55 partly follows the alignment of the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] from Chester (Deva) to Caernarfon ([[Segontium]]), particularly from Junction 31 to 30 and Junction 13 to 12. Between Chester and Holywell the alignment of this road is uncertain and between St. Asaph and Abergwyngregyn, the Roman road followed an inland route, via Canovium Roman Fort at Caerhun, avoiding the difficulties of the crossing of the Conwy estuary and the cliffs at Penmaenbach and Pen-y-Clip.

[[Romania]]'s administration is relatively [[Unitary state|centralized]] and administrative subdivisions are therefore fairly simplified.

According to the [[Constitution of Romania]], its territory is organized administratively into communes, towns and counties:&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Romania]], [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0a3 Title I, article 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

* At the county level: 41 [[Counties of Romania|counties]], and one city with special status ([[Bucharest]], the national capital)
* At the town/commune level: 103 [[Municipiu|municipalities]] and 217 other [[List of towns in Romania|cities]] (for urban areas), and 2861 [[Commune in Romania|communes]] (for rural areas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insse.ro/cms/sites/default/files/field/publicatii/anuarul_statistic_al_romaniei_carte_en.pdf 2017 Romanian Statistical Yearbook], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Municipality ''(municipiu)'' status is accorded to larger towns, but it does not give their administrations any greater powers.

Below communal or town level, there are no further formal administrative subdivisions. However, communes are divided into villages (which have no administration of their own). There are 12,957 villages in Romania. The only exception is Bucharest, which has six [[Sectors of Bucharest|sectors]], each with an administration of its own.

==Historic==
{{Main|Historical administrative divisions of Romania}}
[[File:Tara Romaneasca judete 1601-1718.svg|thumb|300px|right|Divisions of Wallachia, 1601-1718]]
[[File:Moldova_judete_1601-1718.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Divisions of Moldavia, late 17th-early 19th centuries]]
[[File:Transylvanian_Principality.svg|thumb|300px|right|Divisions of Transylvania, 1606-1660]]
The earliest organization into ''[[Județ|județe]]'' of the Principalities of [[Wallachia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verticalonline.ro/de-la-sat-la-judet-in-istoria-olteniei |title=De la sat la județ în istoria Olteniei &amp;#124; Vertical |publisher=Verticalonline.ro |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively ''ținuturi'' of [[Moldavia]], dates back at least to the early 15th century. Each ''județ'', respectively ''ținut'', was ruled by a ''jude'', respectively ''pârcălab'', an officially appointed person who had administrative and judicial functions in a manner inspired from the organization of the late [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Transylvania]], when it was part of the historic [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (in the Middle Ages), an [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|independent Principality]] or a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] domain (in the modern era until World War I) was divided into [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|royal counties]] ([[Latin]]:''comitatus''), headed by ''comes'' (royal counts) with administrative and judicial functions. The term ''județ'' became used in [[Romanian language|Romanian universally]] for all principalities since mid-19th century.

[[File:Romania Judete Antebelice (RO).svg|thumb|300px|right|Counties of Romania, 1878-1913]]
After modern Romania was formed in 1859 through the [[United Principalities|union of Wallachia and rump Moldavia]], and then extended in 1918 through the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|union of Transylvania]], as well as [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]] (parts of Moldavia temporarily acquired by the Habsburgs, 1775–1918, respectively the [[Russian Empire|Russian Tsars]], 1812–1917), the administrative division was modernized using the French departments system as an example. With the exception of the half of the [[Communist Romania|Communist period]], this system remained in place. Since 1864, for each ''județ'' there exists a ''[[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]]'' (from the Latin ''[[praefectus]]''), a subordinate of the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]], who is the representative of the government in the county, and the head of the local administration in the areas not delegated to local authorities.&lt;ref name="Ag"/&gt; Until 1948, each ''județ'' was further divided into a number of ''plăși'' (singular ''plasă''), with each administered by a ''pretor'' (from the Latin ''[[praetor]]''), appointed by the ''prefect''.&lt;ref name="Bz"/&gt;

In 1913, as a result of the [[Second Balkan War]], Romania acquired Southern [[Dobruja]] from [[Bulgaria]], integrating this historical region within Romania's borders until 1940. In 1923 Romania adopted a new Constitution, and in 1927 it uniformized the traditional administrative systems of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia with that of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. County borders were kept largely intact, with only a couple minor adjustments, as a total of 71 județe existed between 1927 and 1938.

In 1938, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] modified the [[Constitution]], and after that the law of administration of the Romanian territory. Ten "ținuturi" (approx. translation: "lands") were created, ruled by "Rezidenți Regali" (approx. translation "Royal Residents"), appointed directly by the [[Monarch]]. The ținuturi represented another layer of administration between counties and the country; county borders were not erased.&lt;ref name=Ag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioan Scurtu, Theodora Stănescu-Stanciu, Georgiana Margareta Scurtu, [http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/istorie1918-1940/cap8.htm ''Istoria românilor între anii 1918-1940: VIII.

During World War II, the territory of Romania suffered very significant modifications. In 1940, Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied]] [[Bessarabia]], northern [[Bukovina]], and [[Herza region]] which after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, would become part of [[Republic of Moldova]] and of [[Ukraine]]. Between 1941-1944, these territories together with [[Transnistria]], were administered by Romania briefly, as the country was governed by a military dictatorship allied with Nazi Germany. [[Transnistria]] consisted of formerly proper Soviet territory between [[Dniester]] and [[Southern Bug]] rivers. Nowadays, most of it is in [[Ukraine]], with small parts in the [[Republic of Moldova]] (current [[Transnistria]]). This territory was kept under Romanian military occupation, and was not annexed to Romania consisted of a further 13 counties.

[[File:Romania Counties 1930-2008.svg|thumb|right|300px|Current counties imposed over the inter-war counties]]
After the war, the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] took over the administration of the country. In 1950, the party changed the administration model to the Russian model (regions and [[raion]]s), but it reverted to the current system in 1968, although county borders were quite different from the interbelic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vestul.ro/stiri/1310/in-linii-mari.htm |title=Istoria Banatului :: În linii mari |publisher=Vestul.ro |date=1944-08-23 |accessdate=2010-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521104455/http://www.vestul.ro/stiri/1310/in-linii-mari.htm |archive-date=2013-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the former counties of Ilfov and Ialomița were re-organised into the present-day counties of Giurgiu, Călărași, Ialomița and Ilfov. The county borders introduced in 1968 are largely in place, but administrative reform during the 1990s has devolved the functions of different authorities in line with transition from a totalitarian communist system to a modern democracy. The only territorial adjustment after 1989 occurred in 1995, when [[Ilfov County]] was formed. Before that it was a dependency of the Municipality of Bucharest (''Sectorul Agricol Ilfov'').

==Current status==
[[File:Romania NUTS 1.svg|thumb|right|300px|NUTS 1 regions of Romania]]
[[File:Regiuni_de_dezvoltare.svg|thumb|right|300px|NUTS 2 regions of Romania]]
[[File:Romanian_license_plate_codes.png|thumb|right|300px|NUTS 3 regions of Romania]]
Eight [[Development regions of Romania|regional divisions]] (called ''development regions'') were created in 1998 in order to better co-ordinate regional development as Romania progressed towards accession to the [[European Union]], and consist of several counties each. These correspond to [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS II]]-level divisions in European Union member states, but do not actually have an administrative status and do not have a legislative or executive council or government. As of 2009, [[Romania]] is divided into 41 counties and one municipality which are assigned as [[NUTS of Romania|NUTS III-level]] divisions. Currently, Romania has no NUTS-4 units, the counties being composed directly of [[city|cities]] (some of which with [[municipality]] status) and [[commune]]s.

As in all modern democracies, the political power in Romania is divided into three independent branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The ''prefect'' and his administration have only executive prerogatives. However, the territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication.&lt;ref name=Ag/&gt; At the same time with local elections (of mayors and councilors for the cities and communes), a ''Consiliu județean'' (County Council) is elected for each county. From 2008 to 2016 a President of the County Council was also elected by direct vote, from 2016 he or she has been (as prior to 2008) elected by a Council. As of now, the legislative powers of county councils are quite reduced, but there are plans for more decentralization. (These plans, however, call for introduction of Regional Councils for the 8 [[Development regions of Romania|development regions]] of the NUTS-2 level.)

==Future developments==

As of 2010 there have been several proposals for the administrative reorganization of [[Romania]] made by the presidential commission tasked with the analysis of the political and constitutional regime.&lt;ref name="Microsoft Word - RAPORTUL STANOMIR.doc"/&gt; Most of these recommendations aim for the partial reestablishment of the counties in their pre-1950 form. The counties will be grouped into several regions (9 to 15) based on common historical and economic characteristics ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS II level]]). The regions will be in their turn clustered into 4-6 macroregions ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS I level]]). Furthermore, a [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS IV]] level division, called [[plasă]] or canton will probably be added in order to meet the [[European Union|EU]] statistical and administrative requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/dosar/a129846-cum-va-arata-harta-romaniei.html |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230804/http://www.romanialibera.ro/dosar/a129846-cum-va-arata-harta-romaniei.html |archivedate=May 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposal, based on 15 autonomous euro-regions (amongst them one ethnic based region with a consistent Hungarian majority made of the existing [[Mureș County|Mureș]], [[Harghita County|Harghita]] and [[Covasna County|Covasna]] counties) grouped into 5 statistical macroregions ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS I]]), was made by the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandul.info/politica/reorganizare-teritoriala-marca-udmr-15-euroregiuni-15-parlamente-955641 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421045240/http://www.gandul.info/politica/reorganizare-teritoriala-marca-udmr-15-euroregiuni-15-parlamente-955641 |archivedate=April 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)==
{{Main|NUTS of Romania}}

For statistical and development purposes, Romania, in the NUTS scheme, is divided into:
* NUTS I level:  4 macroregions (''macroregiune'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), used for appropriation of European development funds
* NUTS II level: 8 [[development regions of Romania|development regions]], with an average population of 2.8 million inhabitants per region, although not administrative divisions ''per se'', have been used for decades for statistical purposes by the Romanian National Commission of Statistics (NCS). Recently they also exist to co-ordinate regional development and appropriation of European development funds
* NUTS III level: 41 [[Counties of Romania|counties]] and one municipality ([[Bucharest]], the national capital) reflecting Romania's official administrative-territorial structure
* LAU I level: not used, as territorial units associations have not been identified yet;
* LAU II level: 217 [[cities of Romania|cities]] and 103 [[Municipalities of Romania|municipalities]] (for urban areas), and 2,856 [[Commune in Romania|communes]] (for rural areas)

An exception to this structure is the [[Bucharest|Municipality of Bucharest]], which is a secondary division (rather than a tertiary division like other municipalities) and is officially divided into six [[Sectors of Bucharest|sectors]], each sector having a local government and council.

The eight development regions (specific territorial entities without administrative status or legal personality) represent the framework for collecting specific statistical data, according to the European regulations issued by Eurostat for the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) II territorial level. According to the Emergency Government Ordinance No 75/2001 on the functioning of the National Institute for Statistics, eight Directorates General for regional statistics have been created, and together with the 34 county directorates for statistics, aim at developing regional statistics. Officially, the eight regions are [[Nord-Est (development region)|Nord-Est]] (North-East), [[Sud-Est (development region)|Sud-Est]] (South-East), [[Sud - Muntenia (development region)|Sud - Muntenia]] (South - Muntenia), [[Sud-Vest (development region)|Sud-Vest Oltenia]] (South-West Oltenia), [[Vest (development region)|Vest]] (West), [[Nord-Vest (development region)|Nord-Vest]] (North-West), [[Centru (development region)|Centru]] (Centre), and [[București - Ilfov (development region)|București - Ilfov]] (Bucharest - Ilfov). The criteria used by NCS for delimiting the regions is a combination of geographical location and homogeneity based on population density. Alternative historical names are also used, but remain unofficial.

'''Bellamy Cay''' is an [[island]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]], located entirely within Trellis Bay on [[Beef Island]]. Formerly called '''Blanco Islet''', this island is named after its most famous resident, [[Samuel Bellamy|"Black Sam" Bellamy]], the "prince of pirates".

For much of his very short but wildly successful campaign of piracy in 1716 and 1717, Bellamy used this islet (which was named Blanco Islet at the time) as his base of operations, while crew members used the protection of Trellis Bay to maintain their fleet of ships.  Bellamy soon learned that from Blanco, as well as from nearby Sprat Point, ships could be seen sailing through the [[Sir Francis Drake Channel]]. His favourite prey were Spanish Galleons laden with treasure intended for the exclusive use of the King &amp; Queen of Spain.

In the early 1950s the small island was acquired by Władysław (Wladek) Wagner, the "first Polish yachtsman," who left Poland in 1932 to sail around the world and who ended up eventually settling in Trellis Bay, Beef Island Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, where he built a boatyard and marine railway in addition to most of the buildings now standing on Bellamy Cay, where he ran a small restaurant and hotel.

Since the 1970s, the cay has been the home of the restaurant and bar called "The Last Resort" – which for many years was owned and operated by [[Tony Snell (RAF officer)|Tony Snell]], a British [[war hero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2chat.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-4261.html|title=F/L Tony Snell|accessdate=2009-11-12}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellamy Cay is near the [[Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport]], and is inhabited by the owners and staff of the Restaurant.  The Island remains off the power, water and communications grid of the mainland, producing its own electricity and water through solar, wind and diesel generators.

The '''clock code''' is a method of mentally computing the [[sine]] of an angle between zero and sixty [[degree (angle)|degrees]]. [[Aviator|Pilot]]s sometimes need to do this to estimate the heading correction due to the wind, and [[sailor]]s may find it useful to do the same thing to allow for the current due to the [[tide]]s.

The basic assumption is that for angles up to around 60°, it is adequately accurate to assume that sine(A) = A, when A is expressed as a fraction of 60. Thus, the sine of 30° = 30/60 = 1/2 = 0.5.

The clock code is a further method of visualising fractions of 60, since we are very used to expressing fractions of an hour (60 minutes) when telling the time.

Thus:

* 10/60 = 1/6 = 0.167 (true sine = 0.1736, error = -4%)
* 15/60 = 1/4 = 0.25 (0.259, -3.4%)
* 20/60 = 1/3 = 0.33 (0.342, -3.5%)
* 30/60 = 1/2 = 0.5 (0.5, 0%)
* 40/60 = 2/3 = 0.66 (0.643, +2.6%)
* 45/60 = 3/4 = 0.75 (0.707, +5.7%)
* 50/60 = 5/6 = 0.8 (0.766, +4.2%)
* 60/60 = 1/1 = 1.0 (0.866, +13.4%)

The angle is the angle of the wind or tide as it presents itself relative to the ship or aircraft, so if the wind is coming from the left at a relative angle of 30°, we use a sine of 0.5. Once the sine has been estimated, the drift due to wind or tide can be estimated accordingly by resolving the velocity of the wind or tide into a forward component and a sideways component. The sideways component is the windspeed x the sine, and the forward component is (1 - the sine) x windspeed (i.e. the [[cosine]]). Naturally we must apply these corrections to our groundspeed in the appropriate  direction according to logic - a wind from the left will blow us off course in that direction; a headwind will slow our progress, a tailwind will increase it. Converting this back to a heading correction can be done using the [[1 in 60 rule]].

For wind angles greater than 60°, it is adequate to assume it's at 90°, i.e. a side wind.

More accurate corrections are done when possible, but in the particular case of a [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] pilot mentally calculating an unexpected diversion, using tables or the [[E6B]] slide rule in flight is usually not an option, so the clock code is one method of handling the required calculation without excessive error. In practice the wind strength can only be guessed or based on earlier reports, and the error due to the sine calculation will usually be much less than that due to the wind itself. Fine tuning of the heading can be done en route using the usual methods for doing so.

[[File:Comparison_convolution_correlation.svg|thumb|300px|Visual comparison of [[convolution]], [[cross-correlation]] and [[autocorrelation]].]]
A '''correlation function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]  that gives the statistical [[correlation]] between [[random variable]]s, contingent on the spatial or temporal distance between those variables. If one considers the correlation function between random variables representing the same quantity measured at two different points then this is often referred to as an [[autocorrelation function]], which is made up of [[autocorrelation]]s. Correlation functions of different random variables are sometimes called '''cross-correlation functions''' to emphasize that different variables are being considered and because they are made up of [[cross-correlation]]s.

Correlation functions are a useful indicator of dependencies as a function of distance in time or space, and they can be used to assess the distance required between sample points for the values to be effectively uncorrelated. In addition, they can form the basis of rules for interpolating values at points for which there are no observations.

Correlation functions used in [[correlation function (astronomy)|astronomy]], [[financial analysis]], [[econometrics]], and [[statistical mechanics]] differ only in the particular stochastic processes they are applied to.  In [[quantum field theory]] there are [[Correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions over quantum distributions]].

==Definition==
For possibly distinct random variables ''X''(''s'') and ''Y''(''t'') at different points ''s'' and ''t''  of some space, the correlation function is

:&lt;math&gt;C(s,t) = \operatorname{corr} ( X(s), Y(t) ) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{corr}&lt;/math&gt; is described in the article on [[correlation]]. In this definition, it has been assumed that the stochastic variables are scalar-valued. If they are not, then more complicated correlation functions can be defined. For example, if ''X''(''s'') is a [[random vector]] with ''n'' elements and ''Y''(t) is a vector with ''q'' elements, then an ''n''×''q'' matrix of correlation functions is defined with &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; element

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ij}(s,t) = \operatorname{corr}( X_i(s), Y_j(t) ).&lt;/math&gt;

When ''n''=''q'', sometimes the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of this matrix is focused on. If the [[probability distribution]]s have any target space symmetries, i.e. symmetries in the value space of the stochastic variable (also called '''internal symmetries'''), then the correlation matrix will have induced symmetries. Similarly, if there are symmetries of the space (or time) domain in which the random variables exist (also called '''[[spacetime symmetries]]'''), then the correlation function will have corresponding space or time symmetries. Examples of important spacetime symmetries are &amp;mdash;
*'''translational symmetry''' yields ''C''(''s'',''s''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) = ''C''(''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) where ''s'' and ''s''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; are to be interpreted as vectors giving coordinates of the points
*'''rotational symmetry''' in addition to the above gives ''C''(''s'', ''s''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) = ''C''(|''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;|) where |''x''| denotes the norm of the vector ''x'' (for actual rotations this is the Euclidean or 2-norm).

Higher order correlation functions are often defined. A typical correlation function of order ''n'' is

:&lt;math&gt;C_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n}(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n) = \langle X_{i_1}(s_1) X_{i_2}(s_2) \cdots X_{i_n}(s_n)\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;{{clarification needed|reason=explain bracket notation|date=July 2016}}

If the random vector has only one component variable, then the indices &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; are redundant. If there are symmetries, then the correlation function can be broken up into [[irreducible representation]]s of the symmetries &amp;mdash; both internal and spacetime.

==Properties of probability distributions==
With these definitions, the study of correlation functions is similar to the study of [[probability distributions]]. Many stochastic processes can be completely characterized by their correlation functions; the most notable example is the class of [[Gaussian processes]]. 

Probability distributions defined on a finite number of points can always be normalized, but when these are defined over continuous spaces, then extra care is called for. The study of such distributions started with the study of [[random walk]]s and led to the notion of the [[Itō calculus]].

The Feynman [[path integral formulation|path integral]] in Euclidean space generalizes this to other problems of interest to [[statistical mechanics]]. Any probability distribution which obeys a condition on correlation functions called [[reflection positivity]] lead to a local [[quantum field theory]] after [[Wick rotation]] to [[Minkowski spacetime]]. The operation of [[renormalization]] is a specified set of mappings from the space of probability distributions to itself. A [[quantum field theory]] is called renormalizable if this mapping has a fixed point which gives a quantum field theory.

The '''Darwin Rise''' is broad triangular region in the north central [[Pacific Ocean]] where there is a concentration of [[atoll]]s.

During his voyage across the globe [[Charles Darwin]] realised that vertical crustal motion must be responsible for the formation of continents and ocean basins, as well as isolated atolls in the Pacific.  He deduced that the central basin of the Pacific had subsided while surrounding areas had risen.  In 1964 U.S. geologist [[Henry William Menard|Henry Menard]] subsequently named the uplifted area in the Pacific after the English naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stein|Stein|1993|loc=Introduction, p. 53}}; {{Harvnb|Darwin|1845}}: When later dealing with other continents he became so fixed in his belief in vertical movements of the crust and the erosive power of the sea that he excluded other possible explanations[…] [http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_GeologicalDiary.html]; {{Harvnb|Menard|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological context==
Covering an area of {{Convert|12000|x|3000|km|abbr=on}}, the Darwin Rise is limited to the east by the [[Izu-Bonin Trench|Izu-Bonin]] and [[Mariana Trench|Mariana]] trenches, to the west by the [[Line Islands]].&lt;ref name="JannCast-10572"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janney|Castillo|1999|loc=Setting and Age Constraints, pp. 10572, 10574}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two major plateaux, the [[Shatsky Rise]] to the north and the [[Ontong Java Plateau]] to the south, border the Darwin Rise.  How these plateaux relate to the rise remains disputed.&lt;ref name="JannCast-10572" /&gt;

There are six major chains of seamounts on the rise&amp;nbsp;— the [[Japanese Seamounts|Japanese]], [[Magellan Seamounts|Magellan]], [[Wake Seamounts|Wake]], [[Marshall Islands Seamounts|Marshall Islands]], [[Line Islands Seamounts|Line Islands]] seamounts and the [[Mid-Pacific Mountains]]&amp;nbsp;— and numerous minor clusters.  The ages of these seamounts in general follow the motion of the [[Pacific Plate]] from 130 to 180&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ma|Million years ago}}, as predicted by conventional hotspot theory, and decrease from west to east and north to south.  This age-distance pattern is, however, not corroborated by the limited data available.&lt;ref name="JannCast-10572" /&gt;

==Origin==
In 1964, [[Henry William Menard|Henry Menard]] proposed that this was a [[superswell]] raised by volcanism during the [[Cretaceous]] (120-80 mya).&lt;ref&gt;For an illustration of Menard's model of the evolution of the Darwin Rise see {{Harvnb|Stein|Stein|1993|loc=Fig. 1, p. 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A problem with this conjecture is that this region actually has a sea floor at a normal depth that happens to possess an abundance of [[sea mount]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeLaughter|Stein|Stein|2005|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foulger|2010|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead this feature may have formed from [[diapir]]s or [[Mantle plume|plumes]] rising from the Earth's [[upper mantle]], which results in chains of sea mounts along the direction of the plate motion. However, this idea remains in dispute and an alternate hypothesis involving multiple "plumelets" has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janney|Castillo|1999|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s it was proposed that the Darwin Rise was the South Pacific Superswell 100&amp;nbsp;Ma and that the volcanoes of the Darwin Rise erupted over the same mantle region as the volcanoes of French Polynesia today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNutt|1998|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, U.S. geologist [[Marcia McNutt]] proposed that the Darwin Rise is a palaeo-superswell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNutt|1998|loc=Fig. 2, p. 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diego de Arana''' (Cordoba, Spain, 1468 - Haiti, 1493) was governor of the first documented Spanish settlement in the [[New World]], at [[La Navidad]].

He was a sailor of Castile who accompanied [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage to America, where Arana was killed by natives.

Arana is described as a native of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in the journal of Columbus. ''The History of the Admiral'' by [[Ferdinand Columbus]] says Diego was the son of Rodrigo de Arana. He was a cousin of [[Beatriz Enriquez de Arana]], who was the mistress of Christopher Columbus.

== Christopher Columbus background and connection ==

In early 1486, Columbus was living in the court of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand V]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]] in [[Seville, Spain]]. Columbus was trying to convince them to finance his "Enterprise of the Indies", a far reaching expedition to reach the east by going west.  Columbus had knowledge of the [[Canaries Current]] and hoped he could reach the [[Indias]] by taking advantage of this ocean phenomenon. The monarchs were interested in Columbus's idea but were focused on the war in [[Granada]] against the [[Moors]]. Columbus was given [[subsistence]] and allowed to stay at the monarchs' castle in Cordoba as they thought he might have an idea that would provide riches and spread Christianity.&lt;ref name ="wilford87"&gt;Wilford, pp. 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Brinkbäumer87"&gt;Brinkbäumer, pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting for a decision and another meeting with the royals, Columbus patronized a local [[apothecary]] shop operated by people from [[Genoa, Italy]]. Columbus is believed to have come from the Genoa area and associated with doctors, physicians, surgeons, astronomers, scientists and others that also patronized the Genoese pharmacy. There he also became friends with a young [[Basque people|Basque]] man: Diego de Arana.&lt;ref name ="wilford89"&gt;Wilford, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego had two orphaned cousins under the family's household, [[Beatriz Enríquez de Arana]] and her brother Pedro Enríquez de Arana.&lt;ref name ="wilford89"/&gt; Their family was originally from [[Harana/Valle de Arana|Arana]] as was Diego's, a valley of [[Álava]], Spain. Diego introduced Beatriz, a 20 (or 21) year old woman of [[hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|Basque]] origin, to Columbus in 1487.&lt;ref name ="Brinkbäumer87"/&gt; At the time Columbus was 35. They became lovers and in August 1488 they had a son named [[Ferdinand Columbus]] (aka Hernando Colon).&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; They never married.&lt;ref name ="wilford89"/&gt; Diego's family, who adopted Beatriz, had a prosperous wine business. They may have helped Columbus with money for his expeditions.&lt;ref name ="wilford89"/&gt;

== Voyage with Columbus ==

[[File:Christopher Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492..jpg|thumb|left|Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492]]
When Columbus left for his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|first voyage]] to the [[New World]], he took Diego with him on the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]] as the master-at-arms. The Santa Maria ran aground off the present-day site of [[Cap-Haïtien]], [[Haiti]] on December 25, 1492, and was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Maclean, Frances| title=The Lost Fort of Columbus| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/fort-of-columbus-200801.html| work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]| date=January 2008| accessdate=January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that the ship was beyond repair, Columbus ordered his men to strip the timbers from the ship. The timbers from the ship were later used to build [[Môle Saint-Nicolas]], which was originally called ''[[La Navidad]]'' (Christmas) because the wreck occurred on Christmas Day.

Following the sinking of the Santa Maria and the temporary loss of the Pinta, Columbus, who longed to return to Spain to announce his discoveries, chose to leave behind 36 men who did not fit in the Nina for the return trip. Along with Diego de Arana were his lieutenants: Gutierrez, baker of the king's bench, Ferdinand Segovia, and Rodrigo de Escobedo, notary. For the defense of those men, the expedition built a fort, [[La Navidad]], with the help of native Taino and timbers from the ''Santa Maria''. He appointed Diego de Arana as governor of the settlement. Columbus received permission from [[Guacanagaríx]], the chief or [[cacique]] of the nearest tribe, to settle there.

On Friday, January 4, 1493, Columbus set sail in the ''Niña'' in search of the third ship in the fleet, the ''Pinta''. The ''Pinta'' was commanded by [[Martín Alonzo Pinzón]] and had been absent for six weeks. On the night of November 21, the [[caravel]] ''Pinta'' had vanished into the darkness off the coast of [[Cuba]], and in his journal Columbus accused Pinzón of deliberately having separated the ''Pinta'' from the other ships in order to beat the admiral to the rich sources of gold which Columbus imagined were in the immediate area. On Sunday morning, January 6, 1493, the missing ''Pinta'' was spotted approaching from the east, and after a heated argument between the two men, the fleet returned to gather people and supplies for a return voyage.

== Death ==


When Columbus came back from Spain during his second voyage, on November 27, 1493, he expected to see a bustling village. When he landed, however, he saw eleven corpses of his men on the beach and discovered that La Navidad had been destroyed. He was told by nearby [[Taínos]] that the settlers had mistreated the natives, who retaliated by killing the settlers. Other sources say there was insubordination within the colonists, which led to their deaths, including the death of Diego de Arana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quisqueyavirtual.edu.do/wiki/Fuerte_de_la_Navidad Fuerte de la Navidad] on Wiki Dominicana&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diyār Rabī‘a''' ("abode of [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]]") is the medieval [[Arabic]] name of the easternmost and largest of the three provinces of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the other two being [[Diyar Bakr]] and [[Diyar Mudar]]. According to [[al-Baladhuri]], all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by [[Mu'awiyah]] in the course of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The Diyar Rabi'a was settled by the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribe, of which the [[Mudar]] were also a subgroup.

Diyar Rabī‘a encompasses the upper reaches of the river [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] and its tributaries, i.e. the regions of [[Tur Abdin]] and [[Beth Arabaye]], as well as both shores of the river [[Tigris]] from the vicinity of [[Jazirat ibn Umar]] in the north to the boundary with [[Iraq]] in the area of [[Tikrit]] in the south, including the lower reaches of the [[Upper Zab]] and [[Lower Zab]]. The main city of the province was [[Mosul]] (Arabic al-Mawsil), with other important urban centres at [[Balad, Iraq|Balad]], Jazirat ibn Umar, [[al-Sinn]], [[Barqa'id]], [[Sinjar]], [[Nasibin]], [[Mardin]] and  [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah|Ra's al-'Ayn]]. The region was plagued by the raids of the [[Qarmatians]] in the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] periods. In the mid-10th century, it came under the control of the native [[Hamdanid dynasty]], centred at Mosul. The Hamdanid emirate was terminated by the [[Buyids]] in 980, and the province passed under the control of the [[Uqaylids]], who held it until the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] conquest in the late 11th century.

==Kurdish Diyar Rabia==
Like [[Diyar Bakir]], despite the Arabic tribal name that signifies a previous Bedouin presence, The province of Diyar Rabia gradually became Kurdish, eventually becoming a minor [[Kurdish Chiefdom]] in the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6352">The '''geology of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' is the study of rocks, minerals, water, landforms and geologic history in Georgia. The country is dominated by the [[Caucasus Mountains]] at the junction of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the Afro-Arabian Plate, and rock units from the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] are particularly prevalent. For much of its geologic history, until the uplift of the Caucasus, Georgia was submerged by [[marine transgression]] events. Geologic research for 150 years by Georgian and Russian geologists has shed significant light on the region and since the 1970s has been augmented with the understanding of plate tectonics. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=256-259}}&lt;/ref &gt;

==Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
The Georgian Block in the Dzirula Massif is part of the Main Range zone of the Greater Caucasus and the Lesser Caucasus fold system. The south slope of the Greater Caucasus has exposed [[Paleozoic]] rocks in the Svaneti Zone, including black [[shale]], phthanite chert, sandstones, turbidites, small amounts of marble and [[andesite]] or [[dacite]] volcanic rocks. These rocks, which belong to the [[Dizi Series]] are up to two kilometers thick and date to the [[Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]]. Weakly metamorphosed Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are also found in the Dzirula Massif—namely, [[allochthon]] [[phyllite]] that contact Paleozoic [[granitoids]] and [[Precambrian]] gabbro, amphibolite and serpentinite. 

[[Late Carboniferous]] and [[Early Permian]] conglomerate, sandstone, limestone and argillite are identified by marine fossils. The Dzirula and Khrami massifs contain [[rhyolite]] and coal-bearing argillite. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=256-257}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
[[Triassic]] sediments such as quartz sandstone and siltstone, together with dacite and rhyolite are part of the Dizi Series, with thicknesses of 80 to 500 meters. [[Jurassic]] black shales, sandstone, turbidite and rhyolite sequences are up to five kilometers thick. 
In the [[Late Jurassic]], limestone and [[marl]] formed in a shallow marine environment, with alternating layers of basalt-andesite-[[dacite]] volcanic rocks exposed on the western edge of the Khrami Massif and in the Lock-Karabakh Zone. 

The [[Early Cretaceous]] is marked by clastic limestone and greywacke siltstone [[flysch]] 750 meters to 1.6 kilometers thick in the Mestia-Tianeti flysch zone. Within the Georgian Block, the crystalline rocks of the Dzirula Massif are overlain by Early Cretaceous rocks 300 to 550 meters thick, primarily limestone but also glauconite sandstone, marl and clay. Elsewhere in the Adjara-Trialeti Zone, calc-alkaline basalt from the [[Albian]] is common. Within the Arthvin-Bolsini Block is a 1.2 kilometer sequence of carbonates, shallow water limestones and marl as well as [[tuff]]. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=258}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
In the [[Cenozoic]], greywacke and siltstone flysch, 600 to 850 meters thick, deposited during the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]]. In the Georgian Block, limestone and marl from this period ranges between 30 and 400 meters thick. [[Turbidite]], and both [[tholeiite]] and [[shoshonite]] basalt deposited during a [[Middle Eocene]] event, up to five kilometers thick. In the Locki Crystalline Massif, basalt, andesite, dacite and rhyolite up to 2.7 kilometers thick overlaps older Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks. 

Marl, clay and gravel are hallmarks of the Late Eocene in the Adjara-Trialeti Zone, grading to volcanic rocks in the west. Throughout the [[Oligocene]], layers of [[gypsum]] bearing clays intermingled with sandstone and accumulated fish scales. This sequence continued to deposit into the [[Miocene]] and is exposed in the Gagra-Djava Zone. Marine [[molasse]] deposits with clays, sandstones, conglomerates, limestone and marl were laid down during the Miocene. River terraces, glacial moraines and volcanic rocks from the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]] are present, but erratically distributed. Georgia experienced three periods of glaciation during the [[Pleistocene]]. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=258-259}}

==Tectonics==
Northeastern Georgia has asymmetric, isoclinal folding on the southern slope and poorly folded, or monoclonal structures on the northern slope of the Greater Caucasus. [[Nappe]] structures are directed toward the south and are evidence of the underthrusting of the Georgian Block beneath the Greater Caucasus. The northern boundary of the Georgian Block is a deep fault, that manifests in the sedimentary cover. To the east, the overlying sedimentary rocks are detached and shifted towards the south, along with the nappes. 

The [[Adjara-Trialeti Zone]] of the Lesser Caucasus is situated south of the Georgian Block and is anticlinorium with block-fold structures. There is an overthrust nappe along the northern margin of this zone, to the west of the Dzirula Massif. The [[Artvini-Bolnisi Block]] has two tectonic units. The gently folded [[Cenozoic]] volcanic rocks of the Javakhen Zone contain two seismic faults, associated with lava tubes. The Bolnisi Zone has the Khrami salient [[Horst (geology)|horst]], with steep folds south of the sedimentary cover. 
The northeast wedge of the [[Locki-Karabakh Zone]] is also situated in Georgia, with crystalline rock from before the Jurassic exposed in the Locki anticlinorium. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=259}}

==Natural resource geology==
Georgia has deposits of iron and manganese ore, as well as rare, small deposits of copper, lead, zinc, tin, cobalt, astatine, and molybdenum. Oil, coal and peat deposits are found in some parts of the country. [[Barite]], [[calcite]], [[bentonite]], diatomite, talc, [[zeolite]], andesite, limestone, dolomite are all used in the chemical industry and some rocks, like chalcedony, spongolite and agate are used for building stones and paint. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=261}}

'''Geomorphology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]]: [[wikt:γῆ|γῆ]], ''gê'', "earth"; [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]], ''morphḗ'', "form"; and λόγος, ''[[Logos|lógos]]'', "study") is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topography|topographic]] and [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] features created by physical, chemical or biological processes operating at or near the Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why [[landscape]]s look the way they do, to understand [[landform]] history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]], [[climatology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.

== Overview ==
[[File:VU0K1843 (39985550).jpg|thumbnail|[[Weathering#Ocean waves|Waves]] and [[Water chemistry analysis|water chemistry]] lead to structural failure in exposed rocks]]
[[Earth]]'s surface is modified by a combination of surface processes that shape landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basin]]s where the surface of the Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth's surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes, or alternatively stated, the intersection of the Earth's [[lithosphere]] with its [[hydrosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].

The broad-scale topographies of the Earth illustrate this intersection of surface and subsurface action. Mountain belts are [[tectonic uplift|uplifted]] due to geologic processes. [[Denudation]] of these high uplifted regions produces [[sediment]] that is transported and [[deposition (geology)|deposited]] elsewhere within the landscape or off the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willett|first=Sean D.|author2=Brandon, Mark T.|title=On steady states in mountain belts|journal=Geology|date=January 2002|volume=30|issue=2|pages=175–178|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030&lt;0175:OSSIMB&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2002Geo....30..175W}}&lt;/ref&gt; On progressively smaller scales, similar ideas apply, where individual landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive processes (uplift and deposition) and subtractive processes ([[subsidence]] and [[erosion]]). Often, these processes directly affect each other: ice sheets, water, and sediment are all loads that change topography through [[flexural isostasy]]. Topography can modify the local climate, for example through [[orographic precipitation]], which in turn modifies the topography by changing the hydrologic regime in which it evolves. Many geomorphologists are particularly interested in the potential for [[Climate change feedback|feedbacks]] between climate and [[erosion and tectonics|tectonics]], mediated by geomorphic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roe|first=Gerard H.|author2=Whipple, Kelin X. |author3=Fletcher, Jennifer K. |title=Feedbacks among climate, erosion, and tectonics in a critical wedge orogen|journal=American Journal of Science|date=September 2008|volume=308|issue=7|pages=815–842|doi=10.2475/07.2008.01|url=http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/Publications/RoeEtal_ClimateWedge_08.pdf|bibcode=2008AmJS..308..815R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these broad-scale questions, geomorphologists address issues that are more specific and/or more local. Glacial geomorphologists investigate glacial deposits such as [[moraine]]s, [[esker]]s, and proglacial [[lake]]s, as well as [[Erosion#Ice|glacial erosional]] features, to build chronologies of both small [[glacier]]s and large [[ice sheet]]s and understand their motions and effects upon the landscape. [[Fluvial]] geomorphologists focus on [[river]]s, how they [[sediment transport|transport sediment]], [[River channel migration|migrate across the landscape]], [[bedrock river|cut into bedrock]], respond to environmental and tectonic changes, and interact with humans. Soils geomorphologists investigate soil profiles and chemistry to learn about the history of a particular landscape and understand how climate, biota, and rock interact. Other geomorphologists study how [[hill]]slopes form and change. Still others investigate the relationships between [[ecology]] and geomorphology. Because geomorphology is defined to comprise everything related to the surface of the Earth and its modification, it is a broad field with many facets.

Geomorphologists use a wide range of techniques in their work. These may include fieldwork and field data collection, the interpretation of remotely sensed data, geochemical analyses, and the numerical modelling of the physics of landscapes. Geomorphologists may rely on [[geochronology]], using dating methods to measure the rate of changes to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, Global Geomorphology, Pearson Education Ltd, 537 p. {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunai, T.J., 2010, Cosmogenic Nucleides, Cambridge University Press, 187 p. {{ISBN|978-0-521-87380-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Terrain measurement techniques are vital to quantitatively describe the form of the Earth's surface, and include [[differential GPS]], remotely sensed [[digital terrain model]]s and [[Lidar#Geology and soil science|laser scanning]], to quantify, study, and to generate illustrations and maps.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/intro.html DTM intro page], Hunter College Department of Geography, New York NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical applications of geomorphology include [[natural hazard|hazard]] assessment (such as [[landslide]] prediction and [[Landslide mitigation|mitigation]]), river control and [[stream restoration]], and coastal protection.  Planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as Mars.   Indications of effects of [[aeolian processes|wind]], [[fluvial]], [[glacial]], [[mass wasting]], [[Impact event|meteor impact]], [[tectonics]] and [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic]] processes are studied. This effort not only helps better understand the geologic and atmospheric history of those planets but also extends geomorphological study of the Earth. Planetary geomorphologists often use [[Terrestrial Analogue Sites|Earth analogue]]s to aid in their study of surfaces of other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference of Geomorphology|url=http://www.geomorphology-iag-paris2013.com/en/s3-%E2%80%93-planetary-geomorphology-iag-wg|publisher=Europa Organization|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317082407/http://www.geomorphology-iag-paris2013.com/en/s3-%E2%80%93-planetary-geomorphology-iag-wg|archivedate=2013-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than some notable exceptions in antiquity, geomorphology is a relatively young science, growing along with interest in other aspects of the [[earth sciences]] in the mid-19th century.  This section provides a very brief outline of some of the major figures and events in its development.

===Ancient geomorphology===

The study of landforms and the evolution of the Earth's surface can be dated back to scholars of [[Classical Greece]]. [[Herodotus]] argued from observations of soils that the [[Nile delta]] was actively growing into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and estimated its age.&lt;ref name='Bierman'&gt;Bierman, Paul R., and David R. Montgomery. Key concepts in geomorphology. Macmillan Higher Education, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] speculated that due to [[sediment transport]] into the sea, eventually those seas would fill while the land lowered. He claimed that this would mean that land and water would eventually swap places, whereupon the process would begin again in an endless cycle.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;

Another early theory of geomorphology was devised by the polymath [[History of China|Chinese]] scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD). This was based on his observation of [[Ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] shells in a [[stratum|geological stratum]] of a mountain hundreds of miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Noticing [[bivalvia|bivalve]] shells running in a horizontal span along the cut section of a cliffside, he theorized that the cliff was once the pre-historic location of a seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles over the centuries. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by [[soil erosion]] of the mountains and by deposition of [[silt]], after observing strange natural erosions of the [[Taihang Mountains]] and the [[Yandangshan|Yandang Mountain]] near [[Wenzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;Sivin, Nathan (1995). ''Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections''. Brookfield, Vermont: VARIORUM, Ashgate Publishing. III, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nj&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1959). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. pp. 603–618.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he promoted the theory of gradual [[climate change]] over centuries of time once ancient petrified [[bamboo]]s were found to be preserved underground in the dry, northern climate zone of ''Yanzhou'', which is now modern day [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province.&lt;ref name=nj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan Kam-leung and Gregory K. Clancey, Hui-Chieh Loy (2002). ''Historical Perspectives on East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine''. Singapore: [[Singapore University Press]]. p. 15. {{ISBN|9971-69-259-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern geomorphology===
The term geomorphology seems to have been first used by [[Laumann]] in an 1858 work written in German. Keith Tinkler has suggested that the word came into general use in English, German and French after [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[W. J. McGee]] used it during the International Geological Conference of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Tinkler, Keith J. A short history of geomorphology. Page 4. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Edward Marr]] in his The Scientific Study of Scenery&lt;ref&gt;Marr, J.E. The Scientific Study of Scenery. Methuen, page iii, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; considered his book as, 'an Introductory Treatise on Geomorphology, a subject which has sprung from the union of Geology and Geography'.

An early popular geomorphic model was the ''geographical cycle'' or ''[[cycle of erosion]]'' model of broad-scale landscape evolution developed by [[William Morris Davis]] between 1884 and 1899.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt; It was an elaboration of the [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] theory that had first been proposed by [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes'&gt;Oldroyd, David R. &amp; Grapes, Rodney H. Contributions to the history of geomorphology and Quaternary geology: an introduction. In: GRAPES, R. H., OLDROYD, D. &amp; GRIGELIS, A. (eds) History of Geomorphology and Quaternary Geology. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 301, 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[valley]] forms, for example, uniformitarianism posited a sequence in which a river runs through a flat terrain, gradually carving an increasingly deep valley, until the [[side valley]]s eventually erode, flattening the terrain again, though at a lower elevation. It was thought that [[tectonic uplift]] could then start the cycle over. In the decades following Davis's development of this idea, many of those studying geomorphology sought to fit their findings into this framework, known today as "Davisian".&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt; Davis's ideas are of historical importance, but have been largely superseded today, mainly due to their lack of predictive power and qualitative nature.&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Walther Penck]] developed an alternative model to Davis's.&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt; Penck thought that landform evolution was better described as an alternation between ongoing processes of uplift and denudation, as opposed to Davis's model of a single uplift followed by decay.&lt;ref name='Ritter'&gt;Ritter, Dale F., R. Craig Kochel, and Jerry R. Miller. Process geomorphology. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasised that in many landscapes slope evolution occurs by backwearing of rocks, not by Davisian-style surface lowering, and his science tended to emphasise surface process over understanding in detail the surface history of a given locality. Penck was German, and during his lifetime his ideas were at times rejected vigorously by the English-speaking geomorphology community.&lt;ref name=OldroydGrapes /&gt; His early death, Davis' dislike for his work, and his at-times-confusing writing style likely all contributed to this rejection.&lt;ref name='Simons'&gt;Simons, Martin (1962), "The morphological analysis of landforms: A new review of the work of Walther Penck (1888–1923)", Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers) 31: 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Davis and Penck were trying to place the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface on a more generalized, globally relevant footing than it had been previously. In the early 19th century, authors – especially in Europe – had tended to attribute the form of landscapes to local [[climate]], and in particular to the specific effects of [[glaciation]] and [[periglacial]] processes. In contrast, both Davis and Penck were seeking to emphasize the importance of evolution of landscapes through time and the generality of the Earth's surface processes across different landscapes under different conditions.

During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale geomorphology was termed "physiography".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "'''''physi'''''cal" and "ge'''''ography'''''", and therefore synonymous with [[physical geography]], and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of [[physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]] while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with "pure morphology", separated from its geological heritage.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many earth scientists for the term "geomorphology" in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Victor R. | authorlink = |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Introduction |publisher=NASA |date=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climatic geomorphology===
{{further|Climatic geomorphology}}
During the age of [[New Imperialism]] in the late 19th century European explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms. As geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns. Climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale. The rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of [[Wladimir Köppen]], [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] and [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]]. [[William Morris Davis]], the leading geomorphologist of his time, recognized the role of climate by complementing his "normal" temperate climate [[cycle of erosion]] with arid and glacial ones.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twidale |first1=C.R.|author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |last2=Lageat |first2=Y. |date=1994 |title=Climatic geomorphology: a critique |url= |journal=[[Progress in Physical Geography]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=319–334 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Climatic geomorphology|year=2004|pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction ''against'' [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] that was by the mid-20th century considered both un-innovative and dubious.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Attack&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flemal |first=Ronald C. |last2= |first2= |date=1971 |title=The Attack on the Davisian System Of Geomorphology: A Synopsis |url= |journal= Journal of Geological Education|volume= 19|issue= |pages=3–13 |doi= 10.5408/0022-1368-XIX.1.3|access-date= |bibcode=1971JGeoE..19....3F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early climatic geomorphology developed primarily in [[continental Europe]] while in the English-speaking world the tendency was not explicit until L.C.

Climatic geomorphology was criticized in a 1969 [[review article]] by [[process geomorphology|process geomorphologist]] D.R. Stoddart.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Thomas|first=Michael F.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Tropical geomorphology|year=2004|pages=1063–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism by Stoddart proved "devastating" sparking a decline in the popularity of climatic geomorphology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly "trivial" methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; In addition some conceptions of climatic geomorphology, like that which holds that chemical weathering is more rapid in tropical climates than in cold climates proved to not be straightforwardly true.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

===Quantitative and process geomorphology===
[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] in the [[Drakensberg]], southern Africa.

Geomorphology was started to be put on a solid quantitative footing in the middle of the 20th century. Following the early work of [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] around the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Ritter' /&gt; a group of mainly American natural scientists, [[geologists]] and [[hydraulic engineers]] including [[William Walden Rubey]], [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]], [[Hans Albert Einstein]], [[Frank Ahnert]], [[John Tilton Hack|John Hack]], [[Luna Leopold]], [[Shields parameter|A. Shields]], [[Thomas Maddock (scientist)|Thomas Maddock]], [[Arthur Strahler]], [[Stanley Schumm]], and [[Ronald Shreve]] began to research the form of landscape elements such as [[rivers]] and [[mass wasting|hillslopes]] by taking systematic, direct, quantitative measurements of aspects of them and investigating the [[Scaling law|scaling]] of these measurements.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Ritter' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/Memorials/v41/Schumm-S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. These methods began to allow prediction of the past and future behavior of landscapes from present observations, and were later to develop into the modern trend of a highly quantitative approach to geomorphic problems. Many groundbreaking and widely cited early geomorphology studies appeared in the [[Bulletin of the Geological Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MORISAWA|first=MARIE|date=1988-07-01|title=The Geological Society of America Bulletin and the development of quantitative geomorphology|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsabulletin/article-abstract/100/7/1016/182157/the-geological-society-of-america-bulletin-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=GSA Bulletin|language=en|volume=100|issue=7|pages=1016|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1988)100&lt;1016:TGSOAB&gt;2.3.CO;2|issn=0016-7606|bibcode=1988GSAB..100.1016M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received only few citations prior to 2000 (they are examples of [[Paper with delayed recognition|"sleeping beauties"]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Evan B|date=2017-04-17|title=Delayed recognition of geomorphology papers in the Geological Society of America Bulletin|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309133317703093|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–368|doi=10.1177/0309133317703093}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a marked increase in quantitative geomorphology research occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=Michael|date=2010-06-01|title=The trajectory of geomorphology|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133310363992|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=265–286|doi=10.1177/0309133310363992|issn=0309-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative geomorphology can involve [[fluid dynamics]] and [[solid mechanics]], [[geomorphometry]], laboratory studies, field measurements, theoretical work, and full [[landscape evolution model]]ing. These approaches are used to understand [[weathering]] and [[pedogenesis|the formation of soils]], [[sediment transport]], landscape change, and the interactions between climate, tectonics, erosion, and deposition.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In Sweden [[Filip Hjulström]]'s doctoral thesis, "The River Fyris" (1935), contained one of the first quantitative studies of geomorphological processes ever published. His students followed in the same vein, making quantitative studies of mass transport ([[Anders Rapp]]), fluvial transport ([[Åke Sundborg]]), delta deposition ([[Valter Axelsson]]), and coastal processes ([[John O. Norrman]]). This developed into "the [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] School of [[Physical Geography]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, KJ, 1985: "The Nature of Physical Geography", E. Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary geomorphology===
Today, the field of geomorphology encompasses a very wide range of different approaches and interests.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt; Modern researchers aim to draw out quantitative "laws" that govern Earth surface processes, but equally, recognize the uniqueness of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate. Particularly important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include:

1) that not all landscapes can be considered as either "stable" or "perturbed", where this perturbed state is a temporary displacement away from some ideal target form.  Instead, dynamic changes of the landscape are now seen as an essential part of their nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whipple |first=Kelin X. |title=Bedrock Rivers and the Geomorphology of Active Orogens |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |date=19 May 2004 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=151–185 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120356 |bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..151W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time scales"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Philip A. |title=Time scales of tectonic landscapes and their sediment routing systems |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |date=2008 |volume=296 |pages=7–28 |doi=10.1144/SP296.2 |bibcode = 2008GSLSP.296....7A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) that many geomorphic systems are best understood in terms of the [[stochastic process|stochasticity]] of the processes occurring in them, that is, the probability distributions of event magnitudes and return times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benda |first=Lee |author2=[[Thomas Dunne (geologist)|Dunne, Thomas]] |title=Stochastic forcing of sediment supply to channel networks from landsliding and debris flow |journal=Water Resources Research |date=December 1997 |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=2849–2863 |doi=10.1029/97WR02388 |bibcode=1997WRR....33.2849B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knighton, David. Fluvial forms and processes: a new perspective. Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has indicated the importance of [[chaos theory|chaotic determinism]] to landscapes, and that landscape properties are best considered [[statistics|statistically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dietrich |first=W.

Albeit having its importance diminished [[climatic geomorphology]] continues to exist as field of study producing relevant research. More recently concerns over [[global warming]] have led to a renewed interest in the field.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

Despite considerable criticism the [[cycle of erosion]] model has remained part of the science of geomorphology.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker/&gt; The model or theory has never been proved wrong,&lt;ref name=Slaymaker/&gt; but neither has it been proven.&lt;ref name=ARoy&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Andre |date= |title=Contemporary Meanings in Physical Geography: From What to Why? |url= |location= |publisher= |page=5 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent difficulties of the model have instead made geomorphological research to advance along other lines.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Slaymaker|first=Olav|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Geomorphic evolution|year=2004|pages=420–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its disputed status in geomorphology, the cycle of erosion model is a common approach used to establish [[denudation chronology|denudation chronologies]], and is thus an important concept in the science of [[historical geology]].&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=David K.C.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Denudation chronology|year=2004|pages=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging its shortcomings modern geomorphologists [[Andrew Goudie (geographer)|Andrew Goudie]] and [[Karna Lidmar-Bergström]] have praised it for its elegance and pedagogical value respectively.&lt;ref name=Naten&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/erosionscykel |title=erosionscykel |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=June 22, 2016 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Cycle of erosion|year=2004|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==

Geomorphically relevant processes generally fall into
(1) the production of [[regolith]] by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], 
(2) the [[sediment transport|transport]] of that material, and 
(3) its eventual [[deposition (geology)|deposition]]. Primary surface processes responsible for most topographic features include [[wind]], [[wave]]s, [[weathering|chemical dissolution]], [[mass wasting]], [[groundwater]] movement, [[surface water]] flow, [[glacier|glacial action]], [[tectonism]], and [[volcanism]]. Other more exotic geomorphic processes might include [[periglacial]] (freeze-thaw) processes, salt-mediated action, marine currents activity, seepage of fluids through the seafloor or extraterrestrial impact.

=== Aeolian processes ===
[[File:MoabAlcove.JPG|thumb|Wind-eroded alcove near [[Moab, Utah]]]]
[[Aeolian processes]] pertain to the activity of the [[wind]]s and more specifically, to the winds' ability to shape the surface of the [[Earth]]. Winds may erode, transport, and deposit materials, and are effective agents in regions with sparse [[vegetation]] and a large supply of fine, unconsolidated [[sediment]]s. Although water and mass flow tend to mobilize more material than wind in most environments, aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as [[desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Leeder, M., 1999, Sedimentology and Sedimentary Basins, From Turbulence to Tectonics, Blackwell Science, 592 p. {{ISBN|0-632-04976-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological processes===
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|[[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|Beaver dams]], as this one in [[Tierra del Fuego]], constitute a specific form of zoogeomorphology, a type of biogeomorphology.]]
The interaction of living organisms with landforms, or [[Biogeomorphology|biogeomorphologic processes]], can be of many different forms, and is probably of profound importance for the terrestrial geomorphic system as a whole.  Biology can influence very many geomorphic processes, ranging from [[biogeochemical]] processes controlling [[chemical weathering]], to the influence of mechanical processes like [[burrowing]] and [[tree throw]] on soil development, to even controlling global erosion rates through modulation of climate through carbon dioxide balance. Terrestrial landscapes in which the role of biology in mediating surface processes can be definitively excluded are extremely rare, but may hold important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets, such as [[Geography of Mars|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dietrich |first=William E. |author2=Perron, J. Taylor |title=The search for a topographic signature of life |journal=Nature |date=26 January 2006 |volume=439 |issue=7075 |pages=411–418 |doi=10.1038/nature04452 |pmid=16437104 |bibcode = 2006Natur.439..411D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluvial processes ===

{{Main|Fluvial}}
{{See also|Hack's law|Sediment transport}}
Rivers and streams are not only conduits of water, but also of [[sediment]]. The water, as it flows over the channel bed, is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream, either as [[bed load]], [[suspended load]] or [[dissolved load]]. The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the river's [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton, D., 1998, ''Fluvial Forms &amp; Processes'', Hodder Arnold, 383 p. {{ISBN|0-340-66313-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to the surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large-scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strahler |first=A. N. |title=Equilibrium theory of erosional slopes approached by frequency distribution analysis; Part II |journal=American Journal of Science |date=1 November 1950 |volume=248 |issue=11 |pages=800–814 |doi=10.2475/ajs.248.11.800|bibcode=1950AmJS..248..800S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burbank |first=D. W. |title=Rates of erosion and their implications for exhumation |journal=Mineralogical Magazine |date=February 2002 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |doi=10.1180/0026461026610014 |url=http://projects.crustal.ucsb.edu/tectgeomorphfigs/Min_Mag_exhumation_ms.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2002MinM...66...25B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements.

As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. These systems take on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable (without faulting). Drainage systems have four primary components: drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, and receiving basin. Some geomorphic examples of fluvial landforms are [[alluvial fan]]s, [[oxbow lake]]s, and [[fluvial terrace]]s.

=== Glacial processes===
[[File:Glacial landscape LMB.png|thumb|right|Features of a glacial landscape]]
[[Glacier]]s, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of [[ice]] down a valley causes [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] and [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]] of the underlying [[rock (geology)|rock]]. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed [[glacial flour]]. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a [[moraine]]. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M.R. &amp; Glasser, N.F., 1996, Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 364 p. {{ISBN|0-471-96345-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of [[Plio-Pleistocene]] landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed [[paraglacial]] processes. This concept contrasts with [[periglacial]] processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Church |first=Michael |author2=Ryder, June M. |title=Paraglacial Sedimentation: A Consideration of Fluvial Processes Conditioned by Glaciation |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |date=October 1972 |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=3059–3072 |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[3059:PSACOF]2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1972GSAB...83.3059C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hillslope processes ===
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|[[Talus cone]]s on the north shore of [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]], [[Svalbard]], Norway. Talus cones are accumulations of coarse hillslope debris at the foot of the slopes producing the material.]]
[[Image:Ferguson-slide.jpg|thumb|The [[Ferguson landslide|Ferguson Slide]] is an active [[landslide]] in the [[Merced River|Merced River canyon]] on [[California State Highway 140]], a primary access road to [[Yosemite National Park]].]]
[[Soil]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope under the force of [[gravity]] via [[Downhill creep|creep]], [[Landslide|slides]], flows, topples, and falls. Such [[mass wasting]] occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].

Ongoing hillslope processes can change the topology of the hillslope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes. Hillslopes that steepen up to certain critical thresholds are capable of shedding extremely large volumes of material very quickly, making hillslope processes an extremely important element of landscapes in tectonically active areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roering |first=Joshua J. |author2=Kirchner, James W. |author3=Dietrich, William E.  |title=Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology |journal=Water Resources Research |date=March 1999 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=853–870 |doi=10.1029/1998WR900090 |url=http://www.geog.uoregon.edu/amarcus/geog607w09/readings/roering-et-al1999_wrr_slopes.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=1999WRR....35..853R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Earth, biological processes such as [[burrowing]] or [[tree throw]] may play important roles in setting the rates of some hillslope processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabet |first=Emmanuel J. |author2=Reichman, O.J. |author3=Seabloom, Eric W.  |title=The Effects of Bioturbation on Soil Processes and Sediment Transport |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |date=May 2003 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=249–273 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141314|bibcode= 2003AREPS..31..249G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igneous processes===
Both [[volcanic]] (eruptive) and [[plutonic]] (intrusive) igneous processes can have important impacts on geomorphology. The action of volcanoes tends to rejuvenize landscapes, covering the old land surface with [[lava]] and [[tephra]], releasing [[pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] material and forcing rivers through new paths.  The cones built by eruptions also build substantial new topography, which can be acted upon by other surface processes. Plutonic rocks intruding then solidifying at depth can cause both uplift or subsidence of the surface, depending on whether the new material is denser or less dense than the rock it displaces.

===Tectonic processes===
{{See also|Erosion and tectonics}}
[[Plate tectonics|Tectonic]] effects on geomorphology can range from scales of millions of years to minutes or less. The effects of tectonics on landscape are heavily dependent on the nature of the underlying [[bedrock]] fabric that more or less controls what kind of local morphology tectonics can shape. [[Earthquake]]s can, in terms of minutes, submerge large areas of land creating new wetlands. [[Isostatic rebound]] can account for significant changes over hundreds to thousands of years, and allows erosion of a mountain belt to promote further erosion as mass is removed from the chain and the belt uplifts. Long-term plate tectonic dynamics give rise to [[orogeny|orogenic belts]], large mountain chains with typical lifetimes of many tens of millions of years, which form focal points for high rates of fluvial and hillslope processes and thus long-term sediment production.

Features of deeper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] dynamics such as [[mantle plume|plumes]] and [[delamination (geology)|delamination]] of the lower lithosphere have also been hypothesised to play important roles in the long term (&gt; million year), large scale (thousands of km) evolution of the Earth's topography (see [[dynamic topography]]).  Both can promote surface uplift through isostasy as hotter, less dense, mantle rocks displace cooler, denser, mantle rocks at depth in the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cserepes |first=L. |author2=Christensen, U.R. |author3=Ribe, N.M.  |title=Geoid height versus topography for a plume model of the Hawaiian swell |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=15 May 2000 |volume=178 |issue=1–2 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00065-0 |bibcode=2000E&amp;PSL.178...29C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seber |first=Dogan |author2=Barazangi, Muawia |author3=Ibenbrahim, Aomar |author4= Demnati, Ahmed  |title=Geophysical evidence for lithospheric delamination beneath the Alboran Sea and Rif–Betic mountains |journal=Nature |date=29 February 1996 |volume=379 |issue=6568 |pages=785–790 |doi=10.1038/379785a0 |bibcode = 1996Natur.379..785S |url=http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/5287/1/Seber1996_Abstract%26Figure.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine processes===
Marine processes are those associated with the action of waves, marine currents and seepage of fluids through the seafloor. [[Mass wasting]] and submarine [[landslide|landsliding]] are also important processes for some aspects of marine geomorphology.&lt;ref&gt;Guilcher, A., 1958. Coastal and submarine morphology. Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ocean basins are the ultimate sinks for a large fraction of terrestrial sediments, depositional processes and their related forms (e.g., sediment fans, [[deltas]]) are particularly important as elements of marine geomorphology.

== Scales ==
Different geomorphological processes dominate at different spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, scales on which processes occur may determine the reactivity or otherwise of landscapes to changes in driving forces such as climate or tectonics.&lt;ref name="Time scales"/&gt; These ideas are key to the study of geomorphology today.

To help categorize landscape scales some geomorphologists might use the following [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]:
* 1st – [[Continent]], [[ocean basin]], climatic zone (~10,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 2nd – Shield, e.g. [[Baltic Shield]], or [[mountain range]] (~1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 3rd – Isolated [[sea]], [[Sahel]] (~100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 4th – [[Massif]], e.g. [[Massif Central]] or Group of related landforms, e.g., [[Weald]] (~10,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 5th – River valley, [[Cotswolds]] (~1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 6th – Individual [[mountain]] or [[volcano]], small valleys (~100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 7th – Hillslopes, stream channels, [[estuary]] (~10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 8th – [[gully]], [[barchannel]] (~1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 9th – Meter-sized features

== Overlap with other fields ==
There is a considerable overlap between geomorphology and other fields. Deposition of material is extremely important in [[sedimentology]].  [[Weathering]] is the chemical and physical disruption of earth materials in place on exposure to atmospheric or near surface agents, and is typically studied by [[soil science|soil scientists]] and environmental [[chemistry|chemists]], but is an essential component of geomorphology because it is what provides the material that can be moved in the first place. [[Civil engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental engineering|environmental]] engineers are concerned with erosion and sediment transport, especially related to [[canal]]s, [[slope stability]] (and [[natural hazard]]s), [[water quality]], coastal environmental management, transport of contaminants, and [[stream restoration]]. Glaciers can cause extensive erosion and deposition in a short period of time, making them extremely important entities in the high latitudes and meaning that they set the conditions in the headwaters of mountain-born streams; [[glaciology]] therefore is important in geomorphology.

'''Green Actors of West Africa (GAWA)''' is a [[Business network|network]] of [[environmental group|environmental organizations]] from [[West Africa]] created in 2005. The goal of GAWA Network is to develop ways of enhancing cooperation and coordination between and among the various donors and environmental (nature conservation) actors in this sub-African region.

The geographic coverage of GAWA network members includes: [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Togo]].

==History==
The initial concept of Green Actors in West Africa was first discussed in September 2004 during a meeting of NC-[[IUCN]]’s West African partners in [[Aburi]], Ghana. In a later meeting in April 2005 in [[Cotonou]], Benin, the decision was reached to formalize the network.

GAWA is thus a network of environmental [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) involved in [[environmental protection]], [[Land rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], [[awareness raising]], biodiversity [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and natural [[resource management]].

== Main priorities for the network ==
During 2005-2006, members of the network decided to focus their efforts on:
* [[Advocacy]], [[lobbying]] and strategic information gathering in local, national and regional contexts;
* Enhancing the technical and financial capacities of environmental NGOs to meet the challenges and threats to the natural environment, resulting from livelihood activities;
* Involvement of the local populations in biodiversity conservation and forest restoration;
* Inventories of endangered and flagship species as well as direct efforts to promote protection of protected areas;
* Environmental awareness and education at local, national and regional levels;
* Improved availability of current information on threatened species and habitats;
* Conflict management in biodiversity conservation initiatives

== Funding ==
The Netherlands Committee of [[IUCN]] (NC-IUCN) through the Tropical Rainforest Programme (TRP) and Dry Areas Support funds has been very instrumental in initiating the regional network. Through direct budget support to its regional focal point, the [[Environmental Foundation for Africa]], NC-IUCN have enabled all country assessments, holding of regional network meetings and capacity building training programmes for their partners in the sub-region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3854">'''Grey Ukraine''' (also: '''Grey Klin''' - ''Siryi Klyn''; Ukrainian: Сірий Клин, also: Сіра Україна - "Grey Ukraine"; Russian: Серый Клин) is an unofficial name for a region in Southern Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan, where there was mass settlement by [[Ukrainians]] at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. 1917-1920 there was a movement for a Ukrainian autonomy in the region.

==History==
[[File:Сірий Клин.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The map of the location of the Grey Ukraine.]]
The Ukrainian settlement of Siryi Klyn (literally: the "grey wedge")&lt;ref name="Wilson2015"/&gt; developed around the city of [[Omsk]] in western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Wilson1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Wilson|title=Ukrainian Nationalism in the 1990s: A Minority Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_QMCypjpXwC&amp;pg=PA180|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57457-0|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Bondarenko, an emigrant from [[Poltava]] province, wrote before World War I: "The city of Omsk looks like a typical Moscovite city, but the bazaar and markets speak Ukrainian". All around the city of Omsk stood Ukrainian villages. The settlement of people beyond the Ural mountains began in the 1860s. Altogether before 1914 1,604,873 emigrants from Ukraine settled the area.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Historical Grey Ukraine exists roughly within the present-day northern [[Kazakhstan]] and southern [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="Aggression1954"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. Congress. House.

A similar situation of territorial isolation exists with the [[Green Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Wynar2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bohdan S.

Most of the Ukrainian migrations to Siberia happened during the late 19th century and early 20th century. However, the migrations continued throughout the Soviet period. [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[virgin lands campaign]] during the 1950s managed to encourage the migration.&lt;ref name="Wilson1997"/&gt;

==Demographics==

According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian census]], 77,884 people of the [[Omsk Oblast|Omsk region]] identified themselves as Ukrainians, making Ukrainians the third-largest ethnic group there, after Russians and [[Kazakhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=81 |script-title=ru:Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года: Приморский край |trans-title=Russian Population Census 2002: Primorsky Krai |language=ru |publisher=Demoscope.ru |date=2002 |accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The book '''''Feindliche Übernahme: Wie der Islam den Fortschritt behindert und die Gesellschaft bedroht'''''  (''Hostile Takeover: How Islam Impedes Progress and Threatens Society'') was written by the German politician [[Thilo Sarrazin]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. It is published by the Finanzbuch Verlag (a member of the Münchener Verlagsgruppe GmbH) and has been released at the 30 August 2018. The book made it to #1 of the "[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel bestseller list]]", which is listing the best selling books in Germany per week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buchreport.de/2018/09/04/thilo-sarrazin-schafft-es-erneut-an-die-spitze-der-spiegel-bestsellerliste/ Thilo Sarrazin schafft es erneut an die Spitze der SPIEGEL-Bestsellerliste], Buchreport.de&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Thilo Sarrazin's best-known book ''[[Germany Abolishes Itself|Deutschland schafft sich ab: Wie wir unser Land aufs Spiel setzen]]'' (translated as: "Germany abolishes itself: How we are putting our country at a risk"), in which he criticizes Islam and migration, was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bz-berlin.de/deutschland/sarrazin-streitet-mit-verlag-richter-wirbt-fuer-einigung|title=Sarrazin streitet mit Verlag – Richter wirbt für Einigung|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.m-vg.de/finanzbuchverlag/shop/article/15466-feindliche-uebernahme/|title=Feindliche Übernahme|date=2018-08-28|isbn=9783959721622|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On publication, the book was immediately condemned by [[Angela Merkel]] and members of her government as "discriminatory". The [[Bundesbank]], for whom Sarrazin worked, distanced itself from the author,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11131937|title=Germany central banker condemned for 'racist' book|date=30 August 2010|website=BBC News|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that his remarks violated the bank's code of conduct were harmful to its reputation.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/30/bundesbank-executive-book-race-row|title=Bundesbank executive provokes race outcry with book|date=30 August 2010|author=Kate Connolly|website=The Guardian|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-German writer and sociologist [[Necla Kelek]], who accompanied Sarrazin at the launch, said that Sarrazin was "doing Germany a service" and that she shared his concerns about the future of the country. "(He) is calling on us Muslims to reflect on the role we play in Germany," she said. "To accuse him of racism is absurd, because Islam is not a race, but a culture and a religion."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; 

==Reception==
===Launch===
The launch of Sarrazin's new book was given police protection.&lt;ref name="n-tv"/&gt; [[Heinz Buschkowsky]], a former SPD politician, stated that he does not agree with every thesis in the book, but, out of his knowledge as former district mayor of [[Neukölln]], [[Berlin]], he shared Sarrazin's views.&lt;ref name="n-tv"&gt;[https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Sarrazin-der-Unverstandene-article20599837.html Sarrazin - der Unverstandene], n-tv.de&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Kühnert]], chairman of the SPD's Young Socialists' group [[Young Socialists in the SPD|Jusos]], demanded new party procedures to allow Sarrazin's exclusion, and the [[SPD]] leadership distanced itself from him.&lt;ref name="n-tv"/&gt;

===Critical reception===
A first detailed review of this book, in which she accuses Sarrazin of many factual errors, was published on the day of publication by the Freiburg scholar Johanna Pink in ''[[Die Zeit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/2018/36/feindliche-uebernahme-thilo-sarrazin-islam-buch/komplettansicht|title="Feindliche Übernahme": Ist diese Religion gefährlich?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulrich von Schwerin describes Sarrazin's question in the ''[[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]'' as legitimate, but his results as a "distorted image".&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich von Schwerin: [https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.rezension-feindliche-uebernahme-sarrazins-neues-buch-ist-ignorant-und-voller-vorurteile.0cbbf05f-9d9c-47d5-9583-c057479e7f02.html ''Rezension „Feindliche Übernahme“: Sarrazins neues Buch ist ignorant und voller Vorurteile.''] www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de, 31 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Von Schwerin says that of Sarrazin that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"His whole book shows that he is not concerned with helping shape peaceful coexistence, but rather with the strict separation of peoples and stopping the immigration of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/thilo-sarrazins-hostile-takeover-an-islam-experts-take-on-the-book/a-45346358|title=Thilo Sarrazin's 'Hostile Takeover': An Islam expert's take on the book|date=4 September 2018|author=Ulrich von Schwerin|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sonja Zekri]], writing in ''[[Tages Anzeiger]]'', said that "For him, Islam is not a faith, exposed to the stream of history and changeable, but a fate, a genetic defect that leads to intolerance and "below average educational achievements"," adding that "Germany needs this book as much as an Ebola outbreak, and yet success is inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/buecher/noetig-wie-ein-ebolaausbruch/story/10945671|title=Thilo Sarrazin hat wieder zugeschlagen|date=30 August 2018|author=Sonja Zekri|website=Tages Anzeiger|language=de|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit against his former publisher===
Several bestsellers authored by Thilo Sarrazin have been published by the Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, a member of the [[Random House]] group. They declined to publish his 2018 book, claiming that he had rejected [[proofreading]] of his work by an expert − a claim the publisher had to take back in court, after Sarrazin had proven it to be a falsehood. Sarrazin filed a lawsuit over 800,000 Euro claiming defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/literarischewelt/article180292582/Thilo-Sarrazin-Random-House-gesteht-Falschaussage-ein.html|title=Thilo Sarrazin: Random House gesteht Falschaussage ein|last=WELT|date=2018-07-31|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5715053|title=Umstrittenes Buch: Random House gesteht Falschaussage über Sarrazin|last=Plickert|first=Philip|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-18|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bastone di Giacobbe inv 3167 IF 46850.jpg|thumb|300px|Jacob's staff in the Museo Galileo, Florence]]

The term '''Jacob's staff''', also known as '''cross-staff''', a '''ballastella''', a '''fore-staff''', or a '''balestilha''', is used to refer to several things.  In its most basic form, a Jacob's staff is a stick or pole with length markings; most staffs are much more complicated than that, and usually contain a number of measurement and stabilization features. The two most frequent uses are:
* in [[astronomy]] and [[navigation]] for a simple device to measure [[angle]]s, later replaced by the more precise [[sextant]]s;
* in [[surveying]] (and scientific fields that use surveying techniques, such as [[geology]] and [[ecology]]) for a vertical rod that penetrates or sits on the ground and supports a compass or other instrument.

The simplest use of a Jacob's staff is to make qualitative judgements of the height and angle of an object relative to the user of the staff.

==In astronomy and navigation==
In [[navigation]] the instrument is also called a '''cross-staff''' and was used to determine angles, for instance the angle between the horizon and [[Polaris]] or the [[sun]] to determine a vessel's [[latitude]], or the angle between the top and bottom of an object to determine the distance to said object if its height is known, or the height of the object if its distance is known, or the horizontal angle between two visible locations to determine one's point on a map.

The Jacob's staff, when used for astronomical observations, was also referred to as a '''radius astronomicus'''.  With the demise of the cross-staff, in the modern era the name "Jacob's staff" is applied primarily to the device used to provide support for surveyor's instruments.

===History===
The origin of the name of the instrument is not certain.  Some refer to the Biblical patriarch [[Jacob]],&lt;ref name="turnerASI"/&gt; specifically {{bibleverse||Gen|32:11|HE}}.&lt;ref name="turnerASI"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Antique Scientific Instruments'', Blandford Press Ltd. 1980 {{ISBN|0-7137-1068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also take its name after its resemblance to [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], referred to by the name of [[Jacob]] on some medieval [[star chart]]s.&lt;ref name="wynter"&gt;Harriet Wynter and Anthony Turner, ''Scientific Instruments'', Studio Vista, 1975,  {{ISBN|0-289-70403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orion"&gt;[http://www.maa.mhn.de/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/orion.html Orion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612163005/http://www.maa.mhn.de/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/orion.html |date=2007-06-12 }} This article indicates the three belt stars are sometimes called Jacob's Ladder or Jacob's Stick&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible source is the Pilgrim's staff, the symbol of St James (Jacobus in Latin). The name ''cross staff'' simply comes from its [[cruciform]] shape.

The original Jacob's staff was developed as a single pole device in the 14th century that was used in making astronomical measurements.  It was first described by the French-Jewish mathematician [[Levi ben Gerson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~tsaban/Pdf/MathofLevi.pdf "The Mathematics of Levi ben Gershon, the Ralbag"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surveyhistory.org/jacob's_staff1.htm David G. Krehbiel "Jacob's Staff", ''Backsights'', Surveyor's Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Provence]], in his "Book of the Wars of the Lord" translated in Latin as well as Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Dr. David|title=The Cross Staff|url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scrostaf.htm|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used a Hebrew name for the staff that translates to “Revealer of Profundities.” The term “Jacob’s staff” was not used by Ben Gerson himself but by his Christian contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Bernard|title=Levin ben Gerson and the Cross Staff Revisted|journal=Aleph|date=2011|volume=11|issue=2|pages=365–385|jstor=10.2979/aleph.11.2.365.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:a08ab1beb338a72c69a372d21cc1f553}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its invention was likely due to fellow French-Jewish astronomer [[Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon|Jacob ben Makir]] who also lived in Provence in the same period.&lt;ref name="oxfordShipsAndSea"/&gt; Attributions to 15th century Austrian astronomer [[Georg Purbach]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://obs.nineplanets.org/psc/hist1.html "Important Astronomers, their Instruments and Discoveries"]&lt;/ref&gt; are less likely correct, since Purbach was not born until 1423. Such attributions may refer to a different instrument with the same name.  May&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that its origins can be traced to the [[Chaldea]]ns around 400 [[Before Christ|BC]].

Although it has become quite accepted that ben Gerson first described Jacob's staff, the British Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] theorizes that the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095), in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, described a Jacob's staff.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 573 575"&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Pages 573&amp;ndash;575.&lt;/ref&gt; Shen was an [[antiquarian]] interested in ancient objects; after he unearthed an ancient crossbow-like device from a home's garden in [[Jiangsu]], he realized it had a sight with a graduated scale that could be used to measure the heights of distant mountains, likening it to how mathematicians measure heights by using right-angle triangles.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 573 575"/&gt; He wrote that when one viewed the whole breadth of a mountain with it, the distance on the instrument was long; when viewing a small part of the mountainside, the distance was short; this, he wrote, was due to the cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the eye, while the graduation started from the further end. Needham does not mention any practical application of this observation.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 573 575"/&gt;

During the medieval European [[Renaissance]], the Dutch mathematician and surveyor [[Metius]] is known to have developed his own Jacob's staff. Fellow Dutch mathematician [[Gemma Frisius]] is also known to have made improvements to this instrument. The German mathematician Johannes Müller, called [[Regiomontanus]], made the Jacob's staff in the 15th century to a popular instrument in geodesic and astronomical measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit. Band 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck. Cologne, 2010. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:Jacobstaff.JPG|thumb|right|A Jacob's staff, from [[John Seller]]s' ''Practical Navigation'' (1672)]]
In the original form of the cross-staff, the pole or main staff was marked with [[graduation (instrument)|graduations]] for length.   The cross-piece (''BC'' in the drawing to the right), also called the ''transom'' or ''transversal'', slides up and down on the main staff.  On older instruments, the ends of the transom were cut straight across.  Newer instruments had [[brass]] fittings on the ends with holes in the brass for observation.  In [[marine archaeology]], these fittings are often the only components of a cross-staff that survive.&lt;ref name="swanick"&gt;Swanick, Lois Ann. ''An Analysis Of Navigational Instruments In The Age Of Exploration: 15th Century To Mid-17th Century'', MA Thesis, Texas A&amp;M University, December, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It was common to provide several transoms, each with a different range of angles it would measure.  Three transoms were common.  In later instruments, separate transoms were switched in favour of a single transom with pegs to indicate the ends.  These pegs mounted in one of several pairs of holes symmetrically located on either side of the transom.  This provided the same capability with fewer parts.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  The transom on [[Gemma Frisius|Frisius]]' version had a sliding vane on the transom as an end point.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

===Usage===
The navigator places one end of the main staff against his cheek just below his eye.  He sights the horizon at the end of the lower part of the transom (or through the hole in the brass fitting) (''B''), adjusting the cross arm on the main arm until the sun is at the other end of the transom (''C'').  The altitude can then be determined by reading the position of the transom on the scale on the main staff.  This value was converted to an angular measurement by looking up the value in a table.

===Cross-staff for navigation===
[[File:Cross-staff-MnM 11 NA 5-IMG 5989-black.jpg|thumb|Nautical cross-staff dated 1776, on display at [[Musée national de la Marine]], Paris.]]
The original version was not reported to be used at sea, until the [[Age of Discoveries]]. Its use was reported by [[João de Lisboa]] in his ''Treatise on the Nautical Needle'' of 1514.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldstein, B. R.|date=2011|journal=Aleph|volume=11|pages=365–383|title=Levi ben Gerson and the Cross Staff Revisited|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~brg/pdfs/brg_v_5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Johannes Werner]] suggested the cross-staff be used at sea in 1514&lt;ref name="may"/&gt; and improved instruments were introduced for use in navigation.  [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] introduced it to England in the 1550s.&lt;ref name="turnerASI"/&gt;  In the improved versions, the rod was graduated directly in degrees.  This variant of the instrument is not correctly termed a ''Jacob's staff'' but is a cross-staff.&lt;ref name="oxfordShipsAndSea"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea'', Peter Kemp ed., 1976 {{ISBN|0-586-08308-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cross-staff was difficult to use.  In order to get consistent results, the observer had to position the end of the pole precisely against his cheek.  He had to observe the horizon and a star in two different directions while not moving the instrument when he shifted his gaze from one to the other.  In addition, observations of the sun required the navigator to look directly at the sun.  This could be a painful exercise and made it difficult to obtain an accurate [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] for the sun. Mariners took to mounting [[smoked glass|smoked-glass]] to the ends of the transoms to reduce the glare of the sun.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Bourne (mathematician)|Bourne, William]], ''A Regiment for the Sea'', 1574&lt;/ref&gt;

As a navigational tool, this instrument was eventually replaced, first by the [[backstaff]] or [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], neither of which required the user to stare directly into the sun, and later by the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and the [[sextant]].  Perhaps influenced by the backstaff, some navigators modified the cross-staff to operate more like the former.  Vanes were added to the ends of the longest cross-piece and another to the end of the main staff.  The instrument was reversed so that the shadow of the upper vane on the cross piece fell on the vane at the end of the staff.  The navigator held the instrument so that he would view the horizon lined up with the lower vane and the vane at the end of the staff.  By aligning the horizon with the shadow of the sun on the vane at the end of the staff, the elevation of the sun could be determined.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This actually increased the accuracy of the instrument, as the navigator no longer had to position the end of the staff precisely on his cheek.

Another variant of the cross-staff was a [[Reflecting instrument#Joost van Breen's reflecting cross-staff|spiegelboog]], invented in 1660 by the Dutchman, Joost van Breen.

Ultimately, the cross-staff could not compete with the backstaff in many countries.  In terms of handling, the backstaff was found to be more easy to use.&lt;ref name="dehilster"&gt;[http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/crossstaff/index.html  Nicolàs de Hilster's web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311225816/http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/crossstaff/index.html |date=2014-03-11 }} Tests performed on various instruments are described.  In addition, de Hilster describes the handling characteristics found by the testers on the Nav List mailing list.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it has been proven by several authors that in terms of accuracy, the cross-staff was superior to the backstaff.&lt;ref name="bruyns"&gt;Bruyns, Willem Mörzer, ''The Cross-staff, History and development of a navigational instrument'', Nederlandsch Historisch Sheepvaart Museum, Amsterdam, and Walburg Instituut, Zutphen, Netherlands, 1994 {{ISBN|90-6011-907-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Backstaves were no longer allowed on board [[Dutch East India Company]] vessels as per 1731, with octants not permitted until 1748.&lt;ref name="bruyns"/&gt;

==In surveying==
In [[surveying]] the ''Jacob's staff'', contemporaneously referred to as a ''jacob staff'', is a single straight rod or staff made of nonferrous material, pointed and metal-clad at the bottom for penetrating the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, ''The Wilderness Route Finder'', University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, pp. 47-55, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has a screw base and occasionally a ball joint on the mount, and is used for supporting a [[compass]], transit, or other instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, pp. 47-55, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cross-staff'' may also have a different meaning in the history of surveying.  While the astronomical cross-staff was used in surveying for measuring angles, two other devices referred to as a cross-staff were also employed.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E., ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Cross-head''', '''cross-sight''', '''surveyor's cross''' or '''cross''' - a drum or  box shaped device mounted on a pole.  It had two sets of mutually perpendicular sights. This device was used by surveyors to measure offsets.  Sophisticated versions had a compass and spirit levels on the top.  The French versions were frequently eight-sided rather than round.&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt;
#'''Optical square''' - an improved version of the cross-head, the optical square used two silvered mirrors at 45° to each other.  This permitted the surveyor to see along both axes of the instrument at once.&lt;ref name="rankine"&gt;Rankine, William J. M., ''A Manual of Civil Engineering'', Charles Griffin &amp; Company (1926), p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, many surveyor's instruments were used on a Jacob's staff.  These include:
*Cross-head, cross-sight, surveyor's cross or cross
*[[Graphometer]]
*[[Circumferentor]]
*[[Holland circle]]
*[[Miner's dial]]
*[[Optical square]]
*[[Reflecting instrument#Types of sextants|Surveyor's sextant]]
*[[Surveyor's target]]
*[[Abney level]]

Some devices, such as the modern optical targets for laser-based surveying, are still in common use on a Jacob's staff.

===In geology===
In geology, the Jacob's staff is mainly used to measure stratigraphic thicknesses in the field, especially when [[Bed (geology)|bedding]] is not visible or unclear (e.g., covered outcrop) and when due to the configuration of an [[outcrop]], the apparent and real thicknesses of beds diverge therefore making the use of a tape measure difficult. There is a certain level of error to be expected when using this tool, due to the lack of an exact reference mean for measuring stratigraphic thickness. High-precision designs include a laser able to slide vertically along the staff and to rotate on a plane parallel to bedding.&lt;ref&gt;Patacci, M. (2016),  A high-precision Jacob's staff with improved spatial accuracy and laser sighting capability [http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/94611/ Open Repository] [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.02.001 DOI Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kabardia''' ({{lang-kbd|Къэбэрдей}}) was a historical region in the North Caucasus corresponding partly to the modern [[Kabardino-Balkaria]].  It had better political organization than its neighbors and a somewhat ‘feudal’ social structure.  It existed as a political community from the fifteenth century or earlier until it came under Russian control in the early nineteenth century.

==Geography and Peoples==
The [[Kabardians]] were the eastern branch of the [[Circassians]], to use this word in its broadest sense. They occupied the central third of the [[North Caucasus]] piedmont. To the north were the [[Nogais|Nogai]] steppe nomads.  To the south, and deeper in the mountains, were, from west to east, the [[Karachay]]s, [[Balkars]], [[Ossets]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]]  and [[Chechens]]. They interacted with these peoples because the mountaineers usually drove their livestock to the lowlands for winter pasture. The first three of these seem to have been originally steppe-dwellers who sought refuge in the mountains during the Mongol wars, while the Ingush and Chechens have inhabited the Caucasus for as long as anyone knows.  To the west were the [[Abazin]]s, the [[Besleney]], a branch of the Kabardians, and the [[Circassians]] proper. In the east the Kabardians were sometimes in contact with the [[Kumyks]].  The country's boundaries fluctuated, as did its political unity and degree of control over outlying areas.  The core of Kabardia was Great Kabardia which extended from somewhat east of the north-flowing part of the [[Kuban River]] to somewhat east of the north-flowing part of the [[Terek River]]. To the east was Lesser Kabardia between the Terek and [[Sunzha River]]s in what is now Chechen country. According to the Russian historian V. I. Potto, in the eighteenth century the Kabardians were greatly admired and copied by their neighbors, such that the phrase “he dresses, or rides, like a Kabardian” was an expression of high praise. [[Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov|Yermolov]] said that the Kabardians were the best fighters in the Caucasus but in his day they were much weakened by plague.

==History==
The Kabardians and their western relatives, the Circassians, have inhabited the north flank of the Caucasus as far back as anyone knows.  Kabardia is said to have been founded by the semi-legendary [[Prince Inal]]. Without a native tradition of written history, most of what we know of their history comes from their contacts with the Russians. This contact dates from 1475 then the Turks captured the Genoese ports on the Black sea and the part-Circassian Zakkaria Gizolfi appealed unsuccessfully to Moscow.  When the Golden Horde broke up about 1500 the steppe nomads became organized as the [[Nogai Horde]]. They and the Crimeans began or continued to raid the north Caucasus. Richmond reports raids for the years : ‘no later than 1476’, 1491, 1498, circa 1500 ‘every spring’,  1521, 1518, a 10-year break after 1519, 1539, 1547, 1554, 1567, 1578, 1606-1635 “seven times’,  1670s, 1708, 1720, 1735, 1740s, 1760–61 and &lt;ref&gt;Richmond @kindle1342 'In 1777 Greater Kabardia was invaded by both Russians and Crimeans.' The last Crimean raid on Russia seems to have been in 1769. It became a Russian vassal in 1774. Was this the last Crimean raid before it was annexed in 1783? Richmond does not pursue the matter.&lt;/ref&gt; 1777.

'''A brief alliance around 1560:''' Since the Crimeans were also raiding Russia (see [[Crimean–Nogai raids into East Slavic lands]]) the two peoples were natural allies.  There had been an isolated group of Cossacks on the [[Terek Cossacks|lower Terek]] from perhaps 1520.  In 1552 a Kabardian embassy reached Moscow. In 1556 Kabardians and Cossacks took the Turkish Fort Temryuk on the Taman peninsula.  When Astrakhan was captured in 1556 Russia had a base 250 miles northeast of Kabardia.   A few Kabardians entered Russian service. Temryuk  came to power some time before 1558 and in 1561 [[Maria Temryukovna|his daughter]] married Ivan the Terrible.   In 1567 Russia founded Sunzha Ostrog at the junction of the Terek and Sunzha in Lesser Kabardia.  In 1569, after [[Russo-Turkish War (1568–70)|the Turks failed to take Astrakhan]], their retreating troops were killed by the Kabardians.   In 1570 Temryuk was killed fighting the Crimeans.  In 1588 there was another treaty of alliance.  With the death of Temryuk and losses in the Livonian War Russia disengaged from the Caucasus for about 200 years. Sunzha Ostrog was abandoned in 1571, rebuilt in 1578 and abandoned a year later.

'''1600-1753:''' In 1645 a regiment was moved to Tersk  (it has been re-established early in the century).    Kabardia split into two factions, the pro-Russian Baksan and pro-Crimean Kashkatau (originally the alliances were opposite, but they switched sides some time after 1722.). One side brought in Russians from Astrakhan.  The [[Nekrasov Cossacks]] settled on the Kuban about 1711. More Cossacks settled on the Terek and Kizlyar was founded in 1736.  In 1739 Kabardia was declared a buffer state between the Russian and Ottoman empires.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond has Treaty of Belgrade here. Other sources have Treaty of Nish. The diplomatic status of the north Caucasus was always vague.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1744 Koltsov and 400 Cossacks arrived to support the Baksan faction.  Another force was sent in 1753.

'''Conquest:''' ''Kabardia came under Russian control between about 1769 and 1830. They moved west from the Terek country, southwest from Astrakhan and to a lesser degree southeast from Azov. From 1769 Russia intervened in Georgia south of the mountains. This required them to hold the [[Georgian Military Highway]] which passed through Kabardia. Georgia was annexed in 1800.''
[[File:Barry (capitaine). F. 23. Kabardiens. Mission scientifique de Mr Ernest Chantre. 1881.jpg|thumb|upright|Kabardians, 1881]]

Mozdok was established in 1763 and in 1769 Russia attacked Kabardia for the first time.  The 1774 [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] declared Kabardia a vassal of the Crimean Khanate.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, @kindle 1327. This is contradicted by other sources&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1777 the Mozdok line was begun which was to run from Mozdok northwest to Azov.  From  1779 a line of forts was run west along the [[Malka River]] cutting off Kabardian pastures.  In 1779 von Shtrandman was sent to the north Caucasus and fought 1500 Kabardians at a place called Fort Pavolosk. There was a major battle on the Malka River and later 3000 Kabardians were defeated in the Baksan country.  This led to a treaty but there was more fighting in 1780.    By 1783 the [[Georgian Military Highway]]  had been improved sufficiently to be used by wheeled traffic.   In 1785-91 [[Sheikh Mansur]] attempted to lead an anti-Russian holy war in the north Caucasus.  During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]] Russian forces thrice crossed Circassian territory attempting to take the Black Sea fort of Anapa.  Late in this war Batal Pasha invaded the north Caucasus and was defeated.  In 1791 Ustlabinsk was established in Circassia at the junction of the Kuban and Laba Rivers. By 1793 25000 Cossacks were settled along the Mozdok line.

In the early nineteenth century a plague struck the north Caucasus which lasted until the 1830s. It is estimated that Kabardia lost 90% of its population, falling from 200,000 in 1790 to 30,000 in 1830.  In 1804 there was a general uprising all over the north Caucasus. The Russians won at least three battles mainly because of their artillery. One involved 13000 men on both sides and another involved 7000 Kabardians. Around 1810 Russia destroyed 200 villages.  In 1822 new forts were built on the North Caucasus Line.  In the 1820s Yermolov led a campaign which is said to have completely depopulated Lesser Kabardia.  After about 1830 the Kabardians had been subdued by plague and war and the Russians turned their attention to the [[Murid War]] in the east and the [[Russo-Circassian War]] in the west. For more on the conquest see [[North Caucasus line]].

A '''land Information System (LIS)''' is a [[geographic information system]] for [[cadastre|cadastral]] and [[land use|land-use]] mapping, typically used by [[local governments]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade, T. and Sommer, S. eds. ''[http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=868&amp;Category_ID=49 A to Z GIS]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A LIS consists of an accurate, current and reliable land record [[cadastre]] and its associated attribute and spatial data that represent the legal boundaries of land tenure and provides a vital base layer capable of integration into other geographic systems or as a standalone solution that allows data stewards to retrieve, create, update, store, view, analyze and publish land information.

== Importance ==
# Land parcel is the basic unit for access and control of land, land use decisions. 
# Current, reliable land information necessary for many public programs: land planning, infrastructure development and maintenance, environmental protection and resource management, emergency services, social service programs and so forth. 
# LIS provides a base for land markets, development, and other economic activity. 
# LIS helps in updating of the maps.

==Monuments==

===Monumento de los Españoles===
[[File:Monumento de los Españoles.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Monument to the Spaniards]]
{{Main|Monument to the Carta Magna and Four Regions of Argentina}}

The "Monumento a La Carta Magna y las Cuatro Regiones Argentinas" is situated in the Sarmiento y [[Avenida del Libertador|Libertador]] avenues part of the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] district. It was raised by the Spanish community in 1910 for the Centennial of the Revolution of May, and it is commonly referred to as the "Spanish Monument" ("Monumento De los Españoles"). The colossal work is 24.5 meters high, created in marble from [[Carrara]] and brass by the Spanish sculptor [[Agustí Querol Subirats]].

In March 1916, the [[ocean liner]] ''[[Príncipe de Asturias (ocean liner)|Príncipe de Asturias]]'' from [[Barcelona]] was wrecked 90 miles from Rio de Janeiro. In this accident, more than 450 people died and the load of marble ornaments and brass that composed the statuary of the monument was lost in the depths of the ocean. The following year, replicas were requested for those lost in the shipwreck. Finally, May 25, 1927 the count of Amalfi, on behalf of the king [[Alfonso XIII]], made a symbolic delivery of the work to the president [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.palermonline.com.ar/palermo-barrio/galeria_de_fotos/monumento_carta_magna/index.htm |title="Monumento de los Españoles" |access-date=2009-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203123111/http://palermonline.com.ar/palermo-barrio/galeria_de_fotos/monumento_carta_magna/index.htm |archive-date=2009-02-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monument of General Manuel Belgrano===
{{Main|Equestrian monument to General Manuel Belgrano}}

This monument of the general [[Manuel Belgrano]], one of the greatest heroes of Argentine History, is in the [[Plaza de Mayo]]. It is a bronze equestrian statue on a large granite pedestal, showing Belgrano holding aloft the flag of Argentina. It was inaugurated in 1873, created by the French sculptor [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]] and Argentine [[Manuel de Santa Coloma]]. The monument was erected by public funding in gratitude to the general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conozcabuenosaires.com.ar/monumentos/belgrano.htm "Monumento al General Manuel Belgrano"] Conozca Buenos Aires. Retrieved 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel Belgrano (1770 &amp;ndash; 1820) was an economist, lawyer, politician, and military leader, born in [[Buenos Aires]]. He founded the ''Escuela de Naútica'' (School of Navigation) in 1799. After the Spanish rule was overthrown in 1810, Belgrano was appointed general by the first autonomous government of Argentina. Belgrano led an ill-fated military campaign to [[Paraguay]], and also led the [[Jujuy Exodus]], which prepared the ground for victories of the [[Argentine War of Independence]] in the northwest of the country in the [[Battle of Tucumán]] (1812) and [[Battle of Salta]] (1813). Belgrano was one of the leaders of the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]], promulgated on July 9, 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentour.com/en/argentina_personalities/manuel_belgrano.php "Juan Manuel Belgrano"] Argentour.com.

===Monument of the Two Congresses===
[[File:Buenos Aires-Plaza del Congreso-Monumentos.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Monument of the Two Congresses]]
The ''Monumento de los dos Congresos'' in the [[Congressional Plaza|Plaza des los Dos Congresos]] in the [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Monserrat]] district, was created in stone from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. The monument was designed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] architect Eugène D'Huicque (1877–1955) and the bronze statues are the work of the Belgian artist Jules Lagae(1862–1931). It was created in [[Brussels]], finished in 1909, and inaugurated in Buenos Aires on July 9, 1914&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cai.org.ar/dep_tecnico/comisiones/CTECO/trabajos/obras-monumentos.htm "OBRAS Y MONUMENTOS SOBRE LAS PLAZAS DEL CONGRESO"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004131345/http://www.cai.org.ar/dep_tecnico/comisiones/CTECO/trabajos/obras-monumentos.htm |date=2008-10-04 }} Centro Argentino de Ingenieros. Retrieved 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument celebrates the centenary of the 1816 declaration of independence. The central figure represents the Republic on the march, with snake faces and an allegory of abundance at its feet. The two lateral figures represent the assembly of 1813 and the congress of 1816. There are also other representations of national fauna, notably of horses and condors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismebuenosaires.com/Monuments-sur-la-Plaza-des-los-Dos.html "Monuments sur la Plaza des los Dos Congresos"] Tourism Buenos Aires.

=== Monument to Christopher Columbus ===
{{Main|Monument to Christopher Columbus (Buenos Aires)}}

The monument of [[Christopher Columbus]]  (ca. 1451-1506) was located between [[Casa Rosada|La Casa Rosada]] (government house) and La Avenida La Rabida. The monument was a gift celebrating the 1910 Centennial of Argentinean independence from Spain, from the Buenos Aires Italian community, led by Italian immigrant Antonio Devoto.

A work of the Italian sculptor [[Arnoldo Zocchi|Arnaldo Zocchi]], the foundation stone of the monument was placed on May 24, 1910, but the monument was not inaugurated until June 15, 1921.The monument is 26 meters tall and weighs 623 tons. The column in the center was made of a single 6.25m tall block of Carrara marble that weighed 38 tons. The monument was created in Italy, divided into nineteen sections, and shipped to Buenos Aires, where it arrived on April 14, 1921. It suffered some damage during a bombardment in 1955. In June 2013 the monument was taken down to be replaced by a monument to indigenous guerrilla fighter Juana Azurduy de Padilla.

===Monument to José Manuel Estrada===
[[File:Monumento a Estrada.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Monumento a Estrada]]

This monument in the Plaza Loria is to the late-19th-century historian, journalist and publicist [[José Manuel Estrada]] (1842–1894), a leading [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] intellectual and politician in Buenos Aires in the second half of the 19th century.

The sculpture of Estrada was ordered in 1937 by the municipality of Buenos Aires and inaugurated on 11 November 1947. It was created by the sculptor Héctor Rocha (1893-?), who also created a statue of General Manuel Belgrano in the plaza Manuel Belgrano, inaugurated in 1961, and the ''Monumento a Guillermo Rawson'' described below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bue.gov.ar/recorridos/index.php?info=auto_contenido&amp;menu_id=144&amp;lang=en "Belgrano"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410021641/http://www.bue.gov.ar/recorridos/index.php?menu_id=144&amp;info=auto_contenido&amp;lang=en |date=2009-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi===
[[File:GaribaldiBuenosAires.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi in Plaza Italia]]
{{Main|Monumento a Giuseppe Garibaldi}}

The Monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi is an [[equestrian sculpture]] featuring [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], located on [[Plaza Italia, Buenos Aires|Plaza Italia]], in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–1882) was an [[Italians|Italian]] military and political figure. In his twenties, he joined the [[Carbonari]] Italian patriot revolutionaries, and had to flee Italy after a failed insurrection. He then contributed to the independence of [[Uruguay]], leading the Italian Legion in the [[Uruguayan Civil War]], and afterwards returned to Italy as a commander in the conflicts of the [[unification of Italy|Risorgimento]]. He has been dubbed the "Hero of the Two Worlds" in tribute to his military expeditions in both South America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garibaldi, Giuseppe (1807-1882) |url=http://www.ohiou.edu/~chastain/dh/gari.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129085329/http://www.ohiou.edu/~chastain/dh/gari.htm |archivedate=2009-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monument to General Juan Lavalle===
[[File:Buenos Aires - Monumento a Lavalle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lavalle]]

The monument is the work of the sculptor Pedro Costa, located in a circle on Tucumán street. It is made of marble and sandstone. It has a strong base and a column that supports the statue. It was carried out by the initiative of a Commission presided over by [[Bartolomé Mitre]] during the intendency of Torcuato of Alvear.

[[Juan Lavalle]] was in the army that besieged [[Montevideo]] in 1813. He continued to participate in the struggles between the successor states of the Spanish provinces, fighting with great bravery and steadily rising in rank. In the [[Battle of Ituzaingó]] in February 1827, he beat the forces of General Abreu and was himself proclaimed General on the field of battle. Lavalle organised the [[Unitarian Party|Unitarian]] revolution of December 1828, after which he was chosen governor of [[Buenos Aires Province]]. One of his unfortunate decisions was to execute former governor [[Manuel Dorrego]], which ignited a civil war. After the ''Convention of Barracas'' agreement with [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], he retired to the [[Banda Oriental]] (nowadays Uruguay) In 1839, with support from exiled objectors to Rosas' government, he arrived in [[Entre Ríos Province]] and advanced towards Buenos Aires in order to overthrow Rosas. However, he was unsuccessful and was accidentally shot dead in 1841.

By a "strange coincidence" the Monumento al General Lavalle was erected in front of the residence of Felicia Dorrego, the former governor's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentinatotal.com.ar/info_turis/provincias/capfed/paseos/paseo_9.htm "Plaza General Lavalle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704085428/http://www.argentinatotal.com.ar/info_turis/provincias/capfed/paseos/paseo_9.htm |date=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariano Moreno (1778–1811) was a lawyer, journalist and politician who played a decisive role in the [[May Revolution]] that led to the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] of Argentina from Spain. Moreno was a secretary in the [[Primera Junta|First Junta]] that replaced the viceroy of Spain. He suppressed the uprising of [[Santiago de Liniers]] in [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] (whom he had executed later), and organized the liberating expedition to Alto Perú. He was then removed from office by [[Cornelio Saavedra]].

Moreno created the first Argentine newspaper, ''La Gazeta de Buenos Aires''. He summarized his thoughts on economics in his 1809 book ''Representación de los hacendados y labradores'', which, following the [[physiocrats|physiocratic doctrine]], proposed the stimulation of agriculture to develop an economy that was very dependent on [[international trade]] and its undesirable consequence, [[contraband]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Cabildo===
[[File:Cabildo de Buenos Aires.JPG|280px|thumb|right|Buenos Aires Cabildo.]]
{{Main|Buenos Aires Cabildo}}

The [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] building was used as the government house during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial times]] of the [[Viceroyalty of the River Plate]]. The original building was finished in 1610 but was soon found to be too small and had to be expanded. Over the years many changes have been made. In 1940, the architect Mario Buschiazzo reconstructed the colonial features of the Cabildo using various original documents.

Currently, the Cabildo hosts the National Museum of the Cabildo and the May Revolution (Museo Nacional del Cabildo y la Revolución de Mayo), in which paintings, artifacts, clothes and jewellery of the 18th century are on display. The patio of the Cabildo still has its 1835 ornamental water well.

The Casa Rosada sits at the eastern end of the Plaza de Mayo, a large square which since the 1580 foundation of Buenos Aires has been surrounded by many of the most important political institutions of the city and of Argentina. The site, originally at the waterline of the [[Río de la Plata]], was first occupied by the "Fort of Juan Baltazar of Austria," a structure built on the orders of the founder of Buenos Aires, Captain [[Juan de Garay]], in 1594. Its 1713 replacement by a masonry structure (the "Castle of San Miguel") complete with turrets made the spot the effective nerve center of colonial government.

Following independence, President [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] had a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] portico built at the entrance in 1825, and the building remained unchanged until, in 1857, President [[Justo José de Urquiza]] ordered the fort demolished in favor of a new customs building, built under the direction of [[English settlement in Argentina|British Argentine]] architect Edward Taylor. The [[Italianate]] structure was Buenos Aires' largest building from 1859 until the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museo.gov.ar/historia/indice.htm "Museum of the Casa Rosada: history" {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091129/http://www.museo.gov.ar/historia/indice.htm |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remained the city's tallest building until 1935 when, on completion, the [[Kavanagh Building]] took over this title. The lighthouse at the top of the building can be seen all the way in Montevideo, Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbarolo.com.ar/homein.htm Palacio Barolo Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302074138/http://www.pbarolo.com.ar/homein.htm |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teatro Colón===
[[File:Frente del Teatro Colón.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Teatro Colón]]
{{Main|Teatro Colón}}
The Teatro Colón (Columbus Theatre) opened in 1908 and is one of the World's major opera houses.

The present theatre, the second with that name, opened in 1908 after twenty years under construction. The auditorium is horseshoe-shaped, has 2,487 seats (slightly more than, say, the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], London, England), standing room for 1,000 and a stage which is 20 m wide, 15 m high and 20 m deep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrocolon.org.ar/inicio.htm Official site of the Teatro Colon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513191520/http://www.teatrocolon.org.ar/inicio.htm |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[acoustics]] are considered one of the best five acoustics in opera in the world.

The theatre is bounded by the extremely wide [[9 de Julio Avenue]] (technically Cerrito Street), Libertad Street (the main entrance), [[Arturo Toscanini]] Street, and Tucumán Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrocolon.org.ar/English/history.htm History of the Colón Theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517070546/http://www.teatrocolon.org.ar/English/history.htm |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the heart of the city on a site once occupied by [[Ferrocarril Oeste de Buenos Aires|Ferrocarril Oeste]]'s ''Plaza Parque'' station.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13223">This is a list of '''[[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] words of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] origin'''.

''Note: For information on the transcription used, see [[National Library at Calcutta romanization]]. An exception from the standard is the [[romanization]] of Sinhala long "ä" ({{IPA|[æː]}}) as "ää".''

Sinhala words of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] origin came about during the period of [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch colonial rule]] in [[Sri Lanka]] between 1658 and 1798. This period saw absorption of several Dutch words into the local language brought about by the interaction between Dutch colonials and the Sinhalese people, mainly in the coastal areas of the island. The Dutch replaced the Portuguese as the catalyst of change with regards to the social and cultural life of the people. A wide variety of words were adopted from administrative terms to military terms, which reveals several points of contact between the two groups.

==Types of loanwords==
;Borrowings
The words pertaining to the fields of daily life, [[Administration (business)|administration]], [[food]] and [[military]] are the most numerous; this is to be expected because of many new innovations and goods that reached Sri Lanka via the Dutch.

==The borrowing process==
Dutch loanwords in Sinhala rarely appear in the same form as the original word. Usually, a word has undergone some kind of modification to fit into the Sinhala [[phonological]] or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] system (e.g. ''balk'' becomes ''bālkaya'' because Sinhala inanimate nouns (see [[grammatical gender]]) need to end with /a/, {{IPAblink|ə}}, in order to be [[Declension|decline]]able).

These are the main ways Dutch words are incorporated into the Sinhala lexicon with different endings:
*With an /aya/ or /uva/ added to Dutch words ending in consonants (e.g. ''raam'' &amp;gt; ''rāmuva'').
*With a /ya/ added to words ending in /a/ or /e/ or /i/ (e.g. ''bakje'' &amp;gt; ''bakkiya'').
*With the animate ending /yā/ added to Dutch words signifying living beings or (e.g. ''tolk'' &amp;gt; ''tōlkayā'').
*Initial /s/ preceding a consonant usually forms an additional syllable (e.g. ''school'' &amp;gt; ''iskōlaya'').

This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[Wallis and Futuna]]'''.

Wallis and Futuna ({{lang-fr|Wallis et Futuna}}) is an [[overseas collectivity]] (''collectivité d'outre-mer'' or ''COM'') of [[France]] located in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] between [[Fiji]] and [[Samoa]].

The territory is made up of three main [[volcano|volcanic]] [[tropical island]]s along with a number of tiny islets, and is split into two island groups that lie about {{convert|260|km}} apart, namely [[Wallis Island]]s (or Uvea Islands) in the northeast and [[Hoorn Islands]] (or Futuna Islands) in the southwest, including [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna Island]] proper and the mostly uninhabited [[Alofi Island]]. The [[capital city|capital]] of Wallis and Futuna is [[Mata-Utu]], which is located on Wallis Island.

== Airports ==

ICAO location identifiers are linked to each airport's [[Aeronautical Information Publication]] (AIP), which are available online in [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) from the French [http://www.sia.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/ ''Service d'information aéronautique'' (SIA)]. Locations shown in bold are as per the airport's AIP page. Most airports give two locations: the first is the city served, second is the city where the airport is located.

This is a list of the '''[[Extreme points of Earth|extreme points]] of [[Denmark]]''': the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location. 

== Latitude and longitude ==
=== Jutland Peninsula ===
This includes only land on the [[Jutland]] peninsula &amp;ndash; land that is part of mainland Europe:

* North : [[Skagen]], [[North Jutland County]] ({{coord|57|45|9|N|10|37|1|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Skagen (North)}})
** If the [[North Jutlandic Island]] is not included, then it's [[Hennedal]] ([[Aalborg Municipality|Aalborg]], [[North Jutland County]]) ({{coord|57|04|45|N|10|00|19|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Hennedal (North)}})
* South : [[Padborg]], [[South Jutland County]] ({{coord|54|58|N|9|21|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Padborg (South)}})
* West : [[Blåvandshuk]], [[Ribe County]] ({{coord|55|33|45|N|8|4|21|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Blåvandshuk (West)}})
* East : [[Grenå]], [[Aarhus County]] ({{coord|56|27|N|10|37|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Grenå (East)}})
Following a flood in 1825, the northernmost part of [[Jutland]] is actually an island.

=== European Union ===
This includes only land in the [[European Union]], also called Denmark proper, excluding [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] which are considered separate countries:

* North : Skagen, North Jutland County ({{coord|57|45|9|N|10|37|1|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Skagen (North)}})
* South : [[Gedser]], [[Falster]] ({{coord|54|33|33|N|11|58|11|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Gedser (South)}})
* West : Blåvands Huk, Ribe County ({{coord|55|33|45|N|8|4|21|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Blåvands Huk, Ribe (West)}})
* East : [[Østerskær]], [[Christiansø]] ({{coord|55|19|06|N|15|11|50|E|type:landmark_region:DK|name=Østerskær (East)}})

[[Image:Grand Cypress South Course 9th hole.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Grand Cypress Golf Club, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando, FL]]  1984]]

Following is a '''list of golf courses designed by [[Jack Nicklaus]]''' and his company [[Nicklaus Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/search_open.php?crit_sort=1&amp;name=&amp;state=&amp;4_option=3&amp;country=USA&amp;submit=Search |title=Courses Open for Play |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest golf design practices in the world.

In the mid-1960s, [[Pete Dye]] initially requested Nicklaus' advice for the design of The Golf Club in suburban Columbus, Ohio. His first design [[Harbour Town Golf Links]], co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/ |title=Nicklaus Design |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent early, yet more prominent design was [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio which opened in 1974 and has hosted the [[Memorial Tournament]] since its inception in 1976. This course has also hosted the 1987 [[Ryder Cup]] and the 1998 [[Solheim Cup]] matches. For the first few years, all of his projects were co-designs with either Pete Dye or [[Desmond Muirhead]].

Nicklaus is in partnership with his four sons and his son-in-law through their company, ''[[Nicklaus Design]]''. The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, nearly 1% of all the courses in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visiteurope.com/ccm/experience/detail/?nav_cat=134&amp;lang=en_US&amp;item_url=/ETC/pan-european/golf-in-europe.ja |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219050156/http://www.visiteurope.com/ccm/experience/detail/?nav_cat=134&amp;lang=en_US&amp;item_url=/ETC/pan-european/golf-in-europe.ja |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 19, 2007 |title=Golf in Europe |publisher=VisitEurope.com |accessdate=November 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of Nicklaus-designed courses stand in the United States, a significant presence also occupies Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4895">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in the Wallis and Futuna Islands'''. There are 5 mammal species in the [[Wallis and Futuna Islands]], all of which are marine mammals of the order Cetacea.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution`, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

==Subclass: [[Theria]]==

===Infraclass: [[Eutheria]]===

====Order: [[Cetacea]] (whales)====
----

[[Image:SpinnerDolphinsoffKauai 1999-03-15.jpg|thumb|[[Spinner Dolphin]]]]
The order Cetacea includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. They are the mammals most fully [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic]] life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.

The '''Mogao Caves''', also known as the '''Thousand Buddha Grottoes''' or '''Caves of the Thousand Buddhas''', form a system of 492 temples {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the center of [[Dunhuang]], an oasis strategically located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the [[Silk Road]], in [[Gansu]] province, China. The caves may also be known as the '''Dunhuang Caves''', however, this term is also used as a collective term to include other Buddhist cave sites in and around the Dunhuang area, such as the [[Western Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Yulin Caves]], and [[Five Temple Caves]]. The caves contain some of the finest examples of [[Buddhist art]] spanning a period of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The first caves were dug out in 366 AD as places of Buddhist meditation and worship.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Wengin&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are the best known of the [[China|Chinese]] Buddhist grottoes and, along with [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], are one of the three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China.

An important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called "Library Cave", which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The contents of the library were subsequently dispersed around the world, and the largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the [[International Dunhuang Project]] exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, with a number open for visiting.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Makinen, Julie (September 27, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-mogao-grottoes-buddhist-caves-dunhuang-20140928-story.html "Getty Institute helps save China's Mogao Grottoes from tourism's impact"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The caves are commonly referred to in Chinese as the Thousand Buddha Caves ({{zh|c=千佛洞|p=qiānfó dòng}}), a name that some scholars have speculated to have come from the legend of its founding, when a monk Yuezun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas at the site.  This name however may have come from the large number of Buddha figures at the site, or the miniatures figures painted on the walls of these caves as these figures are called "thousand Buddhas" colloquially.{{sfn|Chung|1994|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} The name Mogao Caves ({{zh|c={{linktext|莫高窟}}|p= Mògāo kū}}) was used in the Tang dynasty, where 'Mogao' refers to an administrative district at the site during the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger|page=242 |publisher=Routledge|date=13 June 1996|isbn= 978-1884964046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao may mean  "peerless" (literally "none higher", where "''mo''" means "none", and "''gao''" means "high");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/13/dunhuang-caves-artifacts-ancient-history-chinese-civilization-getty-institute-silk-road-los-angeles |title=Artifacts from ancient Chinese cave temples head west for California exhibit |first=Jordan |last=Riefe|date=13 May 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWmmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cave Temples of Mogao at Dunhuang: Art History on the Silk Road: Second Edition |authors= Roderick Whitfield, Susan Whitfield, Neville Agnew |page=55 |publisher=Getty Publications|edition= 2nd |date=29 September 2015|isbn= 978-1606064450}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative reading may be "high in the desert" if "mo" is read as a variant of the Chinese term for "desert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6wmQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mogao+desert+high&amp;q=mo+desert+high |title=Frescoes and Fables: Mural Stories from the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang|first=Naomi |last=McPherson |publisher=New World Press|date= 1998|page=14 |isbn=9787800054006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao is also used as the name of a modern town that is administered by [[Dunhuang]] city: Mogao Town ({{linktext|莫高|镇}}).&lt;ref name="xzqhdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/gs/30392.html |script-title=zh:敦煌市历史沿革 |trans-title=Dunhuang City Historical Development |publisher=XZQH.org |language=Simplified Chinese |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statsdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/tjyqhdmhcxhfdm/2016/62/09/620982.html |title=2016年统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码：敦煌市 |trans-title=2016 Statistical Area Numbers and Rural-Urban Area Numbers: Duhuang City |language=zh-hans |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] |date=2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are also often referred to as the Dunhuang Caves after the nearest city [[Dunhuang]], which means "blazing beacon" as beacons were used  at the frontier outpost to warn of attacks by nomadic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HDBZDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Cave Temples of Dunhuang |isbn=9781606064894 |author1=Agnew |first1=Neville |last2=Reed |first2=Marcia |last3=Ball |first3=Tevvy |date=2016-05-07 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Dunhuang Caves however is also used in a broader sense as a collective term for all the caves found in or around the Dunhuang area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIa9sere_8C&amp;pg=PA427#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Eighteen Lectures on Dunhuang |first= Xinjiang |last=Rong |page=427 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=9789004252332 |date=2013-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dunhuang Mogao cave 159.jpg|thumb|left|Details of painting of the meeting of [[Manjusri]] and [[Vimalakirti]]. Cave 159.]]
Dunhuang was established as a frontier garrison outpost by the Han Dynasty [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wudi]] to protect against the [[Xiongnu]] in 111 BC. It also became an important gateway to the West, a centre of commerce along the [[Silk Road]], as well as a meeting place of various people and religions such as [[Buddhism]].

The construction of the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang is generally taken to have begun sometime in the fourth century AD. According to a book written during the reign of Tang [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], ''Fokan Ji'' ({{lang|zh-hant|佛龕記}}, ''An Account of Buddhist Shrines'') by Li Junxiu ({{lang|zh|李君修}}), a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk named Lè Zūn ({{lang|zh-hant|樂尊}}, which may also be pronounced Yuezun) had a vision of a thousand [[Gautama Buddha|Buddhas]] bathed in golden light at the site in 366 AD, inspiring him to build a cave here.&lt;ref&gt;''Fokan Ji'' {{lang|zh-hant|《佛龕記》}} '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|莫高窟者厥，秦建元二年，有沙门乐僔，戒行清忠，执心恬静。当杖锡林野，行至此山，忽见金光，状有千佛。□□□□□，造窟一龛。}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story is also found in other sources, such as in inscriptions on a [[stele]] in cave 332; an earlier date of 353 however was given in another document, ''Shazhou Tujing'' ({{lang|zh-hant|沙州土鏡}}, ''Geography of Shazhou'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Le Huu Phuoc |title=Buddhist Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Grafikol |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9844043-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined by a second monk Faliang ({{lang|zh|法良}}), and the site gradually grew, by the time of the [[Northern Liang]] a small community of monks had formed at the site. The caves initially served only as a place of meditation for hermit monks, but developed to serve the monasteries that sprang up nearby. Members of the ruling family of [[Northern Wei]] and [[Northern Zhou]] constructed many caves here, and it flourished in the short-lived [[Sui Dynasty]]. By the [[Tang Dynasty]], the number of caves had reached over a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Dunhuang &amp;ndash;  Mogao Caves
|publisher=
|accessdate=2007-07-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Sui and Tang dynasties, Mogao Caves had become a place of worship and pilgrimage for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dunhuang Sees Great Changes Over the Years |author=Xiuqing Yang |publisher=China Intercontinental Press |year=2007 |isbn=7-5085-0916-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 4th until the 14th century, caves were constructed by monks to serve as shrines with funds from donors. These caves were elaborately painted, the cave paintings and architecture serving as aids to [[meditation]], as visual representations of the quest for enlightenment, as [[mnemonic]] devices, and as teaching tools to inform those illiterate about Buddhist beliefs and stories. The major caves were sponsored by patrons such as important clergy, local ruling elite, foreign dignitaries, as well as Chinese emperors. Other caves may have been funded by merchants, military officers, and other local people such as women's groups.

During the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang became the main hub of commerce of the Silk Road and a major religious centre. A large number of the caves were constructed at Mogao during this era, including the two large statues of Buddha at the site, the largest one constructed in 695 following an edict a year earlier by Tang Empress [[Wu Zetian]] to build giant statues across the country.&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=daqin&amp;f=false  |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site escaped the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|persecution of Buddhists]] ordered by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] in 845 as it was then under [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] control. As a frontier town, Dunhuang had been occupied at various times by other non-Han Chinese people. After the Tang Dynasty, the site went into a gradual decline, and construction of new caves ceased entirely after the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. By then Islam had conquered much of Central Asia, and the Silk Road declined in importance when trading via sea-routes began to dominate Chinese trade with the outside world. During the Ming Dynasty, the Silk Road was finally officially abandoned, and Dunhuang slowly became depopulated and largely forgotten by the outside world. Most of the Mogao caves were abandoned; the site, however, was still a place of pilgrimage and was used as a place of worship by local people at the beginning of the twentieth century when there was renewed interest in the site.

[[File:Anonymous-Bodhisattva Leading the Way.jpg|thumb|right|Bodhisattva leading a lady [[donor portrait|donor]] towards the Pure Lands. Painting on silk (Library Cave), Late Tang.]]
During late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Western explorers began to show interest in the ancient Silk Road and the lost cities of Central Asia, and those who passed through Dunhuang noted the murals, sculptures, and artifacts such as the [[Stele of Sulaiman]] at Mogao. The biggest discovery, however, came from a Chinese [[Taoist]] named [[Wang Yuanlu]] who appointed himself guardian of some of these temples around the turn of the century.

Some of the caves had by then been blocked by sand, and Wang set about clearing away the sand and made an attempt at repairing the site. In one such cave, on 25 June 1900, Wang discovered a walled up area behind one side of a corridor leading to a main cave.&lt;ref name="Duan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idp"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous [[Dunhuang manuscripts|hoard of manuscripts]]. In the next few years, Wang took some manuscripts to show to various officials who expressed varying level of interest, but in 1904 Wang re-sealed the cave following an order by the governor of Gansu.

[[File:Wang Yuanlu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Abbot [[Wang Yuanlu]], discoverer of the hidden Library Cave]]
Words of Wang's discovery drew the attention of a joint British/Indian group led by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist [[Aurel Stein]] who was on an archaeological expedition in the area in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-9/V-2/page/0283.html.en Aurel Stein, Serindia vol. II] pg. 801-802&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein negotiated with Wang to allow him to remove a significant number of manuscripts as well as the finest paintings and textiles for a fee. He was followed by a French expedition under [[Paul Pelliot]] who acquired many thousands of items in 1908, and then by a Japanese expedition under [[Otani Kozui]] in 1911 and a Russian expedition under [[Sergei F. Oldenburg]] in 1914. A well-known scholar [[Luo Zhenyu]] edited some of the manuscripts Pelliot acquired into a volume which was then published in 1909 as "Manuscripts of the Dunhuang Caves" ({{lang|zh-hant|敦煌石室遺書}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/dunhuang-shi-shi-yi-shu/oclc/52768538 Dunhuang shi shi yi shu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein and Pelliot provoked much interest in the West about the Dunhuang Caves; however, there was initially little interest in official circles in China. Concerned that the remaining manuscripts might be lost, Luo Zhenyu and others persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the rest of the manuscripts to be sent to Peking ([[Beijing]]) in 1910. However, not all the remaining manuscripts were taken to Peking, and of those retrieved, some were then stolen. Some of the caves were [[Russians in China#Vandalism of Mogao Caves|damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers]] when they were used by the local authority in 1921 to house Russian soldiers fleeing the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] following the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="杨秀清2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang |first1=Xiuqing (杨秀清) |script-title=zh:风雨敦煌话沧桑: 历经劫难的莫高窟 Feng yu Dunhuang hua cang sang: li jing jie nan de Mogao ku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtshc7KLLJwC&amp;pg=PT163|year=2006| publisher = [[:zh:五洲传播出版社|China Intercontinental Press]]|isbn=978-7-5085-0916-7|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, American explorer [[Langdon Warner]] removed a number of murals as well as a statue from some of the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foreign Devils on the Silk Road |author=Peter Hopkirk |authorlink = Peter Hopkirk|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DoxsQDBQHYEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7195-6448-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/209770 |title = From the Harvard Art Museums’ collections Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha (from Mogao Cave 323, Dunhuang, Gansu province) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://img.mp.itc.cn/upload/20160413/2e3f23e8bbaf4d3598091e5b13e369c0.jpg |title = Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 [[Kuomingtang]] soldiers stationed at Dunhuang caused some damage to the murals and statues at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew|title= Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road |year=2000|publisher= The British Library |page=37|isbn= 0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation improved in 1941 when, following a visit by [[Wu Zuoren]] to the site the previous year, the painter [[Zhang Daqian]] arrived at the caves with a small team of assistants and stayed for two and a half years to repair and copy the murals. He exhibited and published the copies of the murals in 1943, which helped to publicize and give much prominence to the art of Dunhuang within China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp The Epochal Significance in Zhang Daqian's Copies of Dunhuang Fresco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728114420/http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Xiang Da then persuaded [[Yu Youren]], a prominent member of the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party), to set up an institution, the Research Institute of Dunhuang Art (which later became the [[Dunhuang Research Academy|Dunhuang Academy]]), at Mogao in 1944 to look after the site and its contents. In 1956, the first [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]], [[Zhou Enlai]], took a personal interest in the caves and sanctioned a grant to repair and protect the site; and in 1961, the Mogao Caves were declared to be a specially protected historical monument by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and large-scale renovation work at Mogao began soon afterwards. The site escaped the widespread damage caused to many religious sites during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;pg=233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=223 |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Library Cave ==

[[File:Dunhuang Cave 16.jpg|thumb|280px|Picture of Cave 16, by Aurel Stein in 1907, with manuscripts piled up beside the entrance to Cave 17, the Library Cave, which is to the right in this picture.]]
The cave no. 17 discovered by [[Wang Yuanlu]] came to be known as the Library Cave. It is sited off the entrance leading to cave no.16, and was originally used as a memorial cave for a local monk Hongbian on his death in 862. Hongbian, from a wealthy Wu family, was responsible for the construction of cave 16, and the Library Cave may have been used as his retreat in his lifetime. The cave originally contained his statue which was moved to another cave when it was used to keep manuscripts, some of which bear Hongbian's seal. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002 were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts, including a Hebrew penitential prayer (selichah) (see [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]). The Library Cave also contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia. According to Stein who was the first to describe the cave in its original state:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-8/V-2/page/0246.html.en Opening of the hidden chapel] M. Aurel Stein, ''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol II''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Heaped up in layers, but without any order, there appeared in the dim light of the priest's little lamp a solid mass of manuscript bundles rising to a height of nearly ten feet, and filling, as subsequent measurement showed, close on 500 cubic feet. The area left clear within the room was just sufficient for two people to stand in.|Aurel Stein|''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol. II''}}
The Library Cave was walled off sometime early in the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed as the reason for sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the [[Tripitaka]] became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Fujieda, "The Tun-Huan Manuscripts", in ''Essays on the sources for Chinese history'' (1973). edited by Donald D. Leslie, Colin Mackerras, and Wang Gungwu. [[Australian National University]], {{ISBN|0-87249-329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf The Provenance and Character of the Dunhuang Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223151/http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as Pelliot, suggested an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents in advance of an attack by invaders, perhaps when [[Western Xia|Xi Xia]] invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed in light of the absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist [[kingdom of Khotan]] to [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanids]] invaders from [[Kashgar]] in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Rong, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/asie_0766-1177_1999_num_11_1_1155 The Nature of the Dunhuang Library Cave and the Reasons for its Sealing]&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is generally accepted to be 1002, and although other dates have been suggested, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.

===Dunhuang manuscripts===
{{Main|Dunhuang manuscripts}}
[[File:Pelliot cave163.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Paul Pelliot]] examining manuscripts in the Library Cave, 1908]]

The manuscripts from the Library Cave date from fifth century until early eleventh century when it was sealed. Up to 50,000 manuscripts may have been kept there, one of the greatest treasure troves of ancient documents found. While most of them are in Chinese, a large number of documents are in various other languages such as [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uigur]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], including the then little-known [[Saka language|Khotanese]]. They may be old hemp paper scrolls in Chinese and many other languages, Tibetan pothis, and paintings on hemp, silk or paper. The subject matter of the great majority of the scrolls is Buddhist in nature, but it also covers a diverse material. Along with the expected Buddhist canonical works are original commentaries, [[apocrypha]]l works, workbooks, books of prayers, [[Confucian]] works, [[Taoist]] works, [[Nestorian Christian]] works, works from the Chinese government, administrative documents, anthologies, glossaries, dictionaries, and calligraphic exercises.

Many of the manuscripts were previously unknown or thought lost, and the manuscripts provide a unique insight into the religious and secular matters of Northern China as well as other Central Asian kingdoms from the early periods up to the Tang and early Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitfield, Susan |title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith. |year=2004  |publisher=British Library, Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscripts found in the Library Cave include the earliest dated printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] from 868, which was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the fourth century. These scrolls also include manuscripts that ranged from the Nestorian [[Jesus Sutras]] to the [[Dunhuang Go Manual]] and ancient music scores, as well as the image of the [[Chinese astronomy]] [[Dunhuang map]]. These scrolls chronicle the development of Buddhism in China, record the political and cultural life of the time, and provide documentation of mundane secular matters that gives a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of these eras.

The manuscripts were dispersed all over the world in the aftermath of the discovery. Stein's acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and [[Lotus Sutra]]s. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained [[Sinology|sinologist]] literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better selection of documents than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men's groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of [[palimpsest]] whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the [[paper]]. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of [[International Dunhuang Project]].

[[File:Mural Avolokitesvara.jpg|thumb|right|Mural of [[Avalokiteśvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), Worshipping Bodhisattvas and Mendicant in cave 57. Figures originally adorned with [[gold leaf]]. Early Tang.]]

The art of Dunhuang covers more than ten major genres, such as [[architecture]], [[stucco]] sculpture, [[Mural|wall paintings]], silk paintings, calligraphy, woodblock printing, embroidery, literature, music and dance, and popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew. "Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road" (2000). The British Library. {{ISBN|0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The caves are examples of [[rock-cut architecture]], but unlike [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], the local rock is a rather soft [[gravel]] conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' styles seen in places such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the [[stupa]] round which worshippers may [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] (''[[parikrama]]'') and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian [[vihara]] (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.

Many of the caves originally had wooden porches or fore-temples built out from the cliff, but most of these have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses the Great Buddha and was originally 4 storeys high, but it has been repaired at least 5 times and is no longer the original structure. A storey was added between 874-885, then repaired in the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murals===
[[File:Dunhuang General Zhang Yichao army detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of mural commemorating the victory of General [[Zhang Yichao]] over the [[Tibetan Empire]]. Cave 156, Late Tang Dynasty.]]
The murals in the caves date from a period of over a thousand years, from the 5th to the 14th century, and many earlier ones were repainted at later points within the period. The murals are extensive, covering an area of {{convert|490,000|ft2|m2|abbr=off}}. The most fully painted caves have paintings all over the walls and ceilings, with geometrical or plant decoration filling the spaces not taken by figurative images, which are above all of the [[Buddha]]. Sculpture is also brightly painted. The murals are valued for the scale and richness of content as well as their artistry. Buddhist subjects are most common, however some have traditional mythical subjects and [[donor portrait|portraits of patrons]]. These murals document the changing styles of Buddhist art in China for nearly a thousand years. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee during the Tang period, and the quality of the work dropped after the tenth century.

Early murals showed a strong Indian and Central Asian influence in the painting techniques used, the composition and style of the paintings as well as costumes worn by the figures, but a distinct Dunhuang style began to emerge during Northern Wei Dynasty.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite book |title=Three Thousands Years of Chinese Paintings |author=Yang Xin, Rihard M. Branhart, Nie Chongzheng, [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]], Lang Shaojun, Wu Hung. |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motifs of Chinese, Central Asian and Indian origin may be found in a single cave, and Chinese elements increased during the Western Wei period.&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

A common motif in many caves is the areas entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which this and other "Thousand Buddhas Caves" are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using [[stencil]]s so that identical figures may be replicated. Flying [[apsara]]s, or celestial beings may be depicted in the ceiling or above the Buddhas, and figures of donors may be shown along the bottom of the walls. The paintings often depict [[jataka tales]] which are stories of the life of Buddha, or [[avadana]] which are parables of the doctrine of [[karma]].

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao mural repainted.jpg|thumb|Early mural revealed after later over-painting had been partly removed. The flesh tones of the figure with its pigments protected from oxidation contrast with the darkened tone of buddhas in later painting seen on the right. Cave 253, Northern Wei.]]

[[Bodhisattvas]] started appearing during the Northern Zhou period, with [[Avalokitesvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), which was originally male but acquired female characteristics later, the most popular. Most caves show [[Mahayana]] and [[Sravakayana]] ([[Theravada]] or [[Hinayana]]) influences, although Mahayana Buddhism became the dominant form during the Sui Dynasty. An innovation of the Sui-Tang period is the visual representation of the sutra &amp;ndash; Mahayana Buddhist teachings transformed into large complete and detailed narrative paintings.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"/&gt;  One of the central features of Tang art in Mogao is the representation of the paradise of the [[Pure Land]], indicating the increasing popularity of this school of Mahayana Buddhism in the Tang era. The iconography of [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]], such as the eleven-headed or thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, also started to appear in Mogao wall paintings during the Tang period. It became popular during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang and the subsequent periods, especially during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"/&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang figures showing shading technique.jpg|thumb|left|Figures showing shading technique, and on the left, the effect of darkening of the paint used in shading which changed the appearance of the figure.]]
While Buddhist art is stylistically distinct from secular art, the style of paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as we know of this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General [[Zhang Yichao]], who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s ([[Uyghur Gansu Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Qocho]]) and the Saka [[Kingdom of Khotan]] and their portraits are featured prominently in some of the caves.&lt;ref name="dra"/&gt;

Many of the figures have darkened due to oxidation of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light. Many early figures in the murals in Dunhuang also used painting techniques originated from India where shading was applied to achieve a 3-dimensional or [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref name="dra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.dha.ac.cn/content.aspx?id=185436748917 |title=The Art of Dunhuang |work=Dunhuang Research Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the darkening of the paint used in shading over time resulted in heavy outlines which is not what the painters had originally intended. This shading technique is unique to Dunhuang in East Asia at this period as such shading on human faces was generally not done in Chinese paintings until much later when there were influences from European paintings. Another difference from traditional Chinese painting is the presence of figures that are semi-nude, occasionally fully nude, as figures are generally fully clothed in Chinese paintings. Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.

===Sculptures===
[[File:Great Buddha, Cave 96, Mogao Caves.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Buddha of cave 96]]

There are around 2,400 surviving clay sculptures at Mogao. These were first constructed on a wooden frame, padded with reed, then modelled in clay stucco, and finished with paint. The giant statues however have a stone core. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is generally shown as the central statue, often attended by [[boddhisattva]]s, [[Four Heavenly Kings|heavenly kings]], [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s, and apsaras, along with [[yaksha|yaksas]] and other mythical creatures.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Grotta nr 275.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in cave 275 from [[Northern Liang]] (397-439), one of the earliest caves. The crossed ankle figure with a three-disk crown shows influence from [[Kushan]] art.]]

The early figures are relatively simple and mainly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Buddhas of Northern Wei may have two attendant Bodhisattvas, and two further disciples were added in Northern Zhou, forming a group of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Figures from the Sui and Tang periods may be present as larger groups of seven or nine, and some showed large-scale [[parinirvana]] scene with groups of mourners. The early sculptures were based on Indian and Central Asian prototypes, with some in the [[Greco-Indian]] style of [[Gandhara]]. Over time the sculptures showed more Chinese elements and became gradually sinicized.

The two giant statues represent [[Maitreya Buddha]]. The earlier and larger one in cave 96, at 35.5 m high, was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and giant statues in 694. The smaller one is 27 m tall and was constructed in 713-41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger northern giant Buddha was damaged in an earthquake and had been repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing, colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its original Early Tang appearance. The southern statue however is largely in its original form apart for its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger Buddha is housed in a prominent wooden 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"/&gt;
[[File:BeijingNationalArtMuseumofChina7.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of the reclining Buddha of the Tibetan period from cave 158. [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing.]]

One type of caves constructed during the Tibetan era is the Nirvana Cave, which features a large reclining Buddha that covers the entire length of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of mourners in murals or in sculptural forms are also depicted along the length of the hall behind the Buddha. The Buddha figure in cave 158 measures 15.6 m long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |pages=170–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original function of the "Library Cave" was as a shrine commemorating Hong Bian, the 9th-century monk. His portrait statue, unusual here and among all surviving works in China, was removed to another spot when the cave was sealed up in the 11th century, but has been returned now the library has been removed. There is also a stone [[stele]] describing his life, and the wall behind the statue is painted with attendant figure; such blending of painted sculpture and wall paintings into a single composition is very common at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings on silk and paper===
Before the discovery in the Library Cave, original paintings on silk and paper from the Tang dynasty, a formative period in Chinese art, were very rare, and most of the surviving examples were copies made in later periods. Over a thousand paintings on silk, banners, and embroideries were found in the Library Cave, none apparently dating before the late 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of the paintings are anonymous, but many are of high quality, especially from the Tang. Most are sutra paintings, images of Buddha, and narrative paintings. The paintings show something of the contemporary Chinese style of the capital [[Chang'an]], but many also reflect Indian, Tibetan and Uighur painting styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |page=235 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are brush paintings in ink alone, some in just two colours, as well as many in full colour. Most common are single figures, and most paintings were probably donated by an individual, who is often portrayed on a diminutive scale. The donor figures become notably more elaborate in dress by the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 21, and numbers 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed images===

The Library Cave is equally important as a source of rare early images and texts produced by [[woodblock printing]], including the famous [[Diamond Sutra]], the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also printed out at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 99-107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textiles===
The textiles found in the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks' apparel ([[Kasaya (clothing)|kāṣāya]]). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth as a sign of humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Museum Book of Chinese Art |author=Jessica Rawson |publisher=British Museum Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7141-1453-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered.  [[Window valance|Valances]] used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caves==
[[File:Dunhuang mural flying apsarasa.jpg|thumb|Flying apsaras, or celestial beings. Caves 285, 538-539 AD, Western Wei Dynasty]]
The caves were cut into the side of a cliff which is close to two kilometers long. At its height, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], there were more than a thousands caves, but over time many of the caves were lost, including the earliest caves. 735 caves currently exist in Mogao; the best-known ones are the 487 caves located in the southern section of the cliff which are places of pilgrimage and worship.   248 caves have also been found to the north which were living quarters, meditation chambers, and burial sites for the monks. The caves at the southern section are decorated, while those at the northern section are mostly plain.

The caves are clustered together according to their era, with new caves from a new dynasty being constructed in different part of the cliff. From the murals, sculptures, and other objects found in the caves, the dates of around five hundred caves have been determined. Following is a list of the caves by era, compiled in the 1980s (more have been identified since):

* [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (366-439) - 7 caves, the oldest dated to [[Northern Liang]] period.
* [[Northern Wei]] (439-534) and [[Western Wei]] (535-556) - 10 from each phase
* [[Northern Zhou]] (557-580) - 15 caves
* [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618) - 70 caves
* Early Tang (618- 704) - 44 caves
* High Tang (705-780) - 80 caves
* Middle Tang (781-847) - 44 caves (This era in Dunhuang is also known as the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] period because Dunhuang was then under Tibetan occupation.)
* Late Tang (848-906) - 60 caves (This and the subsequent periods until the Western Xia period are also known collectively as the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period (歸義軍, Return to Righteousness Army, 848-1036) when Dunhuang was ruled by the Zhang and Cao families.)
* [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|The Five Dynasty]] (907-960) - 32 caves
* [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1035)- 43 caves
* [[Western Xia]] (1036–1226) - 82 caves
* [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1227–1368) - 10 caves

'''Mount Zion''' ({{lang-he-n|הַר צִיּוֹן}}, ''Har Tsiyyon''; {{lang-ar|جبل صهيون}}, ''Jabal Sahyoun'') is a hill in [[Jerusalem]] just outside the walls of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. The term Mount Zion has been used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] first for the [[City of David]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 5:7}}, {{Bibleref2|1 Chronicles 11:5}}; {{Bibleref2|1 Kings 8:1}}, {{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 5:2}}) and later for the [[Temple Mount]], but its meaning has shifted and it is now used as the name of ancient Jerusalem's Western Hill.&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=647 The Significance of Jerusalem: A Jewish Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; In a wider sense, the term is also used for the entire [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=This is Jerusalem |author=Menashe Harel |publisher=Canaan Publishing |location=Jerusalem |year=1977 |pages=194–195 |url= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The three different locations==
[[File:Jerusalem Tomb of David BW 1.JPG|thumb|150px|David's Tomb on Mount Zion]]
The name ''Mount Zion'' referred successively to three locations, as Jerusalemites preserved the time-honoured name, but shifted the location they venerated as the focal point of biblical Jerusalem to the site considered most appropriate in their own time.

===Lower Eastern Hill (City of David)===
At first, Mount Zion was the name given to the [[Jebusite]] fortified city on the lower part of ancient Jerusalem's Eastern Hill, also known as the [[City of David]].&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt;

According to the [[Book of Samuel]], Mount Zion was the site of the Jebusite fortress called the "stronghold of Zion" that was conquered by [[King David]], then renamed and partially rebuilt by him as the "City of David", where he erected his [[David's Palace|palace]].&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt;

===Upper Eastern Hill (Temple Mount)===
Once the [[Temple in Jerusalem#First or Solomon.27s Temple|First Temple]] was erected at the top of the Eastern Hill, the name "Mount Zion" migrated there too.&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt;

After the conquest of the Jebusite city, its build-up area expanded northward towards the uppermost part of the same, Eastern Hill. This highest part became the site of Solomon's Temple.

The identification of the pre-Israelite (Jebusite) and Israelite towns on the Eastern Hill is based on the existence of only one perennial water source in the area, the [[Gihon Spring]], and on archaeological excavations revealing sections of the Bronze Age and Iron Age city walls and water systems.&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harel193&gt;{{cite book |title=This is Jerusalem |author=Menashe Harel |publisher=Canaan Publishing |location=Jerusalem |year=1977 |page=193 |url= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Mount Zion" mentioned in the later parts of the [[Book of Isaiah]] ({{Bibleref2|Isaiah 60:14}}), in the [[Book of Psalms]], and the [[First Book of Maccabees]] (c. 2nd century BCE) seems to refer to the top of the hill, generally known as the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt;

===Western Hill (today's Mount Zion)===
[[File:JerusalemTopography.png|thumb|Natural topography of the old city of Jerusalem and its surroundings]]
The last shift of the name Mount Zion was to the Western Hill, which is more dominant than the Eastern Hill and seemed to first-century CE Jerusalemites the worthier location for the by-then lost palace of King David. The Western Hill is what today is called Mount Zion.&lt;ref name=Pixner&gt;{{cite book |title=Paths of the Messiah |author=Bargil Pixner |editor=[[Rainer Riesner]] |others=Translated by Keith Myrick, Miriam Randall |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2010 |pages=320–322 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bvhA6IE4VqgC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=zion+canaanite#v=onepage&amp;q=zion%20canaanite&amp;f=false |ISBN=978-0-89870-865-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the First Temple period, the city expanded westward and its defensive walls were extended to include the entire Western Hill behind them.&lt;ref name=Harel272&gt;{{cite book |title=This is Jerusalem |author=Menashe Harel |publisher=Canaan Publishing |location=Jerusalem |year=1977 |page=272 |url= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] destroyed the city almost completely around [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|586 BCE]], severing the continuity of historical memory. A long period of rebuilding followed, ending with Jerusalem's second [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|total destruction]] at the hands of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70 CE. [[Josephus]], the first-century CE historian who knew the city as it was before this second catastrophic event, identified Mount Zion as being the Western Hill, separated from the lower, Eastern Hill, by what he calls the "[[Tyropoeon Valley]]".&lt;ref name=Pixner/&gt; It must however be said that Josephus never used the name "Mount Zion" in any of his writings, but described the "Citadel" of King David as being situated on the higher and longer hill, thus pointing at the Western Hill as what the Bible calls Mount Zion.&lt;ref name="Wars"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wars of the Jews or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem |author= Flavius [[Josephus]] |publisher= [[Project Gutenberg]] |translator= [[William Whiston]] |quote= The city was built upon two hills, which are opposite to one another, and have a valley to divide them asunder; [...] Of these hills, that which contains the upper city is much higher, and in length more direct. Accordingly, it was called the "Citadel," by king David; [...] Now the Valley of the Cheesemongers, as it was called, and was that which we told you before distinguished the hill of the upper city from that of the lower,...

See footnote on page 83. ({{Google books|nc0vAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA83|online copy|page=83}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==History since the Late Roman period==
At the end of the Roman period, a synagogue was built at the entrance of the structure known as David's Tomb, probably based on the belief that David brought the [[Ark of the Covenant]] here from [[Beit Shemesh]] and [[Kiryat Ye'arim]] before the construction of the Temple.&lt;ref name=Harel273&gt;{{cite book |title=This is Jerusalem |author=Menashe Harel |publisher=Canaan Publishing |location=Jerusalem |year=1977 |page=273 |url= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]], Mount Zion was conquered by the [[Harel Brigade]] on May 18, 1948 and became the only part of the Old City to stay in Israeli hands until the armistice. At first it was linked to the Jewish neighborhood of [[Yemin Moshe]] across the [[Valley of Hinnom]] via a narrow tunnel, but eventually an alternative was needed to evacuate the wounded and transport supplies to soldiers on Mt. Zion. A cable car capable of carrying a load of 250 kilograms was designed for this purpose. The cable car was only used at night and lowered into the valley during the day to escape detection; it is still in place at what is now the Mount Zion Hotel. The ride from the Israeli position at the St. John Eye Hospital to Mount Zion took two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000003947.htm Mt. Zion Cable Car] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813051739/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000003947.htm |date=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1948 and 1967, when the Old City was under [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian rule]], Israelis were forbidden access to the Jewish holy places. Mount Zion was a designated no-man's land between Israel and Jordan.&lt;ref name="Bar-Am"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1176152836357&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter |publisher=Jerusalem Post |first=Aviva|last=Bar-Am | title=On the spot |accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Zion was the closest accessible site to the ancient [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]]. Until East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]], Israelis would climb to the rooftop of [[David's Tomb]] to pray.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Divided: The Armistice Regime, 1947-1967'', [[Raphael Israeli]], Routledge, 2002, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The winding road leading up to Mount Zion is known as Pope's Way (''Derekh Ha'apifyor''). It was paved in honor of the historic visit to Jerusalem of [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="Bar-Am"/&gt;

==Biblical references ==
[[File:Abendmahlssaal.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Room of the Last Supper]] on Mount Zion]]
The Tanakh reference to ''Har Tzion'' (Mount Tzion) that identifies its location is derived from the Psalm 48 composed by the sons of [[Korah]], i.e. Levites, as "the northern side of the city of the great king", which [[Radak]] interprets as the [[City of David]] "from the City of David, which is Zion (1 Kings 8:1-2; 2 Chron. 5:2)".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Eisenberg, ''The streets of Jerusalem: who, what, why'', Devora Publishing, 2006, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; 2 Samuel 5:7 also reads, "David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David," which identifies Mount Tzion as part of the City of David, and not an area outside today's Old City of Jerusalem. [[Rashi]] identifies the location as the source of "joy" mentioned in the Psalm as the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple Courtyard]], the location of atonement offerings in the northern part of the [[Temple Mount|Temple complex]].&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Davis, ed., ''The Book of Psalms'', Mesorah Publications, New York, 2001, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, Mount Zion is used metaphorically to refer to the heavenly Jerusalem, God’s holy, eternal city. Christians are said to have “ . . . come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven” (Hebrews 12:22-23 cf. Revelation 14:1).

Important sites on Mount Zion are [[Dormition Abbey]], [[King David's Tomb]] and the [[Room of the Last Supper]]. Most historians and archeologists today do not regard "David's Tomb" there to be the actual burial place of [[King David]]. The [[Chamber of the Holocaust]] (''Martef HaShoah''), the precursor of [[Yad Vashem]], is also located on Mount Zion. Another place of interest is the Catholic cemetery where [[Oskar Schindler]], a [[Righteous Among the Nations|Righteous Gentile]] who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], is buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=883869&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;title='A%20sign%20points%20to%20the%20grave%20'&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 |title=A sign points to the grave |publisher=Haaretz.com |last=Rubinstein |first=Danny |accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable burials in the [[Mount Zion Cemetery, Jerusalem|Protestant cemetery on Mt. Zion]] include a number of prominent individuals from the 19th and 20th centuries. These include explorers and archaeologists such as: [[Flinders Petrie]], Charles Frederick Tyrwhitt Drake, James Duncan, [[Clarence Stanley Fisher]], Charles Lambert and [[James Leslie Starkey]]; the architect [[Conrad Schick]]; and pioneers in the fields of medicine, education, religion, diplomacy and social services such as [[J. E. Hanauer|James Edward Hanauer]], Ernest Masterman, [[Hans Nicolajsen|John Nicholayson]], Paul Palmer, [[Max Sandreczky]], Johann Ludwig Schneller, [[Horatio Spafford|Horatio G. Spafford]], author of the hymn ''[[It Is Well with My Soul|It Is Well With My Soul]]''.  Also buried in the cemetery are G. Douglas Young, founder of [[Jerusalem University College]], and his wife Georgina (Snook) Young. The cemetery is also the final resting place for a number of soldiers who fought in the First World War, as well as members of the Palestinian Police who served under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate]]. Several persons buried here were killed in the [[King David Hotel bombing|bombing of the King David Hotel]] on the morning of 22 July 1946.

==Archaeology==
In 1874, an Englishman, Henry Maudsley, discovered a large segment of rock scarp and numerous ancient dressed stones on Mount Zion that were believed to be the base of Josephus's First Wall. Several of these stones were used to construct a retaining wall outside the main gate of the Bishop Gobat school (later known as the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and Jerusalem University College).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centuryone.org/essene.html Jerusalem's Essene Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norra Botkyrka''' (North Botkyrka) usually refers to the northern residential areas of [[Botkyrka Municipality]] near [[Stockholm]] in [[Sweden]].

Norra Botkyrka was until the 1970s an agricultural community with only  a few inhabitants consisting of a few large estates (Norsborg, Hallunda, Slagsta, Fittja and Alby) and a large protected area around the Lake Bornsjö which was and still is a reserve for the drinking water supply for the city of Stockholm. Within a few years during the 1970s, the municipalities of Stockholm and Botkyrka cooperated to build a "[[New town|New Town]]" for more than 30,000 inhabitants.

The idea of a new town concept for Norra Botkyrka was influenced by [[new towns in the United Kingdom]].

During archeological excavations prior to the building of the "New Town" there were found a number of rock carvings in the Slagsta area indicating that there was an agricultural population here already during the Bronze Age. During excavations conducted under the guidance of the Historic Museum of Stockholm there were found in the Hallunda area Bronze Age dwellings together with a number of bronze smelting hearths and ceramic remains from Central Europe showing that there must have been far reaching trading relations already this early.

Already from early historic times the trunkroad from Stockholm to the continent passed through Norra Botkyrka. There are now also four stations on the [[Stockholm Metro]] here: [[Norsborg]], [[Hallunda]], [[Alby, Botkyrka|Alby]] and [[Fittja]].

The area was made famous in the late 1990s through the local hip hop group called [[The Latin Kings (hip hop group)|The Latin Kings]] who often refers to this area in their lyrics. It is also known as one of the most multi-cultural places in Sweden with a majority of the population being first or second generation immigrants. Most of these originate from the [[Middle East]] with other significant groups from for example [[Turkey]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[former Yugoslavia]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Thus in the 1970s, the municipality of Botkyrka elected the first foreign born mayor in Sweden.

The '''Pampas''' (from the {{lang-qu|pampa}}, meaning "plain") are fertile [[South America]]n lowlands that cover more than {{convert|750000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and include the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], [[Santa Fe Province, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[Entre Ríos Province, Argentina|Entre Ríos]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]]; all of [[Uruguay]]; and the southernmost [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|State]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The vast plains are a [[natural region]], interrupted only by the low Ventana and Tandil hills, near [[Bahía Blanca]] and [[Tandil]] (Argentina), with a height of {{convert|1300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.

The climate is warm, with [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|600|to|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} that is more or less evenly distributed through the year, making the soils appropriate for [[agriculture]]. The area is also one of the distinct physiography provinces of the larger [[Paraná river|Paraná]]-[[Paraguay river|Paraguay]] Plain division.

==Climate==
{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina|Climate of Uruguay|Climate of Brazil}}

The climate of the Pampas is generally temperate, gradually giving away to a more [[subtropical climate]] in the north and to a [[semiarid climate]] on the western fringes (like [[San Luis Province]] and western [[La Pampa Province]]). Summer temperatures are more uniform than winter temperatures, generally ranging from {{convert|28|to|33|C|F}} during the day. However, most cities in the Pampas occasionally have high temperatures that push {{convert|38|C|F}}, as occurs when a warm, dry, northerly wind blows from southern [[Brazil]]. Autumn arrives gradually in March, and peaks in April and May. In April, highs range from {{convert|20|to|25|C|F}} and lows from {{convert|9|to|13|C|F}}. The first frosts arrive in mid-April in the south, and in late May or early June in the north.

Winters are generally mild, but cold waves still occur. Normal temperatures range from {{convert|12|to|19|C|F}} during the day, and from {{convert|1|to|6|C}} at night. With strong northerly winds, days of over {{convert|25|C}} can be recorded almost everywhere, and during cold waves, high temperatures can be only {{convert|6|C}}. Frost occurs everywhere in the Pampas, but it is much more frequent in the southwest than around the Parana and Uruguay Rivers. Temperatures under {{convert|&amp;minus;5|C}} can occur everywhere, but values of  {{convert|&amp;minus;10|C}} or lower are confined to the south and west. Snow never falls in the northernmost third and is rare and light elsewhere, except for exceptional events in which depths have reached {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}.

Springs are very variable; it is warmer than fall in most areas (especially in the west) but significantly colder along the Atlantic. Violent storms are more common as well as wide temperature variations: days of {{convert|35|C}} can give way to nights of under {{convert|5|C|F}} or even frost, all within only a few days.

Precipitation ranges from {{convert|1200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the northeast, to about {{convert|500|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the southern and western edges. In the west, it is highly seasonal, with some places recording averages of {{convert|120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} monthly in the summer, and only {{convert|20|mm|in|1}} monthly in the winter. The eastern areas have small peaks in the fall and in the spring, with relatively rainy summers and winters that are only slightly drier. However, where summer rain falls as short, heavy storms, winter rain falls mostly as cold drizzle and so the amount of rainy days is fairly constant. Very intense [[thunderstorm]]s are common in the spring and summer, and it has among the most frequent lightning and highest [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] cloud tops in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Zipser |first = E.

== Wildlife ==
Herbivores of the pampas are the [[pampas deer]], [[guanaco]], [[gray brocket]], [[Chacoan mara|dwarf mara]], [[plains viscacha]], [[Brazilian guinea pig]], [[southern mountain cavy]] and [[coypu]]. The biggest predator of the region is the [[Puma (genus)|puma]] followed by the [[maned wolf]], [[pampas fox]], [[geoffroy's cat]], [[lesser grison]] as well as the omnivorous [[white-eared opossum]] and [[Molina's hog-nosed skunk|molinas hog-nosed skunk]].

Bird species of the pampas are [[ruddy-headed goose]], [[pampas meadowlark]], [[hudsonian godwit]], [[maguari stork]], [[white-faced ibis]], [[white-winged coot]], [[southern screamer]], [[dot-winged crake]], [[curve-billed reedhaunter]], [[burrowing owl]] and the [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]].&lt;ref&gt;WWF ecoregions: https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0803&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN redlist: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/6786/0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN redlist: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/4819/0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN redlist: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22689353/0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN redlist: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/29620/0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery widths="240" heights="240"&gt;

== Vegetation ==
{{Regions of Argentina}}
Frequent [[wildfire]]s ensure that only small plants such as [[Poaceae|grasses]] flourish, and [[tree]]s are less common.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The dominant [[vegetation]] types are grassy [[prairie]] and grass [[steppe]] in which numerous species of the grass genus ''[[Stipa]]'' are particularly conspicuous. "Pampas grass" (''[[Cortaderia selloana]]'') is an iconic species of the Pampas. Vegetation typically includes perennial grasses and [[herb]]s. Different strata of grasses occur because of gradients of water availability.

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] divides the Pampas into three distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregions]]. The [[Uruguayan Savanna]] lies east of the [[Parana River]], and includes all of Uruguay, most of [[Entre Ríos Province, Argentina|Entre Ríos]] and [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] provinces in Argentina, and the southern portion of Brazil's state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The [[Humid Pampas]] include eastern Buenos Aires Province, and southern Entre Ríos Province. The [[Semi-arid Pampas|Semiarid Pampas]] includes western Buenos Aires Province and adjacent portions of Santa Fe, Córdoba, and La Pampa provinces. The Pampas are bounded by the drier Argentine espinal grasslands, which form a semicircle around the north, west, and south of the Humid Pampas.

Winters are cool to mild and summers are very warm and humid. Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year, but is a little heavier during the summer. Annual rainfall is heaviest near the coast and decreases gradually further inland. Rain during the late spring and summer usually arrives in the form of brief heavy showers and thunderstorms. More general rainfall occurs the remainder of the year as [[cold front]]s and storm systems move through. Although cold spells during the winter often send nighttime temperatures below freezing, [[snow]] is quite rare. In most winters, a few light snowfalls occur over inland areas.

Central Argentina boasts a successful agricultural business, with crops grown on the Pampas south and west of [[Buenos Aires]]. Much of the area is also used for [[cattle]] and more recently to grow vineyards in the [[Buenos Aires wines|Buenos Aires wine region]]. These farming regions are particularly susceptible to [[flooding]] during the thunderstorms. In the Pampas, the weather averages out to be {{convert|60|F|C}} year round.

==Immigration==

Starting in the 1840s but intensifying after the 1880s, European immigrants started to migrate to the Pampas, first as part of government-sponsored colonization schemes to settle the land and later as tenant farmers "working as either sharecroppers or as paid laborers for absentee landowners"&lt;ref&gt;Meade, Teresa A. History of modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. Wiley Blackwell, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to make a living for themselves.

However, many immigrants eventually moved to more permanent employment in cities, as industrialization picked up after the 1930s. As a result, Argentina's history of immigration in Buenos Aires Province is typically associated with cities and urban life, unlike in Entre Ríos Province and Santa Fe Province, where European immigration took on a more rural profile.

A '''pargana''' ({{lang-hi|परगना}}, {{lang-ur|پرگنہ}}, {{lang-bn|পরগণা}}, {{transl|hi|''parganā''}}), or '''parganah''', also spelt '''pergunnah''' during the time of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate]] period, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] times and [[British Raj]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924007471935/cu31924007471935_djvu.txt "A Catalogue of Manuscript and Printed Reports, Field Books, Memoirs, Maps ..." Vol. iv, "Containing the treaties, etc., relating to the states within the Bombay presidency"]&lt;/ref&gt; is a former administrative unit of the [[Indian subcontinent]], used primarily, but not exclusively, by the Muslim kingdoms.

''Parganas'' were introduced by the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the word is of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin. As a revenue unit, a pargana consists of several ''[[mouza]]s'', which are the smallest revenue units, consisting of one or more villages and the surrounding countryside. Subdivisions of parganas were called '''[[Mouza]]s''' (area, settlements).

Under the reign of [[Sher Shah Suri]], administration of parganas was strengthened by the addition of other officers, including a '''''shiqdar''''' (police chief), an '''''amin''''' or '''''munsif''''' (an arbitrator who assessed and collected revenue) and a '''''karkun''''' (record keeper).

==Mughal era==
In the 16th century the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] organised the empire into ''[[Subah (province)|subahs]]'' (roughly equivalent of state or province), which were further subdivided into [[sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkars]] (roughly the equivalent of districts), which were themselves organised into ''parganas'' (roughly the equivalent of district subdivisions such as tehsil). In the Mughal system, ''parganas'' served as the local administrative units of a ''sarkar''. Individual parganas observed common customs regarding land rights and responsibilities, which were known as the ''pargana dastur'', and each pargana had its own customs regarding rent, fees, wages, and weights and measures, known as the ''pargana nirikh''.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{citation

|chapter=Pargana
|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pargana
|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |year=2012 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pargana consisted of several '''tarafs''', which in their turn consisted of several villages plus some uninhabited mountain and forest land.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay Muir, ''The making of British India, 1756-1858'', University Press, 1915, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqs5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA289 p. 289]&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Raj==
As the [[British India|British]] expanded into former Mughal provinces, starting with [[Bengal]], they at first retained the ''pargana'' administration, but, under the Governorship of [[Charles Cornwallis]], enacted the [[Permanent Settlement]] of 1793, which abolished the ''pargana'' system in favour of the ''[[zamindar]]i'' system, in which ''zamindars'' were made the absolute owners of rural lands, and abolished the ''pargana dastur'' and ''pargana nirikh''. British administration consisted of [[districts of India|districts]], which were divided into [[tehsil]]s or [[taluk]]s. ''Parganas'' remained important as a geographical term, persisting in land surveys, village identification, court decrees,

==Post independence==
The ''pargana'' system persisted in several [[princely states]], including [[Tonk, India|Tonk]] and [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]]. Parganas disappeared almost completely after the independence of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, although the term lives on in place names, like the districts of [[North 24 Parganas]] and [[South 24 Parganas]] in India's [[West Bengal]] state.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

'''Plantmaps.com''' is reference  website that contains several interactive maps and tools to assist gardeners, botanists, farmers and horticulturalists.  By entering a ZIP code, users can find the USDA hardiness zone, first and last frost dates, heat zones, drought conditions and annual climatology for their area.

==Website tools==

===Interactive USDA Hardiness Zone map===
[[File:California-usda-hardiness-zones.png|frame|110px|right|alt=California USDA Hardiness Zone Map|California USDA Hardiness Zone Map&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-california-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=California USDA Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=Plantmaps |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
built using the google maps api, plantmaps.com has the only fully interactive [[USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] map available on the web.  In addition to plant hardiness zone map covering the [[continental United States]], there are detailed interactive hardiness zone maps for each individual state.  Plantmaps allows the user to locate their hardiness zone based on current US Postal Service ZIP codes.  The [[ZIP code]] search will zoom to the coverage area of the selected ZIP code.

===Hardiness Zone to ZIP code search===
Plantmaps allows other websites to embed the USDA hardiness zone to ZIP code search tool in their websites by adding an [[iframe]] widget to their site, allowing visitors to easily find their local hardiness zone.

===Plantmaps zones===
[[File:Georgia-plantmaps-hardiness-zones.png|frame|110px|right|alt=2009 Plantmaps Hardiness Zone Map for Georgia|2009 Plantmaps Hardiness Zone Map for Georgia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-georgia-plant-maps-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=Interactive Plantmaps 2009 Plant Hardiness Zone Map for Georgia |publisher=Plantmaps |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In response to the latency of the current official USDA hardiness zone map (produced in 1990 using data from 1974 to 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ |title=US National Arboretum |publisher=US National Arboretum |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; plantmaps has created a new hardiness zone map using historical data from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] that covers longer time periods and uses [[climate]] record data from as recently as 2009.  There is an updated plantmaps hardiness zones map for each individual state in the Continental US.

===Interactive first and last frost maps===
Using long term climatology data from the National Climatology Data Center, Plantmaps has created interactive average annual first frost and average annual last frost date maps for each individual state.  These maps break the average frost dates into 10 day/date increments.

===Interactive drought monitor===
Using [[shapefile]] data available from the National Drought Mitigation Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drought.unl.edu/dm/monitor.html |title=US Drought Monitor |publisher=National Drought Mitigation Center |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; plantmaps has created statewide interactive Drought Monitor Maps that are updated weekly with the latest drought monitor conditions throughout the US.

===Interactive Palmer Drought Index map===
Plantmaps provides an interactive [[Palmer Drought Index]] map for each state.  The interactive drought index maps use the latest data supplied by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and allows the map user to select and highlight the specific climate divisions in each state.

===Interactive ecoregions===
Plantmaps has created interactive versions of all available level IV [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] ecoregion maps that allow the user to zoom to identify each individual region. Ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions.htm |title=US EPA Ecoregions |publisher=EPA |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, level IV maps are available for all states except Arizona, California, Hawaii and Alaska.

===Interactive heat zone maps===
Plantmaps contains interactive heat zone maps for each state.  Heat zones display the average frequency of annual days where the temperature exceeds 86 degrees [[fahrenheit]].  Heat zones are useful for determining the survivability of specific plants and trees  in extreme temperature conditions.  It is also useful for determining suitability for plants and trees such as palm trees that require warm temperatures for growth.

===Interactive tree and plant distribution maps===
Plantmaps has interactive plant and tree distribution maps for 800 North American flora.  The distribution maps contain overlays of USDA hardiness zones for analysis of plant and tree range versus hardiness zone.

===Canada Hardiness Zone Map===
In January 2011, Plantmaps released an interactive Canada plant hardiness zone map using up to date climatology data from Canadian National Climate Data Archive.

'''Saneeya Hussain''' (13 August 1954 – 20 April 2005) was a [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[journalist]] and [[environmentalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C08%5C18%5Cstory_18-8-2008_pg12_5|title=Saneeya Hussain week brings environment journalists together|work=Daily Times|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married a [[Brazil]]ian man in 1998 and died in Brazil in 2005.

Saneeya began her career at [[MNJ Pakisan]] working for [[Javed Jabbar]] as a [[copywriter]] in 1978. In the mid-eighties, Saneeya edited [[The Star Weekend]] magazine. The paper was a platform for dissenting views. Banned columnists had to keep changing their names to continue writing, and the women’s movement that was so alive in those days found plenty of space in the magazines pages. She was also a member of the [[Shirkat Gah Collective]] which catalyzed the [[Women’s Action Forum]], the lobby group that so fiercely resisted the [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] regime. When “the red scribbles from upstairs” got unbearable, in early 1988, she left.

Saneeya moved on to join the World Conservation Union ([[IUCN]]) – and was also among one of the first Pakistanis to participate in people-to-people contact with Indian environmentalists. She also set up the pioneering [[Journalists Resource Centre]] that trained and encouraged journalists in environmental reporting.

Saneeyas involvement in the Pakistan's [[National Conservation Strategy]] (NCS) drafted at that time included the path-breaking [[NCS Bulletin]] (later ''The Way Ahead'' magazine), and its Urdu counterpart, [[Jareeda]], edited by [[Obaidullah Baig]].

The '''Speaker''' is the presiding officer of the [[Legislative Assembly of Montserrat|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Montserrat]]. The Speaker is elected by MPs, and does not have to be an Assembly member.&lt;ref name=IH&gt;Ian Hendry &amp; Susan Dickson (2011) ''British Overseas Territories Law'', Bloomsbury Publishing, p237&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Deputy Speaker, who is elected by MPs from amongst their own numbers, although they cannot also be a member of the cabinet.&lt;ref name=IH/&gt;

A '''table''' or '''tableland''' is a [[butte]], flank of a mountain, or [[mountain]], that has a flat [[summit|top]].  

This landform has numerous names in addition to "table", including:
*[[Tuya]]
*[[Tepui]]
*[[Mesa]]
*[[Potrero (landform)|Potrero]]
*[[Butte]]
*[[Plateau]]
*[[Fluvial terrace|Terrace]]
*Table
**Table hill
**Table-topped hill
**Table mountain
**Tableland

==Description==
The term "flat" is relative when speaking of tables, and often the naming or identification of a table (or table hill or mountain) is based on the appearance of the terrain feature from a distance or from below it.  An example is [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde, Colorado]], where the "flat top" of the mountain is both rolling terrain and cut by numerous deep canyons and arroyos, but whose rims appear quite flat from almost all directions, terminating in cliffs.

This article details the use of '''[[telephone number]]s in [[Austria]]'''.

There are no standard lengths for either area codes or subscriber numbers in [[Austria]], meaning that some subscriber numbers may be as short as three digits. Larger towns have shorter area codes permitting longer subscriber numbers in that area. Some examples:

*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Telering was bought by T-Mobile in 2005. As of 2006, Telering uses the network-infrastructure of T-Mobile. As a special requirement of the European commission, many of the former transmitters and frequencies previously operated by Telering were given to Orange and Drei.
*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; BoB is a discount service of A1. yesss! was a discount service of Orange, now sold to A1. Eety is a discount service of Orange (now 3). 

Due to [[Mobile number portability|number portability]], the code is not an accurate way to determine the provider of a given phone number. The providers assign only in exceptional cases (special sort of custom numbers, more expensive) non-existing numbers with a different prefix, and this is handled similarly to porting an existing number from the desired network. However, the providers still have administrative sovereignty over their own prefixes.

'''Telephone numbers in the [[Philippines]]''' follow an open [[telephone numbering plan]] and an [[open dialling plan|open]] [[dial plan]]. Both plans are regulated by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]], an attached agency under the [[Department of Information and Communications Technology (Philippines)|Department of Information and Communications Technology]] (DICT).

The Philippines is assigned an international dialling code of '''63''' by [[ITU-T]]. Telephone numbers are fixed at seven digits, with area codes fixed at one, two, or three digits (a six-digit system was used until the mid-1990s; four to five digits were used in the countryside). Mobile phone numbers are always 10 digits (three digits for the service provider, plus a seven-digit number).

When making long-distance calls in the Philippines, the prefix '''0''' for domestic calls and '''00''' for international calls are used.

==Fixed-line area codes==
Philippine area codes for fixed-line or [[landline]] telephones are fixed at two digits, excluding [[Metro Manila]], the province of [[Rizal]] and the towns and cities of [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] in [[Bulacan]], [[Bacoor]] in [[Cavite]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], which use the area code '''2'''. Some smaller carriers concentrated within a specific geographic area may issue four- or five-digit area codes, but these are being phased out in favour of the standard two-digit area codes.

Occasionally, a particular area may change area codes. For example, the City of [[Bacoor]] in [[Cavite]] has been included in the geographical coverage area of area code '''2''' per the National Telecommunications Commission's Memorandum Order No. 08-09-2011, although almost all fixed-lines in the city still use the old '''46''' area code due to the poor compliance of PLDT and Globe to the said memorandum order. PLDT's response to the memorandum order is the release of its "Call All Manila SIM", an exclusive wireless landline service for Bacoor residents, however the Barangay Molino VII (Sitio Gawaran) and Sitio Malipay in Molino IV now used area code '''2'''.

Sometimes area codes are shared by a number of local government entities to maximise their use. Some area codes are shared by multiple [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], as is the case for former sub-provinces like [[Guimaras]] and [[Iloilo]]; newly carved provinces like [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]]; or provinces with small populations like [[Marinduque]] and [[Quezon]]. In extreme cases, area codes are shared across an [[List of islands of the Philippines|island]] like in [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Samar Island|Samar]], or even entire [[Regions of the Philippines|region]]s, such as with the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]]. In order to identify the call's point of origin, the three-digit telephone exchange prefix is checked.

Since the Philippines employs an open dial plan, telephone numbers dialled within a given area code do not require the area code, excluding calls made from mobile phones or pay phones. When dialling other area codes, the domestic long distance access prefix '''0''' is added, but when dialling from overseas, the domestic prefix is not included. As such, a typical telephone number in Metro Manila and Rizal would look like this:

*Within Metro Manila, Rizal and municipalities of Obando, Bacoor and San Pedro: 1234567
*Outside Metro Manila, Rizal and municipalities of Obando, Bacoor and San Pedro: 02-1234567
*Overseas calls: +63-2-1234567

Areas are grouped into seven broad areas determining the first digit of a given area code. These areas and their accompanying area codes are listed below:

==Mobile phone area codes==
[[Mobile phone]] area codes are three digits long and always start with the number 9, although recently new area codes have been issued with 8 as the starting digit, particularly for VOIP phone numbers. However, the area code indicates the ''service provider'' and not necessarily a geographic region. Unlike fixed-line telephones, the long-distance telephone dialling format is always observed when using a mobile phone. Therefore, mobile phone numbers always have the format "+63 (9957867765) xxx-xxxx" for international callers and "0(9957867765) xxx-xxxx" for domestic callers.

Some of the first area codes to be assigned for mobile phones were 912 for Mobiline/Piltel, 915 for Islacom, 917 for [[Globe Telecom]], 918 for [[Smart Communications]], and 973 for [[Express Telecom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://networkprefix.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://techphil.altervista.org/2015/06/mobile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://philippinenumbers.techphil.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510083156/http://philippinenumbers.techphil.net/ |date=2017-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As service began growing rapidly since the 1990s, new codes have been added to meet demand as existing codes have since been exhausted. Newer codes often come immediately after the last code exhausted, but this might not be the case if the next code is already in use. 965/966 are the latest codes (Feb 2018) and are used for Globe &amp; TM.

Areas codes are grouped by provider with no single contiguous block of codes for a single provider. The companies and their respective area codes are listed below:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">A '''top-lit updraft gasifier''' (also known as a '''TLUD''') is a [[micro-kiln]] used to produce charcoal, especially [[biochar]], and heat for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biochar-Producing Stoves to Benefit Climate, Health, and Soil|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves|publisher=International Biochar Initiative|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TLUD [[pyrolysis|pyrolyzes]] organic material, including wood or manure, and uses a reburner to eliminate volatile byproducts of pyrolization. The process leaves mostly [[carbon]] as a residue, which can be incorporated into soil to create [[terra preta]].

Dr Thomas B Reed and the Norwegian architect Paal Wendelbo independently developed the working idea of a TLUD gasifier in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TLUD|url=http://www.drtlud.com/tlud-technology/history/|publisher=Dr TLUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TLUD gasifier takes it further from a [[rocket stove]] in more efficient way of smoke-free, highly efficient combustion of the fuel.

== The Technology ==

A TLUD gasifier stove &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioChar Foundation|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly constructed with two concentric cylindrical containers.

The inner cylinder is the fuel pot. The fuel pot has holes in the base. These holes are the primary air inlet. The fuel pot also has holes on the neck, like the skirt, serving as a secondary air inlet.

The outer cylinder has holes near the bottom on the sides. During combustion, air enters these holes, either by natural air draft or forced with a DC fan depending on requirement and construction model.

Any biomass with less than 20% water content can be used as fuel. The user fills the fuel pot up to the neck, just below the secondary air inlet holes. The user ignites the top layer of fuel for the pyrolysis to start. Air then flows in through the primary and secondary air inlets. The primary inlet helps the draft of pyrolysed wood gas flow up.

The secondary air inlet blows hot air by the time it travels around the fuel pot. The secondary inlet above the fuel layer helps burn the wood gas. 

YouTube has many instructional videos, with further explanation on other websites.

Although '''tropical Africa''' is mostly familiar to the [[Western world|West]] for its [[rainforest|rainforests]], this [[biogeographic realm|ecozone]] of [[Africa]] is far more diverse. While the tropics are thought of as regions with warm to hot moist climates caused by [[latitude]] and the [[tropical rain belt]], the [[geology]] of areas, particularly mountain chains, and geographical relation to continental and regional scale winds impact the overall parts of areas {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, also, making the tropics run from arid to humid in West Africa. The area has very serious [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Zinkina J., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]] [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=360&amp;Itemid=1 Explosive Population Growth in Tropical Africa: Crucial Omission in Development Forecasts (Emerging Risks and Way Out).

==Overview==
{{Multiple issues|{{tone|date=July 2017}}
{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}}}
[[Tropical rainforest]]s are tropical moist forests of semi-deciduous varieties distributed across nine West African countries. Institute for Sea Research conducted a temperature record dating back to 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="coast"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/centralafrica/africa_proposal.html|title=Study of Land-Use and Deforestation In Central African Tropical Forest Using low Resolution SAR Satellite Imagery|accessdate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several conservation and development [[demographic]] settings are such that the most loss of rain forests has occurred in countries of higher population growth. Lack of dependable data and survey information in some countries has made the account of areas of unbroken forest and/or under land use change and their relation to economic indicators difficult to ascertain. Hence, the amount and rate of [[deforestation in Africa]] are less known than other regions of tropics..

The term [[deforestation]] refers to the complete obstruction of forest [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover for means of agriculture, plantations, cattle-ranching, and other non-forest fields. Other forest use changes for example are forest disintegration (changing the spatial continuity and creating a mosaic of forest blocks and other land cover types), and dreadful conditions (selective logging of woody species for profitable purposes that affects the forest subfloor and the biodiversity).&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; The general meaning to the term deforestation is linked not only to the value system but the type of measurement designed to assess it. Thus, the same interpretations of deforestation cause noticeable changes in the estimate of forests cleared.

One reason for forest depletion is to grow cash crops. Nine West African countries depend on cash crop exports. Products like gum, [[copal]], [[rubber]], [[cola nuts]], and [[palm oil]] provide rather steady income revenue for the West African countries. Land use change spoils entire habitats with the forests.  Converting forests into timber is another cause of deforestation. Over decades, the primary forest product was commercial [[timber]]. Urbanized countries account for a great percentage of the world's wood consumption, that increased greatly between 1950 and 1980. Simultaneously, preservation measures were reinforced to protect European and American forests.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; Economic growth and growing environmental protection in industrialized European countries made request for tropical hardwood become strong in West Africa. In the first half of the 1980s, an annual forest loss of 7,200 square kilometers was note down along the [[Gulf of Guinea]], a figure equivalent to 4-5 per cent of the total remaining rain forest area.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; By 1985, 72 per cent of West Africa's rainforests had been transformed into fallow lands and an additional 9 per cent had been opened up by timber exploitation.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;

Tropical timber became a viable choice to European wood following World War II, as trade with East European countries stop and timber noticeably became sparse in western and southern Europe. Despite  efforts to promote lesser known timber species use, the market continued to focus on part of the usable timber obtainable. West Africa was prone to selective harvesting practices; while conservationists blamed  the timber industry and the farmers for felling trees, others believe rain forest destruction is connected to the problem of fuel wood.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; The contribution of fuel wood consumption to tree stock decline in Africa is believed to be significant. It is generally believed that [[firewood]] provides 75 per cent of the energy used in sub-Sahara Africa.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; With the high demand, the consumption of wood for fuel exceeds the renewal of [[forest cover]].

The rain forests which remain in West Africa now merely are how they were hardly 30 years ago. In Guinea, Liberia and the Ivory Coast, there is almost no primary forest cover left unscathed; in Ghana the situation is much worse, and nearly all the rain forest are cut down. [[Guinea-Bissau]] loses 200 to 350&amp;nbsp;km² of forest yearly, Senegal 500&amp;nbsp;km² of wooded [[savanna]], and Nigeria 6,000,050,000 of both. Liberia exploits 800&amp;nbsp;km² of forests each year. Extrapolating from present rates of loss, [[botanist]] Peter Raven pictures that the majority of the world's moderate and smaller rain forests (such as in Africa,) could be ruined in forty years. Tropical Africa is about 18% of the world total covering 20 million km² of land in West and Central Africa.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; The region has been facing deforestation in various degrees of intensity throughout the recent decades. The actual rate of deforestation varies from one country to another and accurate data does not exist yet. Recent estimates show that the annual pace of deforestation in the region can vary from 150&amp;nbsp;km² in [[Gabon]] to 2900&amp;nbsp;km² in [[Cote d'Ivoire]].  Remaining tropical forest still cover major areas in Central Africa but are abridged by patches in West Africa.

The [[African Timber Organization]] member countries (ATO) eventually recognized the cooperation between rural people and their forest environment. Customary law gives residents the right to use trees for firewood, fell trees for construction, and collect of forest products and rights for hunting or fishing and grazing or clearing of forests for maintenance agriculture. Other areas are called "protected forests", which means that uncontrolled clearings and unauthorized logging are forbidden. After [[World War II]], commercial exploitation increased until no West African forestry department was able of making the law. By comparison with rain forests in other places of the world in 1973, Africa showed the greatest infringement though in total volume means, African timber production accounted just one third compared to that of Asia.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; The difference was due to the variety of trees in Africa forests and the demand for specific wood types in Europe.

[[Forestry]] regulations in east Africa were first applied by colonial governments, but they were not strict enough to fill forest exploitation. It wasn’t until the 1970s that the inadequate performance of forest regulations was recognized. The Tropical Forestry Action Plan was conceived in 1987 by the [[World Resources Institute]] in cooperation with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) and the [[World Bank]] with hopes of halting tropical forest destruction.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; In its bid to stress forest conservation and development, the World Bank provided $111,103 million in building countries, especially in Africa, to help in developing long range forest conservation and management programs meant for ending deforestation.

==Region protection==

Many African countries are in economic and political change, overwhelmed by conflict, making various movements of forest exploitation to maintained forest management and production more and more complicated. 
 
Forest legislation of ATO member countries aim to promote the balanced utilization of the forest domain and of wildlife and fishery in order to increase the input of the forest sector to the economic, social, cultural and scientific development of the country.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;

==Habitats==

The tropical environment is rich in terms of bio-diversity. Tropical African forest is 18 per cent of the world total and covers over 3.6 million square kilometers of land in West, East and Central Africa. This total area can be subdivided to 2.69 million square kilometers (74%) in Central Africa, 680,000 square kilometers (19%) in West Africa, and 250,000 square kilometers (7%) in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; In [[West Africa]], a chain of rain forests up to 350&amp;nbsp;km long extends from the eastern border of Sierra Leone all the way to Ghana. In Ghana the forest zone gradually dispels near the [[Volta river]], following a 300&amp;nbsp;km stretch of [[Dahomey]] savanna gap. The rain forest of West Africa continues from east of Benin through southern Nigeria and officially ends at the border of [[Cameroon]] along the [[Sanaga river]].

Semi-deciduous rainforests in West Africa began at the fringed coastline of Guinea Bissau (via Guinea) and run all the way through the coasts of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, [[Ghana]], continuing through Togo, [[Benin]], Nigeria and Cameroon, and ending at the [[Congo Basin]]. Rain forests such as these are the richest, oldest, most prolific, and most complex systems on earth, are dying, and in turn are upsetting the delicate ecological balance. This may disturb global hydrological cycles, release vast amounts of green house gases into the atmosphere, and lessen the planet's ability to store excess [[carbon]].

The rain forest vegetation of the Guinea-Congolian transition area, extending from Senegal to western [[Uganda]] are constituted of two main types: The semi-deciduous rain forest characterized by a large number of trees whose leaves are left during dry season. It appears in areas where the dry period (rainfall below about 100&amp;nbsp;mm) reach three months. Then, the evergreen or the semi-evergreen rain forest, climatically adapted to somewhat more humid conditions than the semi-deciduous type and is usually there in areas where the dry period is shorter than two months. This forest is usually richer in [[legumes]] and variety of species and its maximum development is around the [[Bight of Biafra]], from [[Eastern Nigeria]] to Gabon, and with some large patches leaning to the west from Ghana to Liberia and to the east of Zaïre-Congo basin.

Judging against rain forest areas in other continents, most of the African rainforest is rather dry and receives between 1600 and 2000&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall per year. Areas receiving more rain than this mainly are in coastal areas. The circulation of rainfall throughout the year remains less than other rain forest regions in the world. The average monthly rainfall in nearly the whole region remains under 100&amp;nbsp;mm throughout the year. The variety of the African rain forest flora is also less than the other rain forests. This lack of flora has been credited to several reasons such as the gradual infertility since the [[Miocene]], severe dry periods during [[Quaternary]], or the [[refuge theory]] of the cool and dry climate of tropical Africa during the last severe ice age of about 18000 years ago.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;

A recent vegetation map of Africa published by [[UNESCO]] and the main vegetation features of Central African rain forest divides the area into the following categories:
. This type of forest shows no substantial seasonal behavior. At the border of the central basin is the mesophilous semi-deciduous forest that is mixed with deciduous and evergreen trees in the upper-stratum, unusual age distribution, continuous shrub stratum at the lower canopy, and a more marked seasonality.

===Secondary forests===
Beyond the forest reserves, a great deal of the remaining part of [[Central Africa]]n rain forest on well drained soils are old secondary forests. There also exist younger secondary forests dominated by parasol trees, Musanga ceropiodes, the most abundant and characteristic secondary forest in Africa. Such trees are found in upper layers of secondary regrowth along the old road networks in Zaïre . The dispersal of secondary forests are important in regional study as they show different floristic and faunistic characteristics than primary forests, and represent centers of human activity and history of land-use changes.

===Non-forest===
The nart comprises degraded lands, irregular agriculture and plantations., and deforested lands and fragmented forests. Plantations have a geometrical lay-out with uniform canopy-cover and follow a different [[vegetation]] cycle as their adjacent features. The areas are located near the transportation networks and are subjugated by economic tree crops such as [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], [[rubber]], [[oil palm]]s and [[Kola nut|Kola]].

===Swamp and flooded forests===
[[Swamp]] forest, inundated forests in flood plains, and riparian forests are found here. Swamp forests are found widely in the [[Zaïre]] basin and throughout the Congo basin where conditions are appropriate. In most areas, swamp forests is like in appearance to rain forest and the tallest trees attain a height of 45 m. The main canopy is often irregular and open, sometimes resembling the secondary forests caused by disturbance The forest has a variety in endemic [[flora]] but it is inadequate in species. Recently, large areas of swamp forests have been cleared for rice farming. Swamp forests in Zaïre, Congo and other lowland forests have seasonal variations that to the level of forest inundation.

==Conservation==
In colonial rule, governments planned only one way to promote conservation. In Nigeria for example, the government introduced forest protection regulatory measures by classification of some forest areas, licensing requirements, and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders. Ghana issued classification permits to firms and executed log export restrictions. The Ivory Coast and Cameroon introduced log supply quotas, as Liberia did.

This trade product is "raw" lumber. Trees native to the West African rainforest from which timber is exported include limba, emeri, obeche and [[Bilinga (wood)|opepe]] as well as the exotic species gmelina, teak, and pinus.

==Fauna==

The Tropical African rainforest has rich [[fauna]], commonly smaller mammal species rarely seen by humans. New species continually are being found. For instance, in late 1988 an unknown shrub species was discovered on the shores of the Nedian River in Western Cameroon. Since then many species have become extinct. However, undisturbed rainforests are some of the richest habitats of animal species. Today, undisturbed rainforests are remnant, but rare. Timber extraction not only changes the edifice of the forest, it affects the tree species spectrum by removing economically important species and terminates other species in the process. The species that compose African rainforests are of different evolutionary ages because of the contraction and expansion of the rainforest in response to global climatic fluctuations.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;:by aniketh 

[[Plant Resources of Tropical Africa|In Tropical Africa about 8,500 plant species have been noted and 403 species of orchids note down]]. The [[pygmy hippopotamus]], the [[giant forest hog]], the water chevortain and a number of [[insectivores]], rodents and bats, tree frogs, bird species inhabit the area. These species, along with a diversity of fruits and insects, make a special habitat. Top canopy monkey species, the [[red colobus]], and others, already have disappeared from much of Tropical Africa's forest.

Species unfamiliar to the changes in forest structure for industrial use might not survive.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt; If timber use continues and an increasing amount of farming occurs, it could lead to the mass killing of animal species. The home of nearly half of the world's animals and plant species are tropical rainforests. The rain forests provide possible economic resource for over-populated developing countries. Despite the stated need to save the West African forests, there are divergence in how to work. In April 1992, countries with some of the largest surviving tropical rain forests banned a rainforest protection plan proposed by the British government. It aimed at finding endangered species of tropical trees in order to control trade in them. Experts estimate that the rainforest of West Africa, at the present trend of deforestation, may disappear by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;

Africa’s rainforest, like many others emergent in the world, has a special significance to the [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous cultures]] who have occupied them for millennia.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;

==Recent news: history of tropical Africa==

In early 2007, scientists created an entirely new proxy to determine annual mean air temperature on land—based on molecules from the cell membrane of soil inhabiting bacteria. Recently, Scientists from the NIOZ, [[Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research]] conducted a temperature record dating back to 25,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="News"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/nofs-muc032307.php|title= During the last ice age, the land climate in tropical Africa|accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In concord with the German colleague of the [[University of Bremen]], this detailed record shows the history of land temperatures based on the molecular fossils of soil bacteria. When applying this to the outflow core of the [[Congo River]], the core contained eroded land material and microfossils from marine algae. That concluded that the land environment of tropical Africa was cooled more than the bordering Atlantic Ocean during the last ice-age. Since the Congo River drains a large part of tropical central Africa, the land derived material gives an integrated signal for a very large area. These findings further enlighten in natural disparities in climate and the possible costs of a warming earth on precipitation in central Africa.&lt;ref name="News"/&gt;

Scientists discovered a way to measure sea temperature—based on organic molecules from algae growing off the surface layer of the Ocean. These organisms acclimatize the molecular composition of their cell membranes to ambient temperature to sustain regular physiological properties. If such molecules sink to the sea floor and are buried in sediments where [[oxygen]] does not go through, they can be preserved for thousands of years. The ratios between the different molecules from the algal cell membrane can  approximate the past temperature of the sea surface. The new “proxy” used in this sediment core  obtained both a continental and a sea surface temperature record. In comparison, both records shows that ocean surface and land temperatures behaved differently during the past 25,000 years. During the last ice age, African temperatures were 21&amp;nbsp;°C, about 4&amp;nbsp;°C lower than today, while the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] was only about 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C cooler. Lead author Johan Weijers and his colleagues arrived that the land-sea temperature difference has by far the largest influence on continental rainfall. The relation of air pressure to temperature strongly determines this factor. During the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], the land climate in tropical Africa was drier than it is now, whereas it favors the growth of a lush rainforest.&lt;ref name="News"/&gt;

'''Zagreb County''' ({{lang-hr|Zagrebačka županija}}) is a [[counties of Croatia|county]] in central [[Croatia]]. It surrounds – but does not contain – the nation's capital [[Zagreb]], which is a separate territorial unit. For that reason, it is often nicknamed "Zagreb ring". According to the 2011 census, the county has 317,606 inhabitants. 

The Zagreb County once included the city of Zagreb, but in 1997 they separated, when the City was given a special status.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Narodne novine]]'', br. 62/01, 125/08&lt;/ref&gt; Although separated from Zagreb City County both administratively and territorially, it still remains closely linked with it.

Zagreb County borders on [[Krapina-Zagorje County]], the city of Zagreb, [[Varaždin County]], and [[Koprivnica-Križevci County]] in the north, [[Bjelovar-Bilogora County]] in the east, [[Sisak-Moslavina County]] in the south and [[Karlovac County]] in the southwest.

[[Zagreb International Airport|Franjo Tuđman Airport]] is located on the territory of Zagreb County, the biggest and most important airport in the country.

== Administrative divisions ==

Zagreb County is divided into 9 towns and 25 municipalities.
