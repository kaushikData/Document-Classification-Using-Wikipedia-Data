'''''A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest Students''''' is ''The Templeton National Report on Acceleration'', a report which was published in 2004 and edited by Nicholas Colangelo, Susan G. Assouline, and [[Miraca Gross]]. This report argues for the [[academic acceleration]] of qualified [[gifted]] and talented students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/12/AR2006061201009_pf.html | accessdate = July 26, 2008 | work=The Washington Post | title=Fast Learners Benefit From Skipping Grades, Report Concludes}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the results of studies on outcomes of accelerating and not accelerating high-achieving students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saving the Smart Kids |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,995204,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the evidence that acceleration is a beneficial practice when implemented correctly, many teachers and parents are reluctant to accelerate students.  The report presents the research on acceleration in an effort to increase the number of students who have access to acceleration. &lt;br/&gt;
The report is divided into two parts: Volume I, which summarizes the research and provides an introduction to acceleration as an academic intervention for gifted students; and Volume II, an edited volume that provides a more detailed overview of relevant research studies.

The success of  ''A Nation Deceived'' led to the creation of the ''Acceleration Institute'' (formerly the Institute for Research and Policy on Acceleration), which is dedicated to the study and support of educational acceleration for academically talented students.

''[[A Nation Empowered]]'', a follow-up to ''A Nation Deceived'', was published in 2015. It expands upon findings of the original report and incorporates research that has emerged since publication of ''A Nation Deceived''. 

==Contents==
The first three of its "20 Most Important Points from Volume II" are:&lt;ref&gt;''A Nation Deceived Volume I, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

#Acceleration is the most effective curriculum intervention for gifted children.
#For bright students, acceleration has long-term beneficial effects, both academically and socially.
#Acceleration, especially in the form of [[grade skipping]], is a virtually cost-free intervention.

Among other points, the report also indicates that:

* Gifted students are frequently better matched with their cognitive peers (older peers) rather than age peers.
* Above-level testing is useful in identifying candidates for acceleration.  Above-level testing is defined as testing that is two or more grade levels above a student’s current placement.  For example, a fourth grader might take a test intended for sixth graders. Above-level testing helps eliminate the [[ceiling effect (statistics)|ceiling effect]] that often makes it difficult to determine appropriate placement for high-ability students.
* Early entry to kindergarten benefits some gifted children both academically and socially.
* Skipping two or more years of school is academically and socially beneficial for highly gifted students.
* Although significant evidence for the validity of acceleration exists, many educators remain negative about the practice.

[[File:LAR-Konferanse 06 Foto Lars-Andreas Kvisle - forsamling 5.jpg|thumb|Conference on [[medicament]]-assisted rehabilitation in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]]]
An '''academic conference''' or '''symposium''' is a [[:wikt:conference|conference]] for [[researcher]]s (not necessarily [[academic]]s) to present and discuss their work. Together with [[academic journal|academic]] or [[scientific journal]]s, conferences provide an important channel for exchange of information between researchers.

== Overview ==
[[File:America’s Got Regulatory Science Talent 2017 Competition (02176) (34031793065).jpg|thumb|Presentations form the core of most conferences]]
Conferences are usually composed of various [[presentation]]s. They tend to be short and concise, with a time span of about 10 to 30 minutes; [[presentation]]s are usually followed by a [[discussion]]. The work may be bundled in written form as [[academic paper]]s and [[publish]]ed as the conference [[proceedings]].

Usually a conference will include [[keynote speaker]]s (often, scholars of some standing, but sometimes individuals from outside academia). The keynote lecture is often longer, lasting sometimes up to an hour and a half, particularly if there are several keynote speakers on a [[Convention panel|panel]].

[[File:Panel Discussion (19307220363).jpg|thumb|Panel discussions are intended to bring multiple perspectives on a topic]]
In addition to presentations, conferences also feature [[panel discussion]]s, [[Round table (discussion)|round table]]s on various issues, [[Poster session|poster sessions]] and workshops. Some conferences take more interactive formats, such as the participant driven "[[unconference]]" or various conversational formats.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Hohl, M., &amp; Sweeting, B. (Eds.). (2015). Composing conferences. Special issue of Constructivist Foundations, 11(1). Retrieved from http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/journal/11/1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presentations ===
[[File:PhUSE Computational Science Symposium 2016 (26133831630).jpg|thumb|Presentations may be [[Plenary session]]s designed for all attendees (shown here) or breakout sections designed for smaller groups.]]
Prospective [[wikt:presenter|presenters]] are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation, which will be reviewed before the presentation is accepted for the meeting. Some disciplines require presenters to submit a paper of about 6–15 pages, which is [[peer review]]ed by members of the [[program committee]] or referees chosen by them.

In some disciplines, such as English and other languages, it is common for presenters to read from a prepared script. In other disciplines such as the [[Science|sciences]], presenters usually base their talk around a visual presentation that displays key figures and research results.

=== Size ===

A large meeting will usually be called a conference, while a smaller is termed a workshop. They might be ''single track'' or ''multiple track'', where the former has only one session at a time, while a multiple track meeting has several parallel sessions with speakers in separate rooms speaking at the same time.

The larger the conference, the more likely it is that [[Academic publishing|academic publishing houses]] may set up displays. Large conferences also may have a career and job search and interview activities.

At some conferences, social or entertainment activities such as tours and receptions can be part of the program. Business meetings for [[learned society|learned societies]] or [[interest group]]s can also be part of the conference activities.

=== Types ===

Academic conferences typically fall into three categories:
* the themed conference, small conferences organized around a particular topic;
* the general conference, a conference with a wider focus, with sessions on a wide variety of topics. These conferences are often organized by regional, national, or international [[learned society|learned societies]], and held annually or on some other regular basis.
* the professional conference, large conferences not limited to academics but with academically related issues.

=== Infrastructure ===
[[File:PhUSE Computational Science Symposium 2016 C 1089 (26340497691).jpg|thumb|Larger conferences may have exhibits and displays for participants between sessions]]
Increasing numbers of [[amplified conference]]s are being provided which exploit the potential of WiFi networks and mobile devices in order to enable remote participants to contribute to discussions and listen to ideas.

Advanced technology for meeting with any yet  unknown person in a conference is performed by active RFID that may indicate wilfully identified and relatively located upon approach via electronic tags.

==Organizing an academic conference==
Conferences are usually organized either by a scientific society or by a group of researchers with a common interest. Larger meetings may be handled on behalf of the scientific society by a [[Professional Conference Organiser]] or PCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9u11fI4Nc8C&amp;pg=PT321&amp;dq=pco+conferences |title=Conferences and Conventions: a global industry by Tony Rogers |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meeting is announced by way of a Call For Papers (CFP) or a Call For Abstracts, which is sent to prospective presenters and explains how to submit their abstracts or papers. It describes the broad theme and lists the meeting's topics and formalities such as what kind of [[abstract (summary)]] or paper has to be submitted, to whom, and by what [[Time limit|deadline]]. A CFP is usually distributed using a mailing list or on specialized online services. Contributions are usually submitted using an online [[Paper management|abstract or paper management]] service.

Increasingly, there has been a call for more sustainable academic conferencing, as flying to and consumption at conferences is one of the largest components of an academics environmental footprint&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grémillet|first=David|date=2008-10-30|title=Paradox of flying to meetings to protect the environment|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7217/full/4551175a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=455|issue=7217|pages=1175–1175|doi=10.1038/4551175a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, few conferences have enacted practices to reduce their environmental impact, despite guidelines being widely available&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Butt|first2=Nathalie|last3=Chauvenet|first3=Alienor|last4=Plein|first4=Michaela|last5=Stringer|first5=Martin|last6=Chadès|first6=Iadine|date=2017-08-07|title=Academic conferences urgently need environmental policies|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0296-2|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0296-2|issn=2397-334X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An analysis of academic conferences taking place in 2016, showed that only 4% of 116 conferences sampled offered carbon offset options and only 9% of these conferences implemented any form of action to their reduce environmental impact&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

[[Serbia]] inherited the academic grading system of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The grading process uses an absolute achievement scale to determine the grade of a student.

==Primary and secondary school level==
In [[Elementary school|elementary]] schools and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools, a five-point grading scale is used:

* 5 (excellent)
* 4 (very good)
* 3 (good)
* 2 (sufficient) is the lowest passing grade.
* 1 (insufficient) is the lowest possible grade, and the failing one.

In addition, descriptive grades are used to grade a student's conduct and religious or civic education. Religious or civic education grades are not counted in the arithmetic mean. In elementary schools conduct grades also are not counted in the arithmetic meanwhile in secondary schools they are.

The student's marks in each subject are averaged at the end of every semester and final grades are determined by the following ranges:&lt;ref name="ZAKON
O OSNOVNOJ ŠKOLI"&gt;[http://www.paragraf.rs/propisi/zakon_o_osnovnoj_skoli.html ZAKON O OSNOVNOJ ŠKOLI]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 5 (excellent) is given for an average of 4.50 to 5.00;
* 4 (very good) is given for an average of 3.50 to 4.49;
* 3 (good) is given for an average of 2.50 to 3.49;
* 2 (sufficient) is given for an average of 2.00 to 2.49;
* 1 (insufficient) is given if the student does not have grade of at least 2 in each topic of the course.

At the end of the school year, final grades for each subject are calculated from those given at the end of each semester. The student's overall achievement is assessed by averaging his grades in all subjects and then applying the above ranges.

==Tertiary (university) level==
At universities, a six-point grading scale is used:
* 10 (excellent – outstanding),
* 9 (excellent),
* 8 (very good),
* 7 (good),
* 6 (sufficient, passing) is the lowest passing grade,
* 5 (not sufficient, not passing) is the failing grade.

Requirements for "a minimum achieved percentage at all stages of exam taking (written, practical, oral) in order to achieve corresponding grade" is regulated by the statute of each individual institution, but general rules apply:

{|class="wikitable"
!  Grade
!  Humanities, Medicine, Law, etc.  
!  Science, Engineering, Mathematics, etc.
|-
| 10
| 91-100% 
| 96-100%
|-
| 9
| 81-90% 
| 86-95%
|-
| 8
| 71-80%
| 76-85%
|-
| 7
| 61-70% 
| 66-75%
|-
| 6
| 51-60%
| 56-65%
|-
| 5
| 0-50%
| 0-55%
|}
A student's average for all subjects is calculated to two decimal places (e.g. 9.54).

In practice, the mark of 10 is seldom given as it implies the perfection which hardly ever characterizes a student's or indeed a lecturer's work. Even 9's are fairly rare. Therefore, an overall grade of 8 is considered a very good pass in any subject. This is especially true in schools of mathematics, science and engineering.

For interim grading, before final marks are given, professors may use credit, percentage, or decimal systems (on a scale of 0-100 credits, 0-100 points, 0-100%, or 1.0-10.0).
A mark of 5.5 usually counts as a narrow pass, whereas 5.4 and below constitutes a failure. If no decimal places are used, 6 and up is a pass, and 5 and below a fail.
Sometimes when no decimals are used, the additional grade of 6– is used to indicate that the student "barely passed". Failing marks can sometimes be offset by high passes provided the average mark is passing (e.g., a 4 and a 9 would average to 6.5, which is passing). Compensation of marks is usually not allowed in the course specifications, but a lower limit for a compensable grade may be set (marks lower than 4 may not be offset, so a 4 and an 8 ((4+8)/2 = 6) would be passing, while a 3 and a 9, though also averaging to 6, would not be passing.

Depending on the grade, universities can grant some honors (although this system is very limited compared to some other countries). A general heuristic (although this differs between institutions) is that a study average at least grade 9.5, final thesis graded 10, not a single grade below 8 and completing the curriculum without delays will lead to (in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) ''izvanredan'', meaning ''[[cum laude]]'', extraordinary. For an average better than 9.0, but not meeting the criteria for cum laude, ''odličan'' (excellent) is awarded, and for an average better than 8.0, but not meeting the criteria for excellent - ''vrlo dobar'' (very good) is awarded.

==Serbian grading system compared to other systems==
Converting the numbers of the Serbian grading system into the letters of systems such as those used in the United States and Great Britain, is difficult. It can really only be done if one can compare the frequency distribution of grades in the two systems.

The grades 9 and 10 are hardly ever given on examinations (on average, a 9 is awarded in less than 2%, and a 10 in less than 0.4% of cases). This is because the mark 10 implies perfection (i.e. a 96-100% score on all questions, extraordinary level) and a mark 9 an excellent level, which could be translated as a level close to that of the professor.

As the incidence of a 9 or 10 in Serbian university examinations are considerably lower than that of the top marks in the American or British grading system, it would be a mistake to equate a 10 to an A, a 9 to a B, and so forth. If the 8, 9 and 10 are taken together, as in the table above, they represent up to 15% of examination results. If, in a grading system based on letters, the A represents the top 10% or thereabouts, the grades 8 and above should be represented by A and A- grades.

It should be borne in mind though, that Serbian secondary education is similar to Russian and partially to German; therefore the pre-university secondary education is at much higher level than in many other Western countries. Proof of this claim can be found in the fact that [[Mathematical Gymnasium]] from Belgrade won only in last 3 years around 60 medals from international competitions, including gold medal from 2008. Russian Olympiad in Mathematics, gold and silver medals from International Olympiads in Mathematics, International Olympiads in Physics and International Olympiads in Informatics, and around 400 in previous 30 years, thus becoming unique in the world. This becomes relevant in comparing quality of students attaining various grades with other systems where more/less candidates are assessed at the level concerned and candidates with less knowledge. Moreover, the equivalence of university preparatory education the world over should not be assumed, the US high-school being considered inadequate for admission to Serbian universities.

Every foreign diploma held by Serbian nationals should undertake process of recognition or equivalence of foreign diploma (e.g. BA, BSc, etc.) or honorary title (e.g. PhD, PhEng, etc.).
Not surprisingly, Serbian graduates from US universities (even from the best ones) are not given equivalence automatically, but rather are put in 3rd, 4th or 5th years of diploma studies. Recent examples include graduates from [[University of California at Berkeley]] and [[MIT]] who were given 8 differential subjects to study at the Faculty of Mathematics, and too many subjects to even get enrolled to final year at the Faculty of Physics so the graduate was enrolled in 3rd year of undergraduate studies of General (not even Theoretical, Experimental, or Applied) physics. Such decisions are to be made by the commissions of faculties in question, and approved or disapproved by the Professors Assembly and, after that, by the dean.
Recent example also includes Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs, mr [[Vuk Jeremić]], whose Bachelor of Science in Theoretical Physics from the prestigious [[University of Cambridge]] could not be recognized as equivalent to ''diploma'' by the ''Faculty of Physics'', [[University of Belgrade]], and it took Mr Jeremic more than 8 (eight) years to have his diploma finally recognized in September 2005.&lt;ref name="Fizički Fakultet"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

A mark 7 is a good grade, implying the student has good command of the subject matter, but not exceptionally good. Mark 6 implies the student has satisfactory command of the subject matter. Marks 7- and 6+ are a fairly frequent marks ''in internal use'' (before the final mark is given, which can be either 7, or 6). As such it relates to the mark B in many other systems, 7- and 7 more likely B+ under systems with a very broad B category.

The conversion of the lowest passing grade may present another problem. A grade of 40% is a clear fail (although an ''internal'' mark 4 may be sometimes compensated by high grades obtained in all other tests and colloquia of the same subject). A mark 5, on the other hand, is 'almost satisfactory'. For purposes of assessing student's progress throughout the year, ''mark 5'' is an usuful mark and may lead to a pass, provided the student improves in the next tests and retakes the test(s) he/she failed (if the test can be organized again during the same school year). For final exams, a 5 is unacceptable as an average. A mark 5 is slightly below that of the D in many systems: student in some cases may pass certain exam with an average mark between 5 and 6 if one of the higher marks from the same subject is ''extraordinary'' (10) or ''excellent'' (9).

AgentCubes is an [[educational programming language]] for kids to create 3D and 2D online games and simulations. The main application of AgentCubes is as computational thinking tool teaching kids [[computational thinking]] through game and simulation design based on the Scalable Game Design&lt;ref&gt;Repenning, A., Webb, D. C., Koh, K. H., Nickerson H., Miller, S. B., Brand, C., et al.,[https://sgd.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/images/4/41/TOCE_2015_Repenning.pdf "Scalable Game Design: A Strategy to Bring Systemic Computer Science Education to Schools through Game Design and Simulation Creation"], Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE), vol. 15, pp. 1-31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; curriculum. 

Similar to a spreadsheet, an agentcube is a grid-based organization. An agentcube is a four dimensional organization consisting of rows, columns, layers cubes containing stacks of programmable agents. This grid-based organization is useful to create a wide array of applications ranging from 1980-style arcade games such as Pac-Man, over 3D games to simple [[agent-based model]]. Agents can be given user created 3D shapes, they can compute formulae, move in the grid, change appearance, play sounds, animate themselves, and send messages to each other. 

AgentCubes was developed with support by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Research explored if K-12 students could pick up computation thinking patterns designing games and, if later, these students could leverage these computational thinking patterns to transfer skills to make STEM simulations. 

== History ==

AgentCubes is inspired by [[AgentSheets]] which introduced modern drag and drop blocks programming in 1995&lt;ref&gt;A. Repenning, [https://sgd.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/images/2/21/20YearsofBlockProgramingLessonsLearned_published.pdf "Moving Beyond Syntax: Lessons from 20 Years of Blocks Programing in AgentSheets"], Journal of Visual Languages and Sentient Systems, vol. 3, p. 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. Most notably, AgentCubes transitioned from 2D to 3D design including highly accessible 3D modelling technology called Inflatable Icons. Historically, both AgentSheets and AgentCubes are rooted in an early prototype of parallel programming for kids running on a Connection Machine 2, a massively parallel supercomputer. The notion of massively parallel computing carried over to AgentCubes but leaving out the need for supercomputing hardware. 

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''AgentCubes Desktop''' (2006). The first AgentCubes implementation was a MacOS/Windows desktop application.

&lt;li&gt;'''AgentCubes Online''' (2012). AgentCubes online shares the same user interface but is complete rewrite based on web technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript and WebGL. 

&lt;/ul&gt;

AgentCubes Online has been used in large [[National Science Foundation]] teacher professional development scale up projects nationally  in the USA and through the support of private foundation in countries such as Mexico, and Switzerland. In 2017 1 million projects were created. AgentCubes online is now available in English, Spanish, German, Italian and French. There are free and commercial versions of AgentCubes available. In Switzerland AgentCubes is free.

== Computational Thinking Tool ==

With the goal to shape ''computational thinkers'' and not necessarily ''programmers'' AgentCubes, and AgentSheets before it, have the goal to be computational thinking tools and not programming tools. Computational thinking tools make Computer Science education practical in K-12 by combining Programming Support Tools with Creativity Support Tools:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Programming Support Tools''': Beyond just supporting syntactic challenges addressed by drag and drop blocks programming, programming support tools also address semantic and pragmatic challenges. AgentCubes, for instance, supports pragmatic challenges and aid the debugging process by supporting the study of what programs mean in particular situations. 

&lt;li&gt;'''Creativity Support Tools''': Research with indicated a close connection between the motivation to program of students and the ability to create their own designs. AgentCubes extended this notion by including tools that would make 3D modelling accessible and even include the ability to 3D print objects created. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

Programming in AgentCubes is based on a IF/THEN parallel conditional rule formalism&lt;ref&gt;Touretzky, D., [https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2527149&amp;ftid=1396193&amp;dwn=1&amp;CFID=16952090&amp;CFTOKEN=333431087cbf08e6-6BC08A09-E1CE-4886-DA569E6FBB865ABA "How should young children approach programming?"], Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges archive, Volume 29 Issue 1, October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. Lists of conditions and actions can be assembled into rules. Rules, can be wrapped up as methods with names which can be invoked by other rules. In the spirit of computational thinking tools it is typically possible to implement games and simulations with a small number of rules. For instance, a complete Pac-Man-like game including sophisticated AI allowing the ghost to collaboratively track down pac-man can be written in just 10 rule. Similar rule-based tools are [[ToonTalk]], or Microsoft’s [[Kodu]].

'''Aleppo College''' ({{lang-ar|كلية حلب الأمريكية / معهد حلب العلمي}}; also called '''Aleppo American College''') Aleppo College was a Junior College it awarded High School Degrees at the Tenth Grade&gt;&gt;&gt; and up to 1964 &lt;&lt;&lt; it awarded  and Freshman and Sophomore  classes in; Arts Engineering and Medicine at the 11th and 12th Grades. It is based in the [[Syria|Syrian]] city of [[Aleppo]] since 1923. The roots of the college are traced back to the [[Central Turkey College]] of [[Gaziantep|Aintab]] founded between 1874-1876 by the [[American Board of Commissioners and Foreign Missions]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to serve the large number of Christian Armenian population in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], ''s.v.'' Aintab.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The students of the Aintab College were largely [[Armenians]] -mainly [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Protestant Armenians]]-, but non-Armenians also attended. As a result of the massacres of the Armenians during the 1915 [[Armenian Genocide]], the college was transferred to the [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] city of Aleppo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synod-sl.org/?page_id=656 Synod-SL:Aleppo College]&lt;/ref&gt; through the efforts of its director John E. Merrill&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syrianhistory.com/Theme/key/Aleppo+College Syrian History:Aleppo College]&lt;/ref&gt; (1898–1937), where it became to be known as Aleppo College or the Aleppo American College and functioned as a [[high school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1967.tb01239.x | volume=57 | title=ALEPPO COLLEGE: FAILURE OR FULFILMENT? | year=1967 | journal=The Muslim World | pages=42–45 | last1 = Miller | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School facilities==
By 1930, with the efforts of the American benefactor James Lack, a large piece of land of 13 hectares was donated to erect the new buildings of the school in the south-western suburbs of Aleppo. However, the construction process was launched in 1936 and completed in 1939. Due to the circumstances of the [[World War II]], the construction of the second building (Girls High school)named American High School for Girls started only in 1950 and completed in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&amp;category=round&amp;filename=200903292245011 e-Aleppo:Aleppo College]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In its life of more than 150 years the college has helped prepare thousands of young men and women for service to society. In the secular field its graduates have distinguished themselves as teachers, school administrators, nurses, physicians, surgeons, pharmacists, dentists, writers, merchants, engineers, government officials and a cross-section of the occupations of its alumni.

==Alumni==
Many famous natives of Aleppo were among the alumni of Aleppo College:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syrianhistory.com/view-photo/3048/The+Aleppo+College+in+1928/aleppo+college Syrian History:Aleppo College]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Mathieu Giard''' (8 August 1846 – 8 August 1908) was a French [[zoologist]] born in [[Valenciennes]].

== Biography ==
In 1867 he began his studies of [[natural sciences]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], followed by work as ''préparateur de zoologie'' at the laboratory of [[Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers]] (1821–1901) in [[Paris]]. In 1872 he defended his doctoral thesis with a study on compound [[ascidians]] titled "''Recherches sur les ascidies composées ou synascidies''". From 1873 to 1882, he was ''professeur suppléant'' of [[natural history]] at the faculty of sciences in [[Université Lille Nord de France|Lille]], and in the meantime, was also affiliated with the [[Institut industriel du Nord]]. In 1874 he founded a biological station at [[Wimereux]] in order to familiarize his students to marine and terrestrial organisms. At Lille, he is credited for putting together an excellent school of zoology.

In 1887 he became a lecturer at the École Normale Supérieure, and from 1888 until his death, he was a professor at the faculty of sciences in Paris, holding the chair of "evolution of living organisms". Following his death, he was succeeded at the Wimereux station by [[Maurice Caullery]] (1868–1958). Among his numerous students and assistants was [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Félix Le Dantec]] (1869-1917).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/ldt0.html Repères chronologiques Service des Archives de l'Institut Pasteur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004090849/http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/ldt0.html |date=2013-10-04 }} Félix Le Dantec (1869-1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Giard was influenced by the work of [[Ernst Haeckel]], and considered [[Lamarckism]] and [[Darwinism]] to be complementary theories.
[[Image:Alfred Giard 1846-1908.jpg|left|thumbnail|Alfred Mathieu Giard by [[Paul Richer]].]]
From 1904 to 1908 he was president of the [[Société de biologie]]. He died on his birthday on August 8, 1908 in [[Orsay]].

== Research ==
He was especially interested in the relationship between host and parasite in nature (both plants and animals), and used the term "[[parasitic castration]]" to define sexual characteristic changes in the host as a result of the parasite, even when the sex glands of the host are not directly involved. He is credited for providing a description of ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', a gastrointestinal [[protozoan]] [[parasite]] that is named after himself and Czech physician [[Wilhelm Lambl|Vilem Dusan Lambl]] (1824–1895). The illness associated with the parasite is sometimes called [[giardiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3511.html] Giardia lamblia @ [[Who Named It]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 he was the first scientist to describe the phylum [[Orthonectida]] (parasites of [[Ophiurida]]).

In 1894 he introduced the term "[[anhydrobiosis]]" (the ability of organisms to survive extreme dehydration).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/gia0.html Archives Department of the Pasteur Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112062811/http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/gia0.html |date=2013-11-12 }} Chronology Alfred Giard (1846-1908)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pub.epsilon.slu.se/2000/1/Schoug_a_20090507.pdf A Dry Phase of Life Freeze-drying and storage stability of Lactobacillus coryniformis Si3 in sucrose-based formulations] by Åsa Schoug&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Giard coined the word ''poecilogonie'' ([[poecilogony]]) to describe a phenomenon in which similar adults develop from dissimilar [[larva]]e in marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjgarchive.org/library/text/ontogeny/p0176.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928064425/http://www.sjgarchive.org/library/text/ontogeny/p0176.htm |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }} Discussion on Poecilogony, Interpolations into Juvenile Stages&lt;/ref&gt;

He is remembered for his extensive research of [[crustaceans]], particularly [[Epicaridea]] (parasitic [[isopods]]) and members of the family [[Bopyridae]]. Amongst his very numerous publications are 300 devoted to [[entomology]]. He was a figure of importance in [[economic entomology|applied entomology]] in France and a member of the [[Société entomologique de France]].

== History ==

'''1924''' - [[May L. Cheney]], who organized a teacher placement office at the University of California, Berkeley helped form the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS). In 1924, NAAS met for the first time and came as guests of the [[National Association of Deans of Women]] (NADW) to a convention sponsored by the Department Superintendence of the National Education Association.

'''1929''' - Forty-six NAAS members registered for the Sixth Annual Convention. NAAS became the National Association of Personnel and Placement Officers (NAPPO).

'''1930s''' - The name [http://www.myacpa.org American College Personnel Association] (ACPA) was adopted in 1931. Association communication consisted of one mailed newsletter, the Personnel-O-Gram (P-O-G). In 1937, the Student Point of View statement was developed by leaders of the [http://www.acenet.edu American Council on Education] (ACE) and ACPA.

'''1940s''' - The Journal for Educational and Psychological Measurement (EPM) became the next form of the association's newsletter communication in 1943. In 1947, ACPA's President Daniel D. Feder's recommendation for formal unification efforts led to the formation of the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA). No conferences were held from 1943 through 1945 during World War Two.

'''1950s''' - The Personnel and Guidance Journal replaced EPM as ACPA's official journal in 1952. ACPA members approved the plan to form APGA. Membership reached 1,000 in 1952 and continued to increase through the next two decades. In 1959, Charles Lewis, the P-O-G associate editor was named the first editor of the Journal of College Student Personnel, ACPA's new official journal.

'''1970s''' - ACPA collaborated with other national organizations on many national conventions. In 1973, ACPA and NAWDC (formerly NADW) coordinated a national convention. The Standing Committee for Women was established in 1973. In 1974, NAWDAC (name change for NAWDC), NASPA and ACPA coordinated a national convention. In 1976, membership totaled 9,384 at a record high. The Standing Committee for Multicultural Affairs was founded in 1978. In 1979, ACPA became one of the first members of the  [[Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education]] (CAS).

'''1980s''' - ACPA flourished under the presidential leadership of outstanding student affairs practitioners and faculty members such as Susan Komives, Margaret "Peggy" Barr and Dennis Roberts. In 1983, ACPA was incorporated under the District of Columbia Non-Profit Act. In 1987, ACPA and NASPA held a joint meeting in Chicago to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Student Personnel Point of View statement. In 1988, ACPA's premier journal was renamed [https://web.archive.org/web/20070827071906/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/pub_jcsd.cfm THE JOURNAL COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT] (JCSD).

'''1990s''' - In 1991, after 40 years, ACPA leaders and members voted to disaffiliate from APGA, which was known as the American Association for Counseling and Development (AACD), and was later renamed the American Counseling Association (ACA). In September 1992, the separation became effective, and ACPA moved into a new office space at the National Center for Higher Education in Washington, D.C. Presidents Leila V. Moore (1991–92), Terry E. Williams (1992–93), Charles C. Schroeder (1986–87), Barbara Anderson (1994–95) and Harold E. Cheatham (1995–96) were all involved in this tremendous undertaking.

'''Early 2000''' - In 2003, Carmen Neuberger retired as Executive Director. Gregory Roberts, ACPA President from 1999–2000, was selected as the new Executive Director.

'''2010''' - The ACPA/NASPA Professional Competency Areas document was published by the Joint Task Force on Professional Competencies and Standards.

'''2011''' - After more than two years of work by the Consolidation Steering Team from ACPA and NASPA leaders, a voting process took place in March. Eighty-percent of ACPA members voted affirmed consolidation while eligible NASPA members who voted fell short of the required 2/3 majority. In the July/August 2011 issue of the Journal of Higher Education, ACPA's premier publication, THE JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT (JCSD) is ranked fourth among 50 Tier One journals in higher education. In a study by Nathaniel Bray and Claire Major, 106 out of 144 respondents reported that they read JCSD, and more than half of them cited JCSD in their work. This report continues JCSD's streak as the highest ranked journal in student affairs.

'''2012''' - ACPA appointed the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-appoints-credentialing-implementation-team Credentialing Implementation Team], launched the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-announces-institutional-leadership-councils-program Institutional Councils Program] and published its on-going [http://www2.myacpa.org/global-initiatives Global Initiatives].

Even though About Campus is sponsored by ACPA, it addresses an audience that goes well beyond student affairs to include all those on campus (administrators, faculty, and staff) who are concerned with student learning.
* ''Enough Is Enough: A Student Affairs Perspective on Preparedness and Response to a Campus Shooting'' presents first-hand accounts and experienced counsel from professionals who have lived through a violent incident, and continue to deal with its aftermath.

Editors: Brian O. Hemphill (Northern Illinois University) and Brandi Hephner LaBanc (Northern Illinois University).
* ''Multicultural Student Services on Campus'' constitutes a thorough introduction to the structure, organization, and scope of the services and educational mission for new professionals in multicultural student services (MSS). For senior practitioners it offers insights for re-evaluating their strategies, and inspiration to explore new possibilities. The book discusses the history and philosophy of MSS units; describes their operation; asserts the need for integration and coherence across the multiple facets of their work and how their role is influenced by the character and type of their institutions; and considers the challenges and opportunities ahead. Editor: Dafina Lazarus Stewart (Bowling Green State University).

Editors: Jeanne L. Higbee (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities) and Alice A. Mitchell (University of Maryland College Park).
* ''Shifting Paradigms in Student Affairs'' is addressed to all student affairs professionals whose primary focus is student learning. Faculty members in preparation programs, senior administrators and student development educators in residence halls, student unions or career counseling offices will use the ideas presented in different ways. Nevertheless, the book has a common purpose for all readers which is to assert the educational functions of student affairs and services, and to situate student development education solidly within the mission of colleges and universities in the United States. Editor: Jane Fried (Central Connecticut State University).
* ''Empowering Women in Higher Education and Student Affairs'' addresses the experiences and position of women students, from application to college through graduate school, and the barriers they encounter; the continuing inequalities in the rates of promotion and progression of women and other marginalized groups to positions of authority, and the gap in earnings between men and women; and pays particular attention to how race and other social markers impact such disparities, contextualizing them across all institutional types. Editors: Penny A. Pasque (University of Oklahoma), Shelley Errington Nicholson.
* ''The First Generation Student Experience'' are 14 first-person narratives – by first-generation students spanning freshman to graduate years – that help the reader get to grips with the variety of ethnic and economic categories to which they belong. The book concludes by defining 14 key issues that institutions need to address, and offers a course of action for addressing them. By Jeff Davis.
* ''College Student Death: Guidance for a Caring Campus'' is the result of many years of collaboration with more than thirty contributors. This book applies the knowledge of university personnel called upon to respond to student death on and off campus and to provide solace to family and the campus community. It also provides support to university staff in the immediacy of student death, guides the design of policy before a crisis occurs, and provide instructional considerations for faculty. Editors: Rosa Cintrón (University of Central Florida), Erin Taylor Weathers, Katherine Garlough (Oklahoma City Community College).
* ''Where You Work Matters'' offers current and future administrators a greater appreciation for the vibrancy and complexity of the student affairs profession. This volume challenges the widely held assumption that the professional practice of student affairs administration transcends the influence of [[organizational culture]]. Based on data and commentaries from more than 1,100 practitioners, this book describes how the experience of student affairs administrators varies by institutional type. The findings paint a multifaceted and integrated portrait of the profession. Author: Joan B. Hirt (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5167">'''Assistive Technology Acts''' provide federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education to each state and territory to support "State efforts to improve the provision of assistive technology to individuals with disabilities of all ages through comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ataporg.org/legislative.html Association of Assistive Technology Act Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017095950/http://ataporg.org/legislative.html |date=October 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Currently, [http://resnaprojects.org/scripts/statewidecontacts.pl?State=ma&amp;Program_type=Statewide there are 56 State AT programs].  For the approximately 50,000,000 individuals with disabilities in the United States, these programs are available to provide them with assistance in selecting and acquiring ''[[assistive technology]]'', defined as any device that would help them perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.

==History==
The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act (P.L. 100-407) was first passed in 1988, reauthorized in 1994 (P.L. 103-218) and again in 1998 (P.L. 105-394).  It was designated as a systems change grant and is often called the "Tech Act" for short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nichcy.org/laws/ata National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed this legislation to increase access to, availability of, and funding for assistive technology through state efforts and national initiatives.  The 1998 law reaffirmed that technology is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the lives of Americans with disabilities.

Every state and territory of the United States was awarded a Tech Act project.  The first group of projects started in 1989. Each state project had five years of funding under the 1989 law.  A competitive grant application was required to receive an additional five years of funds.  Projects were assured of eight years of full funding; the ninth year at 75% of full funding; and the tenth year as a Tech Act project at 50% of full funding.

Legislation supporting the state assistive technology projects was scheduled to sunset on September 30, 2004.  The Assistive Technology Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-364) reauthorized the assistive technology programs in all states and territories for five years as a formula-based program, and removed the [[sunset provision]] from the law.

==Assistive Technology Act of 2004==
One of the major changes brought about by the Assistive Technology Act of 2004 was a change in purpose.  Previous Acts focused on helping states build "systems for improving access to assistive technology devices for individuals with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.republicans.edlabor.house.gov/archive/issues/108th/education/at/billsummary.htm U.S. House of Representatives Education and Workforce Committee - Bill Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; With the 2004 edition, the Act now required States to provide direct aid to individuals with disabilities to ensure they have access to the technology they need.  As a result, the majority of State efforts are required to be conducted in the following areas: assistive technology reutilization programs, assistive technology demonstration programs, alternative financing programs and device loan programs.

==Accomplishments of State Tech Act Programs==
Due to the efforts of the State Tech Act Programs, millions of Americans with disabilities are able to go to work, go to school, participate in recreation activities, and be contributing members of their communities.  The State Program accomplishments are summarized each year as part of the Tech Act reporting requirements.  A summary of these accomplishments is compiled by the Association of Assistive Technology Act Programs;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ataporg.org/legislative.html Association of Assistive Technology Act Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017095950/http://ataporg.org/legislative.html |date=October 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; complete copies of each State Plan can be found at the National Information System for Assistive Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nisat.info/index.php/page/home National Information System for Assistive Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511143309/http://nisat.info/index.php/page/home |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Atlas Black: Managing to Succeed''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by Jeremy Short, Talya Bauer, and Dave Ketchen, about a fictional character named Atlas Black and his efforts to create a startup restaurant while completing his senior year of college. The series is illustrated by Len Simon. The compilation contains five chapters published by [[Flat World Knowledge]].

==Overview==
Faced with meager career opportunities after a series of short-term jobs, Atlas Black decides that his best career prospect is to start his own business. Atlas Black blends the storyline of Atlas’s quest to start his own entrepreneurial startup, with insights from key management theories drawn from the fields of entrepreneurship, organizational behavior and applied psychology, and strategic management.

==Background==

==Storylines==

===Chapter 1. ''Not So Ancient History''===
Atlas Black and his best friend and sidekick David Chan are introduced. Atlas is behind on his rent, and realizes that he needs to take dramatic steps to improve his career prospects. He begins to realize that much of his knowledge of business is based on memorizing terms and buzzwords that he has trouble applying to actual business situations. The mysterious ‘Black’ appears and suggests that starting his own business is a risky proposition, but an acceptable trade-off given Atlas’s other prospects.

===Chapter 2. ''How To Make Good Decisions (And Avoid Bad Ones)''===
Atlas attempts to gain funding by completing his tax returns. Much to his surprise, his ex-girlfriend Maria is working at the accounting firm he visits. Atlas explains that he is now taking school more seriously and even applying the idea of a [[balanced scorecard]] to his personal life, but Maria is unconvinced. The chapter ends in an embarrassing appearance at a local house party when his friend Tess requesting him as a delivery driver for Pilgrim Pizza, his current job as well.

===Chapter 3. ''Blood, SWOT, and Tears''===
Atlas learns that the mechanics of starting his own business are not as difficult or important as the need to develop a specific strategy. With the help of David, he concludes that a restaurant makes sense of a potential entrepreneurial venture in most college towns – but he also needs a unique hook if this idea it to truly move forward.

===Chapter 4. ''Human Resources: Sail or Anchor?''===
After a revelation with the mysterious ‘Black’ while playing [[disc golf|disk golf]], Atlas develops the idea of the No Cover Café. This restaurant would provide free live music with modestly priced food to attract the audience associated with most college towns. Atlas interviews a classmate for a potential internship, and she is livid to discover the position will be unpaid, providing another opportunity for embarrassment for Atlas.

===Chapter 5. ''Charting the Future: Organizational Structure and Fit''===
Atlas realizes the need to become more organized if the No Cover Café is to become a reality, and visits his college’s career fair to contemplate potential employees and other local firms that they could supply their restaurant, such as Cat Lady Coffee – a local coffee shop that Atlas and David frequent.

These schools are based on the same principle as the ''[[Diwan (school)|Diwan]]'' schools of [[Brittany]], as well as the ''[[Gaelscoileanna]]'' movement in Ireland, the ''[[Ikastolak]]'' movement in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]],  the ''[[Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin|Ysgolion Meithrin]]'' movement in [[Wales]], and the [[La Bressola]] schools of [[Northern Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.diwanbreizh.org/sections.php4?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=34 L'immersion : une stratégie pour le bilinguisme]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bilingualism]] from an early age is recommended by many [[linguistics|linguist]]s, as it helps children become more adept at learning additional languages. Some studies have shown that bilingual children have advantages over [[monoglot]] children in other subjects.&lt;ref name="B&amp;H"&gt;

The '''cognitive elite''' of a [[society]], according to [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], are those having higher [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] levels and thus better prospects for success in life. The development of a cognitive elite during the 20th century is presented in their 1994 book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. In this book, Herrnstein and Murray propose that the cognitive elite has been produced by a more technological society which offers enough high skill jobs for those with a higher intelligence to fill. They also propose that by removing [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]] or [[social class|class]] as criteria the main criteria of success in academic and professional life is becoming primarily based on cognitive ability.

[[Educational psychology|Educational psychologist]] [[Linda Gottfredson]] wrote:
{{cquote|Differences in intelligence matter. For members of the cognitive elite to maintain otherwise is like the rich arguing that money does not matter. Differences in ''[[General intelligence factor|g]]'' affect the lives of individuals and families. They help shape the social order and limit our ability to reshape it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf Why g matters]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
The [[The Bell Curve#Criticisms|book has met with criticism]], as has the cognitive elite concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Frank Harold|title=For Whom Does the Bell Toll?: Meritocracy, the Cognitive Elite, and the Continuing Significance of Race in Postindustrial America|quote=It refutes as cultural superstition and social science pornography The Bell Curve's theories on the role of intelligence in the social stratification of postindustrial America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9273">'''Continuing medical education''' ('''CME''') refers to a specific form of [[continuing education]] (CE) that helps those in the [[medicine|medical]] field maintain competence and learn about new and developing areas of their field. These activities may take place as live events, written publications, online programs, audio, video, or other electronic media. Content for these programs is developed, reviewed, and delivered by faculty who are experts in their individual clinical areas.  Similar to the process used in [[academic journals]], any potentially conflicting financial relationships for faculty members must be both disclosed and resolved in a meaningful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accme.org/requirements/accreditation-requirements-cme-providers/standards-for-commercial-support|title=Standards for Commercial Support: Standards to Ensure Independence in CME Activities|publisher=Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics complain that drug and device manufacturers often use their financial sponsorship to bias CMEs towards marketing their own products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmeschedule.com/about-continuing-medical-education-cme/|title=Continuing Medical Education|publisher=CME Schedule|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Continuing medical education is not a new concept. From essentially the beginning of institutionalized medical instruction (medical instruction affiliated with medical colleges and teaching hospitals), health practitioners continued their learning by meeting with their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed K, Ashrafian H |title=Life-long learning for physicians |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5950 |page=227 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19815754 |doi=10.1126/science.326_227a |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19815754}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand rounds, case discussions, and meetings to discuss published medical papers constituted the continuing learning experience. In the 1950s through to the 1980s, CME was increasingly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Concerns regarding informational bias (both intentional and unintentional) led to increasing scrutiny of the CME funding sources. This led to the establishment of certifying agencies such as the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education which is an umbrella organization representing medical associations and bodies of academic medicine from the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Europe. The pharmaceutical industry has also developed guidelines regarding drug detailing and industry sponsorship of CME, such as the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (PAAB) and Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&amp;D).

== CME requirements ==
In the United States, many states require CME for medical professionals to maintain their licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Medical Education for Licensure Reregistration|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/455/licensurerereg-06.pdf|work=State Medical Licensure Requirements and Statistics|publisher=American Medical Association|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, CME for physicians is regulated by the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] (ACCME) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA).

In Canada, certification is provided by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]] (RCPSC) and the [[College of Family Physicians Canada]] (CFPC).  The RCPSC is responsible for the development and implementation of all certifying examinations in each specialty other than Family Medicine. Specialist physicians who join the Royal College as Fellows maintain their knowledge, skills, competence and performance through participating in the Maintenance of Certification Program.  For each five-year cycle, fellows of the college are required to document 400 credits, with a minimum of 40 credits obtained in each year of the cycle.  Credits are earned at one to two credits per hour, based on the type of learning activity.  The CFPC requires 250 credit-hours over a five-year cycle.  Fifty credits must be obtained for each year of the cycle.  To earn and maintain fellowship within the college, an additional 24 credit-hours of higher level learning are also required over each learning cycle.  Similarly, each province and territory requires documentation of ongoing CME for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed K, Ashrafian H, Hanna GB, Darzi A, Athanasiou T |title=Assessment of specialists in cardiovascular practice |journal=Nature Reviews Cardiology  |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=659–67 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19724254 |doi=10.1038/nrcardio.2009.155 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrcardio/journal/v6/n10/pdf/nrcardio.2009.155.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production of CME courses==
Continuing medical education activities are developed and delivered by a variety of organizations, including:
* [[Professional association]]s
* [[Medical education agency|Medical education agencies]]
* [[Hospital]]s

Activities may be classified as Formal Learning Activities, including live planned programs, enduring materials (such as DVD- and web-based content), Process Improvement CME (or PI-CME, as defined by the American Medical Association), or Informal Learning Activities such as Internet-Point of Care (POC) research and decision making, or [[journal club]]s whose members evaluate published research for mutual awareness and benefit, or online professional communities.&lt;ref&gt;Trentin G. (Ed) (2014). Network-Based Continuing Medical Education: Social Media and Professional Development. [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], Hauppauge, NY, {{ISBN|978-1-63117-346-2}}. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260311473_Network-Based_Continuing_Medical_Education_Social_Media_and_Professional_Development/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, professional certification for CME planners was established by the National Commission for Certification of CME Professionals which is earned by standardized exam, and confers the Certified CME Professional (CCMEP) certificate. NC-CME maintains a registry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccme.org/content.aspx?dbid=12 |title=Welcome to www.nccme.org |publisher= National Commission for Certification of CME Professionals, Inc. |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of these certified professionals. As of June 2011, the Registry included 320 professionals.

== Criticism of industry sponsorship{{anchor|sponsorship}}==

Critics, such as Morris and Taitsman,&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris L, Taitsman JK |title=The agenda for continuing medical education—limiting industry's influence |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=361 |issue=25 |pages=2478–82 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20018969 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsb0905411 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/25/2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; would prefer that the medical profession eliminate commercial support for CME.

Despite ACCME requirements that program content be free of commercial interests, "CME providers can easily pitch topics designed to attract commercial sponsorship," and sponsors can award grants to programs that support their marketing strategies.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt; The Institute of Medicine has said that CME has become too reliant on industry funding that "tends to promote a narrow focus on the products and to neglect provisions of a broader education on alternative strategies," such as communication and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine, Conflict of interest in medical research, education, and practice. Washington, D.C., National Academies Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[gabapentin]] (Neurontin), was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for adjunctive therapy in epilepsy, but Warner-Lambert sponsored CME activities that encouraged its use for off-label indications. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] brought civil and criminal charges against Warner-Lambert, which Warner-Lambert settled for $430 million, alleging that Warner-Lambert paid kickbacks to doctors in the form of lavish trips to attend presentations about [[off-label use]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_civ_322.htm Warner-Lambert to pay $430 million to resolve criminal &amp; civil health care liability relating to off-label promotion.] Press release of the U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC, May 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[AstraZeneca]] PLC has been fined $520 million in the [[United States]] for off-label promotion to doctors for their anti-psychotic drug, [[Seroquel]].

Industry-sponsored CMEs can violate federal statutes, according to the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. "When a pharmaceutical manufacturer rewards high-prescribing physicians by directing a CME provider to pay (or overpay) them as CME faculty, consultants, or members of a speaker's bureau," wrote Morris and Taitsman.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt;

It is often synonymous with '''honor roll''' and '''honor list''', but should not be confused with [[Honours degree|honours degrees]].

Generally, students enrolled in college or university would need to satisfy a series of specific requirements before receiving the Dean's List. These requirements may differ across institutions, but in most cases will require students to enroll in a [[full-time]] capacity, to achieve a specific [[Grade Point Average|grade point average]] within the [[academic term]], and to maintain a specific [[cumulative grade point average]] throughout enrollment. Universities may often establish further rewards, such as Annual Dean's Lists, for students that demonstrate even greater academic distinction. As such, a Dean's List and its direct derivatives are usually intended for students that demonstrate highest scholarship across multiple disciplines, and not necessarily bound to a specific field of study.

Over time, the Dean's List has also led to the creation of additional rewards with similar nomenclatures, including the [[provost (education)|Provost's]] List,&lt;ref name="Wyoming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/general_information/provosts_list.html|title=Office of the Registrar: Provost's List|last=|first=|date=|work=University of Wyoming|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=January 11, 2017|quote=The requirements to be met are as follows: 1.

== Distinction ==
=== Comparison to North American Latin honors ===

{{Main|Latin honors}}
Although the Dean's List and Latin honors may both be issued in recognition of high scholarship, they are mostly separate awards not intended for direct comparison.
Many institutions confer three levels of Latin honors, as follows:
* ''cum laude'', meaning "with praise" (or "with honor")&lt;ref&gt;The usual translation of ''[[wiktionary:laude#Latin|laude]]'' from [[Latin]] is "with praise".&lt;/ref&gt;
** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 25% (or 30%) of their class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-studentlink/registration-records-and-graduation/graduation-and-diplomas/graduation-honors.html|title=Graduation Honors|date=|work=NYU|publisher=New York University|accessdate=January 12, 2017|quote=Effective with the September 2008 graduating class,... the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. ''Summa cum laude'': the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. ''Magna cum laude'': the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. ''Cum laude'': the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/reg/graduation/latin-honors/|title=Latin Honors|work=BU, Office of the University Registrar|publisher=[[Boston University]]|accessdate=January 12, 2017|quote=Among graduating seniors in each school or college, Latin Honors are awarded to the top 30% of the class as follows: Summa Cum Laude Top 5%, Magna Cum Laude Next 10%, Cum Laude Next 15%}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''magna cum laude'', meaning "with great honor"
** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 10% (or 15%) of their class; this is the highest honor awarded at some institutions.
* ''summa cum laude'', meaning "with highest honor"
** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 1-5% of their class.

Because Latin honors are often conferred to the approximate class rank whereby students also receive the Dean's List (as the top 10-15%), '''''magna''''' and '''''summa cum laude''''' are usually held in higher regard. A Dean's List may therefore be seen as equal to (or more prestigious than) '''''cum laude''','' depending on the specific requirements involved.

===Comparison to GPA ===
The Dean's List [[GPA]] requirements vary from school to school, although there are general standards:
* With the GPA scale from 0 to 4, 4 being an A, the dean's list cutoff is typically around 3.5-3.7.&lt;ref name="Wyoming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://students.cfaes.ohio-state.edu/node/674|title=Dean's List|work=OSU.EDU|publisher=[[The Ohio State University]]|accessdate=January 11, 2017|quote=Students completing a minimum of 12 graded credit hours with a GPA of 3.5 or higher for any given term will be named to the Dean's List for that term in the college in which they are enrolled. Courses graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) or pass/non-pass (PA/NP) do not count toward the minimum 12 graded hours, and a grade of U, E, EN, or NP will disqualify you from making the Dean's List, even if you meet the 3.5 criteria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/stu-adv/deanslist.php | title = Dean's List Requirements | publisher = [[Cornell University]] |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2012-01-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120901214822/http://www.arts.cornell.edu/stu-adv/deanslist.php | archive-date = September 1, 2012 | quote = Minimum GPA Required: 12 Credits --- 3.85 or higher, 13 or 14 credits --- 3.75 or higher, 15 or 16 credits --- 3.65 or higher, 17 or more credits --- 3.55 or higher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://falk.syr.edu/students/awards-scholarships/deans-list/ | title = Falk College Spring 2016 Dean’s List | work = Falk College | publisher = [[Syracuse University]] | date = January 11, 2017 | quote = Students at the College are named to Dean’s list when they have achieved a minimum of a 3.4 semester grade point average and have earned at least 12 credit hours of course work. Students receive a certificate of achievement from Dean Murphy and often cite this honor on their resume, portfolio or when applying for employment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/front/Deans_List.html | title = Dean's List | work = University of Washington | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | accessdate = January 11, 2017 | quote = The Quarterly Dean's List includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who are pursuing their first undergraduate degree and have attained a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in the final grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate entries regarding inclusion on the Dean's List are made on the student's permanent academic record.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Top 10% of the class in GPA&lt;ref name="Wharton" /&gt;

Some schools maintain two lists for two different levels of GPA. For example, the dean's list records students with at least a 3.5 GPA whereas the chancellor's list records students with a higher 4.0 GPA.&lt;ref name="IU-Southeast"&gt;{{cite press release|title=More than 1,000 IU Southeast students honored for academics in spring semester|date=June 7, 2016|publisher=[[Indiana University Southeast]]|location=New Albany, Indiana|url=https://now.ius.edu/2016/06/more-than-1000-iu-southeast-students-honored-for-academics-in-spring-semester/|quote=The Dean’s and Chancellor’s lists both recognize students who have achieved outstanding semester honors in academics. Those named to the Chancellor’s List received highest academic honors in the spring semester.|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNC-Asheville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzaga-Honors"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gonzaga.edu/news-and-events/university-honors/default.asp | title = University Honors | work = Gonzaga University | publisher = Gonzaga University | quote = Welcome to the Gonzaga University Honors webpage, showcasing students who have achieved academic excellence and earned a place on either our President's List or the Dean's List. These lists are published twice a year following the completion of the fall and spring semesters. | accessdate = January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different from an academic [[scholarship]], the dean's list award does not come with any [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]]. However, students high on the dean's list are often offered extra financial aid, especially if they express a desire to transfer or exhibit more financial need.

=== Comparison to European classifications ===
In Europe, [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] may utilize variations of the [[British undergraduate degree classification|British degree classifications]] to distinguish students of high scholarship. The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom, for example, was developed in 1918.&lt;ref name="Alderman2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|title=Tear up the class system|last=Alderman|first=Geoffrey|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was implemented based on one from the 16th century, when the [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] implemented [[Norm-referenced test|norm referencing]] to distinguish the top 25% of candidates, the next 50%, and the bottom 25%.&lt;ref name="Alderman2" /&gt;

Today, '''first-class honours''' (commonly referred to as "'''first-hons'''") is awarded, by most institutions, to any student that receives a grade of 70% or higher (as opposed to classification by class rank). The number of first-class honours degrees has reportedly tripled since the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Paton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9792964/Number-of-first-class-degrees-has-tripled-since-late-90s.html|title=Number of first-class degrees "has tripled since late 90s"|last=Paton|first=Graeme|date=10 January 2013|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been concern over possible [[grade inflation]] due to increasing numbers of higher-class honours degrees awarded per annum.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/12/first-class-degrees-concern|title=Is the number of first-class degrees cause for concern?|work=The Guardian|deadurl=no|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/16/first-class-degrees-concern-update|title=Is the number of first-class degrees cause for concern: Update|last=Shepherd|first=Jessica|date=17 January 2012|publisher=The Guardian|deadurl=no|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Education in Bangladesh''' is overseen by the Bangladesh's [[Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Education]]. [[Ministry of Primary and Mass Education]] are responsible for implementing policy for [[primary education]] and state-funded schools at a local level. In Bangladesh, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at primary school level and six years at high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools.

Bangladesh conforms fully to the UN's [[Education For All]] (EFA) objectives&lt;ref name= EFA&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002305/230507e.pdf Bangladesh: Education for All 2015 National Review].

''General Economics Division (GED), Bangladesh Planning Commission''. plancomm.gov.bd.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other education-related international declarations.  Article 17 of the [[Bangladesh Constitution]] provides that all children receive free and compulsory education.&lt;ref name="Article 17"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh: Article 17 (Free and compulsory education)|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24565 | publisher = bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education system==
[[File:BangEduSys.png|thumb|260px|A Bangladesh education system chart]]
The main education system is divided into three levels: &lt;!-- is this really true of Technical-Vocational? --&gt; &lt;!-- Technical &amp; vocational would ideally be part of Secondary and Tertiary Edcuation System, considering same is used in India and both education systems are evolved from same undivided Indian education systems --&gt;
*Primary Level (Class 1–5)&lt;ref name="thedailystarviii"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/primary-education-now-class-viii-1225825 |title=Primary education now up to class VIII |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=18 May 2016 |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secondary Level (6-10) or (9-12 at some schools) There is no middle school system in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="thedailystarIX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-103042 |title=Primary education up to class VIII, secondary XII|newspaper=The Daily Star |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tertiary Level

At all levels of schooling, students can choose to receive their education in English or Bangla. Private schools tend to make use of English-based study media while government-sponsored schools use Bangla.
[[File:Cadets in class.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Cadets in a classroom]]
[[Cadet Colleges in Bangladesh|Cadet Colleges]] are important in the education system of Bangladesh. A cadet college is a room and board collegiate administered by the Bangladesh. Military discipline is compulsory at all cadet colleges. [[Faujdarhat Cadet College]] is the first cadet college in Bangladesh, established in 1958 over an area of {{convert|185|acre|km2}}  at [[Faujdarhat]] in the district of [[Chittagong]]. At present there are 12 cadet colleges in Bangladesh, including 3 cadet colleges for girls.

Tertiary education in Bangladesh takes place at 37 government, 80 private and 3 international universities. Students can choose to further their studies in Chartered Accountancy, engineering, technology, agriculture and medicine at a variety of universities and colleges. &lt;!-- Are colleges tertiary too? --&gt;

===Primary education===
The overall responsibility of management of primary education lies with the [[Ministry of Primary and Mass Education]] (MOPME), set up as a Ministry in 1992. While MOPME is involved in formulation of policies, the responsibility of implementation rests with the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) headed by a Director General. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) and its subordinate offices in the district and [[upazila]] are solely responsible for management and supervision of primary education. Their responsibilities include recruitment, posting, and transfer of teachers and other staff; arranging in-service training of teachers; distribution of free textbooks; and supervision of schools. The responsibility of school construction, repair and supply of school furniture lies with the DPE executed through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) is responsible for the development of curriculum and production of textbooks. While the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formulation of policies, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) under the Ministry of Education is responsible for implementing the same at secondary and higher education levels. The NCTB is responsible for developing curriculum and publishing standard textbooks.

The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:
* [[Primary School Certificate]] (PSC) ([[Fifth grade|5 grade]])
* [[Junior School Certificate]] (JSC) ([[Eighth grade|8th grade]])

===Secondary education===
{{main|High Schools in Bangladesh}}
The secondary level of education is controlled by the eight General Education boards:
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Barisal|Barisal Education Board]] for [[Barisal Division]]
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Chittagong|Chittagong Education Board]] for [[Chittagong Division]] 
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Comilla|Comilla Education Board]] for [[Comilla Division]]
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka|Dhaka Education Board]] for [[Dhaka Division]] 
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dinajpur|Dinajpur Education Board]] for [[Rangpur Division]]
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Jessore|Jessore Education Board]] for [[Khulna Division]]
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mymensingh|Mymensingh Education Board]] for [[Mymensingh Division]]
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Rajshahi|Rajshahi Education Board]] for [[Rajshahi Division]]
* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Sylhet|Sylhet Education Board]] for [[Sylhet Division]]

The boards' headquarters are located in [[Barishal]], [[Comilla]] [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] [[Jessore]], [[Rajshahi]] and [[Sylhet]].

Eight region-based Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:
* [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) ([[Tenth grade|10th grade]])
* [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) ([[Twelfth grade|12th grade]])

At the school level, in the case of non-government secondary schools, School Management Committees (SMC), and at the intermediate college level, in the case of non-government colleges, Governing Bodies (GB), formed as per government directives, are responsible for mobilising resources, approving budgets, controlling expenditures, and appointing and disciplining staff. While teachers of non-government secondary schools are recruited by concerned SMCs observing relevant government rules, teachers of government secondary schools are recruited centrally by the DSHE through a competitive examination.

In government secondary schools, there is not an SMC. The headmaster is solely responsible for running the school and is supervised by the deputy director of the respective zone. Parent Teachers Associations (PTAs), however, exist to ensure a better teaching and learning environment.

===Tertiary education===

[[File:Civil Engineering Building of BUET seen from EME Building.JPG|thumb|[[Department of Civil Engineering, BUET|Civil Engineering department]] of [[BUET]]. BUET is regarded as one of the best universities for engineering education in Bangladesh]]

At the tertiary level, universities are regulated by the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]].The colleges providing tertiary education are under the National University. Each of the medical colleges is affiliated with a public university. Universities in Bangladesh are autonomous bodies administered by statutory bodies such as Syndicate, Senate, Academic Council, etc. in accordance with provisions laid down in their respective acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Private_University|title=Private University – Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=University_Grants_Commission|title=University Grants Commission – Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical and Vocational education===

The Technical and Vocational Education System provides courses related to various applied and practical areas of science, technology and engineering, or focuses on a specific specialized area. Course duration ranges from one month to four years. The [[Technical Education Board]] controls technical and vocational training in the secondary level.

The Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of technical and vocational education in the country. Curriculum is implemented by BTEB. There are also a number of [[List of universities in Bangladesh#Private universities|private universities in Bangladesh]].In the Technical Education System, after obtaining a Diploma-in-Engineering degree (four-year curriculum) from the institutes listed below, students can further pursue their educational career by obtaining a bachelor's degree from Engineering &amp; Technology Universities. It normally it takes an additional two and a half to three years of coursework to obtain a bachelor's degree, although some students take more than three years to do so. They can then enroll in post-graduate studies. Students can also study CA (Chartered Accounting) after passing HSC or bachelor's degree and subject to fulfilling the entry criteria of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).

==Alternative education system==
===English language schools===
A vast number of schools in Bangladesh are [[English version school]]s. English Medium schools are mainly private schools where all the courses are taught in English except one Bengali Language subject at ordinary level (O Level). These schools in Bangladesh follow the General Certificate of Education (GCE) syllabus where students are prepared for taking their Ordinary Level (O Level) and Advanced Level (A Level) examinations. The General Certificate of Education system is one of the most internationally recognised qualifications, based in the United Kingdom. The Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are English equivalent to the [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) and [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) examinations respectively. Most students sit for these exams from the registered schools in Bangladesh who follow the GCE syllabus. Those who do not attend a school that follows the GCE syllabus may also sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations from the British Council. These examinations are conducted under the supervision of the British Council in Bangladesh. The GCE examination conducted by the British Council takes place twice a year. Currently there are two boards operating from Bangladesh for Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations, which are Edexcel and University of Cambridge International Examinations.
Bangladesh has recently opened [[English version schools (Bangladesh)]] translating board textbooks in English.

===Madrasah education===
The [[Madrasah]] Education System focuses on religious education, teaching all the basics of education in a religious environment. Religious studies are taught in [[Arabic]] and the students in some areas also serve the local area [[masjid]]s. Students also have to complete all the courses from the General Education System. Many privately licensed Madrasas take in homeless children and provide them with food, shelter and education, e.g. [[Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah]] in [[Sylhet]].
In the Madrasah Education System there are two systems:

One, called the "Quomi" Madrasah system is privately owned and funded&lt;ref name="Mumtaz2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahmad, Mumtaz|editor=Esposito, John |editor2=Voll, John |editor3=Bakar, Osman|title=Asian Islam in the 21st Century|chapter= Islam, state, and society in Bangladesh|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-8HrM55XfgC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-804421-5|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is run according to the Deobandi system of Islamic education, which rejects the rational sciences.&lt;ref name="Tan2014"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tan, Charlene |title=Reforms in Islamic Education: International Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bMAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=New York|isbn=9781441101341|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other, called the "Alia" madrasah system, is privately owned but subsidised by the government (the government spends 11.5% of its education budget on alia madrasahs, paying 80% of teacher and administrator salaries).&lt;ref name="Mumtaz2007"/&gt; Quomi madrasahs account for 1.9% of total primary enrollment and 2.2% of secondary enrollment; aliyah madrasahs account for 8.4% of primary and 19% of secondary enrollment.&lt;ref name="DavisMiroshnikova2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alam, Mahmadul |author2=A.T.M Shaifullah Mehedi |author3=Nehraz Mahmud |editor=Davis, Derek |editor2=Miroshnikova, Elena |title=The Routledge International Handbook of Religious Education|chapter= Religious education in Bangladesh|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyfnbXzdpZMC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1-136-25641-7|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alia system is like the general education system, except that Arabic is taught in addition to general education. The [[Madrasah Education Board]] covers religious education in government-registered [[Madrasah]]s in the secondary level. After passing "Alim", a student can enroll for 3 additional years to obtain a "Fazil" level. Students can go for further general education and earn a university degree. After passing successfully, they can further enroll for another 2 years to obtain a "Kamil" level degree. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Non-formal education==
There exists a substantial number of NGO-run non-formal schools, catering mainly to the drop-outs of the government and non-government primary schools. Very few NGOs, however, impart education for the full five-year primary education cycle. Because of this, on completion of their two-to three-year non-formal primary education in NGO-run schools, students normally re-enter into government/non-government primary schools at higher classes.

There are Non-Governmental Schools (NGO) and Non-Formal Education Centers (NFE) and many of these are funded by the government. The largest NFE program is the much reputed [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] program. However, not all NFE graduates continue on to secondary school.

NGO-run schools differ from other non-government private schools. While the private schools operate like private enterprises often guided by commercial interests, NGO schools operate mainly in areas not served either by the government or private schools, essentially to meet the educational needs of vulnerable groups in the society. They usually follow an informal approach to suit the special needs of children from these vulnerable groups. But nowadays, some NGO schools are operating into places where there are both private and government schools.

Similarly, in NGO-run schools there does not exist any SMC. The style of management differs depending upon differences in policies pursued by different NGOs. Some are centrally managed within a highly bureaucratic set-up, while others enjoy considerable autonomy.

Different NGOs pursue different policies regarding recruitment of teachers. Some prepare a panel of prospective teachers on the basis of a rigorous test and recruit teachers from this panel. Other NGOs recruit teachers rather informally from locally available interested persons.

==Current Issues==
[[File:10 years old Dipa and 12 years old Laboni study in class 2 at "Unique Child learning Center", Mirmur-Dhaka, Bangladesh.jpg|thumbnail|Girls studying at the Unique Child Learning Center in Mirpur-Dhaka]]
Current government projects to promote the education of children in Bangladesh include compulsory primary education for all, free education for girls up to grade 10,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} stipends for female students, a nationwide integrated education system and a food-for-education literacy movement. A large section of the country's national budget is set aside to help put these programs into action and to promote education and make it more accessible. Recent years have seen these efforts pay off and the Bangladesh education system is strides ahead of what it was only a few years ago. Now even national curriculum books from class 5 to class 12 are distributed freely among all students and schools.

The educational system of Bangladesh faces several problems. In the past, Bangladesh education was primarily a British modelled upper class affair with all courses given in English and very little being done for the common people. The Bangladesh education board has taken steps to leave such practices in the past and is looking forward to education as a way to provide a poverty-stricken nation with a brighter future.&lt;!-- "In the past" refers to what approximate time period?  100 years ago?  20 years ago?  I guess 1947 --&gt;
As Bangladesh is an overpopulated country, there is a huge demand to turn its population into labour, which is why proper education is needed and proper help from government in the educational sectors of Bangladesh is crucial.

===Education expenditure as percentage of GDP===
Public expenditure on education lies on the fringes of 2 percent of GDP with a minimum of 0.94 percent in 1980 and a maximum of 2.2 percent in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Bangladesh/Education_spending/ Education Spending, Bangladesh, at theglobaleconomy.com] Accessed 26 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative dimension===
The Education system lacks a sound Human Resource Development and deployment system&lt;ref&gt;Sedere, Upali M. (2000). "Institutional Capacity Building Through Human Resource Development". Directorate of Primary Education/PEDPQI Project of NORAD, Bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has demoralised the primary education sector personnel, including teachers, and contributes to poor performance. Poverty is a big threat to primary education. In Bangladesh, the population is very high. The number of seats available in colleges is less than the number of students who want to enroll, and the number of seats available in universities is also less than the number of students who passed higher secondary level and want to join in a university. Besides, the cost of education is increasing day by day, as a result many students are unable to afford it.

One study found a 15.5% primary school teacher absence rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/Roll_Call_Teacher_Absence_Bangladesh.pdf|title=Roll Call: Teacher Absence in Bangladesh|year=2004|publisher=Site resources.world bank.org|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender disparity===
In Bangladesh, gender discrimination in education occurs amongst the rural households but is non-existent amongst rich households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1058017.pdf Molla Huq: Gender Disparities in Secondary Education in Bangladesh, May 2008, at files.eric.ed.gov] Accessed 26 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Dp/pdf/522.pdf Abu S. SHONCHOY* and Mehnaz RABBANI: The Bangladesh Gender Gap in Education: Biased Intra-household Educational Expenditures, at ide.go.jp] Accessed 26 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; There is great difference in the success rates of boys, as compared to girls in Bangladesh. However, in recent years some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol32/6/32-6.pdf Niels-Hugo Blunch, Maitreyi Bordia Das: Changing norms about gender inequality in education: Evidence from Bangladesh] Accessed 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===School attendance===
The low performance in primary education is also matter of concern. School drop-out rates and grade repetition rates are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/DataCentre/Pages/country-profile.aspx?code=500&amp;SPSLanguage=EN|title=Country Profiles: Bangladesh |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics  |date= |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor school attendance and low contact time in school are factors contributing to low level of learning achievement.

===Religion and education===
Madrasah education in Bangladesh is heavily influenced by religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://alochonaa.com/2014/03/27/the-impact-of-islamic-schools-in-bangladeshi-society-the-case-of-madrassa/ |title=The Impact of Islamic Schools in Bangladeshi Society: The Case of Madrassa |date=27 March 2014 |website=alochonaa.com |access-date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literacy rate==
Bangladesh has one of the lowest [[List of countries by literacy rate|literacy rates]] in Asia, estimated at 66.5% for males and 63.1% for females in 2014.  Recently the literacy rate of Bangladesh has improved as it stands at 71% {{As of|2015|lc=y}} due to the modernization of schools and education funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=16 June 2015 |title=Bangladesh's literacy rate rises to 70 percent, education minister says |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/06/16/bangladeshs-literacy-rate-rises-to-70-percent-education-minister-says |newspaper=bdnews24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Austerlitz''''' was a late 100-gun [[Hercule class ship of the line|''Hercule''-class]] [[ship of the line]] of the [[French Navy]].

==Service history==
Laid down as ''Ajax'', she was renamed ''Austerlitz'' on 28 November 1839, still on keel.

In 1850, her rigging was changed for that of a 90-gun, and a steam engine was installed.

She took part in operations in the Black Sea in 1854.

From 1871, she was used as a prison hulk of prisoners of the [[Paris Commune]]. Between 1874 and 1894, she was used as a school ship. She was eventually broken up in 1895.

'''Go Heritage Runs''' is an award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manthan Award Winners 2015| url = http://manthanaward.org/winner-2015/}}&lt;/ref&gt; series of fun runs organized across [[India]] at various [[Historic site|heritage]] locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Go Heritage Runs| url = http://www.goheritagerun.com/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[GoUNESCO]] founder Ajay Reddy in 2014. The goal of these runs is to promote awareness of heritage locations.

== History ==
Go Heritage Runs began as an offshoot of GoUNESCO in 2014.

The run format of Go Heritage Runs is simple. These runs are conducted at heritage sites and are not time bound. They are organized on a Sunday and include different run formats such as 5K, 10K, up to the distance of a half marathon (21.0975&amp;nbsp;km). The exact run distances vary from location to location.

The preparation for these runs began in July 2014 in [[Hampi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Running past heritage|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/running-past-heritage/article7901216.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2015-11-21|access-date = 2016-02-24|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a test run was arranged. About 50 people traveled from Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai, to participate in the run. In November 2014, the next test run was conducted in [[Bidar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141105/nation-current-affairs/article/city-runs-bidar-heritage|title = Hyderabad runs for Bidar heritage|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = 2016-02-24|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harvey Dinnerstein''' (born 1928), is a figurative [[artist]] and [[educator]]. A [[drawing|draftsman]] and [[Painting|painter]] in the [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] tradition, his work has included [[genre]] paintings, contemporary narratives, complex figurative compositions, [[portraits]], and intimate images of his family and friends.

Dinnerstein was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and studied with [[Moses Soyer]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], and [[Julian E. Levi]] at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. From 1947 to 1950 Dinnerstein was also a student at the [[Tyler School of Art]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Upon his return to New York in the early 1950s, he was one of a group of recent Tyler graduates who resisted the prevailing style of [[Abstract Expressionism]] in order to paint in a figurative mode.

Inspired by the [[Montgomery, Alabama]] bus boycott of 1956, Dinnerstein traveled south to document the [[Civil Rights]] upheaval through a series of drawings. This interest in cultural and moral issues continued to inform drawings and paintings that recorded the social unrest of the 1960s.

From 1965 to 1980 Dinnerstein taught at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York, and from 1975 to 1992 at the [[National Academy of Design]], of which he was elected a member in 1974. He has taught at the Art Students League since 1980.

He received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts]] in [[Old Lyme]], [[Connecticut]] in 1998.

Dinnerstein has participated in numerous exhibitions in galleries and museums throughout the [[United States]]. His work is in the permanent collections of the [[Butler Institute of American Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], [[Museum of the City of New York]], National Academy of Design, [[National Museum of American Art]], and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

He has been a very influential instructor for several generations of students at The National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, including Ephraim Rubenstein, Nomi Silverman and [[Gregory William Frux]].

His book ''Harvey Dinnerstein: An Artist at Work'' was published in 1978 by Watson-Guptill.

He is the brother of figurative artist [[Simon Dinnerstein]], and the uncle of concert pianist [[Simone Dinnerstein]].

'''Janet Murray''' is a [[professor]] in the [[School of Literature, Media, and Communication]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].  Before coming to Georgia Tech in 1999, she was a Senior [[research scientist|Research Scientist]] in the Center for Educational Computing Initiatives at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where she taught humanities and led advanced interactive design projects since 1971. She is well known as an early developer of [[Digital humanities|humanities computing]] applications, a seminal theorist of [[digital media]], and an advocate of new educational programs in digital media.

==Work and contributions==
Janet Murray designed projects include a digital edition of the Warner Brothers classic, Casablanca.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~murray/casablancaNEHmagazine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition she directs an eTV Prototyping Group, which has worked on interactive television applications for PBS, ABC, MTV, Turner, and other networks. She also works extensively as a member of Georgia Tech's Experimental Game Lab and is an advisor to Georgia Tech's Mobile Technology Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~murray/&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's major book is ''Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace'', which asks whether the computer can provide the basis for an expressive narrative form, just as print technology supported the development of the novel and film technology supported the development of movies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} She provides an optimistic answer&lt;!-- just what is that answer? --&gt;. Murray’s analysis rests on an understanding of the computer as a medium of representation with a distinct set of properties. She argues that the computer is procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial, and that it affords three characteristic (but not unique) pleasures: immersion, agency, and transformation. She defines interactivity as the combination of the procedural and the participatory property which together afford the pleasure of agency&lt;!-- is this a direct quote? if so, cite it. actually, it's best to cite it regardless --&gt;. She connects research work on [[artificial intelligence]] with cultural forms such as [[video games|games]], [[film|movies]], [[literature]], and [[television]]. Murray’s main point is that the new computer formats expand the possibilities of expression available for storytelling. To her, "digital transmission has opened up the possibility of long-form storytelling, since audiences can view whole seasons after their original broadcast date, and they can follow story over multiple seasons."&lt;ref&gt;"Inventing the Medium: The Radical Challenge of Humanistic Digital Design," in: ''Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World'', ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray was a guest writer for [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]] and [[Nick Montfort]] ''The New Media Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmediareader.com/&lt;/ref&gt; an anthology of articles on the new media which Janet was the first of the two introduction in the book called "Inventing the Medium."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-intro-murray-excerpt.pdf "Inventing the Medium" -Janet H. Murray]&lt;/ref&gt; She talks about why [[Douglas Engelbart]] is important to the new media. Janet compares and contrasts [[Jorge Borges]]'s "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]" to [[Vannevar Bush]]'s "As We May Think", explaining the similarities and differences between the humanist approach and the scientific approach to digital media. Murray emphasizes that Borges is fascinated by the arbitrariness of language itself, whereas Bush interprets the world not as an imprisoning labyrinth, but a challenging maze waiting to be solved by an appropriately organized and clever team effort (Wardrip-Fruin, 3). She talks about the pros and cons, plus the philosophy of both Borges and Bush, as an introduction to the rest of the articles in ''The New Media Reader''. In addition, she defines the representational power of new media into these four categories: its procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial properties, with the encyclopedic capacity having the most significance in influence (Wardrip-Fruin, 6). Finally, she goes through the history of [[hypertext]], [[video games]], and [[World Wide Web]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Murray’s work has been referenced by game designers, interactive television producers, filmmakers, and journalists. It has been criticized from opposing directions, by writer [[Sven Birkerts]] as a threat to print culture (in ''[[HotWired]]'' magazine and in a televised debate) and by [[ludologist]]s as an inappropriately literary approach to games (''Game Studies'' vol. 1 no. 1).

Murray also has an active role in developing two new degree programs at Georgia Tech which were launched in 2004: the Ph.D. in Digital Media and the [[B.S. in Computational Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcc.gatech.edu/compumedia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027231006/http://lcc.gatech.edu/compumedia/ |archivedate=2009-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the [[Peabody Award]]s [[The George Foster Peabody Awards Board of Jurors|Board of Jurors]] from 2007 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody-awards-board-members&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Kozol''' (born September 5, 1936) is an [[American people|American]] writer, educator, and activist, best known for his books on [[public education in the United States]].

==Education and experience==

Born to [[Harry Kozol]] and Ruth (Massell) Kozol, Jonathan graduated from [[Noble and Greenough School]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;Leaders from the 1960s: A Biographical Sourcebook of American Activism, By David De Leon&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvard University]] ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' in 1958 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in [[English Literature|English literature]]. He was awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He did not, however, complete his Rhodes, deciding instead to go to [[Paris, France|Paris]] to learn to write fiction and nonfiction from experienced authors such as [[William Styron]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], and others who were living in Paris at the time. It was upon his return that he began to tutor children in [[Roxbury, MA]], and soon became a teacher in the [[Boston Public Schools]].  He was fired for teaching a [[Langston Hughes]] poem, as described in ''[[Death at an Early Age]]'', and then became deeply involved in the [[civil rights]] movement. After being fired from Boston Public Schools, he was offered a position to teach at [[Newton Public Schools]], the school district he  attended as a child, and taught there for several years before becoming more deeply involved in social justice work and dedicating more time to writing.

Kozol has since held two [[Guggenheim Fellowships]], has twice been a fellow of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and has also received fellowships from the [[Marshall Field III#Philanthropy|Field]] and [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] Foundations.

Kozol also has worked in the field of [[social psychology]]. He has been working with children in inner-city schools for more than forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, Jonathan (2007). "Letters to a Young Teacher", p. 289. Three Rivers Press, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-307-39372-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kozol is currently on the editorial board of ''Greater Good Magazine'', published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Kozol's contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

==Writing career==
[[File:Jonathan Kozol at Pomona College 17 April 2003.jpg|thumb|Kozol at [[Pomona College]], 2003]]
''[[Death at an Early Age]]'', his first non-fiction book, is a description of his first year as a teacher in the Boston Public Schools. It was published in 1967 and won the [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science, Philosophy and Religion|in Science, Philosophy and Religion]].&lt;ref name=nba1968&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1968 "National Book Awards – 1968"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; It has sold more than two million copies in the United States and Europe.

Among the other books by Kozol are ''Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America'', which received the [[Robert F. Kennedy]] Book award for 1989 and the [[Conscience-in-Media Award]] of the [[American Society of Journalists and Authors]], and ''[[Savage Inequalities|Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools]]'', which won the New England Book Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.

His 1995 book, ''[[Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation]]'', described his visits to the [[South Bronx]] of New York City, the poorest congressional district in the United States. It received the [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]] in 1996, an honor previously granted to the works of Langston Hughes and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].

He published ''Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope'' in 2000 and ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America'' was released September 13, 2005.  Kozol documents the continuing and often worsening segregation in public schools in the United States, and the increasing influence of neoconservative ideology on the way children, particularly children of color and poor children of urban areas, are educated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/American-Apartheid-Education1sep05.htm  Kozol, "Still Separate, Still Unequal: America's Educational Apartheid" published in ''Harper's Magazine'' (v.311, n.1864, September 1, 2005), essay adapted from ''The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629092537/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/American-Apartheid-Education1sep05.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is still active in advocating for integrated public education in the United States and is a critic of the [[school voucher]] movement. He continues to condemn the inequalities of education and the apparently worsening segregation of black and Hispanic children from white children in the segregated public schools of almost every major city of the nation.  Kozol's ethical argument relies heavily on comparisons between rich and poor school districts.  In particular, he analyzes the amount of money spent per child.  He finds that in school districts whose taxpayers and property-owners are relatively wealthy, the per-child annual spending is much higher (for example, over $20,000 per year per child in one district) than in school districts where poor people live (for example, $11,000 per year per child in one district). He asks rhetorically whether it is right that the place of one's birth should determine the quality of one's education.

==Non-profit==

Kozol founded The Education Action Fund, which serves as a nonprofit charitable fund that provides direct assistance to many of the children and families profiled in Jonathan’s books. Donations to the EAF go directly towards children and families living in impoverished or racially isolated areas, and often provide a much-needed relief from financial instability.

'''Matriculation''' is the formal process of entering a [[university]], or of becoming eligible to enter by fulfilling certain academic requirements such as a [[matriculation examination]].

==Australia==
Matriculation, often shortened to "matric", was formerly the successful completion of 6th Form (Year 12), and was only done by students intending to go on to University. Year 11 was known as the 'Leaving' year, which was the end of high school for the majority of students. In the late 60s and early 70s all states replaced matriculation with either a certificate such as the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]], (HSC) in Victoria and NSW, or a University entrance exam such as the [[Tertiary Entrance Exam]] in Western Australia. These have all been renamed (except in NSW) as a State-based certificate, such as the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (VCE) or the [[Western Australian Certificate of Education]] (WACE).

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, the "Matriculation" is the Secondary School Examination (SSC) taken at year 10, and the Intermediate Exams is the Higher Secondary Examination (HSC) taken at year 12. Bangladesh, like the rest of [South Asia], still uses terms such as Matriculation Exams and Intermediate Exams taken from the days of the [[British Raj]] although in England itself these terms were replaced by 'O' or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSEs) and 'A' or Advanced Level Examinations respectively.

==Brazil==

In Brazilian Portuguese, the word "matrícula" refers to the act of enrolling in an educational course, whether it be elementary, high school, college or post-graduate education.

==Canada==
In Canada, the term is used by some older universities to refer to orientation ("[[frosh]]") events,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} however some universities, including [[University of King's College]], still hold formal Matriculation (usually shortened to "matric") ceremonies. [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] also holds formal matriculation ceremonies, during which time incoming students are required to sign a matriculation register, making the practice the closest in format to that conducted by [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] colleges of any university in North America. The ceremony at King's is quite similar to the matriculation ceremonies held in universities such as Oxford or Cambridge.
In [[Ontario]] during the era with [[Ontario Academic Credit|grade 13]], satisfactory completion of grade 12 was considered junior matriculation. Satisfactory completion of grade 13 was senior matriculation. In [[Nova Scotia]], at the present time, Junior matriculation is grade 11 and senior matriculation is completion of grade 12.

==Czech Republic==
At [[Charles University in Prague]], the oldest and most prestigious university in the Czech Republic, matriculation is held at the Great Hall (Magna Aula). The ceremony is attended by students commencing their studies. It is intended as a demonstration of the adoption of student's duties and obtaining of student's rights. The ceremony itself involves students taking the Matriculation Oath of the University and symbolically touching the Faculty mace and shaking the Dean's hand.

Other Czech universities hold ceremonies similar to the one just described.

==Denmark==
In Denmark, the [[University of Copenhagen]] holds a matriculation ceremony each year. The ceremony is held in the Hall of Ceremony in the main building of the University. The ceremony begins with a procession with the rector and the deans in academic dress and other regalia. The ceremony continues with the rector listing the different faculties, after which the different student, shouts when their respective faculty is mentioned. The rector then delivers a speech, after which the rector and the deans leave the ceremony again in procession, after which a party is held on university grounds, to mark the admission of the new students.

==Finland==
{{main article|Matriculation exam (Finland)}}
In [[Finland]], Matriculation (Finnish: ''Ylioppilastutkinto'', Swedish: ''Studentexamen'') is [[matriculation examination|the examination]] taken at the end of [[Secondary education]] to qualify for entry into [[University]]. The test also constitutes the high school's final exam(s), in other words it is a high school graduation exam. Since 1919, the test has been arranged by a national body, the Matriculation Examination Board. Before that, the administration of the test was the responsibility of the [[University of Helsinki]].

==Germany==
The German term ''Immatrikulation'' describes the administrative process of enrolling at university as a student. This can happen for winter semester and, depending on the degree program, also for summer semester. It does not involve a ceremony. A prerequisite for matriculation is generally the ''[[Abitur]]'', which is the standard matriculation examination in Germany, for regular universities and ''Fachhochschulreife'' for [[Fachhochschule|''Fachhochschulen'']] (Universities of Applied Sciences). Both ''Abitur'' and ''Fachhochschulreife'' are school leaving certificates which students receive after passing their final examinations at some types of German secondary schools.

==Hong Kong==
{{See also|Joint University Programmes Admissions System|Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education}}
In Hong Kong, the term is used interchangeably with the completion of [[sixth-form]]. After sitting for the [[HKCEE|Certificate of Education examinations]], eligible students receive two years of sixth-form education, upon completion, they sit for the [[HKALE|A-level examinations]]. Most secondary schools offer the sixth-form programme, and there are also a few sixth-form colleges. Students obtaining good grades in the A-level examinations will be admitted to a university. The [[334 Scheme|education reforms]] of Hong Kong in the 2000s have replaced the fourth- and fifth-form education, which prepared students for the HKCEE, and the sixth-form education with a three-year senior secondary education, which leads to the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] Examination. The last sixth-form students graduated and took the A-level examinations in 2012; in the same year the first students studying the new senior secondary curriculum graduated and took the first HKDSE examinations.

==India==

In India, it is a term commonly used to refer to the final year of 10th class, which ends at tenth 
Board (tenth grade), and the qualification consequently received by passing the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|national board exams]] or the [[Secondary School Certificate|state board exams]], commonly called "matriculation exams".

India still uses terms such as Matriculation Exams and Intermediate Exams taken from the days of [[British Raj|British rule]] although in England itself these terms were replaced by 'O' or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called [[GCSEs]]) and 'A' or Advanced Level Examinations.

English is the standard language for matriculation for science subjects, while regional languages are also an option. Most students who pass matriculation, or class 10, are 15–16 years old. Upon successfully passing, a student may continue onto the Higher secondary school. Most students who pass class 12 are 17–18 years old. The [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] and [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] boards conduct twelfth standard courses nationally, while [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|state boards]] operate at the state-level. Although the basic curriculum is prescribed by the CBSE.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, Matriculation programmes are run by public universities and the Ministry of Education (MoE). Matriculation programmes offered by public universities offer fewer options for further study upon completion of the said program as they are limited to that particular university.

The matriculation programme provided by the MoE is a one-year pre-U program sponsored by the Malaysian government. SPM ([[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]] or the Malaysian Certificate of Education) holders can apply for MoE Matriculation during their SPM year [Form 5]. Students that are offered the matriculation programme will be posted to several Matriculation Colleges within Malaysia.

After MoE Matriculation, they can further their studies in local universities within Malaysia. Several universities in New Zealand and UK recognize the MoE Matriculation as a pre-U qualification. Matriculation was introduced after the repeal of the racial based quota for public university admission.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Apart from the matriculation programmes, there is the STPM programme ([Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia] or Malaysian Higher School Certificate), the standardised national examinations taken by Form 6 students.  STPM is different from the matriculation programme in terms of its duration (2 years vs. 1 year), syllabus (breadth and depth), marking method (standardised assessment nationwide vs. assessment by matriculation college itself) and passing rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Nepal==
{{Main|School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)}}
In Nepal, it refers to the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate (SLC)]] before now it is known as Secondary education examination (SEE) (As per new education act 2016) taken at year 10, before Intermediate Exams (Higher Secondary or 10+2) taken in subsequent two years prior to university entry. School leaving certificate (SLC) or Secondary education examination (SEE) is the main examination which is also called "Iron gate" in Nepal. Although SLC and 10+2 are widely used, some educational institutions follow the British system with O' or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSE) and A' or Advanced Level Examinations respectively.

==Pakistan==

In [[Pakistan]], "matriculation" (usually shortened to “matric”) is the term that refers to the final examinations that take place at the end of 9th and 10th grades. These Examinations are usually taken up by students aged 14 to 16 years.

It results in the issuance of [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) or [[Technical School Certificate]] (TSC). After the SSC (or TSC), students may proceed for 11th year of education at College. After successful completion of the 11th (HSSC-1) and the 12th (HSSC-2) years in college, they get the Intermediate certificate [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSSC) and become eligible to enter universities in Pakistan or in other countries. Pakistan still uses terms such as Matriculation Exams and Intermediate Exams taken from the days of [[British Raj|British rule]], although in England itself these terms were replaced with 'O' or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSEx) and 'A' or Advanced Level Examination.

==South Africa==
{{main article|Matriculation (South Africa)}}
In South Africa, "matriculation" (usually shortened to "matric") is a term commonly used to refer to the final year of high school and the qualification received on graduating from high school (now officially the National Senior Certificate or NSC). Strictly speaking "matriculation" refers to the minimum university entrance requirements (usually called a matric exemption as it provides an exemption from writing entrance exams when applying for University entrance).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==United Kingdom==
In the British universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=NWTN661I|name=Newton, Sir Isaac}} As an example of the continual use of the term matriculation in the ACAD database for any student entering any of the Colleges at Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Durham|Durham]], and the [[New College of the Humanities]], the term is used for the ceremony at which new students are entered into the register (in [[Latin]] ''[[matricula]]'') of the university, at which point they become members of the university. Oxford requires matriculants to wear academic dress with [[Academic dress of Oxford University|subfusc]] during the ceremony. At Cambridge and Durham, policy regarding the wearing of academic dress varies amongst the colleges. Separate matriculation ceremonies are held by some of the colleges in Durham. Also at Durham, not all students are entered into the register, but one person from each college is selected to sign their own name for the whole college. At the University of St Andrews as well as the other [[ancient universities of Scotland]], matriculation involves signing the [[Sponsio Academica]], a pledge to abide by university rules and to support the institution. In 2015, [[Bishop Grosseteste University]] Lincoln introduced a Matriculation event for all new students.

At most British universities there is no formal ceremony. The term "matriculation" is not used by many, with the terms "enrolment" and "registration" being more commonly employed to describe the administrative process of becoming a member of the university.

At Oxford and Cambridge, matriculation was formerly associated with entrance examinations taken before or shortly after matriculation, known as [[Responsions]] at Oxford and the [[Previous Examination]] at Cambridge, both abolished in 1960. University-wide entrance examinations were subsequently re-introduced at both universities, but abolished in 1995. More limited subject-based tests have since been introduced.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], universities and colleges that have a formal matriculation ceremony include: [[Adrian College]], [[Albion College]], [[Anna Maria College]], [[Asbury University]], [[Assumption College]], [[Belmont Abbey College]], [[Belmont University]], [[Boston College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/offices/fye/conversations.html |title=Conversations in the First Year&amp;nbsp;— Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]], [[Columbia University]], [[Culver-Stockton College]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Duquesne University]], [[Hamline University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamline.edu/ |title=Hamline University &amp;#124; Saint Paul, Minnesota |publisher=Hamline.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], [[Jacksonville University|Jacksonville University in Jacksonville, FL]], [[Kalamazoo College]], [[Kenyon College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenyon.edu/x6916.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060901095052/http://www.kenyon.edu/x6916.xml |archivedate=2006-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence University]], http://lawrence.edu, [[Lyndon State College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyndonstate.edu/ |title=Lyndon&amp;nbsp;— A Vermont State College |publisher=Lyndonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyon College]], [[Marietta College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marietta.edu/academics/traditions/matriculation/index.html |title=URL retrieved 2007-August-26. |publisher=Marietta.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528154846/http://www.marietta.edu/academics/traditions/matriculation/index.html |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McKendree University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckendree.edu/news/nso-2012.php Class of 2016 Matriculates at McKendree] Retrieved 2012-August-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Mount Union College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.muc.edu/Newsroom/matriculation_convocation_welcomes_freshmen_to_mount_union.aspx,|title=URL retrieved 2008-April-11|work=muc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moravian College]], [[Muhlenberg College]], [[Occidental College]], [[Randolph-Macon College]], [[Rice University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmc.edu/News/09-09-04%20Matriculation%20Ceremony.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805141715/http://www.rmc.edu/News/09-09-04%20Matriculation%20Ceremony.aspx |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Leo University]], [[Scripps College]], [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], [[Tufts University]], The [[University of Saint Mary (Kansas)]], [[University of Wisconsin–Baraboo/Sauk County]], [[Virginia Military Institute]], [[Wabash College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wabash.edu/dearoldwabash/2014/09/04/ringing-in-the-new-a-special-time-at-wabash/|title=Ringing in the new – a special time at Wabash {{!}} Dear Old Wabash|website=blog.wabash.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walsh University]], [[Washington and Jefferson College]], and [[Willamette University]].  Some medical schools highlight matriculation with a [[white coat ceremony]].  For example, UAB School of Medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uab.edu|title=UAB - The University of Alabama at Birmingham - Home|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; does so.

At most universities and colleges in the United States, "matriculation" refers to mere enrollment or registration as a student at a university or college by a student intending to earn a degree, an event which involves no special ceremony.

===Special student===
Universities and colleges in the United States commonly have a category of students known as '''special students''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/special_students_admissions.php |title=Special Students: Admissions |date= |website=Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128000441/http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/special_students_admissions.php |archivedate=November 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://continuingstudies.wisc.edu/advising/univspec.htm |title=University Special Students |date= |website=University of Wisconsin – Madison Continuing Education |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/admissions/graduate/special.html |title=Undergraduate Special Student Admissions |date= |website=MIT Graduate Admissions |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''non-matriculated students'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/spd/graduate/nonmatric.html |title=Non-Matriculated Graduate Student Status |date= |website=Stonybrook University School of Professional Development |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231232515/http://www.stonybrook.edu/spd/graduate/nonmatric.html |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grad.washington.edu/admissions/gnm.shtml |title=Graduate Non-Matriculated Students |date= |website=University of Washington |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115233413/http://www.grad.washington.edu/admissions/gnm.shtml |archivedate=November 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''non-matriculating students'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sasundergrad.rutgers.edu/current-students/nonmatriculating-students |title=Nonmatriculating Students |date= |website=Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally these are students who are not merely auditing a class, but receive credit which is potentially transferable, pay full tuition, and often receive benefits that other students receive such as access to facilities and health care.  These students typically are enrolled as matriculated students at other institutions and are visiting scholars of some type.  However, sometimes students attend classes for the purpose of a standalone non-degree education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10123">The term '''microlecture''' is ''not'' used here to refer to [[microcontent]] for [[microlearning]], but to actual instructional content that is formatted for [[E-learning|online]] and [[mobile learning]] using a constructivist approach. More specifically, as described in the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]],&lt;ref&gt;Shieh, David. (2009). These lectures are gone in 60 seconds. ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 55(26), A1,A13.&lt;/ref&gt; these are approximately 60 second presentations with a specific structure. They are not just brief (one minute) presentations: although Dr. McGrew had success with "one minute lectures"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGrew | first1 = L.

David M. Penrose (aka the One Minute Professor), an independent instructional designer and eLearning consultant, has articulated the process for creating these '''microlectures'''. As stated (Shea, 2009), these specific [[lecture]]s are combined with specific activities designed to promote the epistemic engagement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shea | first1 = P. | last2 = Bidjerano | first2 = T. | year = 2009 | title = Community of inquiry as a theoretical framework to foster "epistemic engagement" and "cognitive presence" in online education | url = | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 543–553 | doi = 10.1016/j.compedu.2008.10.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the learner.

'''National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research''' ({{lang-bn|জাতীয় বস্ত্র প্রকৌশল ও গবেষণা ইনস্টিটিউট}}) is also known as '''NITER'''. Located in [[Savar]], [[Dhaka District]], it is the largest undergraduate textile campus in Bangladesh. It offers the Bachelor of Science in [[Textile manufacturing|Textile Engineering]],  [[Industrial and production engineering|Industrial and Production Engineering]] and  Fashion &amp; Apparel Design  in co-ordination with the [[University of Dhaka]]. The institute has a partnership between the [[Bangladesh Textile Mills Association]] (BTMA) and the [[Ministry of Textiles and Jute]]. It is a public-private partnership constituent educational institution under [[University of Dhaka]].

==History==
NITER was originally a training center, Textile Industry Development Center (TIDC), a public institution which was established in January 1979 by the [[government of Bangladesh]] to impart training for professionals engaged in the textile manufacturing industry. In 1994, its name changed to National Institute of Textile Training Research and Design (NITTRAD). Later, the [[Ministry of Textiles and Jute]] decided to run NITTRAD under [[public–private partnership]] (PPP) program and handed over its operational management to Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) under the Ministry of Textiles and Jute. From 1 January 2013, the Ministry of Textiles and Jute, according to a suggestion from the University of Dhaka, changed the name of the Institute to National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research.
From 2010 to 2011 session NITER started Bachelor of Science in [[Textile engineering]] course under the University of Dhaka.

It also provides practical and training classes of textile engineering to students of private universities in Bangladesh.

The '''National Space Centre''' is a museum and educational resource covering the fields of [[Outline of space science|space science]] and [[astronomy]], along with a space research programme in partnership with the University of Leicester. It is located on the north side the city of [[Leicester]], England, next to the [[River Soar]]. Many of the exhibits, including upright rockets, are housed in a tower with minimal steel supports and a semi-transparent cladding of [[ETFE]] 'pillows'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grimshaw.global/projects/national-space-centre/| title=Grimshaw projects: National Space Centre, Leicester, UK| website=Grimshaw: Architecture, Planning, Industrial Design|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become one of Leicester's most recognisable landmarks.

==History==
The building was designed by [[Nicholas Grimshaw]], and it opened to the public on 30 June 2001.&lt;ref name=10years/&gt; The tower is {{Cvt|42|m}} tall and claims to be the only place to house upright space rockets indoors.&lt;ref name=10years&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-13812684|title=National Space Centre in Leicester celebrates 10 years|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Leicester===
The centre arose from a partnership between the [[University of Leicester]]'s Space Research Centre and local government agencies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The total project cost was £52m, £26m of which came from a [[Millennium Commission]] grant, and the rest from [[private sector]] sponsors.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/bulletin/spacecentrejune2001.pdf| title= The National Space Centre: The countdown begins|website = University of Leicester Bulletin|year=2001| issue=Supplement: June/July 2001| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run as an educational charity, and offers science workshops for school children of all ages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The National Space Centre currently has post-doctoral science researchers based at the University of Leicester's Space Research Centre (SRC) and the University of Nottingham's Institute of Engineering Surveying and Space Geodesy (IESSG).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''[[official language]]s of the [[United Nations]]''' are the six languages that are used in UN meetings, and in which all official UN documents are written. In alphabetical order, they are:

* [[Arabic]] ([[Modern Standard Arabic]])
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Nation Official Languages | url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Written character: [[Simplified Chinese]])

 | accessdate = 2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French language|French]]
* [[Russian language|Russian]]
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]

==Description==
These languages are used at meetings of various [[United Nations System|UN organs]], particularly the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] (Article 51 of its Rules of Procedure), the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] (Article 41 of its Rules of Procedure). Each representative of a country may speak in any one of these six languages, or may speak in any language and provide interpretation into one of the six official languages. The UN provides [[simultaneous interpretation]] from the official language into the other five official languages, via the [[United Nations Interpretation Service]].

The six official languages are also used for the dissemination of official documents. Generally, the texts in each of the six languages are equally authoritative.

The United Nations has drawn criticism for relying too heavily on English, and not enough on the other five official languages. Spanish-speaking member nations formally brought this to the attention of the Secretary-General in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1399761.stm |title=Plea to UN: 'More Spanish please' |date=2001-06-21 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] then responded that full parity of the six official languages was unachievable within current budgetary restraints, but he nevertheless attached great importance to improving the linguistic balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter dated 18 June 2001 |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/56/a56176.pdf |date=2001-06-18 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009, resolutions of the General Assembly have urged the Secretariat to respect the parity of the six official languages, especially in the dissemination of public information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/63/100%20A-B&amp;Lang=E Resolution 63/100]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114235019/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F63%2F100%20A-B&amp;Lang=E |date=14 January 2014 }} Questions relating to information (5 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/63/306 Resolution 63/306]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101347/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F63%2F306 |date=3 April 2015 }} Multilingualism (9 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-61-266.pdf Resolution A/RES/61/266] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715041928/http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-61-266.pdf |date=15 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018}} Multilingualism 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; resolutions concerning human resources management at the UN, the General Assembly had emphasized "the paramount importance of the equality of the six official languages of the United Nations" and requested that the Secretary-General "ensure that vacancy announcements specified the need for either of the working languages of the Secretariat, unless the functions of the post required a specific working language".

The Secretary-General's most recent report on multilingualism was issued on 4 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |id=UN Doc ID A/65/488 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/65/488 |title=Multilingualism |publisher=United Nations Secretary-General |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on 19 July 2011, the General Assembly adopted Resolution No. A/RES/65/311 on multilingualism, calling on the Secretary-General, once again, to ensure that all six official languages are given equally favourable working conditions and resources. The resolution noted with concern that the multilingual development of the UN website had improved at a much slower rate than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |id=UN Doc ID GA/11116 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/ga11116.doc.htm |publisher=UN Department of Public Information |title=Adopting Resolution on Multilingualism, General Assembly Emphasizes Importance of Equality Among Six Official United Nations Languages |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six official languages spoken at the UN are the [[first language|first]] or [[second language]] of 2.8 billion people on the planet, less than half of the world population. The six languages are official languages in more than half the countries in the world (about one hundred).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==
The [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]], its 1945 constituent document, did not expressly provide for official languages of the [[United Nations|UN]]. The Charter was enacted in five languages (Chinese, French, Russian, English, and Spanish) and provided (in [[Chapter XIX of the United Nations Charter|Article 111]]) that the five texts are equally authoritative.

In 1946, the first session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted rules of procedure concerning languages that purported to apply to "all the organs of the United Nations, other than the [[International Court of Justice]]", setting out five official languages and two [[working languages]] (English and French).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2(I) General Assembly Resolution 2 (I)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109134851/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F2%28I%29 |date=9 January 2015 }} Rules of Procedure Concerning Languages, 1 February 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the second session of the General Assembly adopted permanent rules of procedure, Resolution 173 (II). The part of those rules relating to language closely followed the 1946 rules, except that the 1947 rules did not purport to apply to other UN organs, just the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="legal.un.org"&gt;{{cite web |page=4 |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_187.pdf |year=1966 |volume=2 |title=Preparation of Multilingual Treaties: Memorandum by the Secretariat |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a proposal had been in the works to add Spanish as a third working language in addition to English and French. This was adopted in Resolution 262 (III), passed on 11 December 1948.&lt;ref name="legal.un.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/262(III) Resolution 262 (III)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109195740/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F262%28III%29 |date=9 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Russian was added as a working language of the General Assembly &lt;!-- as well as of the Security Council? --&gt; so that, of the GA's five official languages, four (all but Chinese) were working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19681218&amp;id=NskyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y-0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3900,651877 |title=Russian to be included as UN working language |date=1968-12-18 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |work=Ottawa Citizen |author=Robert Reford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2479(XXIII) Resolution 2479 (XXIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160807/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F2479%28XXIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Russian among the working languages of the General Assembly (amendment to rule 51 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly) and question of including Russian and Spanish among the working languages of the Security Council (21 December 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the General Assembly made Chinese a working language and added Arabic as both an official language and working language of the GA. Thus all six official languages were also working languages. Arabic was made an official and working language of "the General Assembly and its Main Committees", whereas the other five languages had status in all GA committees and subcommittees (not just the main committees). The Arab members of the UN had agreed to pay the costs of implementing the resolution, for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/3189(XXVIII) Resolution 3189 (XXVIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160811/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F3189%28XXVIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Chinese among the working languages of the General Assembly and the Security Council (18 December 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/3190(XXVIII) Resolution 3190 (XXVIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160841/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F3190%28XXVIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Arabic among the official and the working languages of the General Assembly and its Main Committees (18 December 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/3191(XXVIII) Resolution 3191 (XXVIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160842/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F3191%28XXVIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Chinese among the working languages of the General Assembly, its committees and its subcommittees and inclusion of Arabic among the official and the working languages of the General Assembly and its Main Committees: amendments to rules 51 to 59 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the General Assembly got rid of this final distinction, making Arabic an official and working language of all its committees and subcommittees, as of 1 January 1982. At the same time, the GA requested the Security Council to include Arabic among its official and working languages, and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] to include Arabic among its official languages, by 1 January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/35/a35r219e.pdf Resolution 35/219] Use of Arabic in the subsidiary organs of the General Assembly, in the Security Council and in the Economic and Social Council: amendments to rules 51, 52, 54 and 56 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly (17 December 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1983, the Security Council (like the General Assembly) recognized six official and working languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502000000/http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm |date=2 May 2012 }} Rules 41 to 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], as of 1992, there were six official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) of which three were working languages (English, French, and Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/pdf/rules.pdf Rules of Procedure of the Economic and Social Council] rules 32 to 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] were added as [[working languages]] in the Economic and Social Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214205555/http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml |date=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights]] was presented to [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;"Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights, 1996". Cultural Rights: Culture and Development. Retrieved 9 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but has yet to be officially ratified.&lt;ref&gt; "International PEN: Linguistic Rights and Translation". UNESCO's List of NGOs. Unesco.org. Retrieved 9 March 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;  Many international linguistics still expect that the UN will eventually add new official languages such as [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] to represent Asian and African populations and put more resources into assisting endangered languages. 

In 2002, it was reportedly proposed to the then current UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that the UN develops a 'Semi-Official' or 'Regional' language status for commonly spoken languages that do not have Official status so that a higher percentage of the worlds population could be familiar with UN actions. As of 2006, the six official languages are the first or second language of 2.8 billion people on the planet, which is less than half of the world population. The list of potential 'Semi-Official' or 'Regional' languages, many of which can be considered lingua francas in their areas, could include: [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Chichewa language|Chichewa]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[German language|German]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Oromo language|Oromo]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Shanghaiese]], [[Shona language|Shona]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Tamil language| Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Urdu]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[International Sign Language]], [[International Braille]], and possibly an [[international auxiliary language]] such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido language|Ido]], or [[Interlingua]]. As of 2017, the UN has taken no public action to approve a "Semi-Official" or "Regional" status mainly due to expected translation costs.

{{cns|date=April 2018|text=As of April 2018, the [[United Nations Secretariat]] uses two working languages: English and French. All [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretaries-General]] have had a working knowledge of both languages.}}

Since the late 1990's and increasingly in the 2000's, there has been much discussion of adding Hindi, Portuguese, Swahili, Malay and to a lesser extent, Turkish, Bengali, or other languages as additional official languages. The most recent example being when the Deputy Secretary General was asked in January 2018 about the process of adding Hindi as an official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/db180103.doc.htm|title=Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most proposed [[List of languages by the number of countries in which they are recognized as an official language|languages are spoken in more than one nation]] and/or have a [[List of languages by total number of speakers|large number of speakers]]. 

As of June 2018, the media branch of the United Nations, UN News (https://news.un.org/), includes website translations into Portuguese and Swahili in addition to the 6 official languages.&lt;ref name="un.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/12/324362-top-un-official-stresses-need-internet-multilingualism-bridge-digital-divide|title=Top UN official stresses need for Internet multilingualism to bridge digital divide|date=14 December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UN documents and websites are already translated into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (referred to as Bangla), [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] but not on an official or consistent basis.

==New proposed languages==

===Bengali===
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] is one of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most widely spoken languages in the world]], ranking seventh, with over 240 million speakers.&lt;ref name="ethnologue1"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size
 | title=Ethnologue| publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] [[Sheikh Hasina]] argued in front of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] that the Bengali language should be made one of the official languages of the UN. This was backed by a resolution adopted unanimously by the assembly of the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]] in December, and support was also given by the states of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bengali 'should be UN language'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8425744.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi===
[[Hindi]] is one of the official languages of [[India]] and [[Fiji]] and is also spoken in [[Suriname]], [[Mauritius]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Guyana]]. It is mutually intelligible to a high degree with [[Urdu]] which is spoken in Pakistan and together they are often considered the same language, referred to as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] or Hindi-Urdu. Although very similar verbally, they do have different written scripts; Hindi is written in the [[Devanagari script|Devanagari script]] and Urdu is written in the [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaʿlīq script]]. [[Hindi language|Hindi]] has more than 550 million speakers in India alone, of whom 422 million are native, 98.2 million are second language speakers, and 31.2 million are third language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement5.aspx|title=Census of India: Comparative speaker's strength of Scheduled Languages-1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001|first=|last=ORGI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indiaspeak-English-is-our-2nd-language/articleshow/5680962.cms|title=Indiaspeak: English is our 2nd language – Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindi is the [[lingua franca]] of the majority of Indians in the subcontinent, along with Pakistan (as Urdu), Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, with its importance as a global language increasing day by day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siasat.com/news/hindi-varanasi-norwegians-whats-sambandh-982592/|title=Hindi.

In 2007, it was reported that the government would "make immediate diplomatic moves to seek the status of an official language for Hindi at the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/holnus/001200707150321.htm |title=Hindi at UN: India to take action to get official status |date=2007-07-15 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |work=The Hindu |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 press release from its Ministry of External Affairs, the Government of India has been "working actively" to have [[Hindi]] recognized as an official language of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacurrentaffairs.org/hindi-in-uno/ |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |title=Hindi in UNO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pibmumbai.gov.in/scripts/detail.asp?releaseId=E2009PR1426 |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |title=Government working actively for Hindi as official language of UN: S M Krishna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Nepal]]'s Vice President [[Parmananda Jha]] stated his firm support for the inclusion of Hindi as an official language of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/hindi-official-language-un-nepal-vice-president-2042199.html|title=Hindi should be an official language in the UN: Nepal Vice President – Firstpost|date=12 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers in India|linguistic diversity]] in India, the expansion of Hindi has become political and has led to a rise of English in the post-British colonial period. This is why English is included along with Hindi on Indian passports. If the Indian government is able to grant more federal-level protection for other languages such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]], as a compromise then the UN may be more likely to grant a vote on adding Hindi as an official language. But as of now, the international community does not seem to see enough benefit to overcome the potential political issues that adding Hindi as official language of the UN could cause. 

===Malay===
[[Malay language|Malay]] is an [[Austronesian]] language spoken throughout the [[Malay Peninsula]] and large swaths of [[Southeast Asia]]. [[Malay language|Malay]] is an official language of [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] (which is the 4th most populous nation in the world),&lt;ref name="imf2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik|title=Jumlah dan Distribusi Penduduk|date=May 2010|accessdate=13 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], [[East Timor]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Islands]] and is a recognized minority language in [[Thailand]] where is it spoken in the [[Narathiwat]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Pattani]] regions, and the [[Philippines]] where it is spoken in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], and [[Bataraza]] and [[Balabac]] in [[Palawan]].  

Spoken by more than 280 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu/indonesian/2012/03/10/how-many-people-speak-indonesian/|title=How many people speak Indonesian?|website=ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malay language|Malay]] is considered the 7th most commonly spoken language by Ethnologue 2017. Malay has several names depending on the local vernacular designation, for example it is referred to as [[Bahasa Melayu]] in Malaysia, [[Bahasa Indonesia]] in Indonesia and [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]] in Thailand. The level of [[mutual intelligibility]] between these standards is debated. Having Malay as an official language of the UN would expand its presence into Asia which is growing rapidly. Malay is also prominent on the internet as the Malay language has the sixth most Internet users of all languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===
Many [[Lusophone]]s have advocated for greater recognition of their language, being the sixth most spoken language in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread across four continents: [[Portugal]] in [[Europe]]; [[Brazil]] (the largest [[lusophone]] nation) in [[South America]]; [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] in [[Africa]]; and in [[Asia]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Macau]].

===Swahili===
[[Swahili language|Swahili]] is a [[lingua franca]] throughout eastern Africa and is especially prevalent in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Swahili, known as Kiswahili by its speakers, is an official language of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins 1961&lt;/ref&gt;  is an official language of the [[African Union]] and is officially recognised as a lingua franca of the [[East African Community]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eac.int/treaty/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=206&amp;Itemid=331&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commonly spoken languages in Africa, is a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools and is increasingly being used in eastern [[Burundi]] and northern [[Mozambique]].

With between 50 – 100 million speakers, Swahili is lexiconically similar to other eastern Bantu languages such as [[Comorian language|Comorian]] which have differing levels of mutual intelligibility. Swahili is already used unofficially in many UN organizations as the [[United Nations Office at Nairobi]], one of the four major UN global offices (in addition to offices in [[Headquarters of the United Nations|New York City]], [[United Nations Office at Vienna|Vienna]], and [[United Nations Office at Geneva|Geneva]]), is located in [[Nairobi|Nairobi]], Kenya. The media branch of the UN, UN News (https://news.un.org/), already includes translations into Swahili.&lt;ref name="un.org1"/&gt;

===Turkish===
In September 2011, during a meeting with UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] expressed a desire to see [[Turkish language|Turkish]] become an official UN language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/component/content/article/127-ana-manset-haberleri-en/94584-erdogan-meets-un-sg-ban-ki-moon |publisher=Anadolu Agency |title=Erdogan meets U.N.

==Coordinator for multilingualism==
In a 1999 resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to "appoint a senior Secretariat official as coordinator of questions relating to multilingualism throughout the Secretariat".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/54/64 Resolution 54/64]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120552/http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A%2FRES%2F54%2F64 |date=4 June 2011 }} adopted 6 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the UN's Department of Public Information announced an initiative of six "language days" to be observed throughout the year, one for each official language, with the goal of celebrating linguistic diversity and learning about the importance of cross-cultural communication.&lt;ref name="languagedays"&gt;{{cite press release |id=UN Doc ID OBV/853 PI/1926 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/obv853.doc.htm |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=Department of Public Information to Launch 'Language Days at the United Nations' |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The days and their historical significance are:
* [[UN Arabic Language Day]]: 18 December (the date on which the [[United Nations General Assembly]] designated Arabic as the sixth official language of the United Nations in 1973)&lt;ref name=firstfrench&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34136&amp;Cr=multilingualism&amp;Cr1=674 |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=First-ever French language day celebrated at UN |publisher=UN News Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN observances"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/observances/multilingualism.shtml |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=United Nations Observances – Multilingualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[UN English Language Day]]: 23 April ("the date traditionally observed as the birthday of [[William Shakespeare]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/englishlanguageday/ |title=English Language Day at the United Nations, 23 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[UN French Language Day]]: 20 March (corresponding to the [[International Francophonie Day|Journée internationale de la Francophonie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/newsFr/storyF.asp?NewsID=24785&amp;Cr=France&amp;Cr1= |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=L'ONU célèbre la Journée de la langue française |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

* [[UN Spanish Language Day]]: 12 October (celebrated in the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]] as "Día de la Hispanidad"; compare [[Columbus Day]])&lt;ref name="UN observances"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/portal/cache/offonce/home/pid/22000 |title=Spanish Language Day to be celebrated at HQ on Tuesday, 12 October 2010 |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2011-07-26 |publisher=deleGATE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN specialized agencies==
UN independent agencies have their own sets of official languages that sometimes are different from that of the principal UN organs. For example, the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] has nine official languages including Hindi, Italian, and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001874/187429e.pdf |year=2010 |title=Rules of Procedure of the General Conference}}, Rule 54&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Postal Union]] has just one official language, French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upu.int/en/the-upu/languages.html |publisher=Universal Postal Union |title=Universal Postal Union – Languages |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IFAD]] has four official languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/basic/gc/e/!05govco.pdf |accessdate=2010-08-03 |title=Rules of Procedure of the Governing Council}}, Rule 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/basic/eb/e/!06exboa.pdf |title=Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board |accessdate=2010-08-03}}, Rule 26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- for a table giving the official languages and working languages of various UN independent agencies, as of 2002, see Annex I(b) of the JIU report "Implementation of Multilingualism in the United Nations System" www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/58/93 --&gt;

== Parallels with other multilingual institutions ==
The next largest international grouping after the UN is the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} which is exclusively English speaking. All other international bodies in commerce, transport and sport have tended to the adoption of one or a few languages as the means of communication. This is usually English, closely followed by French (see: [[list of international organisations which have French as an official language]]). Regional groups have adopted what is common to other elements of their ethnic or religious background. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]] is usually adopted across Muslim nation groups. Most of non-Arab Africa is either Francophone or Anglophone because of their imperial past, but there is also a [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|lusophone grouping of countries]] for the same reason.

'''Margaret Ann''' "'''Peggy'''" '''Spencer''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (née '''Hull'''; 24 September 1920 &amp;ndash; 25 May 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-36387532|work=BBC News|title=Peggy Spencer, star of ''Come Dancing'', dies aged 95|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British professional [[ballroom dancer]], [[choreographer]], competition adjudicator, and organizer. 

Peggy married Jack Spencer in 1940, and had two children, Helena and Michael. The marriage was not successful and they divorced in 1947. Peggy formed a close relationship with her brother-in-law Frank, whom she eventually married in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;ISTD biography: [http://www.istd.org/about/autobiographys/pspencer.html Mrs Peggy Spencer MBE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127104102/http://www.istd.org/about/autobiographys/pspencer.html |date=January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, she and Frank (a musician and a dancer before the Second World War) ran the Royston Ballroom in [[Penge]], South London. Peggy was a regular TV dance commentator. She was a leading coach for competitive Latin dancers, and was influential in both Ballroom and Latin American branches of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]]. Her [[ballroom formation]] team was twice invited to dance for the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. For 40 years, her teams appeared in the ''[[Come Dancing]]'' TV programme.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1968"&gt;Spencer, Frank and Peggy 1968. ''Come Dancing''. Allen, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peggy choreographed  a dance sequence for a [[Beatles]] video ("[[Your Mother Should Know]]"), and the tango for [[Rudolph Nureyev]] in the film ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'' (1977). She was a choreographer for the ''[[Burn the Floor]]'' dance show, which combined ballroom dances with modern ideas. More than most things she enjoyed appearing on the BBC's children's show ''[[Blue Peter]]'', where she brought young dancers from her classes to demonstrate. She was the subject of the TV show ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' in 1993.&lt;ref name="Spencer 1968"/&gt;

In 2004. Peggy Spencer became President of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]]. She received multiple awards for her work in teaching and adjudicating in ballroom dancing, including eight [[Carl Alan Award]]s. She and Frank were both appointed [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[[London Gazette]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:Rename media|rename media]]&lt;nowiki&gt;|Peter Gray (psychology professor)|psychologist is a protected term and his prior "psychologist" title is misleading and false}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''Peter Gray''' (born 1944) is an [[United States|American]] researcher and scholar who is a [[research professor]] of psychology at [[Boston College]]. He is the author of a widely used introductory psychology [[textbook]], ''Psychology'' (Worth Publishers, with co-author David Bjorklund beginning with the 7th edition),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpublishers.com/gray/|title=Gray Bridge Page|website=www.worthpublishers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; now in its seventh edition. The book broke new ground when the first edition was published (in 1991) as the first general introductory psychology textbook that brought a Darwinian perspective to the entire field. He is also author of ''Free to Learn: Why Unleashing the Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier, More Self-Reliant, and Better Students for Life'' (Basic Books, 2013), and he writes a popular blog for ''Psychology Today'' magazine entitled "[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn Freedom to Learn]".

Gray is a well-known critic of standard educational systems and is frequently invited to speak to groups of educators, parents, and researchers about children's needs for free play, the psychological damage inflicted on children through our present methods of schooling, and the ways in which children are designed, by natural selection, to control their own education. He is a founder and current board president of the [[Alliance for Self-Directed Education]], which is dedicated to promoting opportunities for [[Self-Directed Education]] for children and teenagers as replacement for coercive schooling. He is also a founder and board member of [https://letgrow.org Let Grow], which is dedicated to renewing children’s freedom to play and explore, outdoors, in public spaces, without continuous adult supervision.

== Academic career ==

Peter Gray graduated in 1962 from Cabot School in [[Cabot, Vermont]].  He then majored in psychology at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] in [[New York City]] and graduated ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]''. His experiences working at camps and recreation centers in high school and college helped to shape his future academic interests in play and child development. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Biology|biological sciences]] from the [[Rockefeller University]] in 1972, and, in that same year, joined the Psychology Department at [[Boston College]]. There he moved up the ranks from Assistant to Associate to Full Professor, serving at various times as department chair, director of the undergraduate program, and director of the graduate program. In 2002 he retired from his teaching position and accepted the appointment he now holds, as research professor.

Gray's research publications span a wide range. Although he is generally known as an evolutionary psychology theorist/researcher, he has conducted and published research in neuroendocrinology, animal behavior, developmental psychology, anthropology, and education. He is most well known for his research concerned with children's natural ways of learning and the role of play in children's development.

In 1972, at the 6th Yugoslavian congress of speleology, Jakopin proposed volume as the main cave parameter in the paper ''O numeričnem vrednotenju kraških objektov'' / ''Numerical Valuation of Objects on Karst'', measured from a computer-based cave model&lt;ref name="NVOOOK"&gt;{{cite conference

In 1974 he made a [[3D modeling|3D model]] for approximation of cave space, based on a series of connected polygonal [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] and used it to make a 3D survey of Skednena jama cave, a fossil [[ponor]] at the northern rim of the Planinsko polje [[polje|karst field]] in Slovenia. By 1979 he developed a computer program to support the 3D model, to compute its vertice coordinates and to calculate the model (and cave) parameters: length, surface and volume. In 1981 Jakopin published the results for Skednena jama cave in the paper ''Macrostereological Evaluation of Cave Space''. The model had 305 vertices, 51 cross sections, total length was 205 m, surface area 8900 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and volume 6.500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with error estimated at below 5%.&lt;ref name="MECS"&gt;{{cite conference

Early in 1981 a larger cave, Mačkovica, located in the same area as Skednena jama cave, was surveyed. Here the model consisted of 106 cross sections and 709 vertices for the length of 650 m and volume of 38.800 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

After [[microcomputer|microcomputers]] became widely available in the early eighties Jakopin developed a different method of volume calculation which could be performed with much less computing power. Instead of computing cave model segment parameters by cutting it iteratively into ever thinner parallel slices&lt;ref name="MECS"/&gt; it was based on breaking up every segment into a series of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrons]], the parameters of which can be computed directly.&lt;ref name="CVZ80"&gt;{{cite conference |last = Jakopin |first = Primož |publication-date = 1983

The '''Registry of Research Data Repositories''' ('''re3data.org''') is an [[Open Science]] tool that offers researchers, funding organizations, libraries and publishers an overview of existing international [[data library|repositories]] for [[research data]].

== Background ==

re3data.org is a global registry of research data repositories from all academic disciplines. It provides an overview of existing research data repositories in order to help researchers to identify a suitable repository for their data and thus comply with requirements set out in data policies.&lt;ref name=Pampel2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pampel|first=Heinz|author2=Vierkant, Paul |author3=Scholze, Frank |author4=Bertelmann, Roland |author5=Kindling, Maxi |title=Making Research Data Repositories Visible: The re3data.org Registry|journal=PLoS ONE|date=4 November 2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78080|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078080|pmid=24223762|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078080|accessdate=7 February 2014|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878080P|pmc=3817176|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The registry was officially launched in May 2013.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sparceurope.org/registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched-re3data-org/ | title=Registry of Research Data Repositories launched – re3data.org | author=Wellander, Janna | date= 4 June 2013 | work=SPARC Europe | accessdate= 5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

In March 2014 the registry lists 634 research data repositories from around the world covering all academic disciplines. 586 of these are described in detail using the re3data.org schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org – from Funding to Growing|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/re3data-org-from-funding-to-growing/|work=re3data.org|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclusion criteria ==

A repository is indexed when the minimum requirements for inclusion in re3data.org are met: the repository has to be run by a legal entity, such as a sustainable institution (e.g. library, university) and clearly state access conditions to the data and repository as well as the terms of use. Additionally, an English [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) plus a focus on research [[data]] is needed.&lt;ref name=Vierkant /&gt;

== Partners and Cooperation ==

re3data.org is a joint project of the [[Berlin School of Library and Information Science]], the [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]] and the Library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT). The project is funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG).&lt;ref name=Pampel2013 /&gt;
The project cooperates with other Open Science initiatives like Databib,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kratz|first=John|title=Finding Disciplinary Data Repositories with DataBib and re3data|url=http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/03/03/finding-disciplinary-data-repositories-with-databib-and-re3data/|work=Data Pub|accessdate=21 March 2014|author2=Nicholls, Natsuko |date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BioSharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases|url=http://www.biosharing.org/biodbcore|work=biosharing|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DataCite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources|url=http://www.datacite.org/resources|work=DataCite|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095924/http://www.datacite.org/resources|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OpenAIRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org and OpenAIRE sign Memorandum of Understanding|url=https://www.openaire.eu/it/component/content/article/481-re3data-and-openaire-sign-memorandum-of-understanding|work=OpenAIRE|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several publishers, research institutions and funders refer to re3data.org in their Editorial Policies and guidelines as a tool for the identification of suitable data repositories, e.g. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The paper trail|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-paper-trail-1.13123|work=Nature|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SpringerPlus - Editorial policies|url=http://www.springerplus.com/about#editorialpolicies|work=SpringerPlus|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance (also referred to as [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]]) to diversity efforts in organizations is a well-established and ubiquitous phenomenon&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kidder|first=Deborah L.|last2=Lankau|first2=Melenie J.|last3=Chrobot‐Mason|first3=Donna|last4=Mollica|first4=Kelly A.|last5=Friedman|first5=Raymond A.|date=2004|title=BACKLASH TOWARD DIVERSITY INITIATIVES: EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION, PERSONAL AND GROUP OUTCOMES|url=https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022908|journal=International Journal of Conflict Management|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=77–102|doi=10.1108/eb022908|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RVrTpCEzLXIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Diversity+Resistance+in+Organizations+kecia+thomas&amp;ots=iALHfM6EHg&amp;sig=kuwDcBumn1zKkNVVUTtHeuxc3WA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diversity%20Resistance%20in%20Organizations%20kecia%20thomas&amp;f=false|title=Diversity Resistance in Organizations|last=Thomas|first=Kecia M.|date=2012-10-02|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781136677533|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be characterized by thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that undermine the success of diversity-related organizational change initiatives to recruit or retain diverse personnel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of such initiatives may be referred to as [[Multicultural and diversity management|diversity management]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definition of diversity management. (n.d.). Retrieved December 10, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=diversity-management&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars note the presence of resistance to diversity before and after the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]]; as pressures for diversity and social change increased in the 1960s, dominant group members (i.e. Whites) faced workplace concerns over displacement by minorities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dass|first=Parshotam|last2=Parker|first2=Barbara|date=1999-05-01|title=Strategies for managing human resource diversity: From resistance to learning|url=http://amp.aom.org/content/13/2/68|journal=The Academy of Management Executive|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=68–80|doi=10.5465/AME.1999.1899550|issn=1558-9080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the workforce, resistance to diversity is often studied as resistance to organizational change, which can be construed as hostile and intentional, as well as a subtler occurrence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars have deemed the "resistance perspective" as reactive, highlighting psychological and behavioral consequences such as [[denial]], [[Avoidance coping|avoidance]], defiance or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] that serve to maintain the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other scholars define resistance to diversity as the behavior of both individuals and organizations that may undermine diversity-driven opportunities for "learning and effectiveness", whether intentional or not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Who is resisting?==

=== Research on resistors ===
Research on resistance to diversity has revealed insight into resistors and under which circumstances they resist. Focusing on resistance from the dominant, non-minority group, some have linked diversity resistance to White male backlash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solomon|first=Charlene Marmer|date=1991|title=Are white males being left out?|url=|journal=Personnel Journal|volume=70 |issue=11|pages=88–92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prime, J., Foust-Cummings, H., Salib, E. R., &amp; Moss-Racusin, C. A. (2012). Calling all White men: Can training help create inclusive workplaces. ''Catalyst, New York''.&lt;/ref&gt;  or straight, white, American male (SWAM) backlash,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; although the research may focus on the study of resistance from Whites ''or'' men in the context of the research question.

==== Resistance to workplace racial diversity ====
Research has documented that some Whites may be resisting the diversity messages of [[multiculturalism]]-based ideologies that embrace ethnic differences between groups or [[Racial color blindness|colorblind]]-based ideologies that ignore the ethnic differences between groups—common ideological options for managing diversity in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Flannery G.|last2=Plaut|first2=Victoria C.|last3=Sanchez-Burks|first3=Jeffrey|date=2008-03-01|title=Unlocking the Benefits of Diversity|url=http://doi.org/10.1177/0021886308314460|journal=The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=116–133|doi=10.1177/0021886308314460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research found members of high-status groups (i.e. Whites) reacted adversely to pro-diversity organizational messages when compared with non-Whites. This research found White people experience heightened threat in response to pro-diversity messages, and that this threat manifests in physiological (cardiovascular reactions), psychological (self-disclosed concerns), and behavioral (making poorer impressions) domains.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dover|first=Tessa L.|last2=Major|first2=Brenda|last3=Kaiser|first3=Cheryl R.|title=Members of high-status groups are threatened by pro-diversity organizational messages|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.10.006|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=62|pages=58–67|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2015.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resistance to workplace gender diversity ====
Researchers have observed some men will resist gender diversity under certain conditions; the researchers presented men in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]) with information that diversity initiatives will effectively increase female representation, which led to resistance among men who believed there is legitimacy to men best-representing STEM (i.e. prototypicality legitimacy) and those who also had concerns about losing the ability to best represent STEM (prototypicality threat).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danbold|first=Felix|last2=Huo|first2=Yuen J.|title=Men's defense of their prototypicality undermines the success of women in STEM initiatives|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022103116301731|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=72|pages=57–66|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2016.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular examples ===
In 2017, attention was given to the technology industry in light of [[James Damore]]'s document "[[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/8/16113070/google-memo-diversity-tech|title=Diversity problems in the tech industry go far beyond Google|work=Vox|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/08/06/diversity-debate-divides-silicon-valley/543487001/|title=Diversity debate divides Silicon Valley|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went viral as a prominent example of perceived "anti-diversity" attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/james-damore-google-anti-diversity-manifesto-free-speech-2017-8|title=James Damore, the Google employee fired for his controversial manifesto, is (almost certainly) not a victim of a free-speech violation|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-reportedly-fires-author-of-anti-diversity-screed-1797619007|title=Google Reportedly Fires Author of Anti-Diversity Screed|last=Ehrenkranz|first=Melanie|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document says [[Google]]'s current diversity initiatives discriminate against dominant group members (i.e. Whites and males) and foster tension within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320|title=Exclusive: Here's The Full 10-Page Anti-Diversity Screed Circulating Internally at Google [Updated]|last=Conger|first=Kate|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was reported that [[Intel]]'s CEO was threatened in response to his diversity efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-ceo-received-threats-for-trying-to-hire-more-minorities-2016-4|title=Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says he's received threats for trying to hire more minorities|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook]]'s CEO faced challenges with what he considered the malicious behavior of his employees replacing a "black lives matter" message with an "all lives matter" message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-asks-racist-facebook-employees-to-stop-1761272768|title=Mark Zuckerberg Asks Racist Facebook Employees to Stop Crossing Out Black Lives Matter Slogans|last=Nunez|first=Michael|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and other commentators have also highlighted media-covered examples of resistance to diversity outside of technology,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including a [[Texaco]] racial discrimination suit in which top-level executives were accused of creating a hostile climate for their diverse employees and were recorded on tape using racial slurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/04/business/texaco-executives-on-tape-discussed-impeding-a-bias-suit.html|title=Texaco Executives, On Tape, Discussed Impeding a Bias Suit|last=Eichenwald|first=Kurt|date=1996-11-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Southern Company]] racial discrimination lawsuit that included popularized reports of nooses displayed in the facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB986159975527361522|title=Black Georgia Power Workers Cite Nooses and 'Glass Ceiling' in Bias Suit|last=Blackmon|first=Douglas A.|date=2001-04-02|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-11-25|last2=Harris|first2=Nicole|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible explanations ==
=== General processes of resisting diversity ===
Some scholars propose that resistance to diversity can generally be understood to be a result of evolved cognitive processes that impact relations between different groups in society. They point to a disconnect between the once-adaptive way humans evolved sensitivity to group differences (e.g. "us" versus "them" tribal boundaries) and some current social environments that contain unprecedented levels of diversity. They propose resistance to diversity may stem from the conflict between automatic social categorization and modern heterogeneous social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crisp|first=Richard J.|last2=Meleady|first2=Rose|date=2012-05-18|title=Adapting to a Multicultural Future|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/853|journal=Science|language=en|volume=336|issue=6083|pages=853–855|doi=10.1126/science.1219009|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22605761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity threats ===
As companies attempt to grow diverse workforces and train them to work harmoniously, research suggests minority group progress may induce a threat response from those in the majority group. Researchers Major and Kaiser argue these types of diversity initiatives jeopardize status hierarchies and that this status instability produces threat, even within well-meaning, "prodiversity" progressives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Major|first=Brenda|last2=Kaiser|first2=Cheryl R.|date=2017-06-25|title=Ideology and the maintenance of group inequality|url=http://doi.org/10.1177/1368430217712051|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=582–592|doi=10.1177/1368430217712051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial progress has been shown to negatively impact Whites' [[self-worth]]; Whites may buffer this impact by perceiving anti-white bias (i.e. racial discounting).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Clara L.|last2=Hirsch|first2=Alexander A.|last3=Kaiser|first3=Cheryl R.|last4=Inkles|first4=Michael P.|date=2017-11-01|title=The threat of racial progress and the self-protective nature of perceiving anti-White bias|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430216631030|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=801–812|doi=10.1177/1368430216631030|issn=1368-4302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, researchers have observed increases in [[Social identity theory|social identity]] threat among men who discuss the instability of men's high status (i.e. changing gender-status relations) with women's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=Ellemers|first2=Naomi|last3=Sintemaartensdijk|first3=Nieska|date=2009-10-01|title=Suffering from the possibility of status loss: Physiological responses to social identity threat in high status groups|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.609/abstract|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=39|issue=6|pages=1075–1092|doi=10.1002/ejsp.609|issn=1099-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible threat-related mechanism that could underlie resistance to diversity is [[prototypicality]] threat, or the threat that one's sub-group will no longer best represent the broader, superordinate group.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Feelings of exclusion ===
Although multicultural ideology is commonly used in workplaces, research suggests White individuals may associate multiculturalism with exclusion and may not readily associate multiculturalism with conceptions of the self. This program of research also found the degree to which Whites feel included, relative to minorities, can help explain racial differences in diversity endorsement. Plaut ''et al'' suggest socially contextualized cues to inclusion or exclusion can meaningfully impact resistance to diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaut|first=Victoria C.|last2=Garnett|first2=Flannery G.|last3=Buffardi|first3=Laura E.|last4=Sanchez-Burks|first4=Jeffrey|title="What about me?" Perceptions of exclusion and Whites' reactions to multiculturalism.|url=http://doi.org/10.1037/a0022832|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=101|issue=2|pages=337–353|doi=10.1037/a0022832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the association between multiculturalism and feelings of exclusion among members of dominant groups, scholars have called for the use of [[All-Inclusive Multiculturalism]] (AIM), or multiculturalism that explicitly includes the dominant group. These researchers noted that whether non-minorities are included or excluded in an article about multiculturalism can implicitly influence their inclusionary associations with the ideology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Problems with diversity efforts ===
Commentators and scholars have speculated that diversity training may itself be creating backlash because employees may feel uncomfortable in training environments or resent being told what to do.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail|title=Why Diversity Programs Fail|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|date=|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Kalev|first2=Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karp|first=H.B.|last2=Sammour|first2=Hael Y.|date=2000|title=Workforce diversity: Choices in diversity training programs &amp; dealing with resistance to diversity|url=|journal=College Student Journal|volume=34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-james-damore-google-20170809-story.html|title=Diversity training was supposed to reduce bias at Google. In case of fired engineer, it backfired.|last=Pierson|first=David|date=2017-08-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-25|last2=Lien|first2=Tracey|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-brain-work/201706/is-your-company-s-diversity-training-making-you-more-biased|title=Is Your Company's Diversity Training Making You More Biased?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When examining the sources of resistance to diversity efforts, researchers have said organizations often use negative, legal-focused deterrents within bias training, designate diversity training as mandatory, and associated the training with corrective action for "problem groups".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Consistent with this thinking, researchers documented evidence of a "counter-response" (i.e. rebellion/defiance) when administering brochures or priming participants with controlling conceptualizations of prejudice-reduction, compared with autonomy-supporting conceptualizations. The controlling conceptualizations focused on the need to reduce prejudice and comply with norms of non-prejudice, whereas the autonomy-supporting conceptualizations focused on drawing attention to the choice and personal value involved in non-prejudice. Finding negative outcomes associated with the controlling conditions, they said common organizational efforts to reduce prejudice via control may be unintentionally increasing resistance.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legault|first=Lisa|last2=Gutsell|first2=Jennifer N.|last3=Inzlicht|first3=Michael|date=2011-11-28|title=Ironic Effects of Antiprejudice Messages|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611427918|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1472–1477|doi=10.1177/0956797611427918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research-based strategies for addressing the resistance ==

Research on resistance to diversity has revealed implications and suggestions for those hoping to address potential, current, or possible resistance.

=== General strategies ===
* Encouraging managers to engage in pro-diversity activities may be more effective and result in less resistance than efforts that limit their discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|last2=Schrage|first2=Daniel|last3=Kalev|first3=Alexandra|date=2015-09-01|title=Rage against the Iron Cage|url=http://doi.org/10.1177/0003122415596416|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1014–1044|doi=10.1177/0003122415596416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To avoid unintentionally alienating key stakeholders in gender diversity, leaders in the study of gender initiatives have recommended cultivating allied male support for organizational change.&lt;ref&gt;Prime, J., &amp; Moss-Racusin, C. A. (2009). ''Engaging men in gender initiatives: What change agents need to know''. New York, NY: Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the context of prejudice reduction, it may be helpful to avoid putting pressure on individuals that limits their autonomy. It may also be better to facilitate the development of people's perceived values and benefits relating to "non-prejudice", via tailored information and organized discussions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Framing strategies===
* Research suggests focusing on equality as something to strive for (i.e. a moral ideal) rather than focusing on avoiding inequality (i.e. a moral obligation), may raise Whites' support for policies that aim to increase the representation of disadvantaged groups (i.e. affirmative action).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Does|first=Serena|last2=Derks|first2=Belle|last3=Ellemers|first3=Naomi|title=Thou shalt not discriminate: How emphasizing moral ideals rather than obligations increases Whites' support for social equality|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022103110002921|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=562–571|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2010.12.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If a multicultural-based ideology is in use, scholars have recommended emphasizing the benefits for all groups, making the ideology inclusive to members of both majority and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galinsky|first=Adam D.|last2=Todd|first2=Andrew R.|last3=Homan|first3=Astrid C.|last4=Phillips|first4=Katherine W.|last5=Apfelbaum|first5=Evan P.|last6=Sasaki|first6=Stacey J.|last7=Richeson|first7=Jennifer A.|last8=Olayon|first8=Jennifer B.|last9=Maddux|first9=William W.|date=2015-11-17|title=Maximizing the Gains and Minimizing the Pains of Diversity|url=http://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615598513|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=742–748|doi=10.1177/1745691615598513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansen|first=Wiebren S.|last2=Otten|first2=Sabine|last3=Zee|first3=Karen I. van der|date=2015-02-25|title=Being part of diversity: The effects of an all-inclusive multicultural diversity approach on majority members' perceived inclusion and support for organizational diversity efforts|url=http://doi.org/10.1177/1368430214566892|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=817–832|doi=10.1177/1368430214566892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Whites have been shown to report increased positive attitudes towards hypothetical diversity programs when the programs are framed as diversity management (i.e. for business reasons), rather than affirmative action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Some research recommends broadly framing diversity-training content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holladay|first=Courtney L.|last2=Knight|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Paige|first3=Danielle L.|last4=Quiñones|first4=Miguel A.|date=2003-09-01|title=The influence of framing on attitudes toward diversity training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrdq.1065/abstract|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=245–263|doi=10.1002/hrdq.1065|issn=1532-1096}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* To address the potential for dominant group members (i.e. Whites or males) to feel threatened by the possibility of losing the claim to best represent the broader organization or industry (i.e. prototypicality threat), researchers have proposed reframing the broader category (e.g. STEM) as more complex (e.g. defined by diversity) may help reduce susceptibility to prototypicality threat &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* There is evidence White Americans who identify strongly with their racial/ethnic groups may respond more positively to multiculturalism if it is framed as a learning opportunity rather than as a set of policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rios|first=Kimberly|last2=Wynn|first2=Ashley N.|date=2016-12-01|title=Engaging with diversity: Framing multiculturalism as a learning opportunity reduces prejudice among high White American identifiers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2196/abstract|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=46|issue=7|pages=854–865|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2196|issn=1099-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== Balanced Scorecard ===
Kaplan and [[David P. Norton]] created the [[balanced scorecard|Balanced Scorecard]], a means of linking a company's current actions to its long-term goals. Kaplan and Norton introduced the balanced scorecard method in their 1992 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, ''The Balanced Scorecard: Measures That Drive Performance''.

This method has been endorsed by companies from every industry and corner of the world as evidenced by the Palladium Balanced Scorecard Hall of Fame for Executing Strategy™ and Bain &amp; Company's Management Tools and Trends report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepalladiumgroup.com/research-and-impact/awards-program/balanced-scorecard-hall-of-fame#content|title=Palladium - Awards Program|website=www.thepalladiumgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2015.aspx|title=Management Tools &amp; Trends 2015 - Bain Brief|website=www.bain.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also published in the fields of [[strategy]], [[cost accounting]] and [[management accounting]].  He is a co-founder, with [[David P.

'''Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC)'''

Kaplan and Steven R. Anderson co-developed time-driven activity-based costing, or TDABC, a methodology to truly understand costs, to help companies get on a simpler and more powerful path to higher profits. Most recently, this methodology is being applied to healthcare, in order to measure health care delivery costs across an entire care continuum, at the medical condition level.

'''Rossall Hockey''' or '''RossHockey''' is a unique form of hockey played only at [[Rossall School]], in [[Fleetwood]], on the [[The Fylde|Fylde coast]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]]. The game is unique to Rossall School and is played on the beach next to the school during the [[Lent]] term only,&lt;ref name="Gazette3395945"&gt;

  | accessdate = 2008-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the pitch being marked by dragging the hockey sticks in the sand before each match.  It is a brutal beach game born of [[Rugby football|rugby]] but played with hockey-like sticks by girls as well as boys at the school. It dates back to the 19th century when pitches were too wet for rugby.&lt;ref name="Gazette3395945"/&gt; It is one of the few school coded sports to have remained in use despite the dominance of other national codes in modern sport. The only other examples of school coded sport in the [[United Kingdom]] that remain are those of the various [[Fives]] codes; of which Rossall has its own, as well as [[Harrow football]], [[Winchester College football]], the [[Eton wall game]] and the [[Eton field game]].

==History==
[[Image:RossHockey.jpg|thumb|right|An old game of RossHockey]]
Rossall Hockey was referenced in the first issue of the Rossallian in 1867, though its exact date of creation is not known.&lt;ref name="William Furness 1944 p.297"&gt;William Furness, 'The Centenary History of Rossall School' ([[Gale and Polden]], 1944) p.297&lt;/ref&gt; Rossall Hockey started as a derivation of Rossall Football, an adaptation of the Eton field game introduced to the school in 1857 by a school master who had been a student at [[Eton College]].&lt;ref name="William Furness 1944 p.297"/&gt;

Initially the rules of RossHockey were slightly different from those of today, with scoring occurring by a system of goals and [[Eton field game#Rougeables|rougeables]].&lt;ref name="William Furness 1944 p.297"/&gt; It is also known that there were no restrictions on the number of players in a game and there was no fixed time of play - indeed one game lasted for two days.&lt;ref name="William Furness 1944 p.297"/&gt;

The official rules were drawn up in 1873 and two years later the first House RossHockey competition took place.&lt;ref name="William Furness 1944 p.297"/&gt; The rules were amended again in 1900 to abolish rougeables. Emphasis has always been placed on the game being one of skill and dribbling - as well as one of brute force.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/a-game-with-stickability-1274552.html | title=A game with stickability | work=The Independent | first=Dave | last=Hadfield | date=1997-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the game was nearly abandoned after over 130 years of history when the supplier of the sticks went bankrupt. A replacement supplier was found in [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] where they had made [[lacrosse]] sticks for many years.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; The new sticks are slightly less ornate than the traditional ones and also made of [[hickory]] rather than [[Ash tree|ash]] but the gameplay has not been affected.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

==Rules==
[[Image:RossHockeyPitch.jpg|thumb|right|The layout of a RossHockey pitch]]

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+Dead Ball Situations
!Name
!Description
|-
| Free hits
|If a free hit is awarded then all players must stand at least five metres from the ball. The ball may be struck with as much vigour as the player chooses. Players may halt the ball in mid air using a hand, however they must not push the ball forward using their hand otherwise a free hit to the other team may be awarded. If the ball is hit out of the side of the pitch a roll-in is given to the opposing team. If the ball is hit off the pitch at the end, outside of the "D" or inside the "D" without stick contact before it crosses the line then a "20-Bully" is observed. In free hits, only one defender is allowed to stand in the "D" whilst the rest of the players on the pitch must stand outside.
|-
|20-Bully
|A "20-Bully" is like any other bully but occurs on the twenty pace line. A "20-Bully" may be awarded if the ball is forced off the pitch at either end.
|-
|Line-Bully
|A "Line-Bully" is like any other bully but occurs at the top end of the "D". A "Line-Bully" may be given if a foul is committed by the defending team in their own "D". If three "Line-Bullies" are awarded in a row a penalty stroke will be given to the attacking team.
|-
|Penalty stroke
|A penalty stroke is like a free hit but always taken from twenty pace line. It gives the attacking team an opportunity to score from outside the "D". Both teams must stand behind the half way line except the taker of the stroke and one of the defending team who may stand behind the goal line to attempt to stop the ball from crossing the line.
|-
|Roll-in
|A Roll-in will be awarded if the ball leaves the side of the pitch. The ball is given to a player on the team who had not hit the ball out. Meanwhile, the rest of the two teams each line up horizontally across the pitch, with the teams two metres apart. The player with the ball then has to roll the ball in. The ball must go at least six paces, as marked by a line on the pitch, but must also touch the ground before the six pace line.
|}

===Gameplay===
*The pitch should be drawn up as indicated in the diagram, with the numbers indicating measurements in paces. The pitch should also be 80 paces in length.
*The game begins with a bully at the centre circle. A bully consists of seven players from each team lined up in opposing lines. Three players from each team stand out of the bully as ''flies''. Four sticks from each team must be placed into the centre to trap the ball.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;
*When the whistle is blown the match begins with each team driving forward in their lines to wrench the ball from the control of the other team.
*When the ball is freed from a bully the teams must each chase after it and force it in across the goal line between the opposing team's posts.
*If a player loses the ball by running ahead of it, another player from their team must take it on. The ball must always be approached from the rear by a player who wishes to take it on - if they fail to do so then they are considered offside.
*Scoring occurs only when the ball is pushed over the line by a player within the "D".

===Fouls===
Any of the following are fouls and will result in a free hit except if they are committed in the "D" by the defending team, in which case a ''Line-Bully'' is observed:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!Name
!Description
|-
|Out of control ball
|This is considered to be a situation where the ball is pushed more than three metres in front of the person who hit the ball.
|-
|Dangerous play
|This can consist of any number of offences including the throwing of one's stick at another person, the hacking of the ball with malicious intent or holding one's stick above head-height.
|-
|Using the incorrect side of the stick
|A stick may not be inverted in order to touch the ball.
|-
|Turning with the ball
|When a player takes the ball they must not take it with their back against the direction which they are playing. Similarly they may not pirouette whilst dribbling.
|-
|Tackling from the wrong side
|A player must attempt to tackle the player with the ball by approaching them from the opposite direction to which they are running. Tackling from the side is not permitted.
|-
|Offside
|In order to take control of the ball a player must have his body behind it. If this is not observed then they are deemed to have taken the ball on from an offside position. If a player loses control of the ball by allowing it to fall behind their stick then they may not touch the ball with the stick until another player on the pitch has done so from an appropriate position.
|-
|Passing the Ball
|The ball must never be passed forward, even as an accident, except in the instance of a free hit.

The Science Council promotes the profession of science and scientists through the [[Chartered Scientist]] designation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charteredscientist.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of codes of practice; it promotes awareness of the contribution of professional scientists to science and society and advances science education and increased understanding of the benefits of science.  

The Science Council provides a forum for discussion and exchange of views and works to foster collaboration between member organisations and the wider science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medical communities to enable inter-disciplinary contributions to science policy and the application of science.

The Science Council was founded by the late Professor [[Sir Gareth Roberts]] FRS, who served as the Council's Founding President. In February 2007, [[Sir Tom McKillop]] FRS, became the new President of the Science Council and he was succeeded in June 2011 by the current President Professor Sir [[Tom Blundell]].

In November 2008 the Science Council launched Future Morph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremorph.org|title=Home - Future Morph|first=iWeb|last=Solutions|date=|website=Future Morph|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website aimed at providing children, parents, teachers and the general public with information about science and how it might help in future careers.

In October 2011 the Science Council launched two additional professional registers – [[Registered Science Technician]] (RSciTech) and [[Registered Scientist]] (RSci)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.professionalregisters.or&lt;/ref&gt; – alongside the [[Chartered Scientist]] award, to build a framework of professional standards and recognition across the science workforce.

'''''SimRefinery''''' is a computer [[construction and management simulation games|management simulation game]] designed to simulate [[Chevron Corporation]]'s refinery operation. It was developed by [[Maxis]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3138907 null from 1UP.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192718/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3138907 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SimRefinery'' was developed by Maxis after the success of ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]''. After rejecting several requests from companies, the team eventually agreed to make a prototype for Chevron. In the words of [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]:

{{quote|[''SimRefinery'' was] a simulation of their refinery operation, for orienting people in the company as to how a refinery works. It wasn't so much for the engineers as it was for the accountants and managers who walked through this refinery every day and didn't know what these pipes were carrying.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/wright.html Interview with Will Wright] retrieved from [[Wired.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The user's role in the simulation was the plant manager of a refinery.  One of the things the user learned was about [[supply and demand]] and how it affects the financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dsVsd.8Ex.htm SEC Info - Gvi Security Solutions Inc - 10-K - For 12/31/96&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a commissioned business aid, it was not made available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+coming+green+computers-a014896038 The coming green computers. - Free Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''SimRefinery'' resembled ''SimCity'' with different graphics, disasters and rules; the latter to represent oil tanker ports, petroleum storage and piping systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/WillWright.html Transcription] of Will Wright's talk at [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VTLS''' Inc. was a global company that provided library automation software and services to a diverse customer base of more than 1900 libraries in 44 countries. The for-profit company was founded in 1985 by Dr. Vinod Chachra, who became the President and CEO of the company. VTLS originated as "Virginia Tech Library Systems", an automated circulation and cataloging system created for [[Virginia Tech]]’s Newman Library in 1975. In addition to its headquarters in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], United States, VTLS had five international offices in Australia, [[Brazil]], India, [[Malaysia]] and Spain. VTLS was one of the few [[ISO 9001:2008]] quality-certified companies within the library industry for many years. The company was acquired by [[Innovative Interfaces]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Innovative Acquires VTLS - The Digital Shift|url = http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/06/ils/innovative-acquires-vtls/|website = The Digital Shift|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

VTLS Inc. was the offspring of a project launched in 1974 at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]'s (Virginia Tech’s) Newman Library, a member of the [[Association of Research Libraries]] with more than 2 million cataloged volumes. Having explored available library automation alternatives and having found no system suitable for the needs of its libraries, Virginia Tech initiated a development project to create an automated library system, spearheaded by Dr. Vinod Chachra, head of Systems Development (SD). This forerunner of VTLS Classic and Virtua, consisting of an [[Online Public Access Catalog]] ([[OPAC]]) and an automated circulation system, was installed at Virginia Tech's Newman Library in September 1975.

By 1980, the software had evolved into the [[integrated library system]] ([[integrated library system|ILS]]) known as "VTLS Classic", a [[MARC standards|MARC]] based ILS including library automation. In 1983, VTLS became the first integrated library system to implement linked [[authority control|Authority Control]] and to feature full integration and support of the MARC Format for bibliographic records. On July 1, 1985, VTLS Inc. was formed by Dr. Vinod Chachra as a subsidiary corporation of Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties (VTIP), which granted VTLS Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to enhance and market VTLS software. The ensuing years witnessed dramatic growth for VTLS and innovative development of the VTLS system. By 1987, VTLS became the first ILS to fully support the US MARC Format for Holdings and Locations in a fully integrated Serials Control Subsystem. In 1989, VTLS introduced a multilingual [[user interface]] design that allowed users to change language dynamically within their user session. VTLS also began offering imaging services and digital library solutions in 1993.

In 1998, VTLS launched their next-generation library automation suite with the first release of the "Virtua Integrated Library System" (ILS). Virtua incorporated all of the functionality of VTLS Classic but utilized an entirely new software architecture that included full Unicode support throughout the system as well as full native [[Z39.50]] support. Since the introduction of Virtua, VTLS continued to develop support for new standards and emerging technologies. In 2000, VTLS introduced support for [[radio-frequency identification]] ([[RFID]]) technology for circulation and security, later expanding it into the "Fastrac" product division. In 2002, VTLS introduced full support for [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] ([[FRBR]]), a key bibliographic standard enabling full [[Resource Description and Access]] ([[Resource Description and Access|RDA]]) Level 1 implementation. In 2004, VTLS introduced the "VITAL Digital Asset Management System". Later developments focused on discovery software for patrons with the introduction of "Visualizer Discovery" in 2008, the "Chamo Social OPAC" in 2009, and a hybrid of the two products called "Chamo Discovery" in 2012. VTLS later introduced a service called "Vorpal Solutions", which offered custom [[Drupal]] modules that allowed deployment of a complete custom Drupal-based front-end for VTLS solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VTLS, Inc.: Paving the Way for Library Solutions|url=http://www.vtcrc.com/tenant-stories/vtls-inc-paving-the-way-for-library-solutions/|website=Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 2013 by the introduction of the "Open Skies" unified software platform initiative, planning for the future interconnectivity of various VTLS-based software components as well as more open connectivity with external library services.

Throughout its history, VTLS was a member of many industry organizations, including: [[American Library Association]] ([[American Library Association|ALA]]), [[Book Industry Study Group]] ([[Book Industry Study Group|BISG]]), [[Coalition for Networked Information]] ([[Coalition for Networked Information|CNI]]), [[EDUCAUSE]], [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] ([[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]]), MARBI, [[National Information Standards Organization]] ([[NISO]]) for [[Z39.50]], [[Online Computer Library Center]] ([[OCLC]]), the [[Unicode]] Consortium, and the Virginia Business Pipeline (VBP). VTLS was also a founding member of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI).

In June 2014, VTLS was purchased by [[Innovative Interfaces|Innovative Interfaces Inc.]], who continues to actively develop and support most of the VTLS-based software suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Innovative Acquires VTLS - The Digital Shift|url = http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/06/ils/innovative-acquires-vtls/|website = The Digital Shift|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vocational Certificate of Education''', usually shortened to '''VCE''' or '''Vocational A-Level''' or '''AVCE''', was a [[vocational education|vocational]] qualification that used to be available in [[Further Education|further education]] colleges and [[sixth form]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Subjects and assessment==
VCEs were available in many subjects including [[Information technology|Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT), Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Management, Leisure and Recreation, Travel and Tourism and Business.  Some students preferred the vocational system due to its practical 'hands-on' nature.

The qualification was created in September 2000 to replace the Advanced [[GNVQ]], with the main change being that the marking system was altered from the three level Distinction, Merit and Pass system to A&amp;ndash;E grading, bringing the AVCE into line with [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]s. The AVCE was intended to lead on to [[higher education]] or employment and was made up of modules, each covering different aspects of the subject. Some of these modules overlapped and some institutions chose to merge their content. Students had to complete a set number of modules in order to qualify for an AVCE: 

*AVCE Double Award - 12 units (worth two A-levels)
*AVCE Single Award - 6 units (worth one A-level)
*ASVCE - 3 units (worth one AS-level)

Assessment was by a mixture of [[continuous assessment]], based on a portfolio of evidence, and externally set and marked examinations. 

==Withdrawal==
The regulatory body, the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] (QCA), along with [[wales|Welsh]] equivalent [[ACCAC]], decided in June 2004 to withdraw the Advanced VCE, with the final candidates starting in September 2004. They created and piloted an "Applied GCE ([[AGCE]])" qualification to replace the AVCE. [[Edexcel]] withdrew AVCE ICT in June 2006 but students were able to re-submit coursework until November 2006 and could re-sit exams until January 2007. The [[General National Vocational Qualification|GNVQ]] is still currently available in two forms &amp;ndash; Foundation and Intermediate levels &amp;ndash; which both work up to the Advanced level. This was withdrawn in 2007. The decision to withdraw the qualification proved unpopular.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">The '''Volvo effect''' is a term used in critiquing [[standardized testing]] that was created by Peter Sacks in his 2001 book ''Standardized Minds''. The term has been picked up by other sociologists, and counting [[Volvo cars|Volvos]] has even been facetiously proposed as an alternative method to the spending millions of dollars on standardized testing.&lt;ref&gt;For instance in ''The Unintended Consequences of High-Stakes Testing'' by M. Gail Jones, Brett D. Jones and Tracy Y. Hargrove.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original text in which the Volvo effect was advanced:

{{cquote|Although standardized tests have a relatively bleak record of predicting success in school and work, we know that they do tend to correlate exceedingly well with the income and education of one's parents. Call it the "Volvo Effect." The data is so strong in this regard that one could make a good guess about a child's standardized test scores by simply looking at how many degrees her parents have and what kind of car they drive.&lt;ref&gt;''Standardized Minds: The High Price of America's Testing Culture and What We Can Do to Change It'' by Peter Sacks, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7382-0433-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
