==Facility==

The 500 square meter facility of ABS-CBN Film Archives is covered with insulated walls. It has two film vaults: the medium-term vault and the long-term vault. The medium term vault holds [[betacam]] tapes, [[U-matic]], [[16mm]] negatives and prints, and some [[35mm]] negatives and prints while the long-term vault holds the 35mm negatives and master prints. The facility is protected by a special [[fire suppression system]]. [[Acclimatization]] rooms are located between the vaults and the exit. Before a film could be taken out from the vault, it has to stay in the first acclimatization room for 24 hours and in the second acclimatization room for another 24 hours to prevent damage caused by condensation due to rapid temperature change. The temperature in the long-term vault is maintained between 8 and 10&amp;nbsp;Â°C with 31 to 35 percent relative humidity while in the medium-term vault, the temperature is maintained between 15 and 20&amp;nbsp;Â°C with 35 to 50 percent relative humidity. The air-conditioning system of the facility operates 24 hours a day. The facility is accessible to visitors for academic and research purposes.

==Digital film restoration==
{{main|ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project}}
ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project is a digital film restoration and remastering project of ABS-CBN Film Archives in partnership with Central Digital Lab. The goal of the project is to digitally restore and remaster select films in the archives of ABS-CBN. As of 2015, the project has restored and remastered over 100 films. Restoration cost ranges anywhere between two hundred thousand [[Philippine Peso|pesos]] and ten million pesos per film.

It achieved critical success in the year it was released.

==Gameplay==
It is the sequel to ''[[Tau Ceti (computer game)|Tau Ceti]]'' and written by the same author, [[Pete Cooke]]. The gameplay is similar â the player pilots a 'skimmer' through a 3D world â but with many extra features. Instead of a single, large gameworld, the storyline is mission-based (but allowing the player some control over the order of play). The world physics of the original game are expanded on, as these missions take place on different planets under different suns; for example piloting under a dark red-dwarf provides a different play experience to a bright yellow sun.

In addition, the player may design their own skimmers; customising engine and weapon strengths,  equipment payloads, and arranging the on-screen control panel.

The game's interface is the same distinctive cursor-and-menu system used in Pete Cooke's other creations, such as ''[[Micronaut One]]'', ''[[A Whole New Ball Game]]'' and ''Tau Ceti''.

==Plot==
From the game's instructions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/a/Academy.txt |title=THE SPECTRUM GAMES DATABASE |accessdate=2010-06-16 |format=Text }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After an incident on 61 Cygnus in 2197 when a rookie pilot selected the wrong gear when docking with the main central reactor and reduced half the planet to molten lava, Gal-Corp decided that a special training facility was needed to provide an elite corps of pilots for the advanced military skimmers used in colonisation and reconnaissance work.

The Galcorp Academy for Advanced Skimmer Pilots (GASP) was founded in 2213 to meet this requirement. With an intake of over a hundred would be skimmer pilots a year, only a few meet the exacting requirement of flying and combat skills.

In order to graduate from the Academy cadets must complete 20 missions, grouped in five levels of four, successfully.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Academyifitmoves.png|right|thumb|A user-created skimmer]]

'''''Ain't Misbehavin'''''' is a musical [[revue]] with a book by [[Murray Horwitz]] and [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]], and music by various composers and lyricists as arranged and orchestrated by [[Luther Henderson]].  It is named after the song by [[Fats Waller]] (with [[Harry Brooks (composer)|Harry Brooks]] and [[Andy Razaf]]), "[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]".

The musical is a tribute to the [[African American|black musicians]] of the 1920s and 1930s who were part of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], an era of growing creativity, cultural awareness, and ethnic pride, and takes its title from the 1929 Waller song "Ain't Misbehavin'". It was a time when [[Manhattan]] [[nightclub]]s like the [[Cotton Club]] and the [[Savoy Ballroom]] were the playgrounds of [[upper class|high society]] and [[Lenox Avenue]] dives were filled with piano players banging out the new beat known as [[Swing music|swing]]. Five performers present an evening of rowdy, raunchy, and humorous songs that encapsulate the various moods of the era and reflect Waller's view of life as a journey meant for pleasure and play.

==Productions==
''Ain't Misbehavin''' opened in the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]'s East 73rd Street [[cabaret]] on February 8, 1978. The cast included [[Irene Cara]], [[Nell Carter]], [[AndrÃ© DeShields]], [[Armelia McQueen]], and [[Ken Page]] and was staged by Arthur Faria,  now recognized as one of the original authors, and directed by Maltby. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote: "The show moves with the zing and sparkle of a Waller recording-filled with bright melodies and asides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Wilson| first = John S.| title = 'Here'Tis'-A Musical Bow to Fats Waller; The Cast| newspaper = The New York Times| pages = C13| date = February 20, 1978| url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3071EFF3E5413728DDDA90A94DA405B888BF1D3&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Ain%27t+Misbehavin%27+&amp;st=p|accessdate = January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reception was such that it was decided to develop it into a full-scale production.

The musical opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Longacre Theatre]] on May 9, 1978, and transferred to the [[Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre|Plymouth Theatre]] and then to the [[Belasco Theatre]] and closed on February 21, 1982, after 1604 performances and fourteen previews. Maltby was the director, with musical staging and [[choreography]] by Arthur Faria. The original cast featured Nell Carter, AndrÃ© DeShields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and [[Charlayne Woodard]]. [[Luther Henderson]], who adapted Waller's music for the revue, appeared as the production's original pianist. Replacements later in the run included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Yvette Freeman]], [[Adriane Lenox]], and [[Alan Weeks (entertainer)|Alan Weeks]]. An [[cast album|original cast recording]] was released by [[RCA Victor]].

The [[West End theatre|West End]] production opened on March 22, 1979, at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]]. DeShields and Woodard were joined by Evan Bell, Annie Joe Edwards, and Jozella Reed. It was revived in London in 1995 at the Tricycle Theatre and then the [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]], with [[Debby Bishop]], [[Dawn Hope]], Melanie Marshall, Sean Palmer, and Ray Shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first =| title = Ain't Misbehavin'(London Revival, 1995)| work = broadwayworld.com| publisher = | date =| url = http://broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Ain't_Misbehavin'_3088/| format =| doi =| accessdate = January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A London revival cast recording was released by First Night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Ankeny| first = Jason | title = Ain't Misbehavin': The Fats Waller Musical Show (1995 London Cast Recording)| work = allmusic.com | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/aint-misbehavin-the-fats-waller-musical-show-1995-london-cast-recording-w110341| accessdate = January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 1982, [[NBC]] broadcast the revue with the original Broadway cast.

A Broadway revival with the same director, choreographer, and cast as the original 1978 production opened on August 15, 1988, at the [[Ambassador Theatre (New York)|Ambassador Theatre]], where it ran for 176 performances and eight previews. [[Frank Rich]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote "In their scrupulous re-creation of the Fats Waller show that first electrified Broadway a decade ago, the original cast and creators have conjured the same between-the-wars dream world as before... Though almost bereft of dialogue, this musical anthology expands beyond its form to become a resurrection of a great black artist's soul. Perhaps the key to the musical's approach, as conceived by the director Richard Maltby Jr., is its willingness to let Waller speak simply and eloquently for himself, through his art but without show-biz  embroidery."&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank. "Review/Theater;A Harlem Legend Lives Again On Broadway". ''The New York Times''. August 16, 1988. Section C; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a national tour directed and choreographed by Faria starred the [[Pointer Sisters]], Eugene Barry-Hill, and [[Michael-Leon Wooley]]. Although it never reached Broadway as originally planned, a recording of highlights from the show was released by RCA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/aint-misbehavin-1996#synopsis "'Ain't Misbehavin' (1996) Track Listing, Synopsis, Background and Cast Credits"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106172220/http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/aint-misbehavin-1996 |date=2011-11-06 }}, masterworksbroadway.com, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in November 2008 and lasting until at least May 2009, season two ''[[American Idol]]'' contestants [[Frenchie Davis]], [[Trenyce | Trenyce Cobbins]] and winner [[Ruben Studdard]] starred in the 30th anniversary national tour of the show.&lt;ref name="Broadway Buzz"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 2008-03-29

The participation of '''Australia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest''' first began in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015]]. [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) an associate member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) was responsible for the selection process of their participants at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] and [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] contests, with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) taking over the country's participation from the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017 contest]]. The first representative to participate for the nation at the 2015 contest was Bella Paige with the song "My Girls", which finished in eighth place out of seventeen participating entries, achieving a score of sixty-four points. Australia continued their participation at the 2016 contest, having internally selected Alexa Curtis with her song "We Are", which finished in fifth place, scoring 202 points. Isabella Clarke in 2017 and Jael Wena in 2018 both placed 3rd, Australia's best results till date. SBS previously broadcast every edition of the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] on a [[broadcast delay]]. As of Junior Eurovision 2017, Australia has awarded the most points to {{Esccnty|Malta|Junior}}, and received the most points from {{Esccnty|Georgia|Junior}}.

'''''Bertie the Brain''''' was an early [[PC game|computer game]], and one of the first games developed in the [[early history of video games]]. It was built in [[Toronto]] by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of [[tic-tac-toe]] against an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable [[difficulty level]]. After two weeks on display by [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company|Rogers Majestic]], the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.

Kates built the game to showcase his [[additron tube]], a miniature version of the [[vacuum tube]], though the [[transistor]] overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides ''Bertie'' before it was no longer useful. ''Bertie the Brain'' is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]], the earliest known [[interactivity|interactive]] [[electronic game]] to use an electronic display. ''Bertie''{{'}}s use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time [[video game graphics|visual graphics]], however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.

==History==
''Bertie the Brain'' was a [[PC game|computer game]] of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates|Dr. Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]].&lt;ref name="CNE"/&gt; Kates had previously worked at [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company|Rogers Majestic]] designing and building radar tubes during [[World War II]], then after the war pursued graduate studies in the computing center at the [[University of Toronto]] while continuing to work at Rogers Majestic.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt; While there, he helped build the University of Toronto Electronic Computer ([[UTEC]]), one of the first working computers in the world. He also designed his own miniature version of the [[vacuum tube]], called the [[additron tube]], which he registered with the [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] on 20 March 1951 as type 6047.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tube1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tube2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tube3"/&gt;

After filing for a patent for the additron tube, Rogers Majestic pushed Kates to create a device to showcase the tube to potential buyers. Kates designed a specialized computer incorporating the technology and built it with the assistance of engineers from Rogers Majestic.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt; The large, four meter tall metal computer could only play tic-tac-toe and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from 25 Augustâ9 September 1950.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNEdates"/&gt;

The additron-based computer, labeled as "Bertie the Brain" and subtitled "The Electronic Wonder by Rogers Majestic", was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it. Kates stayed by the machine when possible, adjusting the difficulty up or down for adults and children. Comedian [[Danny Kaye]] was photographed defeating the machine (after several attempts) for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Bertie the Brain'' was a game of tic-tac-toe in which the player would select the position for their next move from a grid of nine lit buttons on a raised panel. The moves would appear on a grid of nine large squares set vertically on the machine as well as on the buttons, with either an X- or O-shaped light turning on in the corresponding space. The computer would make its move shortly after. A pair of signs to the right of the playfield, alternately lit up with "Electronic Brain" and an X or "Human Brain" and an O, marked which player's turn it was, and would light up along with "Win" when a player had won. ''Bertie'' could be set to several difficulty levels.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt; The computer responded almost instantly to the player's moves and at the highest difficulty level was almost unbeatable.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Additron Tube schematic.png|thumb|Circuitry schematic from the US patent for the [[additron tube]]]]
After the exhibition, ''Bertie'' was dismantled and "largely forgotten" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt; Despite being the first implemented computer gameâpreceded only by theorized chess programsâand featured in a ''Life'' magazine article, the game was largely forgotten, even by video game history books.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt; ''Bertie'''s primary purpose, to promote the additron tube, went unfulfilled, as it was the only completed application of the technology. By the time Rogers Majestic pushed Kates to develop a working model for the Exhibition, he had been working on the tubes for a year, developing several revisions, and the University of Toronto team felt that the development was too slow to attempt to integrate them into the UTEC.&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt;

Although other firms expressed interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic in using the tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing.&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdditronUSPatent"/&gt; By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning in the face of the rise of the superior [[transistor]], preventing any re-visitation of ''Bertie'' or similar machines.&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt; Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt;

''Bertie'' was created only three years after the 1947 invention of the [[cathode-ray tube amusement device]], the earliest known [[interactivity|interactive]] [[electronic game]], and while non-visual games had been developed for research computers such as [[Alan Turing]] and [[Dietrich Prinz]]'s chess program for the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] at the [[University of Manchester]], ''Bertie'' was the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort.&lt;ref name="Spacing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVGD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Replay"/&gt; ''Bertie'' is considered under some definitions in contention for the title of the first video game.  While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while ''Bertie'' did not feature an electronic screen it did run on a computer.&lt;ref name="EVG"/&gt; Another special-purpose computer-based game, ''[[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]]'', was built in 1951, while the software-based tic-tac-toe game ''[[OXO]]'' and a [[draughts]] program by [[Christopher Strachey]] were in 1952 the first [[PC game|computer games]] to display [[video game graphics|visuals]] on an electronic screen rather than light bulbs.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVGD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCU"/&gt;

== History ==
Hunter &amp; Ready initiated the first known bug bounty program in 1983 for their [[Versatile Real-Time Executive]] operating system. Anyone who found and reported a bug would receive a Volkswagen Beetle (aka Bug) in return. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cybersecuritysf/status/883829319604293632|title=The  first âbugâ bounty program|date=8 July 2017|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little over a decade later in 1995, Jarrett Ridlinghafer, a technical support engineer at [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] coined the phrase 'Bugs Bounty'.

Netscape encouraged its employees to push themselves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. Ridlinghafer recognized that Netscape had many enthusiasts and evangelists for their products, some of whom to him seemed even fanatical, particularly for the Mosaic/Netscape/Mozilla browser. He started to investigate the phenomenon in more detail and discovered that many of Netscape's enthusiasts were actually software engineers who were fixing the product's bugs on their own and publishing the fixes or workarounds:
* in the news forums that had been set up by Netscape's technical support department to enable "self-help through collaboration" (another one of Ridlinghafer's ideas during his four-year stint at Netscape); or 
* on the unofficial "Netscape U-FAQ" website, where every known bug and feature of the browser was listed, as well as instructions regarding workarounds and fixes.

Ridlinghafer thought the company should leverage these resources and sat down and wrote out a proposal for the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program', which he presented to his manager who in turn suggested that Ridlinghafer present it at the next company executive team meeting.

At the next executive team meeting, which was attended by [[Jim Barksdale|James Barksdale]], [[Marc Andreessen]] and the VPs of every department including product engineering, each member was given a copy of the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program' proposal and Ridlinghafer was invited to present his idea to the Netscape Executive Team.

Everyone at the meeting embraced the idea except the VP of Engineering, who did not want it to go forward believing it to be a waste of time and resources. However, the VP of Engineering was overruled and Ridlinghafer was given an initial $50k budget to run with the proposal and the first official 'Bugs Bounty' program was launched in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www101.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease48.html |title=Netscape announces Netscape Bugs Bounty with release of netscape navigator 2.0 |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=21 Jan 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970501041756/http://www101.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease48.html |archivedate=May 1, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cobalt.io/blog/the-history-of-bug-bounty-programs|title=Cobalt Application Security Platform|website=Cobalt|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/centurylink/2015/04/30/why-companies-like-pinterest-run-bug-bounty-programs-through-the-cloud/#284751034867|title=CenturyLinkVoice: Why Companies Like Pinterest Run Bug Bounty Programs Through The Cloud|last=CenturyLink|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was such a huge success it's mentioned in many of the books detailing Netscape's successes.

== Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Violations ==

In August 2013, a Computer Science student named Khalil used an exploit to post a letter on the [[Facebook]] timeline of site founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. According to the hacker, he had tried to report the vulnerability using Facebook's bug bounty program, but because of the vague and incomplete report the response team told him that his vulnerability was not actually a bug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/facebook-post-exploit-hacker-zuckerberg-621/|title=Hacker posts Facebook bug report on Zuckerbergâs wall|date=18 August 2013|publisher=RT|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Facebook t-shirt with whitehat debit card for Hackers.jpg|thumb|A Facebook "White Hat" debit card, given to researchers who report security bugs]]

[[Facebook]] started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded âWhite Hatâ debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. âResearchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them,â Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebookâs security response team, told [[CNET]] in an interview. âHaving this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say âI did special work for Facebook.ââ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitehat|first=Facebook|title=Facebook whitehat Debit card|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-hands-out-white-hat-debit-cards-to-hackers/|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Facebook stopped issuing debit cards to researchers.

In 2016, ride sharing company [[Uber]] experienced a security incident when an individual accessed the personal information of 57 million Uber users worldwide. The individual supposedly demanded a ransom of $100,000 in order to destroy the usersâ data. In Congressional testimony, Uber CISO indicated that the company verified that the data had been destroyed before paying the $100,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7d70e53e-73e9-4336-a100-67b233084f12/75728554E990488D71625DFA69B05494.uber---john-flynn---testimony.pdf|title=Testimony of John Flynn, Chief Information Security Officer, Uber Technologies, Inc.|date=6 February 2018|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Flynn expressed regret that Uber did not disclose the incident in 2016. As part of their response to this incident, Uber worked with partner HackerOne to update their bug bounty program policies to, among other things, more thoroughly explain good faith vulnerability research and disclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://threatpost.com/uber-tightens-bug-bounty-extortion-policies/131512/|title=Uber Tightens Bug Bounty Extortion Policy|date=27 April 2018|publisher=Threat Post|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]], which has either the first or second largest number of bug hunters in the world, depending on which report one cites, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factordaily.com/india-bug-bounty-superpower/|title=Bug hunters aplenty but respect scarce for white hat hackers in India|date=8 February 2018|publisher=Factor Daily|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/2017-highlights-880000-paid-to-researchers/1918340204846863/|title=Facebook Bug Bounty 2017 Highlights: $880,000 Paid to Researchers|date=11 January 2018|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; âIndia came out on top with the number of valid submissions in 2017, with the United States and Trinidad &amp; Tobago in second and third place, respectivelyâ, Facebook quoted in a post. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/2017-highlights-880000-paid-to-researchers/1918340204846863/|title=Facebook Bug Bounty 2017 Highlights: $880,000 Paid to Researchers|date=11 January 2018|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo!]] was severely criticized for sending out Yahoo! T-shirts as reward to the Security Researchers for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities in Yahoo!, sparking what came to be called ''T-shirt-gate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=T-shirt Gate|first=Yahoo!|title=Yahoo! T-shirt gate|url=http://www.zdnet.com/yahoo-changes-bug-bounty-policy-following-t-shirt-gate-7000021508|publisher=[[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-Tech Bridge]], a Geneva, Switzerland-based security testing company issued a press release saying Yahoo! offered $12.50 in credit per vulnerability, which could be used toward Yahoo-branded items such as T-shirts, cups and pens from its store. Ramses Martinez, director of Yahoo's security team claimed later in a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bug Bounty|first=Yahoo!|title=So Iâm the guy who sent the t-shirt out as a thank you.|url=http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/62953984019/so-im-the-guy-who-sent-the-t-shirt-out-as-a-thank-you|publisher=Ramses Martinez|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was behind the voucher reward program, and that he basically had been paying for them out of his own pocket. Eventually, Yahoo! launched its new bug bounty program on October 31 of the same year, that allows security researchers to submit bugs and receive rewards between $250 and $15,000, depending on the severity of the bug discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BugBounty Program|first=Yahoo!|title=Yahoo! launched its Bug Bounty Program|url=http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/65622522325/the-bug-bounty-program-is-now-live|publisher=Ramses Martinez|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable programs ==

In October 2013, [[Google]] announced a major change to its Vulnerability Reward Program. Previously, it had been a bug bounty program covering many [[Google]] products. With the shift, however, the program was broadened to include a selection of high-risk [[free software]] applications and [[Library (computing)|libraries]], primarily those designed for [[Computer networking|networking]] or for low-level [[operating system]] functionality. Submissions that Google found adherent to the guidelines would be eligible for rewards ranging from $500 to $3133.70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/google-offers-leet-cash-prizes-for-updates-to-linux-and-other-os-software/|title=Google offers "leet" cash prizes for updates to Linux and other OS software|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=9 October 2013|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2013/10/going-beyond-vulnerability-rewards.html|title=Going beyond vulnerability rewards|last=Zalewski|first=Michal|date=9 October 2013|publisher=Google Online Security Blog|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Google expanded their program to cover vulnerabilities found in applications developed by third parties and made available through the Google Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/22/16516670/google-play-security-rewards-program-vulnerabilities-bug-bounty/|title=Google launched a new bug bounty program to root out vulnerabilities in third-party apps on Google Play|date=22 October 2017|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Microsoft]] and [[Facebook]] partnered in November 2013 to sponsor The Internet Bug Bounty, a program to offer rewards for reporting hacks and exploits for a broad range of Internet-related software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/now-theres-a-bug-bounty-program-for-the-whole-internet/|title=Now thereâs a bug bounty program for the whole Internet|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=6 November 2013|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[GitHub]] and The [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the initiative, which is managed by volunteers from Uber, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, and HackerOne. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/21/facebook-github-and-the-ford-foundation-donate-300000-to-bug-bounty-program-for-internet-infrastructure/|title=Facebook, GitHub, and the Ford Foundation donate $300,000 to bug bounty program for internet infrastructure|date=21 July 2017|publisher= VentureBeat|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software covered by the IBB includes [[Adobe Flash]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Perl]], [[OpenSSL]], [[Nginx]], [[Apache HTTP Server]], and [[Phabricator]]. In addition, the program offered rewards for broader exploits affecting widely used operating systems and [[web browser]]s, as well as the Internet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hackerone.com/ibb|title=The Internet Bug Bounty|publisher=HackerOne|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, [[Peter Cook (press secretary)|Peter Cook]] announced the US federal government's first bug bounty program, the "Hack the Pentagon" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/684616/dod-invites-vetted-specialists-to-hack-the-pentagon|title=DoD Invites Vetted Specialists to âHackâ the Pentagon|website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program ran from April 18 to May 12 and over 1400 people submitted 138 unique valid reports through [[HackerOne]]. In total, the US [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] paid out $71,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackerone.com/hackthepentagon|title=Vulnerability disclosure for Hack the Pentagon|website=HackerOne|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the Secretary of Defense, [[Ash Carter]], met with two participants, David Dworken and Craig Arendt, to honor them for their participation in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/18-year-old-hacker-honored-at-pentagon-1.415197|title=18-year-old hacker honored at Pentagon|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Open Bug Bounty]]'' is a crowd security bug bounty program established in 2014 that allows individuals to post website security vulnerabilities in the hope of a reward from affected website operators.

=== ''The Penny Collector (2017)'' ===
Elkin's first album in six years, ''The Penny Collector'' is a follow-up to "twangy, pure country" ''Call It My Garden'' (2011). Titled in honor of her father, a lifelong collector of coins, whose "passing informed the narrative woven throughout his daughter's sixth LP," ''The Penny Collector'' "exists in the remarkable, forlorn stretch between life and death, equally funereal and filled with quiet joys." Elkin's "enormous, melancholic voice" is the constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2017-04-14/carrie-elkin-record-review/|title=Carrie Elkin Record Review|last=Webster|first=Libby|date=14 April 2017|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|access-date=2018-03-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|text=The recurring motif of nature â the coyotes in the opener, the thrum of cicadas in "Albatross," the mountains of "Niagara" â has Elkin keenly building a backdrop of the minuscule, beautiful moments of being alive, against which her meditations on death are set.|sign=Libby Webster|source=[[The Austin Chronicle]]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''Chapeaugraphy''', occasionally [[anglicisation|anglicised]] to '''chapography''', is a '''novelty act''' and [[begging|panhandling]] trick in which a ring-shaped piece of [[felt]] is manipulated to look like various types of [[hat]]s. The act originated in 1618 with [[Paris]]ian [[busking|street performer]] [[Tabarin]], the most famous of the [[charlatan]]s who combined a French version of ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' with a quack [[medicine show]].

In the 1870s another French comedian, [[Monsieur Fusier]], revived the act and managed 15 hat-twisting styles in his act.

Although rarely seen today, it was featured in an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1985, as performed by magician [[Harry Anderson]].

Types of hat that can be created:

*[[baseball cap]]
*[[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] army hats from the Revolutionary War
*[[pirate]]'s hat
*[[navy|naval]] [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]'s hat
*[[Mickey Mouse]] ears
*[[Ushanka]] (a [[Russia]]n fur hat)
*[[mortarboard]] (a graduation cap)
*[[Catholic]] [[Religious_habit#Nuns|nun's headwear]]
*[[derby hat]]
and several inventive others.

Some known chapeaugraphers are
*[[Tabarin]], a French comedian, the creator of [[Le Chapeau de Tabarin]].
*[[Monsieur Fusier]], another French comedian who revived the act.
*[[FÃ©licien Trewey]], who brought the art form renewed interest and a new name, Treweyism, around the world in the 19th century after seeing Monsieur Fusier.
*[[Paul Wildbaum]], a Canadian physical comedy master.
*[[Sir Richard]], a New Zealand event host.
*[[Fabrice]], a French magician based on the Gold Coast in Australia, has an original routine which was presented at the Adelaide Magic Convention 2014.
*[[Disguido]], an Italian duo of Illusionists, have a routine dedicated to the history of cinema, prized with the [[Mandrake d'or]] in 2013 in Paris ad with the Third place at the European Championship of Magic in Blackpool (UK).

'''ChatNow''' is a [[mobile phone]]-like [[walkie-talkie]] developed by [[Hasbro]]'s [[Tiger Electronics]] division for the [[preteen]] market. It includes simple [[digital photography]] and [[text message]] functionality and transmits using the [[Family Radio Service]] [[UHF]] radio band. It has limited compatibility with other FRS gear; in particular, it is not compatible with [[CTCSS]] or [[Digital coded squelch|DCS]] signals commonly used on standard FRS gear. 

ChatNow differs from standard walkie-talkies by having a 10-digit "Buddy number" (ex.0794020300), allowing users to communicate with specific other users in a telephone-like manner; to make text messaging easier, the ChatNow units provide limited buddy list capability. There is a limited digital camera built into the device as well, and the unit can store up to 30 black and white pictures.

The units are sold in pairs, and come in both [[flip phone]] and slide-out configurations. Hasbro also manufactures add-ons and carrying cases for the line.

{{Designation list |designation1=NHSC |designation1_offname=Vancouver's Chinatown National Historic Site of Canada |designation1_date=2011 }}

'''Chinatown''' in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], is [[Canada]]'s largest [[Chinatown]]. Centred on Pender Street, it is surrounded by [[Gastown]] and the [[Downtown Vancouver|Downtown]] financial and central business districts to the west, the [[Downtown Eastside]] to the north, the remnant of old [[Japantown, Vancouver|Japantown]] to the northeast, and the residential neighbourhood of [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]] to the east. The approximate borders of Chinatown as designated by the City of Vancouver are the alley between Pender and [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] Streets, [[Georgia Street|Georgia]] Street, Gore Avenue, and Taylor Street,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/chinatown/map.htm Map of official boundaries of Chinatown, City of Vancouver website]&lt;/ref&gt; although unofficially the area extends well into the rest of the Downtown Eastside. [[Main Street (Vancouver)|Main]], Pender, and Keefer Streets are the principal areas of commercial activity.

Chinatown remains a popular [[tourist attraction]] and is one of the largest historic Chinatowns in North America. However, it experienced decline as newer members of Vancouver's Cantonese Chinese community dispersed to other parts of the metropolitan area. It has been more recently overshadowed by the newer [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant business district along No.&amp;nbsp;3 Road in the City of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], south of Vancouver. Many affluent [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]ese immigrants have moved there since the late 1980s, coinciding with the increase of Chinese ethnic retail and restaurants in that area. This new area is designated the "[[Golden Village (Richmond, British Columbia)|Golden Village]]" by the City of Richmond. The proposed renaming of the area to "Chinatown" met resistance both from merchants in Vancouver's Chinatown and from non-Chinese residents and merchants in Richmond itself.

Chinatown was once known for its neon signs, but like the rest of the city, lost many signs to changing times and a sign bylaw passed in 1974. The last of these was the Ho Ho sign (which showed a rice bowl and chop sticks), which was removed in 1997. Ongoing efforts at revitalization include efforts by the business community to improve safety by hiring private security, considering new marketing promotions, and introducing residential units into the neighbourhood by restoring and renovating heritage buildings. The current focus is on the restoration and [[adaptive reuse]] of the distinctive association buildings.

Due to the large ethnic Chinese presence in Vancouverâespecially represented by multi-generation [[Chinese Canadian]]s and first-generation immigrants from Hong Kongâthe city has been referred to as "Hongcouver".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=011b7438-172c-4126-ba42-2c85828bd6ce&amp;k=44011 Chinese Vancouver: A decade of change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030045354/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=011b7438-172c-4126-ba42-2c85828bd6ce&amp;k=44011 |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amenities==
Chinatown is becoming more prosperous as new investment and old traditional businesses flourish{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Today the neighbourhood features many traditional restaurants, banks, markets, clinics, tea shops, clothing stores, and other shops catering to the local community and tourists alike. The Vancouver office of [[Sing Tao Daily (Canada)|''Sing Tao Daily'']], one of the city's four Chinese-language dailies, remains in Chinatown. [[CHNM-TV|OMNI British Columbia]] (formerly Channel M) had its television studio in Chinatown from 2003 to 2010.

==Recent developments==
[[File:Vancouver Chinatown 16.JPG|thumb|right|Street in Chinatown]]
Vancouver experienced large numbers of immigrants from the Asia-Pacific region in the last two decades of the twentieth century, most notably from China, whose population in the Vancouver [[Census Metropolitan Area]] was estimated at 300,000 in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ng|first=Wing Chung|title=The Chinese in Vancouver 1945-80|year=1999|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-7748-0733-4|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant development since the 1980s has been the increase of transnational awareness among the Chinese. The heightened mobility of capital, information, people, and commodities across territorial boundaries and distance challenged the traditional meaning of migration. Compared to Chinatown itself, more Chinese immigrants have settled in Richmond, drawn by its lower house prices, considerable concentration of Chinese retailers, and the nearby Vancouver airport. The business heart of Chinatown was visibly affected after the arrival of suburban Asian shopping districts, such as Richmond's Aberdeen Centre, which was promoted as North America's largest enclosed Asian mall in the proximity of other Chinese shopping centres, and which offered more parking and open space than historic Chinatown.

In 1979, the Chinatown Historic Area Planning Committee sponsored a streetscape improvement program to add various Chinese-style elements to the area, such as specially paved sidewalks and red dragon streetlamps that demarcated the area's borders while emphasizing it as a destination for heritage tourism. Starting with its designation by the province as a historic area in 1971 and subsequent economic shifts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chuck Davis History of Metropolitan Vancouver|last=Davis|first=Chuck|publisher=Harbour Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-55017-533-2|location=|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinatown shifted from a central business district to playing a largely cultural role. [[Murality (organization)|Murality]], a local non-profit, is installing a mural on East Pender Street with the aim of bringing colour and vitality to the neighbourhood.

The growth of Chinatown during much of the 20th century created a healthy, robust community that gradually became an aging one as many Chinese immigrants no longer lived nearby. Noticing local businesses suffering, the Chinatown Merchants Association cited the lack of parking and restrictive heritage district rules as impediments to new uses and renovations. Their concerns subsequently led to a relaxation of zoning laws to allow for a wider range of uses, including necessary demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yee|first=Paul|title=Saltwater City|year=2006|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre Ltd.|location=Vancouver|isbn=978-1-55365-174-1|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additions in the mid-1990s included a large parkade, a shopping mall, and the largest Chinese restaurant in Canada. More residential projects around the community and a lowering of property taxes helped to maintain a more rounded community. Reinvigoration was a discussed topic along government members, symbolically embedded in the Millennium Gate project, which opened in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millennium Gate|url=http://www.venturevancouver.com/chinatown-millennium-gate|accessdate=12 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008011638/http://www.venturevancouver.com/chinatown-millennium-gate|archivedate=8 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that the role of the early Chinese settlers in Vancouver's Chinatown area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries helped to put Vancouver on the global map as a popular destination for Asian investment and immigration.

==New business strategies==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

Chinatown's businesses today predominantly consist of those selling lower-order, working-class goods, such as groceries, tea shops, and souvenir stores. While some businesses, such as restaurants, stand out, they are no longer the only Chinese food establishments in the city, a shift that contributed to a visible decline in foot traffic and nighttime activity in Chinatown. As the vacancy rate in Chinatown currently stands at 10%, it has been acknowledged that Chinatown needs a new approach to development, since some businesses have relocated to suburban shopping centres while others simply retired or went out of business. Examples include the closing of some restaurants and shops, sometimes in instances where the family did not have successors or where the business could not sustain itself any longer. Although there is a considerable business vacancy, Chinatown lease rates are considered the cheapest in the city, at $15â$30 per square footâabout one-tenth of the asking price on Vancouver's Downtown [[Robson Street]], the city's upscale shopping district.

The new Chinatown business plan encourages new entrepreneurs to move inâand has attracted a longboard store and German sausage shopâas ways of restoring storefronts and bringing in a younger crowd, and to make higher-income people more comfortable in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind the Changing Face of Vancouver's Chinatown|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/behind-the-changing-face-of-vancouvers-chinatown/article7282156/|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=12 February 2013|location=Toronto|date=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attracted to the lower rent and the building's heritage status, younger businesses have moved in, often with white owners who also live in apartments above the shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Stephen|title=Saving Chinatown, One Sausage and Pilates pose at a Time|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/saving-chinatown-one-sausage-and-pilates-pose-at-a-time/article8410432/|accessdate=12 February 2013|location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus is that Chinatown's priority is to attract people of all backgrounds to Chinatown, and it is believed that the opening of non-traditional stores will bring a new flow of energy and income to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allingham|first=Jeremy|title=Vancouver's Chinatown embraces change|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2013/02/07/bc-chinatown-embrace-change.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the commercial activity is becoming more diversified, dotted with Western chain stores such as Waves Coffeeshop and Dollar Giant. Other additions include vintage stores, two art galleries, bars, and a nightclub, built on the site of the former Ming's restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortune Sound Club|url=http://www.fortunesoundclub.com/about/index.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219004320/http://www.fortunesoundclub.com/about/index.html|archivedate=19 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to bring something of a nightlife atmosphere, reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s, back to the neighbourhood. The diversity of new shops and businesses is believed to be necessary in creating a new image for Chinatown in order to bring vibrancy back to the area and encourage commercial activities in general, and as a way to compete with suburban districts as well as nearby [[Gastown]] and [[Downtown Vancouver]].

===Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan===
The Chinatown Historic Area planning committee, along with AECOM Economics, a US-based planning firm, helped to prepare a Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan for Vancouver's planning department in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinatown Revitalization|url=http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/chinatown-revitalization.aspx|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver planners surveyed 77 businesses and found that 64% reported a decrease in revenue between 2008 and 2011. The majority of consumers, 58%, were local residents, with 21% coming from elsewhere in the Lower Mainland. Tourist spending accounted for only 12% of Chinatown customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howell|first=Mike|title=Vancouver prepares plan to renew ailing Chinatown|url=http://www.vancourier.com/news/Vancouver+prepares+plan+renew+ailing+Chinatown/6977571/story.html|publisher=Vancouver Courier|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the shifting role of Chinatown, the report highlighted key points to help the district keep up with the times:

*Although Chinatown experienced rapid residential growth, Vancouver's Chinese population is no longer concentrated in the Chinatown area, as new immigration settlement is dispersed throughout Metro Vancouver, especially in Richmond.
*Historically, Chinese immigrants to Vancouver were predominantly from Southern China, while immigrants today come from throughout China and Asia. Therefore, Chinatown restaurants need to broaden their offerings beyond mostly Cantonese dishes to cuisine from other parts of China and Asia in order to serve a more diversified consumer base.

Building on these points, the report recommended that Chinatown needs:
*More life on the streets at night and on weekends as a way to dilute social problems
*To provide better restaurants, as these make up the heart of Chinatown and are key to improving its business sector
*To modernize the cultural centre and museum as a viable attraction while keeping its neighbourhood aspects
*To cater more to its residents through everyday services such as groceries and restaurants
*To take advantage of its fine-grained streetscape pattern, which offers a unique sidewalk experience compared to newer auto-oriented suburban areas
*To involve younger community members in decision-making roles
*To renovate its 20 heritage buildings, creating a historic district unparalleled in Western Canada, which will increase appeal to tourists and residents, leading to more local spending
*To be clean and safe in order to reduce negative images, such as illegal drug use and panhandling, associated with the Downtown Eastside in general

===Condominium Development===
[[File:Vancouver Chinatown 13.JPG|thumb|right|Chinese themed street-light]]
Vancouver city councillors voted in 2011 to raise building height restrictions in Chinatown in order to boost its population density. A limit of 9 stories for most of the neighbourhood was set, with a maximum of 15 stories on the busiest streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Brian|title=Can condo-zones save Vancouver's beleaguered Chinatown?|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/28/can-condo-zones-save-vancouvers-beleaguered-chinatown/|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=National Post|date=Sep 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highrises close to Stadium-Chinatown Station have already been built, with more condominium towers under construction, some projects taking advantage of empty lots that sat unused for decades. Due to the unconventional lot sizes, one 9-storey condominium is only 25 feet wide. However, that is not expected to be a problem in Vancouver, which has a market for affordable smaller-scale homes. Critics of highrise development speculate that the plan will effectively divide up the neighbourhood to form a "Great Wall of Chinatown" as lower-income residents are marginalized and displaced.

==Facts and figures==
* The China Gate on Pender Street was donated to the City of Vancouver by the Government of the [[People's Republic of China]] following the [[Expo 86]] world's fair, where it was on display. After being displayed for almost 20&amp;nbsp;years at its current location, the gate was rebuilt and received a major renovation of it faÃ§ade employing stone and steel. Funding for the renovation came from government and private sources; the renovated gate was unveiled during the October 2005 visit of [[Guangdong]] governor [[Huang Huahua]].
[[Image:Chinese Garden.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden|Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Garden]]]]
* The [[Sam Kee Building]]: The Sam Kee Company, run by Chang Toy, one of the wealthier merchants in turn-of-the-20th-century Chinatown, bought this land as a standard-sized lot in 1903. However, in 1912 the city widened Pender Street, expropriating all but 6&amp;nbsp;feet of the Pender Street side of the lot. In 1913 the architects Brown and Gillam designed this narrow, [[steel-framed building|steel-framed free-standing building]] on the remaining 6-foot strip. The basement, extending under the sidewalk and much wider than the rest of the building, housed public baths, with shops on the ground floor and offices above (such basements in Vancouver were once common and zoned as "areaways"). The 1980s' rehabilitation of the building for Jack Chow was designed by Soren Rasmussen Architect and completed in 1986. The building is the narrowest commercial building in the world, according to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].
*[[Lord Strathcona Elementary School]], the oldest public school in Greater Vancouver, is the only public school serving Vancouver's Chinatown.
*[[Wing Sang Building]] is one of the oldest buildings in Chinatown. Built in 1889 by Thomas Ennor Julian, the 6-storey home was home to [[Yip Sang]]'s Wing Sang Company (Wing Sang Limited) from 1889 to 1955.
*In addition to Han Chinese from [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Mainland China]], Chinese Latin Americans have also settled in the Chinatown area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Most of them were from [[Peru]] and arrived shortly after [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] took over that country in a military [[coup]] in 1968. Others have come from [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nicaragua]].
*The neighbourhood was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{DFHD|12951|Vancouver's Chinatown|4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Village==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
In recent years Chinatown has seen growth in new construction as a downtown building boom continued into the former Expo 86 lands, which adjoin Chinatown. New high-rise towers are being constructed around the old [[Expo 86]] site, including International Village, which was built in 1998 and is located next to [[StadiumâChinatown Station|StadiumâChinatown]] [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] station. Anchored by Cineplex Odeon International Village Cinemas and flanked by Rexall Drugstore and Yokoyaya 123, the International Village Shopping Centre is a 300,000&amp;nbsp;ftÂ² entertainment and shopping venue. It is one of the first master-planned communities in Greater Vancouver; is the central hub connecting Gastown, Chinatown, and Yaletown; and is adjacent to the Rogers Arena, the Plaza of Nations, and BC Place Stadium.

International Village was designed to be downtown's answer to the Asian malls found in the [[Golden Village (Richmond, British Columbia)|Golden Village]], though it is not as racially exclusive and includes businesses and residents that are non-Chinese.

International Village also refers to the name given to the area by developer Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd., a subsidiary of [[Henderson Land Development]].

International Village was commonly called Tinseltown, based on one of the brands of theatre chain [[Cinemark|Cinemark Theatres]], which owned the building before Cineplex did.

== Clan societies ==
Chinese immigrants, primarily men, first came to Vancouver in the late 19th century. As more people of Chinese heritage came to Vancouver, clan associations were formed to help the newcomers assimilate in their adopted homeland and to provide friendship and support. Clan societies were often formed around a shared surname lineage, county (e.g., Kaiping, Zhongshan), or other feature of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HISTORIC STUDY OF THE SOCIETY BUILDINGS IN CHINATOWN|last=Contractor to City of Vancouver|first=|publisher=City of Vancouver|year=2005|isbn=|location=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/historic-study-of-the-society-buildings-in-chinatown.pdf|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crossout''''' is a Russian [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]]-action game for PC and consoles. Described as a crafting and combat MMO, the game allows players to construct their own post-apocalyptic vehicles to be used in PvP engagements with real players and PvE missions involving AI-participants. The game is developed by [[Targem Games]] and is published by [[Gaijin Entertainment]].

== Development ==
On May 20, 2015, both Gaijin Entertainment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRAFT, RIDE AND DESTROY! POST-APOCALYPTIC VEHICLE COMBAT MMO CROSSOUT ANNOUNCED|url=http://gaijinent.com/en/news/153/current|website=[[Gaijin Entertainment]]|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Targem Games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crossout|url=http://www.targem.ru/en/news1/2015/|website=Targem Games|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced the  development of a new [[free-to-play]] [[Massively multiplayer online game|mmo]] set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future.

On April 5, 2016, Crossout went into [[Software release life cycle#Beta|closed beta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CROSSOUT CLOSED BETA-TESTING STARTS TODAY!|url=http://crossout.net/en/news/55/current/#/|website=crossout.net|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was launched into open beta on May 30, 2017, on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OBT IS LIVE!|url=http://crossout.net/en/news/178/current/#/|website=crossout.net|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Events of Crossout take place in the same universe as Ex Machinaâs (aka Hard Truck: Apocalypse in the North American market), which is also a Targem-created game published by Buka in 2005. Crossout aims to depict life on Earth 20 years after the disaster, and 200 years before Ex Machina.

In the year 2027 the planet was swept over with a mysterious pandemic disease, that started to spread simultaneously all over the planet. Those few who survived the first days were then haunted by hallucinations, headaches and nightmares, most chose to end their lives. Neither the source of the disease, called âCrossoutâ by the media, nor the nature of the pathogen were identified. The planet was overthrown with chaos as the population fled the larger cities, leaving them as graveyards. In just a few dreadful months, civilization was no more.

The reason behind this was the disruption of an extraterrestrial, multi-millennia eugenic experiment aimed at developing a new sentient race on Earth. Due to a mishap with the control systems the ârally signalâ in the DNA was engaged a few centuries earlier than planned and originally dormant experimental genes were activated which made entities combat-ready. The DNA of the inhabitants, however, hadnât fully developed, and thus the planet was filled with lunatics and suicidal maniacs instead of super soldiers as was originally planned, these mutants survived, and despite their human appearance they couldnât technically be called humans. Survivors have changed mentally, and a decade later visible transformations were reported. The most notable changes involved the blackening of the eyeballs or a strange luminescence in them. Keen to cover up their new appearance, these individuals would hide their eyes and faces under clothing and sunglasses.

Two decades have passed since âCrossoutâ, many do remember what was before. As always there are those willing to rebuild the old world and those that revel in the vision of a burning ruin. Yet there are also those devoid of any humanity at all, but one thing is for sure, this battle will rage on for a long time.

== Gameplay ==
The [[gameplay]] is announced to be focused around the creation and subsequent upgrade of the [[Player (game)|player's]] vehicle through combat and trade as well as the crafting of new items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crossout: Gaijin announces vehicle combat MMO |date=20 May 2015 |url=http://www.freemmostation.com/news/crossout-gaijin-announces-vehicle-combat-mmo/ |website=FREEMMOSTATION |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the game depicts a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] setting after a "Nuclear war" and "human genetic testing gone awry",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=War Thunder dev announces 'Motorstorm meets Mad Max: Fury Road' MMO Crossout |author=Megan Farokhmanesh |date=20 May 2015 |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/20/8630829/crossout-mmo-gaijin |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing some resemblance to the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mad Max-Style Post-Apocalyptic Vehicular Combat PC MMO Revealed |author=Hannah Richardson Lewis |date=20 May 2015 |url=http://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/44112/crossout-brutal-post-apocalyptic-vehicle-combat-mmo-gaijin-entertainment/ |website=MMOGames |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vehicle Customization ===
The game focuses around vehicle combat. Players gain reputation with different factions, gaining access to new blueprints, parts, cars. Players gather parts and materials via battle rewards, completing missions, breaking down unneeded equipment, or by purchasing items from other players via an in-game market. Each player's combat vehicle is only limited by the player's imagination and 2 mandatory parts that need to be integrated into each player's design: cabin and undercarriage (frame). Parts such as armor, weaponry, generators, and auxiliary devices are not required. Different combinations of these items let players custom tune vehicles to their own liking and playstyle. As there are no fixed traditional vehicle "classes" or vehicle roles, players are free to edit and modify their vehicle as they feel, allowing players to customize both the look and the technical aspects of their vehicle, honing their machineâs performance and looks to their liking.

Along with vehicle crafting and customization, Crossout implements a physics model. Players must take into consideration the center of gravity, mass, location and placement of parts. A vehicle too top-heavy may roll over if turned too quickly or during movement on uneven terrain. Heavy machinery has more difficulty navigating. Equipment (such as a rotating radar dish) placed too close to the ground may be hit during its movement causing loss of control or degraded movement ability. Large caliber cannons present recoil on both ends of the weapon, being able to flip over a lighter vehicle that fired the projectile, and potentially flipping the player who is hit. This mechanic not only gives players more in-depth customization, but also acts as a self-balancing aspect. Players who just load down a vehicle with heavy armor and large caliber weapons would not be able to function in combat.

=== Battles ===
These battles are real-time and involve two teams of players and AI-participants. To win, a team must eliminate the enemy team, capture base or perform other tasks depending on the game mode.

===Damage model===

Any vehicle is âactiveâ until the cabin is destroyed, before that it may lose other parts including armor, wheels and armament, effectively crippling or neutralizing it. Because of that, it is important to protect vital components on the battle wagon. Some parts, such as generators or fuel barrels, will explode upon destruction dealing damage to the components/vehicles around it.

===Vehicle Tiers===

Matchmaking is currently limited only by the parts used to create the players' vehicles. Armor costs very few points, while guns and cannons cost much more, meaning that players will be matched with relatively equal-tiered vehicles. Because of this, a vehicle's points come mostly from the weapons it uses.

===Factions===

*'''Engineers:''' Players start in the Engineers faction, and can join one other faction upon reaching level 10. Motivated by neither money nor ideology, this semi-official faction provides everything and helps train up new survivors. Other than that, there is only the occasional blueprint or extra training given.

*'''Lunatics:''' High risk, high reward. Psycho Pete's lunatics fight with buggies. Their weapons are mainly focused around explosives, rams and shotguns, while armour is an optional extra. Fast and agile, their vehicles are good scouts.

*'''Nomads:''' These wanderers are too human to be named the Lost, but are not true humans either. The Nomads use pieces stripped from aircraft, and favour automatic weapons. Their vehicles combine light armour and speed. Faster than the Scavengers, better armoured than the Lunatics, their cars are silver at everything, gold at none.

*'''Scavengers:''' They scavenge old warehouses and abandoned military bases. What is operational is sold. Anything else is repaired and mounted on their cars. The vehicles are centred around armour and firepower, and use a lot of heavy parts. Slow but dangerous, it is foolish to attack one head on. Their weapons are mainly cannons.

*'''Steppenwolfs:''' An elite squad of troops, these soldiers have access to the resources and technology of the Brotherhood. They are either decorated war heroes, disgraced agents or ruthless monsters under the death sentence. They prefer to use long ranged weapons to shoot from behind cover. Unlocked at level 10 with the Scavengers.

*'''Dawn's Children:''' Using cutting edge technology, Dawn's children have protected themselves from the Crossout virus using specially sealed suits. Their vehicles use prototype military parts, rover pieces and high tech plasma weaponry. They have also developed hovers for use in battle. Unlocked at level 10 with the Nomads.

*'''Firestarters:''' Using vehicles closely resembling [[Hot rod|"Hot Rod"]] cars, these cultists worship fire and burn all who disagree. With shotguns, explosives and flamethrowers, they are truly a force to be reckoned with. Anyone who questions their capability for magic quickly disappears. Unlocked at level 10 with the Lunatics.

The '''''Cypria''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ÎÏÏÏÎ¹Î±}} ''KÃºpria''; [[Latin]]: ''Cypria'') is a lost [[epic poetry|epic poem]] of ancient [[Greek literature]], which has been attributed to [[Stasinus]] and was quite well known in [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] (ii.117) refers to it.&lt;/ref&gt; and fixed in a received text, but which subsequently was lost to view. It was part of the [[Epic Cycle]], which told the entire history of the [[Trojan War]] in epic hexameter verse. The story of the ''Cypria'' comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the ''[[Iliad]]''; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic [[dactylic hexameter]]s.

==Date and authorship==
The ''Cypria'', in the written form in which it was known in [[classical Greece]], was probably composed in the late seventh century BC,&lt;ref&gt;"An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the [[Judgement of Paris]] on the Chigi vase" (Burkert 1992:103). On the [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Orientalizing style|proto-Attic]] [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]] of ca. 640 BC called the [http://www.wisc.edu/arth/ah300/13-myth/33.image.html Chigi "vase"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Paris is identified as ''Al[exand]ros'', as he was apparently called in ''Cypria''.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn-White noted&lt;ref&gt;In his Preface to ''Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica''&lt;/ref&gt; "were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by [[Homer]]," one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of ''Cypria'' as post-Homeric, in effect a "[[prequel]]". "The author of the ''Kypria'' already regarded the ''Iliad'' as a text. Any reading of the ''Kypria'' will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the ''Iliad'' in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lykaon]] to [[Lemnos]] or the kitting out of [[Achilles]] with [[Briseis]] and [[Agamemnon]] with [[Chryseis]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Dowden]], "Homer's Sense of Text" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''116''' (1996, pp. 47-61). p 48, noting that the observation had been made by Eric Bethe, in ''Homer: Dichtung und Sage II: Odysee, Kyklos, Zeitbestimmung'', 1922:202.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison can be made with the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the ''Iliad'' as text.

The stories contained in the ''Cypria'', on the other hand, were fixed&lt;ref&gt;W. Kullmann's term ''Faktkanon'', the "canon of facts" is useful in distinguishing fixed narrative contentâ the list and sequence of factsâ from fixed, [[Canon (fiction)|canonic texts]].&lt;/ref&gt; much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating [[oral tradition]]s associated with the [[Homer]]ic epics also apply to the ''Cypria''. Many or all of the stories in the ''Cypria'' were known to the composer(s) of the ''Iliad'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The ''Cypria'', in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the ''Iliad''&lt;ref&gt;''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', 1911: "[[Stasinus]]"&lt;/ref&gt; though there is an overlap in events from the death of [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]], including the catalogue of Trojan allies.{{sfn|Pinder|1995}} J. Marks observes that "Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the ''Kypria'' simply ended with the death of Palamedes."{{sfn|Pinder|1995|p=2}}

The title ''Cypria'', associating the epic with [[Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, (Burkert 1992:103) noting Mesopotamian parallels, concludes "these observations must then point to that epoch when Cyprus, though rich and powerful, was still formally under Assyrian domination".&lt;/ref&gt; demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient tradition&lt;ref&gt;Recorded in [[John Tzetzes]]' ''Chiliades'' xiii.638.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been given by [[Homer]] as a dowry to his son-in-law, a [[Stasinus of Cyprus]] mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by [[Pindar]]. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the ''Cypria'' was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see [[Cyclic Poets]]).

It is possible that the "[[Trojan Battle Order]]" (the list of [[Troy|Trojans]] and their allies, of ''[[Iliad]]'' 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'') is abridged from that in the ''Cypria'', which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies.

==Manuscript tradition==
In current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the ''Cypria'''s original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the ''[[Chrestomathy]]'' attributed to an unknown "Proclus" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian [[Eutychius Proclus]], or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Chrestomathy'' itself was preserved in the ninth-century Patriarch [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]]' renowned ''Bibliotheca'' or ''Myriobiblon'', codex 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline.

==Content==
What follows embeds reports of known content of the ''Cypria'' in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles.

The poem narrates the origins of the [[Trojan War]] and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992: 101-04. Compare ''[[Atra-Hasis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seven Against Thebes|Theban war of the Seven]] ensues.

The ''Cypria'' described the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]; in the [[Judgement of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;Paris is called ''Alexandros'' in quotations of ''Cypria'' and in the surviving synopsis.&lt;/ref&gt; among the goddesses [[Athena]], [[Hera]], and [[Aphrodite]]: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]].

Then Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and [[Helenus]] foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders [[Aeneas]] to sail with him, while [[Cassandra]] prophesies the outcome. In [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]] the Trojans are entertained by the sons of [[Tyndareus]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor and Polydeuces]], and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen&lt;ref&gt;"In the Cypria, Nemesis was Helen's mother, born after Zeus raped the goddess, who had done her best to escape him." {{cite journal|last1=Scodel|first1=Ruth|title=Stupid, Pointless Wars|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|date=2008|volume=138|pages=219â235|doi=10.1353/apa.0.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her [[dowry]] back to his home of [[Troy]] with an episode at [[Sidon]], which Paris and his men successfully storm.

In the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of [[Idas]] and [[Lynceus]], are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day.

[[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother [[Agamemnon]]. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] in a digression tells Menelaus how [[Epopeus]] was destroyed after seducing the daughter of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], the story of [[Oedipus]], the madness of [[Heracles]], and the story of [[Theseus]] and [[Ariadne]]. In gathering the leaders, they detect [[Odysseus]]' feigned madness.

The assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], where the prophet [[Calchas]] warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of [[Teuthras]] in [[Mysia]] and sack it in error for Ilium: [[Telephus]] comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by [[Achilles]]. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at [[Skyros]] and marries [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidameia]], the daughter of [[Lycomedes]], then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium.

When the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to appease the goddess [[Artemis]] and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles.
Artemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the [[Tauri]], making her immortal.

Next they sail as far as [[Tenedos]], where while they are feasting, [[Philoctetes]] is bitten by a snake and is left behind in [[Lemnos]]. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the [[Troad]] is repulsed by the Trojans, and [[Protesilaus]] is killed by [[Hector]]. Achilles then kills [[Cycnus]], the son of [[Poseidon]], and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about.

Achilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and [[Thetis]] contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by
Achilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills [[Troilus]]. [[Patroclus]] carries away [[Lycaon (Troy)|Lycaon]] to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives [[Briseis]] as a prize, and Agamemnon [[Chryseis]].
Then follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies.

==Reception==
The ''Cypria'' was considered to be a lesser work than [[Homer]]'s two masterpieces: [[Aristotle]] criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story.

DR is a founding member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

DR is funded by a [[television licence|media licence]] which is charged to all Danish households with television sets, computers, smartphones and other devices with internet access.

Today, DR operates six television channels, all of which are distributed [[free-to-air]] via a nationwide [[DVB-T]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DANISH DVB-T NETWORK|url=http://digi-tv.dk/In_English/|publisher=Digi-TV|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DR also operates eight radio channels. All are available nationally on [[Digital Audio Broadcast|DAB+ radio]] and online, with the four original stations also available on [[FM radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oversigt over FM-nettets sendemaster og frekvenser|url=http://www.dr.dk/OmDR/Modtagelse/Radio/FM/20091028120111.htm|publisher=DR|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Danmarks Radio.svg|thumb|220px|Old DR logo used from 1996 until 2013.]]
DR was founded on April 1, 1925 under the name of ''Radioordningen'', which was changed to ''Statsradiofonien'' in 1926, to ''Danmarks Radio'' in 1959,&lt;ref name="um-massmedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark â Culture â Mass Media |url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap4/4-13-5.asp#4-13-5 |work= |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110120850/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap4/4-13-5.asp |archivedate=January 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to ''DR'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DANMARKS RADIO 1925-|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/danmarks-radio-1925/|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the German [[occupation of Denmark]] in [[World War II]], radio broadcasts were censored â under particularly harsh conditions from August 1943 â leading many Danes to turn to Danish-language broadcasts from the [[BBC]] or the illegal press,&lt;ref name="befrielsen1945"&gt;{{cite web | title=Censur | url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/stikord/censur.html | work= | publisher=www.befrielsen1945.dk | date= | accessdate=2009-04-30 | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Swedish radio in 1944â1945.&lt;ref name="um-massmedia" /&gt;

Statsradiofonien's second FM radio station, Program 2 (P2), was added in 1951, followed by P3 in 1963.

Experimental television broadcasts started in 1949, with regular programming beginning on October 2, 1951 with the launch of Denmark's first television channel. Daily programming began in 1954.&lt;ref name="um-massmedia" /&gt; Colour television test broadcasts were started in March 1967, with the first large-scale colour broadcasting occurring for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], France.&lt;ref name="colour"&gt;[http://www.recordere.dk/indhold/templates/design.aspx?articleid=2528&amp;zoneid=3 40 Ã¥r med farve-tv fra DR]&lt;/ref&gt; Danmarks Radio officially ended "test" transmissions of colour television on April 1, 1970, although it wasn't until 1978 that their last black-and-white television program (''TV Avisen'') switched to colour.&lt;ref name="colour" /&gt;

On exactly 16 May 1983 at 14:00 CEST, DR launched its first [[teletext]] information service, which is still available on all DR channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Ã¥r pÃ¥ tekst-tv-tronen|url=http://www.dr.dk/om-dr/nyheder/30-aar-paa-tekst-tv-tronen|accessdate=8 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danmarks Radio's monopoly on national television lasted until 1988, when [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] started broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV2, 1988-|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/tv2-1988/|publisher=Danmarkshistorien|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8 years later DR launched their second television channel, [[DR2]] on August 30, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dr.dk/OmDR/About+DR/20060622150803.htm ''Om DR''] (''About DR''), Danmarks Radio corporate website, Undated. Retrieved January 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was sometimes called ''den hemmelige kanal'' ("the secret channel") in its early years because it could not be seen nationwide at its launch.

The first trials of [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] were carried out in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kum.dk/sw1915.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419113636/http://kum.dk/sw1915.asp |archivedate=April 19, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with eight channels officially launching in October 2002.&lt;ref name="dr2000-"&gt;{{cite web | title=DR i Ã¥rene fra 2000 og frem til i dag | url=https://www.dr.dk/OmDR/Fakta+om+DR/Historie/20060504132635.htm | work= | publisher=DR | date= | accessdate=2009-05-02 | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2007, DR launched an online-only news channel [[DR Update]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR lancerer nyhedskanal til nettet: DR Update|url=https://www.dr.dk/presse/dr-lancerer-nyhedskanal-til-nettet-dr-update|accessdate=8 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later added as a traditional channel. At the Danish changeover to over-the-air digital signals on November 1, 2009, DR added three new channels to their lineup&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Danish switchover completed | url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/11/01/danish-switch-over-completed/ | work= | publisher=Broadband TV News | date=November 1, 2009 | accessdate=2009-11-16 }};&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[DR K]] - an intercultural, documentary and "odd-film" channel.
* [[DR HD]] â Denmark's first [[free-to-air]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] channel intended to air successful shows from the other DR channels in true HD only, with no upscaling.
* [[DR Ramasjang]], a children's channel.

In 2013 a new logo in which the letters "DR" featured in a white [[sans-serif]] font on a black background was introduced, and the line-up of television channels was changed once again. A new channel targeting young people, [[DR3]] replaced DR HD. Another channel for children, [[DR Ultra]] replaced DR Update. The closure of DR Update was the start of a revamping of [[DR 2]] as a channel for news and society.

A nationwide switch from DAB to the newer DAB+ format took place on 1 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Overgangen til DAB+ udsat til 1. oktober 2017|url=http://danskemedier.dk/nyhed/overgangen-til-dab-udsat-til-1-oktober-2017/|accessdate=8 April 2017|agency=Danske Medier|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of DR's stations plus the privately owned, public service channel - Radio24Syv, moved to the second national DAB+ multiplex (DAB-blok 2).

== Financing ==
The principal means of funding DR is through the [[television licence|media licence]], costing 2.492 DKK per year per household since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prisen for medielicens|url=https://www.dr.dk/om-dr/licens/prisen-medielicens|publisher=DR|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, radio and television owners were obliged to pay the licence, though the increased availability of online streaming led to the television licence being replaced by the media licence on January 1, 2007. The media licence is mandatory for all owners of television sets, as well as computers, smartphones or other devices with internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skal jeg betale medielicens?|url=http://dr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/40|publisher=DR|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 approximately 180,000 households did not pay media licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SÃ¥ mange betaler ikke licens|url=http://www.business.dk/media/saa-mange-betaler-ikke-licens|accessdate=9 April 2017|publisher=Berlingske Business|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue also comes from commercial activities such as concerts and events in the [[Koncerthuset]], from book, CD, and DVD sales, and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes.

Over a period of four years starting in 2019 through 2022 the media license will be replaced by general taxation, as announced on 16 March 2018 by a majority in the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] consisting of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservatives]], [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]], and [[Danish People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borre|first1=Martin|title=Officielt: Regeringen afskaffer licensen og skÃ¦rer 20 procent i DR|url=https://www.b.dk/politiko/officielt-regeringen-afskaffer-licensen-og-skaerer-20-procent-i-dr|accessdate=8 May 2018|agency=Berlingske|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aftale om fokusering af DR og afskaffelse af medielicensen|url=https://www.regeringen.dk/media/5024/ny-aftale-om-fokusering-af-dr-og-afskaffelse-af-medielicensen.pdf|publisher=Regeringen|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographical terrestrial coverage ===

{{See also|Digital terrestrial television in Denmark}}

'''Denmark'''

All of Denmark is covered by digital terrestrial reception through a nationwide [[DVB-T]] and [[MPEG-4]] network comprising six multiplexes (MUX).  DR owns MUXes 1 and 2 in a joint-venture between DR and TV 2.  MUXes 1 and 2 broadcast all six DR channels unencrypted. Given the low topography of the Danish mainland and islands, so-called [[signal overspill]] is inevitable if every part of the country is to receive coverage. Hence, all DRs' channels are available in northernmost Germany, and [[Scania]] the southernmost part of Sweden.

'''Greenland'''

Every city in [[Greenland]] can receive DR1, DR2 and DR Ultra free-to-air via a public DVB-T network.

'''Faroe Islands'''

The company, TelevarpiÃ°, a subsidiary of Faroese Telecom covers the [[Faroe Islands]] with a DVB-T network broadcasting DR1, DR2, DR3, DR Ramasjang and DR Ultra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TelevarpiÃ°|url=http://tv.fo/|website=TelevarpiÃ°|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DR's online presence includes a comprehensive news website and archive. It was launched as DR Online in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etableringen af DR Online, 1994-96|url=https://www.slideshare.net/cfi_nb/etableringen-af-dr-online-199496|publisher=Niels BrÃ¼gger|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kantar Gallup, dr.dk is Denmark's most visited site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dansk online Index|url=https://doi.tns-clarity.com/Storyboard/RHViewStoryBoard.aspx?RId=%C2%B2%C2%B1&amp;RLId=%C2%B1%C2%B8&amp;PId=%C2%B5%C2%B3%C2%BA%C2%B5&amp;UId=%C2%B1%C2%B8%C2%B7%C2%BA%C2%B6&amp;RpId=20|publisher=Kantar Gallup|accessdate=9 April 2017}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RosenkjÃ¦r Prize==
Since 1963, DR has awarded the RosenkjÃ¦r Prize to a person who has proven an ability to make a difficult subject accessible to a wider audience in an understandable and vivid form. The prizewinner commits to hold a number of radio lectures. The prize is named after Jens RosenkjÃ¦r (1883â1976), Head of State Broadcasting 1937â53. The prize is now DKK 50,000, up from 25,000 in 2008, and 40,000 in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dr.dk/search/forside.htm?q=rosenkjaer&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;getfields=*&amp;filter=p&amp;client=default_frontend Rosenkjaer Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
DR's board of directors comprises 11 members appointed for a four-year period. Three members, including the chair, are appointed by the [[Culture Minister of Denmark|Minister of Culture]], and six by Parliament, while the employees of DR elect two members. The board has overall responsibility for DR programs and for the hiring of DR's chief executive, the director general, and the remaining management positions.

As the major recipient of [[TV license|license funds]], DR operates under a public service contract with the government which it was unable to fulfil in the wake of the budget crisis related to the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Licence | url=https://www.dr.dk/OmDR/About%20DR/20061123155622.htm | work= | publisher=www.dr.dk | date= | accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The act on broadcasting | url=https://www.dr.dk/OmDR/About%20DR/20060703142020.htm | work= | publisher=www.dr.dk | date= | accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Public service contract between DR and the Danish Minister for Culture for the period from 1 January 2007â 31 December 2010 | url=https://www.dr.dk/NR/rdonlyres/44FFCA8C-B869-4EB9-AC70-E88D77EE8574/618897/Publicservicekontraktensembelkorrektion1.pdf | work= | publisher=www.dr.dk | date= | accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget overspends caused a major scandal which saw senior management of DR replaced, and was followed by a heated political debate over whether the service should receive additional emergency funding{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. Various measures to mitigate the impact on the public service obligations of the institution were contemplated by the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], and a compromise was agreed to limit the impact of the deficit.

==Accusations of bias==
For over a decade, the [[Danish People's Party]], a [[nativism (politics)|nativist]]&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Lauren |title=Danish Postmodern Why are so many people fans of Scandinavian TV? |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/danish-postmodern |website=newyorker.com |publisher=CondÃ© Nast |accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] political party,&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delman|first1=Edward|title=How Not to Welcome Refugees|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/denmark-refugees-immigration-law/431520/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized DR for alleged bias in its political news coverage, citing the process for appointment to DR's board of directors. In response, DR set up a "watchdog committee" intended to detect and report upon any bias.

The first large-scale scientific content analysis of political news coverage on DR published by the [[Centre for Journalism (University of Southern Denmark)|Centre for Journalism]] at the [[University of Southern Denmark]], studying election news coverage in the years 1994â2007, documented no persistent political bias towards either the left or the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 | accessdate = 2011-10-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt; News coverage of political actors and parties was found to be largely similar to the news coverage on DR's competitor [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]]. The study concluded that political news coverage on both broadcasters was guided by journalistic professional criteria as to the newsworthiness of political actors and political issues, not by partisan considerations.

In 2008, [[Mikael Rothstein]], author and professor of [[religious history]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], was highly critical of DR when it issued a [[Christian values]] policy, declaring that Muslims would feel excluded.&lt;ref name="NFO"&gt;[http://www.nfo.nu/b95000c/base/518f2776 New edict forcing DR to convey Christianity]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "hurriyet"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/mob_n.php?n=danish-radio-embraces-8216christian-values8217-in-new-contract-2011-02-13 Danish Radio Embraces Christian Values], ''Hurriyet Daily News'', Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dreamchasers 3'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music criticism|music critic]]s. Jake Rohn of [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] gave the mixtape four out of five stars, saying "''Dreamchasers 3'', like most mixtapes, does have some filler like "My Life" and the monotonous "We Ain't the Same" (which ironically bares too much similarity to what every other rapper is saying on records these days). It's not perfect, but it's pretty close.With Meek's current momentum, a slew of fellow dreamchasers in his corner and one of the strongest teams in the game behind him, he is establishing himself again as a true star on this tape and a deadly opponent on the mic."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedmill"/&gt; Bruce Smith of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album a positive review, saying "Fans of Meek Millâs ''[[Dreamchasers]]'' or ''[[Dreamchasers 2]]'', are bound to find much to like about ''Dreamchasers 3''. However, when Meekâs competition is talking about raising the bar lyrically, and he continues to rap about repo-ing women, and comparing diamond flooded watches to the disaster that was Hurricane Katrina, it wonât be surprising if his overall standing within the game takes another hit. This edition of "''Dreamchasers''" is closed out with what sounds to be an intro to Meekâs next effort, and hopefully that project shows the growth many think Meek Mill is capable of."&lt;ref name="hhdx"/&gt; Emmanuel C.M. of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave the mixtape an L, saying "Even though the tape isnât game changing, it does show that Meek is very capable of making propulsive rap music that can also serve as hits. No longer is he only capable of making street anthems; he can actually churn out a vast array of records that will actually get spins. The growth is there. Heâs using his strength, raw emotion and skill as a storyteller, and mastering his craft as an artist. However, this is far from the main course, just a table of different selections to temper the appetite."&lt;ref name="xxlmagmill"/&gt;

On December 24, 2013, ''XXL'' ranked it at number 20 of their list of best mixtapes of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/12/the-25-best-mixtapes-of-2013/3/ |title=The 25 Best Mixtapes Of 2013 - Page 3 of 6 - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-12-24 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''media and entertainment industry in India''' consists of many different segments under its folds such as television, print, and films. It also includes smaller segments like radio, music, OOH, animation, gaming and visual effects (VFX) and Internet advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Yojana August, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment industry in India has registered an explosive growth in last two decades making it one of the fastest growing industries in India. From a single state owned channel, Doordarshan in the 1990s there are more than 400 active channels in the country. Worldwide, 2010 saw the global economy begin to recover from a steep decline in 2009. Improved economic conditions in 2010 played a major role in a rebound in customer spend. Since the world economy begin to recover from the global financial crisis of 2008, improved economic conditions played a major role in rebound in consumer spend. While India was not critically impacted by the downturn in 2008 and 2009, it demonstrated one of the highest growth rates this year and continued to at a healthy pace. The rising rate of investments by the private sector and foreign media and entertainment (M&amp;E) majors have improved India's entertainment infrastructure to a great extent. As per the recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers&lt;ref name=PwC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/in/en/industries/entertainment-media.jhtml|title=Entertainment and Media|first=|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (PwC), Indians are likely to spend more on entertainment in the coming years with a steady growth in their disposable income. And as per the combined survey report by KMPG and FICCI, the entertainment industry in India is expected to expand by 12.5% every year and is likely to reach US$20.09 billion by the year 2013. The industry pegged at INR 5808 billion in 2009 as compared to INR 3565 billion in 2005. The Indian Media &amp; Entertainment Industry grew from US$12.9 billion in 2009 to US$14.4 billion in 2010, a growth of 11 per cent, according to a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and research firm KPMG. The report also states that backed by positive industry sentiment and growing [[media consumption]], the industry is estimated to achieve growth of 13 per cent in 2011 to touch US$16.2 billion. As the industry braces for exciting times ahead, the sector is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent to reach US$28.1 billion by 2015.&lt;ref name = IndiainBusiness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiainbusiness.nic.in/industry-infrastructure/service-sectors/media-entertainment.htm|title=Welcome to India in Business : Industry &amp; Services|website=www.indiainbusiness.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television industry ==
{{main|Television in India}}
Television is one of the major mass media of India and is a huge industry and has thousands of programs in all the states of India. Today India boasts of being the second largest television market in the world.&lt;ref name = Indiamirror&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/indian-industries/television.html|title=Indian Television Industry, Television Industry in India, Television Industry, Television Industries, TV Industry|first=|last=nimmi|website=www.indianmirror.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind some even attaining national fame. TV soaps are extremely popular with housewives as well as working women. Approximately half of all Indian households own a television. Television first came to India in the form of [[Doordarshan]] (DD) on Sept 15, 1959.&lt;ref name=Doordarshan&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ddindia.gov.in/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726051932/http://www.ddindia.gov.in/# |archive-date=2013-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doordarshan is the National Television Network of India and also one of the largest broadcasting organisations in the world. Apart from the state run Doordarshan, there are six DTH players with 54.52 million DTH users in India with the present prediction; it is likely to overtake the US in terms of the largest DTH market in the world.  As of 2012, the country has a collection of free and subscription services over a variety of distribution media, through which there are over 823 channels of which 184 are pay channels. Total television viewership of 415 million is amongst the worldâs highest with nearly 15-16 Television companies beaming programmers to India. The major players being Doordarshan, [[STAR TV]] (Satellite Television Asia Network), Zee Television, United Television, [[CNN]], Sony Television, ATN (Asia Television Network), BBC World, SUN TV, Discovery Channel, TNT and Others.&lt;ref name=Diehardindian&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.diehardindian.com/ntertain/media.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031015043/http://www.diehardindian.com/ntertain/media.htm# |archive-date=2011-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiaâs television business has an estimated $3.4 billion in revenue in 2005, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. With the government is focusing more on Digitalisation, TV distribution is taking new shape Digitalisation has been a major challenge for the government as digital cable is not gaining momentum. According to the new deadline, pan India digitalisation us expected to happen by December 31, 2014. Another challenge for the Television Industry is Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). India is amongst the countries with lowest ARPU as compared to developed countries like US and UK where ARPU is around US$45 to US$60, India has an ARPU approximately US$3.5.

==Print industry==
{{main|Printing industry in India}}
The Indian print media industry is expected to grow by 9.6 per cent over the period 2010-15.&lt;ref name = IBEF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibef.org/artdispview.aspx?in=49&amp;art_id=29801&amp;cat_id=124&amp;page=2 |title=Media and Entertainment |publisher=Ibef.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print industry is expected to grow from Rs 128 bn in 2006 to Rs 232 bn by 2011, at 12.6% CAGR. While the newspaper industry is estimated at Rs 112 bn, the magazine segment is valued at Rs 16 bn.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Equity Master&gt;http://www.equitymaster.com/detail.asp?date=09/14/2007&amp;story=5&amp;title=Indian-Print-industry-An-overview&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper industry is also projected to perform well for the next five years growing at a CAGR of 10.1 per cent according to a report titled "India Entertainment and Media Outlook 2011" by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Indian print industry is growing strong and is expected to grow similarly while the global print industry is moving towards digitalisation and showing a negative growth rate year on year. Print industry in India is the world's second largest with over 90 million copies in circulation daily after China with 130 million copies in circulation daily. Most newspaper has an online&lt;ref name=Onlinenewspaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/india.htm|title=Directory of Indian Online Newspapers|website=Indian Online Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; presence and a growing view counts on their portals. Much of the entertainment and media segments are now focusing on growth in regional areas and smaller towns. Year 2009, a year when there was a slowdown, the regional print showed growth in local to local advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;name=npes&gt;http://www.npes.in/print/INDIAN%20PRINT%20INDUSTRY.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227044453/http://www.npes.in/print/INDIAN%20PRINT%20INDUSTRY.pdf# |date=2012-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, regional print further increased its share in overall print advertisement revenue pie. Regional papers give advertisers access to localised populations and their niche target audience, difficult to do via national broadcast media. Newspapers have realised value and have gone one step further and have launched area specific newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afaqs.com/all/news/misc/38475_Print_Special.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152311/http://www.afaqs.com/all/news/misc/38475_Print_Special.pdf# |archive-date=2014-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise in literacy in past decade has let to the rise of regional newspapers, they have much greater reach and a large audience to entertain. Magazines have not been at their best performance in past few years. However, niche magazine are doing well and is expected to show positive growth. The major challenge faced by this segment of media and entertainment industry is newsprint which continues to threaten profitability. Newsprint forms a major component of the cost of publishing a newspaper. It is roughly 40 -50 percent of the total cost.&lt;ref name=PrintIndustry&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.techno-preneur.net/information-desk/sciencetech-magazine/2009/september09/Print.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415093013/http://www.techno-preneur.net/information-desk/sciencetech-magazine/2009/september09/Print.pdf# |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film industry==
{{main|Cinema of India}}
Films are the most important form of entertainment in India. Film industry in India is among the largest in the world in terms of films produced&lt;ref name=IIFA&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iifa.com/Indianfilmindustry.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203053449/http://www.iifa.com/Indianfilmindustry.html# |archive-date=2011-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 1000) in different languages which include films in Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Tamil,marathi, Telugu, Punjabi and Malayalam.&lt;ref name=Indiaonestop&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiaonestop.com/film.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101231638/http://www.indiaonestop.com/film.htm# |archive-date=2011-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately twenty-three million Indians go to see a film every day. [[Film Federation of India]] is the apex body of film industry in India whose objective is to popularise and promote the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Film Federation Of India http://www.filmfed.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood accounts for 46 percent of the total Indian film industry revenues film industry experts.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;The Hindu&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/the-india-cables/the-cables/article1716155.ece&lt;/ref&gt; According to unofficial estimates available in January 2001, the Indian film industry has an annual turnover of Rs. 60 billion (approximately US$1.33 billion). It employs more than 6 million people, most of whom are contract workers as opposed to regular employees. As at the start of 2001, a reasonable budget film in Hindi could cost US$1.75 million. A low budget Hindi film can be made for even as low as Rs. 15 million. A big budget Hindi movie can cost in excess of US$30 million. The 'bigness' of the budget is attributable mainly to the high fees paid to 'stars', celebrated music directors, high-end technologies and expensive travel costs to shoot in exotic locations worldwide. At the time of writing, it is believed that 'stars' like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan are paid around Rs. 100 million (US$440,000) per film. India has a [[National Film Development Corporation of India|National Film Development Corporation]] (NFDC) which finances some films. A few film makers, who would find it hard to obtain finance from the regular sources, have been financed by the NFDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfdcindia.com/|title=NFDC: Cinemas of india|website=www.nfdcindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NFDC cannot be considered to play a central role in the film industry because it finances too few films which, too, are not of the type that has made the Indian film industry so vibrant.

==Radio industry==
Radio broadcasting in India started in British India in 1923 with the Radio Club of Bombay. [[All India Radio]] (AIR) was established in 1936 which is one of the largest radio networks in the world including the AIR FM. AM, FM and even Satellite Radio have made a huge impact on the Industry in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian-voice-overs.com/radio-in-india.html|title=The Indian Radio Industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the media houses either already have a presence in the industry or are looking to get a license in the next round. Famous stations are Radio Mirchi (of the Times Group) has maintained a lead position in most cities it operates in and other channels like Radio City, Red FM, Big FM, Fever, Radio One have also been able to get significant traction.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Startin&gt;http://strat.in/2009/08/insights-into-the-indian-radio-industry/&lt;/ref&gt; Till 1990 Indian economy was closed, no private player was allowed to enter and Akashwani has the sole responsibility to cater to the wide and culturally diverse Indian consumer base. In the last 5 years, the [[Radio industry]] in India has seen a [[compound annual growth rate]] of approximately 20% and has grown to a size of around Rs. 8.3 billion in 2008. By the end of the 2010, there were 245 active radio stations in India and had a market size of INR 10 billion. It registered a cumulative growth rate of 11 percent from 2007 to 2010. The industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20 percent over 2010- 2015 and is expected to be INR 25 billion in terms of revenue. Phase III privatisation of the radio FM is expected to add 839 new radio stations in 294 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.techno-preneur.net/information-desk/sciencetech-magazine/2009/october09/Radio%20Industry.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415093329/http://www.techno-preneur.net/information-desk/sciencetech-magazine/2009/october09/Radio%20Industry.pdf# |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has approved Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in FM radio channels to 26 percent from the current 20 percent. Ministry of Information and broadcasting is planning to release additional frequencies in all markets, automatic renewal of license at the end of the initial term of the license of the term.&lt;ref name="Ministry Of Information and Broadcasting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mib.nic.in/ |title=Home &amp;#124; Ministry of Information and Broadcasting &amp;#124; Government of India |publisher=Mib.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2018-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721005032/http://www.mib.nic.in/# |archive-date=2012-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major reasons for such an interest in the industry is the increased profitability. The government has cut the license fees to 1/10th of the previous amount.

==Controversial IP Protection By Indian Film Industry==

Indian film industry has been engaging in illegal activities by hiring IT professionals who are launching [[Denial-of-service attack]] against websites that they believe are violating the intellectual property of their clients.&lt;ref name="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100905/11383610909.shtml"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100905/11383610909.shtml|title= Bizarre Indian Anti-Piracy Group Says It Does DoS Attacks On File Sharing Operations|work= Techdirt |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/10/bollywood_cyber_vigilantes_fight_movie_pirates/"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/10/bollywood_cyber_vigilantes_fight_movie_pirates/|title= Bollywood 'recruits DDoS hired guns to fight movie pirates'|work= The Register|date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fabrice Morvan''' (born 14 May 1966) is a French singer-songwriter, dancer and model. He was half of the pop duo [[Milli Vanilli]], with [[Rob Pilatus]], selling multi-platinum albums around the world. However, he was later involved in one of the largest [[scandal]]s in pop music history when it was revealed that neither he nor Pilatus had actually sung on any of Milli Vanilli's recordings. After the scandal, the group reformed as [[Rob &amp; Fab]] in the 1990s with limited success. Morvan  had a solo comeback in the 2000s releasing his first solo album, ''[[Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album)|Love Revolution]]''.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Morvan was born in 1966 in Paris, France, to parents from [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/milli-vanilli-p4917/biography|title=Milli Vanilli â Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18, he moved to Germany, where he was a dancer and model, and was influenced by [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. He met Rob Pilatus in a nightclub in [[Munich]]. They decided to form a rock/soul group.

=== Fame ===
Morvan and Pilatus were noticed by music producer [[Frank Farian]], who signed them as part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to [[Turkey]], where they reputedly got the band's name from a local advertising [[slogan]], Milli Vanilli was born. Morvan and Pilatus served as the public faces for singers [[Charles Shaw (singer)|Charles Shaw]], John Davis, and [[Brad Howell (singer)|Brad Howell]], who Farian thought were talented musicians but lacked a marketable image.

The first Milli Vanilli album was ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]''. Despite critical derision, Milli Vanilli's fame continued to grow worldwide. The album had four hit singles: [[Girl You Know It's True (song)|the title track]], and the group's three #1 hits, "[[Girl I'm Gonna Miss You]]", "[[Baby Don't Forget My Number]]", and "[[Blame It on the Rain]]". Milli Vanilli won the [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist on 22 February 1990 for ''Girl You Know It's True''.

Morvan and Pilatus were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of on-stage [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] and not having sung on the album. Shaw told a reporter the truth about Milli Vanilli, but recanted after Farian paid him $150,000 to do so{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} .

When Morvan and Pilatus pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus had not actually sung on any of the records. As a result, Milli Vanilli's Grammy was withdrawn four days later and [[Arista Records]] dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalog, thus making ''Girl You Know It's True'' one of the largest-selling albums to ever be taken out of print. A court allowed any American who bought the album to get a refund.

Farian would later attempt a failed comeback for the group without Morvan and Pilatus.

===Aftermath===
Months later, Morvan and Pilatus parodied the scandal in a commercial for Carefree [[Chewing gum|sugarless gum]]. They began to lip sync to an opera recording. An announcer asked as they were lip synching, "How long does the taste of Carefree sugarless gum last?" The record then began to skip and the announcer answers, "Until these guys sing for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDE1331F937A25755C0A967958260|title=Milli Vanilli Appears Again|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=14 June 1991|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then moved to [[Los Angeles]], where they released an eponymous album under the name ''[[Rob &amp; Fab]]''. Despite positive reviews from critics, the album failed due to financial constraints, poor promotion, and the scandal surrounding Milli Vanilli's lip-synching allegations. The album itself only sold around 2,000 copies.

Pilatus later served three months jail for assault, vandalism, and attempted robbery. He spent six months on drug rehabilitation before returning to Germany. He died of an alcohol and prescription drug overdose at a hotel in [[Frankfurt]] on 2 April 1998.

===Solo comeback===
Morvan spent several years as a [[session musician]] and [[public speaker]]. In 1998, he was hired as a [[radio programming|radio]] [[Disc jockey#Radio DJs|DJ]] at famed L.A. radio station [[KIIS-FM]]. During this time, he also performed at the station's sold-out 1999 [[Wango Tango]] festival concert before 50,000 people at [[Dodger Stadium]].

In 1997, Morvan was interviewed for the premiere episode of [[VH1|VH-1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''. He was also featured in a 2000 [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] documentary on Milli Vanilli. Morvan then spent 2001 on tour, before performing in 2002 as the inaugural performer at the brand-new Velvet Lounge at the [[Hard Rock CafÃ©]] Hotel in [[Orlando, Florida]].

In 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, ''[[Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album)|Love Revolution]]'', producing, recording, writing and singing all the tracks. On 14 April 2011, Morvan released a new single, "Anytime", to digital outlets.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On 25 May 2012, Morvan released a single, "See the Light" with a new band, Fabulous Addiction.

In March 2014, it was mentioned that Morvan was working on his next single in Los Angeles with Grammy-winning viral producer [[Clarence Jey]] and Grammy-winning singer Delious Kennedy from U.S. R&amp;B group [[All-4-One]].

Morvan also DJs for private [[Heineken International|Heineken]] functions at the [[Heineken Experience]] center in Amsterdam. As a solo musician, Morvan has worked with several DJ/producers including [[Don Diablo]], Guy J, Dance Spirit, Desert Minds, DJ Prinz, Patrick BP Bruyndonx, MuziJunki, Sean McCaff, Limoncello, Guan Elmzoom, and has collaborated on well-received dance releases with several. Some of his other pursuits include writing, painting and fashion design.

=== Film and ''Best of the Best'' album ===
On 14 February 2007, it was announced that [[Universal Pictures]] was developing a film based on the true story of Milli Vanilli's rise and fall in the music industry. [[Jeff Nathanson]], screenwriter from ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', was to write and direct the film. Morvan was supposed to serve as a consultant, providing his and Pilatus' point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117959531.html?categoryid=16&amp;cs=18query=Milli+Vanilli+film Variety.com : Universal sets up Milli Vanilli film]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Michael Fleming, 14 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/02/20/girl-you-know-its-true-milli-vanill-biopic-will-reveal-the-truth/ RollingStone.com : Girl, You Know It's True: Milli Vanilli Biopic will reveal the truth (!)], by Nicole Frehsee, 20 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was never completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6290">'''Margaretha "Greta" Keller''' (February 8, 1903 &amp;ndash; November 11, 1977) was a cabaret singer and actress.

==Biography==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}

===Early years===
Born '''Margaretha Keller''' in [[Vienna, Austria]], she studied dance from the age of eight, followed by acting. Her dÃ©but was in ''Pavillon,'' in Vienna. She also appeared on stage with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''Broadway,'' in which she sang and danced.

A recording contract with Ultraphon in 1929 took her from Vienna to [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]], where she enjoyed great success with [[Peter Igelhoff]] and Peter Kreuder. For over 45 years her voice was familiar worldwide, in radio shows, films, revues, concerts and musicals, but above all in recordings. First called ''The Great Lady Of Chanson'' in her native Vienna, the nickname followed her to [[London]] and [[United States|America]].

===Personal life===
Greta Keller's first marriage to the singer Joe Sargent (1928) did not last. He turned out to be an alcoholic.
Her second marriage started and ended in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] where she met and married [[David Bacon (actor)|Gaspar Griswold Bacon, Jr.]] son of [[Gaspar G. Bacon]] from a prominent "[[Boston Brahmin]]" family. The elder Bacon was a member of the board of [[Harvard University]], and  had been a close associate of [[J.P. Morgan]], and later served as Secretary of State under [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and ambassador to France under [[William Howard Taft]].

Her husband, known in film and theater as [[David Bacon (actor)|David Bacon]], was murdered in 1943, two weeks after finishing a major role in the [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] serial ''[[The Masked Marvel]]''. Speculation involved affairs with [[Howard Hughes]] and another actor, but the murder investigations ceased without a result and the files later disappeared. Due to that shock and a counter-indicated dose of morphein administered by Bacon's brother, a physician, Greta's child with Bacon was stillborn. It took some time for her to recover from these events, but she restarted her career in [[Switzerland]], then on to Vienna, [[Berlin]] and back to [[New York City]].

Greta Keller's last long-time relationship: The last years of her life, from 1973 until her death in November 1977 Greta lived, worked, and traveled with her last partner, Wolfgang Nebmaier, who now lives in Southern Oregon, tends to his wife and their goats and other animals and writes stage and screen plays. (See also Chanteusemovie.com).

===Career===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Her [[lieder]] voice carried the charm of the [[Paris]]ian women but never lost the heart of the girl from [[Vienna]].  Greta's singing in what some call "a style reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich" comes from the fact she was the model for how Marlene Dietrich developed her own voice. Greta Keller made recordings throughout the world and from the 1920s into the 1970s. She spent many years in the [[United States]], notably in hotel club rooms at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf]] and (later) the [[Stanhope Hotel|Stanhope]] in New York, where her show always included  "''[[My Way (song)|My Way]]''", with lyrics composed by [[Paul Anka]], and a number of [[NoÃ«l Coward]] numbers. A "singer's singer," Keller often drew other performers to the room, including the [[Nordstrom Sisters]], [[Beverly Sills]] and [[Hildegarde]].

Other regulars would book the same tables most nights that she was performing, including photographer [[Edgar de Evia]]. Favorites of the Stanhope crowd were the songs of [[Cole Porter]] and NoÃ«l Coward, for their sexual innuendo and double entendres. These included "[[Miss Otis Regrets]]" and "I'm the Other Woman in His Life" by her close friend Elisse Boyd.  She regularly returned to Vienna. The poet and singer [[Rod McKuen]] was introduced by her to an audience in Vienna. McKuen, in turn, hosted a concert presenting her at [[Lincoln Center]] in the 1970s, and wrote the English lyric "[[If You Go Away]]" to [[Jacques Brel]]'s "Ne Me Quitte Pas," which she always sang.

Her repertoire included songs from the 1930s through the [[World War II|war years]] as well as popular songs of the day. A few years before her death, her voice was heard in the [[Academy Award]]-winning movie, ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972), for which she sang the song, ''"Heirat" (Married)''.

'''Incredible Edibles''' was a [[toy]] sold by [[Mattel]] in the 1960s.  It was a series of circular metal [[Mold (cooking implement)|molds]] into which Gobble-Degoop, a candy-like gel, was squeezed. The form was then placed in a small oven and baked into a rubbery soft candy in the shape of worms, insects, and flowers among others, coming in six flavors: licorice, mint, butterscotch, cherry, root beer and cinnamon.

A later set (Kooky Kakes) was made to bake small cakes and decorate them with arms, legs, and faces. Gobble-Degoop and cake mixes could be purchased on blister cards as well as a few additional mold sets.
The "Incredible Edibles" formula was created by chemist Don Lusk.

The song was produced by [[Quincy Jones]], who also produced Gore's prior hit "[[It's My Party (Lesley Gore song)|It's My Party]]".&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Judy's Turn to Cry|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/judys-turn-to-cry-t2601612|author=Viglione, J.|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was released on Gore's first album ''[[I'll Cry If I Want To]]'' and also as a single which reached #5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and #10 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard R&amp;B singles chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesley Gore Charts and Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lesley-gore-p4387/charts-awards/billboard-singles|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The classic rock and roll reader: rock music from its beginnings to the mid-1970s|author1=Studwell, W.E.  |author2=Lonergan, D.|page=252|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-0151-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The single earned a [[gold record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guinness encyclopedia of popular music, Volume 3|author=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Larkin, C.]]|page=1705|year=1995|edition=2|publisher=University of California|isbn=978-1-56159-176-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When "It's My Party" entered the Billboard Hot 100 on May 11, 1963, Gore's label, [[Mercury Records]] rushed to record a sequel.&lt;ref name=goldmine&gt;{{cite book|title=Goldmine roots of rock digest|page=183|author=''[[Goldmine Magazine]]''|publisher=Krause Publications|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87341-775-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sequel, "Judy's Turn to Cry," was recorded on May 14, 1963.&lt;ref name=goldmine/&gt;  In "It's My Party," the singer was in tears because her boyfriend Johnny left with her best friend Judy.

The song's instrumentation includes drums and horns.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  [[Allmusic]] critic Joe Viglione describes "Judy's Turn to Cry" as having "a monstrous hook as valuable as 'It's My Party' with violence that may have been inspired by [[The Crystals]] pushing the envelope with their withdrawn classic '[[He Hit Me (It Felt Like a Kiss)]]'".&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  Viglione also notes that because both "It's My Party" and "Judy's Turn to Cry" are short, both at just under 2:20, and both songs are different from each other, and each starts off with its own identifiable hook, and the choruses are different but the verses tell one continuous story, the two songs could be played on the radio back to back, allowing Gore to sing the entire "soap opera."&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  This song is in the key of D Major, while "It's my Party" is in the key of A Major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Musicological identities: essays in honor of Susan McClary|author=McClary, S., Knapp, R., Baur, S. &amp; Warwick, J.C.|page=71|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-6302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connie Landers sang the two songs back to back on the 2008 album ''Girls Girls Girls: 1960's Rock N Roll''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Girls Girls: 1960's Rock N Roll|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/girls-girls-girls-1960s-rock-n-roll-r1396619|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Maury Dean notes that Gore's "crisp [[soprano]] uses very sophisticated [[jazz]] progressions."&lt;ref name=singles/&gt;  Music journalist [[Lillian Roxon]] commented that "you could savor every bitchy second of Lesley's triumph with her sequel 'Judy's Turn to Cry.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rock Encyclopedia|author=[[Lillian Roxon|Roxon, L.]]|page=207|year=1974|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mother of Rock: The Lillion Roxon Story|author=Milliken, R.|page=274|year=2010|edition=2|publisher=Black, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4587-8017-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to initial release as a single and on ''I'll Cry If I Want To'', "Judy's Turn to Cry" has been released on numerous Lesley Gore compilation albums.

'''Ketchapp SARL''' is a French [[video game publisher]] based in [[Paris]], specialising in the [[mobile game]]s market. Founded in March 2014 by brothers Antoine and Michel Morcos, the company first came into the public eye in 2014, through its port of the [[Open-source video game|open-source game]] ''[[2048 (video game)|2048]]''. Many of Ketchapp's games are unlicensed variations of popular [[casual game]]s by other developers. Ketchapp was acquired by [[Ubisoft]] in September 2016.

== History ==
Ketchapp was founded by brothers Antoine and Michel Morcos on 7 March 2014 in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.sg/ketchapp-is-taking-over-the-app-store-2016-2/ |title=Two brothers from France have figured out how to take over the App Store â and now they're making a fortune |last=Stenovec |first=Tim |date=26 February 2016 |website=[[Business Insider Singapore]] |publisher=[[Rev Asia]] |accessdate=18 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420200743/http://www.businessinsider.sg/ketchapp-is-taking-over-the-app-store-2016-2/ |archivedate=20 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the company [[Video game clone|cloned]] Gabriele Cirulli's [[Open-source video game|open-source]] [[puzzle game]] ''[[2048 (video game)|2048]]'' and published it as an [[iOS]] app, with advertising and [[in-app purchase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/04/the-messy-story-behind-a-game-clone/ |title=The Messy Story Behind A Game Clone |last=Klepek |first=Patrick |date=30 April 2015 |website=[[Kotaku Australia]] |publisher=[[Allure Media]] |accessdate=18 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003171019/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/04/the-messy-story-behind-a-game-clone/ |archivedate=3 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually reached the top of the iOS [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/04/daily-app-2048-by-ketchapp-is-a-perfect-port-of-the-popular-web/ |title=Daily App: 2048 by ketchapp is a perfect port of the popular web-based numbers game |last=Hodgkins |first=Kelly |date=4 April 2014 |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL Tech]] |accessdate=18 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531195657/http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/04/daily-app-2048-by-ketchapp-is-a-perfect-port-of-the-popular-web/ |archivedate=31 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketchapp became successful by adapting ideas from other popular apps, with many of its releases being variations on existing games, such as reworking the popular 2013 game ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' as ''Run Bird Run''.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/25/how-one-studio-is-finding-repeated-success-with-flappy-bird-style-games/ |title=How one studio is finding repeated success with Flappy Bird-style games |last=Grubb |first=Jeff |date=25 March 2015 |website=[[GamesBeat]] |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |accessdate=18 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313075912/http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/25/how-one-studio-is-finding-repeated-success-with-flappy-bird-style-games/ |archivedate=13 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Layli Goobalay''' (or '''Layli Goobaly''') is a board game played in parts of [[Somalia]]. It is a variant of the classical [[count and capture]] game ''mancala'' (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''naqala'', meaning literally "to move"), which is one of the oldest two-player strategy board games played throughout the world. ''Layli Goobalay'' means "to exercise with circles" in the [[Somali language]].&lt;ref name="Rsolg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Layli Goobalay|url=http://www.redsea-online.com/modules.php?name=games&amp;func=display&amp;gameid=1|publisher=Red Sea Online|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Layli Goobalay is played on a 2x6 mancala board (i.e., 2 rows of 6 pits each), with 48 seeds. At game setup, 4 seeds are placed in each pit. Similar equipment and game setup are used for in other mancalas.

At his or her turn, the player takes all the seeds from a pit and [[Mancala#General gameplay|sows]] them counterclockwise. If the last seed of a sowing falls in a non-empty pit that is not a ''Uur'' (see below), [[Mancala#General gameplay|relay-sowing]] applies. Thus, the player's turn ends when the last seed in a sowing is dropped in an empty pit or in a ''Uur'' pit. Depending on the pit where this last seed was dropped, the following situations may occur:

* if the pit is a ''Uur'', nothing happens;
* if the pit is in the opponent's row, nothing happens;
* if the pit is the player's row, and the adjacent pit in the opponent's row is empty, nothing happens;
* if the pit is the player's row, and the adjacent pit in the opponent's row is non empty, the seeds in the opponent's pit are captured. This in turn may lead to two consequences:
** if the opponent's pit contains 3 seeds, one of those seeds is captured and placed in the same pit as the capturing seed. The two pits involved in the capture thus will have 2 seeds each. Those are termed ''Uur'' (meaning "pregnant") and they now belong to the player who captured;
** if the opponent's pit contains any other number of seeds, all those seeds as well as the capturing seed are removed from the game.

A player can never begin a sowing from ''Uur'' pits, and relay-sowing does not apply to ''Uur'' pits. Consequently, the content of ''Uur'' pits tends to grow over time.

The game ends when one of the player can no longer move. Both players then capture the seeds from their own ''Uur''s (remember that a player can own a ''Uur'' in the opponent's row) and from the other pits in their own rows. The player who captured most seeds wins the game.

'''Le PÃ©tomane''' ({{IPAc-en|l|É|Ë|p|É|t|É|m|eÉª|n}}, {{IPA-fr|lÉpetÉËman}}) was the [[stage name]] of the [[France|French]] [[flatulist]] (professional farter) and entertainer '''Joseph Pujol''' (June 1, 1857 â 1945). He was famous for his remarkable control of the abdominal [[muscle]]s, which enabled him to seemingly [[flatulence|fart]] at will. His stage name combines the French verb ''pÃ©ter'', "to fart" with the -''mane'', "-[[mania]]c" suffix, which translates to "fartomaniac".  The profession is also referred to as "[[flatulist]]", "farteur", or "fartiste".&lt;ref name=retro&gt;[http://www.ljhelms.com/pet/_pujol/thestory/retro.htm  Le PÃ©tomane: The Strange Life of a "Fartiste"] Accessed 2012-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that Joseph Pujol actually passed intestinal gas as part of his stage performance. Rather, Pujol was able to "inhale" or move air into his rectum and then control the release of that air with his anal sphincter muscles.  Evidence of his ability to control those muscles was seen in the early accounts of demonstrations of his abilities to fellow soldiers.

==Biography==
[[File:Le pÃ©tomane du Moulin Rouge (1900).webm|thumb|''Le PÃ©tomane du Moulin Rouge'', 1900 ([[silent film]] clip)]]
Joseph Pujol was born in [[Marseilles]], one of five children of stonemason/sculptor FranÃ§ois Pujol and his wife Rose, in a Catalan origin family. Soon after Pujol left school, he had a strange experience while swimming in the sea. He put his head under the water and held his breath, whereupon he felt an icy cold penetrating his rear. He ran ashore in fright and was amazed to sense water pouring from his anus. A doctor assured him that there was nothing to worry about.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

While serving in the army, he told his fellow soldiers about his special ability, and repeated it for their amusement, sucking up water from a pan into his rectum and then projecting it up to several yards. He found that he could suck in air as well. A [[baker]], Pujol would sometimes entertain his customers by imitating musical instruments, and claim to be playing them behind the counter. Pujol decided to try the stage, and debuted in Marseilles in 1887. When his act was well received, he moved to [[Paris]], where he appeared at the [[Moulin Rouge]] in 1892.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

Some of the highlights of his stage act involved sound effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms, as well as playing "[['O Sole Mio]]" and "[[La Marseillaise]]" on an [[ocarina]] through a rubber tube in his anus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/363/did-a-french-vaudeville-star-once-specialize-in-trained-flatulence Did a French vaudeville star once specialize in trained flatulence?] Accessed 2008-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; He could also blow out a candle from several yards away.&lt;ref name=retro /&gt; His audience included [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]]; [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of the [[Belgium|Belgians]]; and [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s364725.htm Begone With the Wind] Accessed 2008-09-01&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1894, the managers of the Moulin Rouge sued Pujol for an impromptu exhibition he gave to aid a friend struggling with economic difficulties. Pujol was fined 3,000 francs, and the Moulin Rouge lost their star attraction as the disagreement led him to set up his own travelling show called the Theatre Pompadour.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

In the following decade Pujol tried to 'refine' and make his acts 'gentler'; one of his favourite numbers became a rhyme about a farm which he himself composed, and which he punctuated with anal renditions of the animals' sounds.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Pujol, horrified by the inhumanity of the conflict, retired from the stage and returned to his bakery in Marseilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rivierareporter.com/features/833-le-petomane-the-mad-farter-joseph-pujol|title=Le PÃ©tomane, The Mad Farter: Joseph Pujol - Riviera Reporter|website=www.rivierareporter.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he opened a biscuit factory in [[Toulon]]. He died in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;One source says his death occurred "shortly after the Allied landing", presumably a reference to [[D-Day]], 6 June, but that was in 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; aged 88, and was buried in the cemetery of [[La Valette-du-Var]], where his grave can still be seen today.

==Legacy==
[[File:Joseph Pujol (Le Petomane) at concert.jpeg|right|thumb|Le PÃ©tomane ''ca.'' 1890]]
Le PÃ©tomane left an enduring legacy and has inspired a number of artistic works. These include several musicals based on his life, such as ''The Fartiste'' (awarded Best Musical at the 2006 [[New York International Fringe Festival]]) and Seth Rozin's ''A Passing Wind'' which was premiered at the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts|Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts]] in 2011. In addition, Le PÃ©tomane was added to David Lee's 2007 reworked revival of the 1953 Broadway play ''[[Can-Can]]'', which had originally been written by Abe Burroughs and [[Cole Porter]]. The updated play, staged at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], featured musical theatre actor Robert Yacko as the fartiste, with sound effects provided by the band's trombone and piccolo players. More recently, the re-released works of English toilet humour specialist [[Ivor Biggun]] include "Southern Breeze", a song about a "Famous French Farteur" who describes in rhyme a stroll through a farmyard, accompanied by appropriate farting noises.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

Los Angeles-based Sherbourne Press published Jean Nohain and F. Caradec's ''Le PÃ©tomane'' as a small hardcover English language edition in 1967. Due to its âsensitiveâ nature, the usual national publicity venues shied away, some claiming that an author was needed for interviews (both elderly writers lived in France). However, âbehind the curtainâ acceptance created a buzz within the national radio/TV promotional circuit and word-of-mouth discussion kept the book in stores for several years. Dorset Press, a division of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], reissued the book in 1993.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

The character has been portrayed several times in film. In 1979 Ian MacNaughton made a short humorous film, written by [[Galton and Simpson]] called ''[[Le PÃ©tomane (film)|Le PÃ©tomane]]'', based on Pujol's story and starring veteran comic actor [[Leonard Rossiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Le-Petomane_1979/|title=Le Petomane (1979)|work=British movies|publisher=Britmovie.co.uk|accessdate=2009-01-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203014504/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Le-Petomane_1979|archivedate=2010-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 Italian movie ''[[Petomaniac|Il Petomane]]'', directed by [[Pasquale Festa Campanile]] and starring [[Ugo Tognazzi]], gives a poetic rendition of the character, contrasting his deep longing for normality with the condition of 'freak' to which his act relegated him. The 1998 documentary ''Le PÃ©tomane'' by [[Igor Vamos]] examines Joseph Pujol's place in history through archival films (none of which actually include him), historical documents, photographs, recreations and fake or tongue-in-cheek interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_13/13_lepetomaine.asp?IshNum=13&amp;Headline=Le%20Petomane|title=Le Petomane: Fin de SiÃ¨cle Fartiste (Igor Vamos, 2000)|last=White|first=Mike|publisher=Cahiers du Cinemart|accessdate=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052020/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_13/13_lepetomaine.asp?IshNum=13&amp;Headline=Le%20Petomane|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly appears as one of the performers in ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', played by Keith Robinson.

Le Petomane is also referenced in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', a 1974 satirical Western comedy film directed by [[Mel Brooks]].  Brooks appears in multiple supporting roles, including the dim-witted Governor William J. Le Petomane, whose name suggests he is full of hot air.{{citation needed|date = October 2014}}

Le Petomane is the name of the university in ''[[Up the Creek (1984 film)|Up the Creek]]'', a 1984 college movie starring [[Tim Matheson]] involving a whitewater rafting race.

Le Petomane is also a character in the novel ''[[The Great Abraham Lincoln Pocket Watch Conspiracy]]'' by Jacopo della Quercia.
and a nearly identical recording horn.

Le Petomane also appears as a character in 2001 Australian-American jukebox musical romantic comedy film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''

'Le Petoman' (without the e, English audiences will pronounce -mane differently to -man) was adapted from the book by 'Le Petomane 1857-1945' by J Nohain &amp; F Caradec for the theatre in 2001 by Tony Stowers. It was turned down by Hull Truck, Salisbury Playhouse and the National Theatre in the UK on the grounds that they felt their audiences would be 'too sophisticated' for the subject matter. Instead it has been read in English in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 2005, in Paris in 2010 and again in Nantes in 2018 and to this day remains unperformed but often read. In 2010 it was translated to French by T Stowers and Kester Lovelace and appears in 'French Collection' by Tony Stowers and 'Plays: Volume Three' by Tony Stowers.

The following is a list of home video releases from the Australian television series ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' (internationally re-titled ''Prisoner: Cell Block H'' in the United States and the United Kingdom, and ''Caged Women'' in Canada). The entire series, consisting of 8 seasons and 692 episodes is available in both Australia and the UK. Initially released in "Best Of" compilation format on DVD in Australia with three sets, in the United States with the first two sets, and in the United Kingdom with only the first set.

In Australia, [[Shock Records]] commenced releasing what was to be the beginning of the entire series in 2006 in volume format on DVD; the complete series over 40 volumes. Prior to the release of Volume 13, "The Complete Collection" was made available with the remaining individual volumes released subsequently. A second version of "The Complete Collection" was released in 2011. All of the original sets are now out-of-print. As of late 2016, ViaVision are releasing ''Prisoner'' on DVD in their original complete season formats.

In the United Kingdom, the series began releasing on VHS with the first 12 episodes over six videos and a video containing episodes 326 &amp; 327. ''Prisoner Cell Block H'' DVDs have been released in stages by FremantleMedia Home Entertainment between 2008 - 2013. The content on the discs is identical to the Australian release, but with different cover/sleeve artwork. The UK releases started out as boxed sets of eight discs (32 episodes) with two discs in four cases within each set, but from Volume 4 onwards all the discs are packed into a plastic case with flip disc holders. The entire series has been released over a total of 20 volumes, the first 16 volumes featuring eight discs each but Volume 17 onwards contains ten discs.

The UK DVD releases are a combination of two volumes as released in Australia. For example, the UK Volume 1 consists of the Australian Volumes 1 and 2.

As with the Australian versions of the DVDs, the episodes are on the whole uncut, but due to the aged source of the master tapes, sometimes minor edits are made to the episodes to cover breaks in the picture or sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canberrang.webng.com/prisoner/dvd/cuts.htm |title=List of cuts made to the DVDs |work=canberrang.webng.com |accessdate=10 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813032023/http://canberrang.webng.com/prisoner/dvd/cuts.htm |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Edna Pearson Story", released on UK DVD in February 2010, contains most of the previously cut scenes although, episode 470 is still missing a scene.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, ''Prisoner: Cell Block H'' was released via Fremantle Home Entertainment, beginning late 2008. The complete series was released through 20 volumes containing 32 episodes per set for the first sixteen volumes; Volume 17 contains 40 episodes, Volume 18 and Volume 19 both contain 48 episodes and the final volume contains 44 episodes. The reason for the increased number of episodes on later sets was due to the fact that Fremantle wanted to keep exactly double the amount of episodes as the original Australian sets. The first 33 Australian releases contain 16 episodes per set; sets 34 to 39 containing 24 episodes per set and Volume 40 containing 20 episodes. Therefore, Fremantle in the UK doubled-up on episodes so that they could finish releasing by Volume 20.

In Australia, distribution company [[Shock Records]] began releasing the UK volumes in 2011, as their original volumes are now out of print. The final volume was released in early 2014.

This is a list of [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship|starships]] from the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. The list is organized first by ''[[ship class]]'', then ''registration number'', ''name'', and finally where that vessel was referenced. These vessels appear or are mentioned in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|original Star Trek series]]'' (''TOS''), ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG''), ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (''DS9''), ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' (''VOY''), ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (''ENT''), ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' (''DSC''), the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]], [[Star Trek games|''Star Trek'' games]], and ''Star Trek'' [[List of Star Trek novels|literature]]. This list tries to avoid using information found in ''Star Trek'' [[fan fiction]]. Many of the sources for this list are considered [[Star Trek canon|non-canon]] and the list relies heavily on the non-canon ''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|author=Okuda, Michael|authorlink=Michael Okuda|author2=Okuda, Denise|last-author-amp=yes|title=[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]|location=New York|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1994â1999|isbn=978-0-671-03475-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|USS ''Valiant''

|For his influential "The Case of Jonathan Doe Starship" article, published in the April 1973 issue 27 of the T-Negative fanzine, future Star Trek model maker Greg Jein accepted the producer's intent and endowed Valiant with the appropriately lower conjectural registry number NCC-1623. But unlike many of his other conjectural Constitution-class registry numbers, the 2006 remastered version of the series afforded no opportunity to bring this ship to canon.

'''''Masques''''', L. 105, is a piece for solo piano by [[Claude Debussy]]. Composed in July 1904, it was premiered on 18 February 1905 by [[Ricardo ViÃ±es]] at the [[Salle Pleyel]] in Paris. Its sombre character reflects Debussyâs difficult separation from Lilly Texier, his first wife. The title refers to the [[commedia dellâarte]], although Debussy confided to [[Marguerite Long]] that the piece was "not Italian comedy, but an expression of the tragedy of existence" - (''"ce n'est pas la comÃ©die italienne, mais l'expression tragique de lâexistence."'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerstle|first1=C.

The '''Midwest Gaming Classic''' ('''MGC''') is an annual convention for all forms of electronic entertainment, including [[video games]], arcade games and pinball, with a focus on [[retrogaming]].

The event has been held in several locations in Wisconsin since launching in 2001.

== History ==
The Midwest Gaming Classic was first held on June 30, 2001 as '''Jagfest 2K1''' and was dedicated to ongoing fan base and [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] scene of the [[Atari Jaguar]]. At that time, the 2K1 show organizers Dan Loosen and Gary Heil decided to open the show to all classic platforms in an effort to expand attendance. They were soon contacted by Martin Goldberg who offered to set up a museum area for the show, and started a tradition of having consoles and computers on display playable by show attendees, as well as gaming competitions held on multiple platforms and prizes at the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Midwest Gaming Classic - Past Shows Main Page|url=http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/content.php?id=past|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080520084419/http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/content.php?id=past|date=March 29, 2008|archivedate = 2008-05-20|accessdate = 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; That first year had 15 tables and 20 games available to play. By 2015, it had grown to over one thousand games.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Milwaukee hosts a gathering of gamers at the Midwest Gaming Classic|url = http://fox6now.com/2015/04/11/milwaukee-hosts-a-gathering-of-gamers-at-the-midwest-gaming-classic/|website = FOX6Now.com|accessdate = 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has moved several times over the years, but has always been in the Milwaukee area.

== Events ==
The Midwest Gaming Classic has a focus on retrogaming, but displays modern game systems as well. The devices on display range from the newest gaming devices to some of the oldest, such as the original [[Pong]]. The event also attracts video game champions from the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gamers in their glory|url = http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/29564904.html|accessdate = 2015-07-28|first = Dani|last = McClain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is known for its pinball games, gaming museum and modern game tournaments. It also has a display of gaming systems that never had success due to a superior competitor or change in technology. Nearly all game systems on display can be played by attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Invasion of the classics|url = http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/29556679.html|accessdate = 2015-07-28|first = Stanley A.|last = Miller II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olive Borden''' (July 14, 1906 â October 1, 1947) was an American film and stage actress who began her career during the [[silent film]] era.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She was nicknamed "[[The Joy Girl]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Liebman|200|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; after playing the lead in the 1927 [[The Joy Girl|film of that same title]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lowe |first1=Denise |title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Women in Early American Films: 1895-1930 |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317718963 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68e2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1899&amp;dq=%22Olive+Borden%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihpbL5k-TdAhVIeawKHfLvDOYQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Olive%20Borden%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borden was known for her jet-black hair and overall beauty.

At the peak of her career in the mid-1920s, Borden was earning $1,500 a week. In 1927, she walked out on her contract with [[20th Century Fox#Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] after refusing to take a pay cut. By 1929, her career began to wane due to her reputation for being temperamental and her difficulty transitioning to sound films. She made her last film, ''[[Chloe, Love Is Calling You]]'', in 1934 and moved on to stage work for a time. By the late 1930s, she had declared bankruptcy and stopped acting. During [[World War II]], she joined the [[Women's Army Corps|WAC]]s. She was later honorably discharged after sustaining a foot injury and attempted to make a comeback in films. However, Borden's attempts to get back into acting were hindered by her alcoholism and health problems.

In 1945, she began working at the [[Casa de Rosas|Sunshine Mission]], a home for destitute women located in the [[skidrow]] section of Los Angeles. She died there in October 1947 of a stomach ailment and [[pneumonia]] at the age of 41.

==Early life==
Olive Borden was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on July 14, 1906.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Her birth name was often reported erroneously as Sybil Tinkle until the 1990s when it was discovered that another woman with the same name had been confused with Borden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lowe|2005|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borden's father died when she was a baby and she was raised by her mother, Sybil&lt;ref name =nsj/&gt; ("Sibbie"), in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] where she also attended [[Catholic]] boarding schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Shipman Springer|1974|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a distant relative of [[Lizzie Borden]].&lt;ref name="Brettell 2005 35"&gt;{{harv|Brettell|2005|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, she persuaded her mother to take her to Hollywood to pursue a career in show business. To support themselves they opened a candy store and Olive worked as a telephone operator.

==Career==
Borden began her career as one of the [[Mack Sennett#Sennett Bathing Beauties|Sennett Bathing Beauties]] in 1922 and was soon appearing as a vamp in [[Hal Roach]] comedy shorts. Producer [[Paul Bern]] chose her for an uncredited role in his film ''[[The Dressmaker from Paris]]'' (1925). She was signed by [[20th Century Fox#Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] after being named a [[WAMPAS Baby Stars|WAMPAS Baby Star]] in 1925 (along with cousin [[Natalie Joyce]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WAMPAS Choice Proves Open Sesame |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23683307/wampas_1927_selection/ |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=January 23, 1927 |location=California, Los Angeles |page=42|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 30, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borden quickly became one of their most popular and highest paid stars earning a salary of $1,500 a week. She had starring roles in eleven films at Fox including ''[[3 Bad Men]]'' and ''[[Fig Leaves]]'', both costarring her then-boyfriend [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]]. During this time she worked with some directors who would go on to achieve major fame, including [[John Ford]], [[Howard Hawks]], and [[Leo McCarey]].

When Fox cut her salary in 1927, she walked out on her contract. By this point she was a major star but she found it difficult to make the transition from silent films to [[Sound film|"talkies"]]. She worked to get rid of her [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] but could not overcome her reputation as being difficult. She was still in demand as an actress, and continued to work for [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] and [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. Borden cut her trademark hair into a short bob and turned herself into a modern [[flapper]]. She made several movies in the early 1930s but her career stalled. Her last screen credit came in 1934 in the film ''Chloe, Love Is Calling You''. She moved to New York where she had a brief stage career and made a living on the [[vaudeville]] circuit.

==Later years==
During her acting career, Borden was one of the highest paid stars. She spent her money freely and by the late 1930s, she was broke. Borden then found work as a postal clerk and mail carrier and also worked as a nurse's aide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ankerich|2010|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Borden joined the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WAC]] where she received an army citation for bravery in turning over an enemy ammunition truck. Her Army career ended after she was hospitalized in [[Walter Reed Medical Center]] with a severe foot injury. After her [[honorable discharge]] she attempted an unsuccessful comeback in films.&lt;ref name="Brettell 2005 35"/&gt;

Borden struggled with alcoholism and numerous health problems. She spent her final years in the [[skid row]] section of [[Los Angeles]] scrubbing floors at the Sunshine Mission, a home for destitute women.&lt;ref name="Brettell 2005 35"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Borden had several relationships with men in and out of the motion picture industry. For the majority of her life, she lived with her mother, Sibbie. From 1926 to 1930, Borden was romantically involved with actor [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] and the press reported they were engaged. She also dated director [[Marshall Neilan]], producer [[Paul Bern]], and had a long affair with Arthur Benline, Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Construction Battalion.

Borden was married twice. Her first marriage was to stockbroker Theodore Spector, whom she married on March 28, 1931, in Harrison, New York.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news |title=Olive Borden Has Marriage Annulled |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24177141/olive_borden/ |work=Star Tribune |agency=Associated Press |date=November 22, 1932 |location=Minnesota, Minneapolis |page=13|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 30, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was rocky{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and the couple separated in early 1932. Borden learned after their separation that Spector was not divorced from his first wife, Pearl, whom he married in 1919. Spector was arrested for [[bigamy]] in 1932 after his first wife came forward and claimed they were still married. In November 1932, Borden petitioned the court for an annulment, which was granted on November 22, 1932.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; She married her second husband, railroad technician John Moeller, in November 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ankerich|2010|pp=72â73}}&lt;/ref&gt; That marriage ended in divorce seven years later.

'''Riley Schillaci''' (born December 22, 1982) is an American [[performance artist]], specializing in [[sword swallowing]] as one of few professional female sword swallowers in the world.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite news|page=D1 |newspaper= [[The Morning Call]] |date=February 24, 2012|section=Life |title=Cutting-Edge Entertainment. Allentown woman is one of few professional female sword swallowers in the world |author=Steve Siegel|accessdate=August 28, 2012|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2012-02-24/entertainment/mc-sword-swallower-allentown-20120224_1_sword-swallowers-association-international-real-sword-allentown-woman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and inception of career==
Riley Schillaci was born on December 22, 1982, in [[Rochester, New York]]. In her childhood, she observed a relative who swallowed forks and knives and stuck licorice up his nose, only to have it reemerge through his mouth. At around 14, Schillaci decided to try swallowing objects because she believed the talent was genetic.  She moved on to swallowing drum sticks and glow sticks,&lt;ref name="Uthe"&gt;{{cite news|page=23|newspaper=Webster Post|date=January 13, 2008|section=Sundayam|title=Don't try this at home, boys and girls.

Her parents held it while she "eased up into it ... 'until it just barely hit the bottom of my stomach'". She cut off the protruding part, making the sword {{convert|19|in|cm}}. Although her parents wanted her to be a singer, they supported her as a sword swallower by attending some of her performances.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

==Career==

===Performance===
Schillaci was a featured season 6 contestant on ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' but was rejected by the judges because she did not smile enough.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; One of fewer than 20 female sword swallowers in the world,&lt;ref name="Zagofsky"&gt;{{cite news|page= |newspaper= [[Erie Times-News]] |date= June 12, 2010|section= |title= Hard economic times led couple to ... gulp ... a strange profession|author= Al Zagofsky|accessdate=August 28, 2012|url=http://www.tnonline.com/2010/jun/12/sharpening-their-skills}}&lt;/ref&gt; she worked with ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; and is a member of the Sword Swallowers Association International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swordswallow.com/performers.php |title=Actively Performing Professional Sword Swallowers|author=[[Dan Meyer (performer)|Dan Meyer]] |date=2011 |work=Sword Swallowers Association International |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She uses [[rum]] to disinfect her sword before swallowing it.&lt;ref name="Voorhees"&gt;{{cite news|page= |newspaper= [[YNN Rochester]] |date=February 28, 2008|section= |title=Her Hobby's Hard To Swallow|author=Seth Voorhees |accessdate=August 28, 2012|url=http://rochester.ynn.com/content/358731/her-hobby-s-hard-to-swallow/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schillaci said that her throat becomes faintly sore after sword swallowing a few times per week.&lt;ref name="Uthe"/&gt;

Besides sword swallowing, her acts include fire eating, fire breathing, human blockhead, human pincushion, and bed of nails.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; She calls her overall act "Odd Girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page= |newspaper= [[WPVI-TV]] |date=April 1, 2012|section=|title=Allentown woman makes a living swallowing swords |author=Walter Perez|accessdate=August 28, 2012 |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8603309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Having earned a degree in sociology and health science, Schillaci has worked in factories, [[special education]], child care, web development, and in administration.&lt;ref name="Zagofsky"/&gt; Her hobbies include writing and playing music.&lt;ref name="Uthe"/&gt;

{{Culture of Argentina}}
[[File:Patogame.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Pato]] is the national sport in Argentina.]]
The practice of '''sports in Argentina''' is varied due to the population's diverse European origins and the mostly mild climate. [[Association football]] is the most popular discipline and other sports played both professionally and recreatively [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[auto racing]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[cycling]], [[field hockey]], [[fishing]], [[golf]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[mountaineering]], [[padel tennis]], [[polo]], [[Roller hockey (Quad)|roller hockey]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[rugby union]], [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], [[skiing]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]]. Argentine achievements can be found in team sports such as association football, basketball, field hockey and rugby union, and individual sports such as boxing, golf, tennis and rowing. [[Pato]], the national sport, is not very popular.

[[Argentina]] is one of the most important sport powers in the region, ending at the top of the medal count at the [[South American Games]] since 1978, with exceptions in 2002 and 2010. In the all-time medal table of the [[Pan American Games]], Argentina holds first place among South American countries and fourth place in the Americas, behind the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Cuba]]. Despite a relative lack of success at the Olympic level in more traditional sports like athletics, swimming, and [[gymnastics]], Argentina has had successful participations in other sports like association football, basketball, field hockey, roller hockey, padel tennis, polo and rugby union.

==Auto racing==
From [[Rallying]] to [[Formula One]], auto racing is a sport followed by a number of fans in Argentina. Formula One legend [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] was five times [[Formula One]] world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time.{{sfnm|1a1=Nauright|1a2=Parrish|1y=2012|1p=98|2a1=Dougall|2y=2013|2pp=170â171}} Other distinguished racers were [[Oscar Alfredo GÃ¡lvez]], [[Juan GÃ¡lvez]], [[JosÃ© FroilÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez]], and [[Carlos Reutemann]].{{sfnm|1a1=Arbena|1y=1999|1p=147|2a1=Dougall|2y=2013|2pp=170â171, 195}} Years after Fangio's career was over, [[Carlos Reutemann]] was the best known Argentine driver of the 1970s. More recently [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a LÃ³pez]] has emerged as one of the world's top [[touring car racing|touring car]] drivers, winning the [[World Touring Car Championship]] in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Argentine competitions include the [[TC 2000]] and [[Turismo Carretera]] [[road racing]] series, as well as [[Rally Argentina]] of the [[World Rally Championship]]. Argentina has also hosted the [[2009 Dakar Rally|2009]], [[2010 Dakar Rally|2010]], [[2011 Dakar Rally|2011]], [[2012 Dakar Rally|2012]], [[2013 Dakar Rally|2013]] [[2014 Dakar Rally|2014]], [[2015 Dakar Rally|2015]], [[2016 Dakar Rally|2016]], [[2017 Dakar Rally|2017]] and [[2018 Dakar Rally|2018]] editions of the [[Dakar Rally]]. Former events include the defunct Formula One [[Argentine Grand Prix]] and [[World Sportscar Championship]]'s [[1000 km Buenos Aires]].

==Football==
{{Main article|Football in Argentina}}
[[File:Arg vs urug 1927.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Argentina playing against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in [[1927 South American Championship|1927]]. The ''ClÃ¡sico del RÃ­o de la Plata'' is one of the oldest derbies in the world.]]

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Argentina and part of the country's culture. The sport is played by children during breaks at school and by grown-ups on the plenty of both [[futsal|indoor]] and outdoor fields located throughout the country.

The [[Argentina national football team|national team]] has won the [[FIFA World Cup]] twice (in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]), successive [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medals (in [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament|2004]] and [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament|2008]]), fourteen [[Copa AmÃ©rica|Copas AmÃ©rica]], one [[FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]] and six [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|World Youth Championships]]. Argentine clubs have won the [[Copa Libertadores]], the top continental competition, a record 22 times and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] or [[FIFA Club World Cup]] 8 times, a record shared with Brazilian clubs. The [[Argentine Primera DivisiÃ³n]] is the top level domestic competition. The country's most famed football idol is [[Diego Maradona]]. Actually the most famous football player is [[Lionel Messi]].

Argentina's fiercest rival is [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and their rivalry is sometimes known as the "[[Argentina and Brazil football rivalry|Battle of the South Americans]]". They have played each other numerous times in the Copa AmÃ©rica and the Confederations Cup, and their clubs have met several times in the Copa Libertadores finals. Argentina is one of the few national teams in association football that have beaten Brazil on a regular basis. Argentine and Brazilian national youth teams have also met at various tournaments. At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], the under-23 teams met in the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament#Semi-finals|semi-finals]], with Argentina winning 3â0 in a hard-fought game. In addition, the aforementioned Maradona has been often compared with Brazilian iconic player [[PelÃ©]].

[[Women's association football|Women's football]] is far behind in terms of popularity and professionalism. However, the [[Argentina women's national football team|women's national team]] has competed in the [[South American Women's Football Championship|South American Championship]] since 1995, finishing as runner-up three times before winning the competition in [[2006 South American Women's Football Championship|2006]] with a 5â0 victory over [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]].

Although the [[Argentina national basketball team|National team]] won the first [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|FIBA World Championship]] in [[1950 FIBA World Championship|1950]], the sport did not gain country-wide popularity until the 2000s, when the national team conquered the Olympic gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament|2004 Summer Olympics]] and had a good performance in the [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002]], [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]] and [[2010 FIBA World Championship|2010 World Championships]] finishing on the second, fourth and fifth position respectively.

[[File:Argentina vs England 2011 RWC (1).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Argentina facing [[England national rugby union team|England]] at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].]]
[[Rugby union]] is a popular and largely amateur sport. However, despite this amateurism, the [[Argentina national rugby union team|national team]] have become one of the most powerful in the sport, finishing third in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] and rising as high as third in the [[World Rugby Rankings]] (then known as the IRB World Rankings) immediately after. Since November 2004, Argentina have picked up at least one win over all the participants in Europe's [[Six Nations Championship]], drawn with the [[British and Irish Lions]] and narrowly lost to the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]], who were forced to survive a last-second assault on their try line. In particular, the ''Pumas'' have enjoyed a dominating record in recent years against [[France national rugby union team|France]], going 7â2 since 2000, with a total points against of 7.

For the first 20 years of the sport's professional era, dating from 1996, most important Argentine players have emigrated to [[Europe]] (mainly to England and France). Probably the best known players are 1970s and 1980s star [[Hugo Porta]]; [[AgustÃ­n Pichot]], Pumas captain during their 2007 World Cup run and now the vice chairman of [[World Rugby]]; his successor as captain, [[Felipe Contepomi]]; current star utility back [[Juan MartÃ­n HernÃ¡ndez]]; 1990s star and later Pumas head coach [[Santiago Phelan]]; [[Marcelo Loffreda]], who coached the team during their 2007 World Cup run before leaving to take up the coaching post at [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English club]] power [[Leicester Tigers]]; and current head coach [[Daniel Hourcade]].

In 2012, Argentina joined New Zealand, Australia and South Africa in the Tri Nations Championship, which then became [[The Rugby Championship]]. In 2014, Argentina took their first victory in this competition against Australia in the first round. Argentina further cemented its links with [[SANZAAR]] when the country was added to that body's [[Super Rugby]] competition, which added teams based in [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Argentina]] and [[Sunwolves|Japan]] in 2016.

'''''Street Legal Racing Redline''''' is a racing game developed by [[Invictus Games (company)|Invictus]] and published by [[Activision Value]].  The game was released for Windows in July 2003.

On September 9, 2014, Invictus announced via their Facebook page that the ''Street Legal'' franchise, as well as every other game Invictus had developed using that game engine was now [[abandonware]], and the engine, along with all the art assets, were for sale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/invictusgames/posts/845125675521524&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{original research section|date=October 2018}}
The game takes place in Valo City (possibly a play on the word "[[velocity]]"), a metropolis known for its vast underworld of [[illegal street racing]]. The plot of the game is to beat every club and accomplish the requirements to enter the Race of Champions, a prestigious racing competition where one can win a bonus car. Players have to race others on the streets during the day for prestige (respect) or money to customize the car. During the night, players can either participate in a drag race against another driver or watch the race. And also the newly added race tracks that allows the player to race their own vehicles against AI's on a race track to win a prize.

A unique feature of the game is its detailed level of customization for the vehicles. The player can buy a completely new car from the dealership, a used one from a local shop where they were already customized or even [[totaled]], or build the car from scratch with a chassis. Unlike a traditional street racing video game if the player crashes their car the consequences are very real and must ''manually'' replace each part that got destroyed in the crash.

==Patches==

Currently, there are three patches for the game: the 2.2.1 MWM (by Miran &amp; Wichur), 2.3.0 Live Edition (by Raxat) and SLRR2015 (by Bigg Boss93, available on VStanced.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://vstanced.com/ Vstanced.com]&lt;/ref&gt;). The latest version (2.3.1) was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and is gradually improved by the Russian game developer ImageCode in collaboration with Raxat.

==Mods==

Thousands of mods were made for this game, including vehicles, parts for said vehicles, tracks (Some mods only work on the 2.2.1 MWM version), sounds, menu interfaces, and textures. Because some of the versions of the game are highly unstable, it is highly likely to crash when too many mods are installed mainly on the 2.2.1 and 2.3.0 versions.

==Reboot==

Thanks to [[fundraising|public funding]], the game was greenlit and eventually re-released on Steam on May 7th, 2016. The Steam release was very unstable when it first launched, but is gradually improving. Its textures and interface make it more contemporary, and the career is altered for more of a challenge.

==Possible sequel==
Dave Singh, the owner of streetlegalmods.com, made a deal with Invictus Games, Ltd. stating that if the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign reached a minimum of $150,000, the development of the sequel to ''SLRR'', ''Street Tuning Evolution'', would officially begin, as long as the game was playable and the community was allowed to add content. $500,000 was demanded to make a complete game.

After having a bad launch with the Kickstarter, and due to the popular demand of a PayPal option, Invictus Games, Ltd. and Dave Singh decided to move the campaign to IndieGogo to solve the many problems, and also to extend the deadline. Backers could then use PayPal to make a pledge. The campaign would have been funded only if it had reached $150,000. The IndieGogo campaign had a significantly better launch than the Kickstarter campaign, which raised around $24,000 a little more than 40 days after its launch in December 18, 2014. The IndieGogo campaign raised nearly $10,000 just one day after its launch. Unfortunately the campaign failed, reaching just over $30,000.

Despite the failure, another person, Bartosz "Wichur" Bieszka, plans to make a sequel to this game under the "Car Tune" title. ImageCode LLC is also working on a similar project also being called [http://image-code.com/2018/10/24/news-on-street-tuning-evolution/ Street Tuning Evolution] which means the game is still very much alive&lt;ref&gt;http://image-code.com/2018/10/24/news-on-street-tuning-evolution/&lt;/ref&gt; which will be a sequel to Street Legal Racing Redline.

'''''The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin''''' is a 2014 [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Wenn V. Deramas]]. It is the sequel to ''[[The Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin]]''. The film is one of the official entries to the [[40th Metro Manila Film Festival]]. [[Vice Ganda]] reprised his role as Colonel Benjamin "Benjie" Santos VIII with [[Richard Yap]], [[Tom Rodriguez]], [[Bimby Yap]] and introducing [[Alex Gonzaga]] with the special participation of [[Eddie Garcia]].

== Plot ==
After defeating the terrorists led by Billy Aladdin, the once humble Private Benjamin ([[Vice Ganda]]) has become the Philippines' unkabogable soldier and a worldwide sensation. One day in the military headquarters, the zombies came to attack the terrorist and Benjamin must face them using vegetable attack (ala [[Plants Vs. Zombies|PVZ]]). Inevitably, he rises from the ranks and in no time becomes the incredible, unbeatable, and unreachable soldier and promoted to Colonel. To prepare him better, Benjamin is assigned under a new general, Wilson Chua ([[Richard Yap]]). However, Private Benjamin committed a big mistake. Benjamin is about to be dismissed from service when Gen. Wilson Chua saves him by giving him a mission â to be the private security of a brat kid Bimbee ([[Bimby Yap]]). As he watches over Bimbee, Benjamin finds himself clashing with Misty (Rhed Bustamante), General Chua's daughter, and the meddlesome housemaid Gundina ([[Alex Gonzaga]]). However, as he gets to know Bimbee more, he learns that Bimbee is a kid deprived of love from family â something that he has ignored in his quest to be on top again. Will he succeed in his new mission?

Terrorists led by Jan Jaranjan ([[Tom Rodriguez]]) threaten the government to detonate the bomb hidden in a mall. How would Benjamin and Wilson deal with it?

In most action scenes in the sequel, they are referencing various video games and mobile app games such as Plants VS Zombies when Benjie and his friends are fighting against the zombies in Paris using gardening weapons,  Just Dance when Benjie and his friends as well as General Wilson Chua and company does performing the moves in order to stop the bomb from detonating, Crisis Zone where Benjie and his friends fought Jan Janranjan and his men using machine guns used in the arcade games and the Street Fighter series when Benjie defeats Jan Jaranjan using a parody version of Ryu's Tatsumaki Sempukyaku in three hits.

''Praybeyt Benjamin'' was ahead of fellow entrants, ''[[My Big Bossing's Adventures]]'' and ''[[Feng Shui 2]]'' ranked second and third respectively in terms of box office record on the opening day of the film festival. Tolentino did not state the official figures of the sales on the opening day of the film festival during the said interview.&lt;ref name="topsmmff"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corales|first1=Nestor|title=âPraybeyt Benjaminâ tops MMFF opening day|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/159255/praybeyt-benjamin-tops-mmff-opening-day|accessdate=1 January 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her stint at ''[[The Buzz (talk show)|The Buzz]]'' where is she is one of the hosts, Kris Aquino said that ''The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin'' recorded P172 million worth of box office receipts as of 3:00 pm [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] December 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Praybeyt Benjamin,' 'Feng Shui' earn P260M in 4 days|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/12/28/14/praybeyt-benjamin-feng-shui-earn-p260m-4-days|accessdate=1 January 2015|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now hold the distinction of starring in 7 of the 20 [[List of highest-grossing films in the Philippines|highest-grossing films in the Philippines of all time]].

=== Critical response ===
Despite being a high-grossing film at the [[40th Metro Manila Film Festival]], reception for ''The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin'' has received mixed to negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balbin|first1=Sherwin Allan|title=The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin Tops MMFF 2014 &amp; Earns P172 Million In 4 Days!|url=http://www.philippineedition.com/2014/12/the-amazing-praybeyt-benjamin-tops-mmff.html|accessdate=1 January 2015|publisher=Philippine Edition|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zig Marasigan of Rappler, described the film in his movie review as "a brainless, hyper-stylized and utterly ridiculous family comedy". Marasigan criticized ''Praybeyt Benjamin'' for "unashamedly made for profit". He also described the film as "cheap, tacky and absolutely nonsensical. But say what you might about the film's level of intellectualism (or lack thereof), it is at least honest about its intentions". Marasigan however acknowledged that the film fulfilled its purpose, to primarily entertain its target audience.&lt;ref name=rappler&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marasigan|first1=Zig|title=[MMFF 2014] âPraybeyt Benjamin 2' Review: Show me the money|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/79142-mmff-2014-praybeyt-benjamin-2-review-vice-ganda|accessdate=1 January 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bubbles Salvador at the [[Philippine Entertainment Portal]], has a more positive review for the film. While Salvador took note of one loophole in the plot of the film - namely the lack of resolution between Bimbee and his father, with the former feeling unloved by the latter, Salvador described Praybeyt Benjamin 2 as "worth of one's couple of hours at the cinema this holiday season, if one is not looking for a lesson in history, a love story, or a good scare, and would settle for a light and funny action comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salvador|first1=Bubbles|title=MMFF 2014 REVIEW: The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/15345/mmff-2014-review-the-amazing-praybeyt-benjamin|accessdate=1 January 2015|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Crabfish'''" is a [[ribaldry|ribald]] [[humorous]] [[folk song]] of the [[England|English]] [[oral tradition]]. It dates back to the seventeenth century, appearing in [[Bishop Percy's Folio]] Manuscript as a song named "The Sea Crabb" based on an earlier tale.&lt;ref name=SeaCrabb1867&gt;{{cite book |title=Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript: loose and humorous songs |editor=Frederick J. Furnivall |location=London |year=1867|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jLo_AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=bishop%20percy%27s%20folio%20manuscript%20crabfish&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[moral]] of the story is that one should look in the [[chamber pot]] before using it.

Owing to the indelicate nature of its theme this ballad was intentionally excluded from [[Francis James Child]]'s renowned compilation of folk songs ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=15048 Lyr Req: Mr Radalum? / Raddle-um / Crabfish etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; The song has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] of 149.

==Synopsis==

A man brings a crabfish (most likely a [[Homarus gammarus|common lobster]]) home as a gift for his wife and puts it in the chamber pot. Some time in the night his wife answers [[excretion|a call of nature]] and the crustacean grabs her private parts. In the ensuing scuffle the husband gets bitten too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/munfla_list&amp;CISOPTR=4854&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=3|title=The Crabfish|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
"Johnny Daddlum" is the [[List of Irish ballads|Irish version]] of this song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=123881 Johnny Daddlum]&lt;/ref&gt; There are variants in which the [[vulgarity|coarse language]] is more clear-cut than in others. In some variants the wife is [[pregnant]], having previously told her husband about her [[food craving|craving]] to eat crabfish meat.

This song has also variants under other names such as "Old She-Crab," "The Crayfish," "A Combat Between an Ale-Wife and a Sea Crab," "The Fishy Crab," and "The Lobster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudcat.org/@displaysong.cfm?SongID=4437 Old She-Crab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudcat.org/@displaysong.cfm?SongID=6105 The Crayfish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=3854 A Combat Between an Ale-Wife and a Sea Crab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armadillo.net/llewtrah/lobster-song.html|title=Lobster Song|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The Crayfish

{{poemquote|Fisherman, fisherman, standing by the sea
Have you got a crayfish that you can sell to me
By the way side high diddly aye do

Yes sir, yes sir, that indeed I do
I have got a crayfish that I can sell to you
By the way side high diddly aye do

Well, I took the crayfish home, and I though he'd like a swim
So I filled up the chamber pot, and I threw the bugger in
By the way side high diddly aye do

In the middle of the night, I thought I'd have a fit
When my old lady got up to a-have a shit
By the way side high diddly aye do

Husband, husband, she cried out to me
The devil's in the chamber pot, and he's got hold of me
By the way side high diddly aye do

Children, children, bring the looking glass
Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's arse
By the way side high diddly aye do

Children, children, did you hear the grunt
Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's cunt
By the way side high diddly aye do

It's the ending of me story; I don't have any more
I've an apple in me pocket, and you can have the core
By the way side high diddly aye do}}

==Versions==
A [[expurgation|sanitized]] version of "The Crabfish," expunging the straightforwardness of the original in order to make the song available for child audiences, was released in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giamusic.com/products/P-6535.cfm|title=The Crabfish|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of private parts the crabfish grabs the wife by the nose and the husband by the ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brookwoodelementary.com/teacher_sites/music/Lyrics/Crabfish.html|title=The Crabfish|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album has a score of 70 out of 100 from [[Metacritic]] based on "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name=meta/&gt; ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' gave the album four stars out of five and stated that "Despite its frustratingly uniform theme--coke--and Jeezy's inflexible, one-speed rasp, his sophomore effort, ''The Inspiration'', suggests that last year's victories were no fluke."&lt;ref name=meta/&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave it a B and stated that Young Jeezy "spits snowman raps with rough-hewn charisma and unseemly enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/music-in-brief,22568/ |title=Music in Brief Â· Article Â· The A.V. Club |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave it three stars out of four and said that Jeezy "continues to improve, crafting songs that are distinctive and memorable, even if he sticks to the well-worn topics of rims, clothes and clubbing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-12-12/news/0612120465_1_young-jeezy-snippets-nimble |title=Young Jeezy THE INSPIRATION RATING: 3 SOUND... |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150055/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-12-12/news/0612120465_1_young-jeezy-snippets-nimble |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' gave it three-and-a-half stars and said that "the smallest suggestions of personality make a charismatic impact."&lt;ref name=meta/&gt; ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' gave the album seven out of ten and stated that "This time around, it's as if the script has been reshot by Michael Bay--glossy and viscerally stimulating--and we're watching a coming attraction for a film that never starts."&lt;ref name=meta/&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' gave it a positive review and said that Jeezy's lyrics "have matured past coke-slinging to the drug's effect on his life."&lt;ref name=meta/&gt; ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'' gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four and said that "Fortunately, getting the money isnât all this follow-up to last yearâs breakthrough ''Letâs Get It'' cares about, and the singles here are fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MATTHEW GASTEIER |url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/music/29987-young-jeezy-the-inspiration/ |title=Young Jeezy - CD Reviews |publisher=Thephoenix.com |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222155724/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/music/29987-young-jeezy-the-inspiration/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews are average or mixed: [[Okayplayer]] gave it an average review and stated, "''The Inspiration'', an even darker work than the debut, finds the Snowman weaving paranoid street tales with eerie trunk-rattling beats. The albumâs main downside is the repetitive nature of many of the tracks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okayplayer.com/reviews/young-jeezy-200612124903.html |title=Young Jeezy |publisher=Okayplayer.com |date=2006-01-02 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121253/http://www.okayplayer.com/reviews/young-jeezy-200612124903.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prefix Magazine'' gave it a score of six out of ten and called it "Spottily effective gangster posturing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Amos Barshad |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/young-jeezy/the-inspiration-thug-motivation-102/15802/ |title=Album Review: Young Jeezy - The Inspiration: Thug Motivation 102 |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date=2008-03-05 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082541/http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/young-jeezy/the-inspiration-thug-motivation-102/15802/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' gave it a Câ and said, "The strange thing about ''The Inspiration'' is how it's posited as an alternative to the much-bullied "conscious rap," and yet, it's among the least fun albums released this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/young-jeezy/the-inspiration.htm |title=Young Jeezy - The Inspiration - Review |publisher=Stylus Magazine |date= |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112839/http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/young-jeezy/the-inspiration.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a mixed review and said, "Young Jeezyâs appeal was never his writing, but now words sometimes fail him."&lt;ref name=meta/&gt; ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' also gave it a mixed review and said that "Almost every dramatic synth swell, exploding snare and multi-tracked "Yeaaahhhh" has been done better elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.courant.com/2006-12-14/entertainment/0612140201_1_thug-motivation-def-jam-atlanta-s-young-jeezy |title=New On Disc - tribunedigital-thecourant |publisher=Articles.courant.com |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223110123/http://articles.courant.com/2006-12-14/entertainment/0612140201_1_thug-motivation-def-jam-atlanta-s-young-jeezy |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
This color revival of ''[[The Munsters]]'' starred [[John Schuck]] (Herman), [[Lee Meriwether]] (Lily), [[Howard Morton]] (Grandpa), [[Hilary Van Dyke]] (Marilyn) and [[Jason Marsden]] (Eddie), and broadcast 73 episodes from October 8, 1988, to May 25, 1991, giving it more first-run episodes than the original series. The [[Television pilot|pilot]] explained the 22-year gap following the original series by showing the family as they were in 1966 when an accident took place; the family then proceeds to wake up in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Munsters Awaken From 22-year Nap|work= Chicago Tribune|date=1988-09-20|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-20/features/8801310728_1_munsters-today-frankenstein-and-dracula-stations-and-cable-companies|accessdate=2010-10-10|first=Kenneth R|last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created following a failed attempt to revive the show with most of the original cast ([[Fred Gwynne]], [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] and [[Yvonne De Carlo]]) in the 1981 [[NBC]] telefilm ''[[The Munsters' Revenge]]''. In the living room set, there are photos of the original casts sitting on the mantle of the fireplace.

===Season 1 (1988â89)===
* "'''Still the Munsters After All These Years" (Pilot)''' â Grandpa creates a "Sleeping Machine" which makes the user fall asleep for a selected amount of time.

When Grandpa sets the dial for 30 minutes and shuts the door, a flash of light and a falling beam change the dial to "Forever." Twenty-two years later, a developer named Mr. Preston ([[Dave Madden]]) and his assistant want to buy the Munsters' home and turn it into a [[parking lot]]. Mr. Preston and his assistant are exploring the house. Mr. Preston forces his employee to search Grandpa's lab; after getting tangled in spider webs he knocks the dial to "off." The Munster family awakens to the world of 1988. They all struggle to find their way in the strange new era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7706">'''The New York Baroque Dance Company''' is a professional American dance company located in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1976 (incorporated 1979) by Artistic Director [[Catherine Turocy]] and Ann Jacoby.&lt;ref&gt;Sulcas, Roslyn (September 16, 2007). [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/arts/dance/16sulc.html "Baroque Holds Court for a New Age"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116195426/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/arts/dance/16sulc.html |date=2018-01-16 }} ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  With a mission to recreate and preserve the full range of 17th and 18th century dances (operas, court balls, salon performances and street shows) the New York Baroque Dance company also serves the community with educational programs for all levels, from elementary school to university, as well as programs for the general public.

The NYBDC has performed with many leading early music specialists, including [[John Eliot Gardiner]], [[Christopher Hogwood]], [[Nicholas McGegan]] and [[Wolfgang Katschner]] and ensembles that include [[Opera Lafayette|Opera Lafayette Orchestra and Chorus]], The Dallas Bach Society, Mercury Baroque, [[Apollo's Fire]] and [[Philharmonia Baroque]].  In New York City, the company produces annual performances with Concert Royal Orchestra.

Important productions have included [[Jean Philippe Rameau|Jean Philippe Rameau's]] ''[[Les BorÃ©ades]]'' (never performed in the 18th century) and [[Hippolyte et Aricie]] at the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]] and the [[Opera de Lyon]]; [[Henry Purcell|Henry Purcell's]] ''[[Indian Queen]]'' at London's [[Barbican]]; [[Scylla et Glaucus]] by [[Jean Marie Leclair]] at the Opera de Lyon as well as more than one hundred performances of a double bill of Rameau's ''[[Pigmalion (opera)|Pygmalion]]'' and [[George Frederick Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Terpsicore]]''. At the [[GÃ¶ttingen International Handel Festival|International Handel Festival]] in [[GÃ¶ttingen|GÃ¶ttingen, Germany]] the company has performed many of that composer's works, including ''[[Ariodante]]'', ''[[Arianna in Creta]]'', ''[[Alcina]]'', ''[[Atalanta (opera)|Atalanta]]'', ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]'', ''Terpsicore'' and ''[[Teseo]]''.

==History==
After studying ballet and dance history at [[Ohio State University]] with Shirley Wynne, Turocy and six other dancers formed the Baroque Dance Ensemble which folded in 1975. Turocy relocated to New York City and formed a new company with Ann Jacoby (who had previously danced with the Baroque Dance Ensemble) as The New York Baroque Dance Co. Turocy had met harpsichordist and conductor James Richman at the [[Aston Magna Music Festival]] in 1974, where they were collaborating on music of Rameau, and the two eventually married.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Allen  (February 9, 1979). [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/09/archives/1600s-music-and-dance-join-hands-for-concert-teaching-musicians-to.html "1600's Music and Dance Join Hands for Concert"] ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  Richman later founded the Concert Royal Orchestra, whose performances date back to their 1977 [[Carnegie Hall]] debut,&lt;ref&gt;Ericson, Raymond  (January 8, 1977). [https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/08/archives/music-authentic-regal-baroque.html "Music: Authentic Regal Baroque"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221050350/http://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/08/archives/music-authentic-regal-baroque.html |date=2018-02-21 }} ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  and with whom the New York Baroque Dance company has frequently collaborated since their 1977 recreation of dances by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-FÃ©ry Rebel]] (''Les Caracteres de la Danse'') and the complete the dance scene from Rameau's pastoral masque, ''[[Les Fetes d'Hebe]]'' at [[Alice Tully Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, John  (December 14, 1977). [https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/14/archives/music-bit-of-baroque.html "Music: Bit of Baroque"] ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, to celebrate the company's 20th anniversary, [[The New York Public Library]] presented the exhibition: ''The New Baroque: Early Dance Re-creations and Inspirations.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypl.org/press/1997/baroque.cfm |title=Exhibition explores the history and pageantry of baroque dance and its re-stagings in the 20th century |accessdate=2018-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001458/http://www.nypl.org/press/1997/baroque.cfm |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Turocy has taught historical performance at the [[Juilliard School]] and (with the New York Baroque Dance Company) has been a guest teacher at the Early Music Institute at [[Indiana University]],&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.music.indiana.edu/news/page/normal/3144.html |title=First steps: Baroque dance introduced to a new generation |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |accessdate=2018-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914114835/http://info.music.indiana.edu/news/page/normal/3144.html |archive-date=2015-09-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oberlin College]], [[Curtis Institute of Music]] and [[Case Western Reserve]].

[[File:Reynard-the-fox.jpg|thumb|The trickster figure [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] as depicted in an 1869 children's book by [[Michel Rodange]]]]
In [[mythology]], and in the study of [[folklore]] and [[religion]], a '''trickster''' is a character in a story ([[God (male deity)|god]], [[goddess]], [[spiritual being|spirit]], [[man]], [[woman]], or [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]]), which exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge, and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behaviour.

==Mythology==
Tricksters are [[archetype|archetypal]] characters who appear in the myths of many different cultures. [[Lewis Hyde]] describes the trickster as a "boundary-crosser".&lt;ref name=Hyde&gt;Hyde, Lewis. ''Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules. Tricksters "...violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis."&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/reviews/980215.15mattict.html|last=Mattick|first=Paul|title=Hotfoots of the Gods|work=New York Times|date=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the bending/breaking of rules takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be [[wikt:cunning|cunning]] or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions and mocks authority. They are usually male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods.

All cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty creature who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths [[Hermes]] plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to [[Autolycus]], who in turn passed it on to [[Odysseus]].&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;  In [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] folktales, the trickster and the [[culture hero]] are often combined.

[[File:How loki wrought mischief in Asgard by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|[[Loki]] cuts the hair of the goddess [[Sif]].]]

Frequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and [[shapeshifting|form]] variability. In [[Norse mythology]] the mischief-maker is [[Loki]], who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He [[Loki#Gylfaginning|becomes a mare]] who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].

British scholar Evan Brown suggested that [[Jacob]] in the Bible has many of the characteristics of the trickster:&lt;blockquote&gt;The tricks Jacob plays on his twin brother [[Esau]], his father [[Isaac]] and his father-in-law [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] are immoral by conventional standards, designed to cheat other people and gain material and social advantages he is not entitled to. Nevertheless, the Biblical narrative clearly takes Jacob's side and the reader is invited to laugh and admire Jacob's ingenuityâas is the case with the tricksters of other cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Evan. ''The Bible in the Context of World Culture'', Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider ([[Anansi]]) is often the trickster.

==Archetype==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Remember11]] --&gt;
{{Further|List of fictional tricksters}}
The trickster or clown is an example of a [[Jungian archetype]].  In modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a [[stock character]].  Often too, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst, in that his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched.  A once-famous example of this was the character [[Froggy the Gremlin]] on the early children's television show "Andy's Gang".  A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R. L. "[http://home.earthlink.net/~christmascamel/id5.html Remembering Andy Devine]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In later folklore, the trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and deceit as a defense.  He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. For example, many typical [[fairy tale]]s have the king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials.  No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes.  With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners.  Therefore, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward.  More modern and obvious examples of that type include [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Pippi Longstocking]].

==Role in African American literature==
Modern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, [[African American literature]] was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural "other." The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As [[Audre Lorde]] explained, the problem was that "the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|chapter=Age, Race, Class, and Sex|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology|editor1-first=Julie|editor1-last=Rivkin|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Ryan|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|page=859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings of the late 1980s, [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] presents the concept of [[Signifyin']]. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the "master's house" can be "dismantled" using his "tools" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, [[the Signifying Monkey]], and his oppressor, the Lion.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} According to Gates, the "Signifying Monkey" is the "New World figuration" and "functional equivalent" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|pp=988â989}} The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of "King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, "[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourseâ¦The monkey speaks figuratively, in a symbolic code; the lion interprets or reads literally and suffers the consequences of his folly..."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's "trounc[ing]" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} The net effect of all of this is "the reversal of [the Lion's] status as the King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the "master's house" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him.

[[File:Br'er Rabbit and Tar-Baby.jpg|thumb|left|[[Br'er Rabbit]] is a trickster character who succeeds through his wits rather than through strength.]]
Following in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, [[Br'er Rabbit]] (a contraction of "Brother Rabbit"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the "creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} The figurative representative of this slave community, Brer Rabbit is the hero with a "fragile body but a deceptively strong mind" that allows him to "create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the "personification of the ethic of self-preservation" for the slave community, but also "an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=158}} Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform.

Before Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] engaged in an epistolary correspondence.&lt;ref name=North77&gt;North, Michael, ''The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the [[Uncle Remus]] tales; Eliot was "[[Virginia opossum|Possum]];" Pound was "[[Tar Baby]]." Pound and Eliot wrote in the same "African slave" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from "the Queen's English, the language of public propriety."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; This rebellion against proper language came as part of "collaboration" between Pound and Eliot "against the London literary establishment and the language that it used."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the [[Uncle Remus]] trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy.

African American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system. In ''When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote'', the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and [[Native American mythology]], thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to "Indian captivity narratives" and the rabbit trickster found in [[Cherokee mythology]].&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=Jonathan|chapter=Introduction: Recognition of the African-Native American Literary Tradition|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: AfricanâNative American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|pages=72â73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baringer|first=Sandra K.|chapter=Brer Rabbit and His Cherokee Cousin: Moving Beyond the Appropriation Paradigm|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: AfricanâNative American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing for a merged "AfricanâNative American folklore", the idea is forwarded that certain shared "cultural affinities" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups "through the trickster talesâ¦survive[d] European American cultural and political domination."&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

==In Native American tradition==
While the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many native traditions held [[clown]]s and tricksters as essential to any contact with the [[sacred]]. People could not pray until they had laughed, because [[laughter]] opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred [[ceremonies]] for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd Gibbens, Professor of English at [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]; quoted [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in ''[[Napalm and Silly Putty]]'' by George Carlin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Native American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional [[picaro]].  One of the most important distinctions is that "we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition".{{sfnp|Ballinger|1991|p=21}} In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next.

In many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote spirit]] ([[Southwestern United States]]) or [[Raven (mythology)|Raven spirit]] ([[Pacific Northwest]]) stole fire from the gods ([[star]]s, [[moon]], and/or [[sun]]). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches.&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;

Wakdjunga in [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] mythology is an example of the trickster archetype.

===Coyote===
{{Main article|Coyote (mythology)}}
[[File:Coyoteinacanoe.png|thumb|left|upright|Coyote often has the role of trickster as well as a clown in traditional stories.]]
The Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among [[indigenous peoples of California]] and [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|the Great Basin]].

According to [[Crow religion|Crow]] (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: "Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumca.org/goldrush/fever04-ci.html "Gold Fever California on the Eve- California Indians", Oakland Museum of California]&lt;/ref&gt; He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Chelan (tribe)|Chelan]] myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time "a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures." while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices of the Winds: Native American Legends|last1=Edmonds|last2=Clark|first1=Margot|first2=Ella E.|publisher=Castle Books|year=2003|isbn=0785817166|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power.

As the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and "medicine". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven.

More often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: "Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water." In others, he is malicious: "Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==In Internet and multimedia studies==
In online environments there has been a link between the trickster and [[Internet trolling]]. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. &amp; Greenhill, A. (2002). "Tribalism, Conflict and Shape-shifting Identities in Online Communities." In the Proceedings of the 13th Australasia Conference on Information Systems, Melbourne Australia, 7â9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. and Greenhill, A. (2009). "[http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2235/ Conflict and Identity Shape Shifting in an Online Financial Community]", ''Information Systems Journal'', (19:5), pp. 461â478. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2008.00301.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbbottCostelloWhosOnFirst.jpg|thumb|[[Abbott and Costello]] performing "Who's on First?"]]

"'''Who's on First?'''" is a [[sketch comedy|comedy routine]] made famous by [[Abbott and Costello]]. The premise of the sketch is that [[Bud Abbott|Abbott]] is identifying the players on a [[baseball]] team for [[Lou Costello|Costello]], but their names and nicknames can be interpreted as non-responsive answers to Costello's questions. For example, the first baseman is named "Who"; thus, the utterance "Who's on first" is ambiguous between the question ("Which person is the [[first baseman]]?") and the answer ("The name of the first baseman is 'Who{{'"}}).

==History==
"Who's on First?" is descended from turn-of-the-century [[American burlesque|burlesque]] sketches that used plays on words and names. Examples are "The Baker Scene" (the shop is located on Watt Street) and "Who Dyed" (the owner is named "Who"). In the 1930 movie ''[[Cracked Nuts]]'', comedians [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey|Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey]] examine a map of a mythical kingdom with dialogue like this: "What is next to Which."  "What is the name of the town next to Which?"  "Yes."  In British [[music hall]]s, comedian [[Will Hay]] performed a routine in the early 1930s (and possibly earlier) as a schoolmaster interviewing a schoolboy named [[Howe (surname)|Howe]] who came from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] but now lives in [[Wye, Kent|Wye]].  By the early 1930s, a "Baseball Routine" had become a standard bit for burlesque comics across the United States. Abbott's wife recalled him performing the routine with another comedian before teaming with Costello.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Bob |last1= Furmanek |first2= Ron |last2= Palumbo |year= 1991 |title= Abbott and Costello in Hollywood |location= New York |publisher= Perigee |isbn= 0-399-51605-0}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bud Abbott stated that it was taken from an older routine called "Who's The Boss?", a performance of which can be heard in an episode of the radio comedy program ''[[It Pays to Be Ignorant]]'' from the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/details/ItPaysToBeIgnorantOtr |title= What did the baggy pants-leg say to the other? |website=[[Archive.org]] |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936, he and Costello continued to hone the sketch. It was a big hit in 1937, when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called "Hollywood Bandwagon".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In February 1938, Abbott and Costello joined the cast of ''The [[Kate Smith]] Hour'' radio program, and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience on March 24 of that year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Dell National Registry 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/WhosOnFirst.pdf |title="Who's On First?" - Abbott and Costello (Earliest existing radio broadcast version) (October 6, 1938) |last=O'Dell |first=Cary |date=2002 |website=United States Library of Congress |format=PDF |access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The routine may have been further polished before this broadcast by burlesque producer [[John Grant (screenwriter)|John Grant]], who became the team's writer, and [[Will Glickman]], a staff writer on the radio show.&lt;ref&gt;This claim is made by Glickman's son. Glickman's obituary in ''Variety'' (March 23, 1983) does not list the sketch among his credits.&lt;/ref&gt; Glickman may have added the nicknames of then-contemporary baseball players like [[Dizzy Dean|Dizzy]] and [[Daffy Dean]] to set up the routine's premise. This version, with extensive wordplay based on the fact that most of the fictional baseball team's players had "strange nicknames" that seemed to be questions, became known as "Who's on First?"  Some versions continue with references to [[Enos Slaughter]], which Costello misunderstands as "He knows" Slaughter.  By 1944, Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted.

Abbott and Costello performed "Who's on First?" numerous times in their careers, rarely performing it exactly the same way twice.  They did the routine for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin Roosevelt]] several times. An abridged version was featured in the team's 1940 film debut, ''[[One Night in the Tropics]]''. The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film ''[[The Naughty Nineties]]'', and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition.{{Efn|On the recording, one can hear muffled laughter in the background coming from the [[film crew]], who are trying, but failing, not to crack up during the taping. After several takes, director [[Jean Yarbrough]] decided that it was a hopeless task to get them to stop laughing, so on the last take he left the laughter in.}} They also performed "Who's on First?" numerous times on radio and television (notably in ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'' episode "The Actor's Home", widely considered the definitive version).

In 1956, a gold record of "Who's on First?" was placed in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. A video (taken from ''The Naughty Nineties'') now plays continuously on screens at the Hall.

In the 1970s, [[Selchow and Righter]] published a "Who's on First?" board game.

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named the routine Best Comedy Sketch of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,36533,00.html |title= Best of the Century |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= December 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early radio recording was placed in the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[National Recording Registry]] in 2003.

In 2005, the line "Who's on First?" was included on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 memorable movie quotations]].

==Sketch==
The names given in the routine for the players at each position are:

:{| class= "wikitable"
|-
! Position !! Player
|-
| [[First baseman|First base]] ||  Who
|-
| [[Second baseman|Second base]] || What
|-
| [[Third baseman|Third base]] || I Don't Know
|-
| [[Left fielder|Left field]] || Why
|-
| [[Center fielder|Center field]] || Because

|-
| [[Pitcher]] || Tomorrow
|-
| [[Catcher]] || Today
|-
| [[Shortstop]] ||  I Don't Give a Darn or I Don't Care
|}

The name of the shortstop is not given until the very end of the routine, and the [[right fielder]] is never identified. In the [[:Who's on First? (board game)|Selchow and Righter board game]], the right fielder's name is "Nobody".&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abbottandcostellofanclub.com/faq.html |title= FAQ |website= Abbott &amp; Costello Fan Club |date= |accessdate= Sep 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in the routine, Costello thinks that the first baseman is named Naturally:

{{block indent |1=
Abbott: You throw the ball to first base.&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: Then who gets it?&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: Naturally.&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: Naturally.&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: Now you've got it.&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: I throw the ball to Naturally.&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: You don't! You throw it to Who!&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: Naturally.&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: Well, that's itâsay it that way.&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: That's what I said.&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: You did not.&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: I said I throw the ball to Naturally.&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: You don't! You throw it to Who!&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: Naturally.
}}

Abbott's explanations leave Costello hopelessly confused and infuriated, until the end of the routine when Costello appears to parody Abbott by saying what appears to be gibberish to him, incidentally getting it right:

{{block indent |1=
Costello: Now I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is drops the ball, so the guy runs to second.
	Who picks up the ball and throws it to What. What throws it to I Don't Know.
	I Don't Know throws it back to Tomorrowâa triple play.&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: Yeah, it could be.&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: Another guy gets up and it's a long fly ball to Because. Why? I don't know.
	He's on third, and I don't give a darn!&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: What was that?&lt;br /&gt;
Costello: I said, I DON'T GIVE A DARN!&lt;br /&gt;
Abbott: Oh, that's our shortstop!
}}

That is the most commonly heard ending. "I Don't Care" and "I Don't Give a ''Damn''" have also turned up on occasion, depending on the perceived sensibilities of the audience.

The skit was usually performed on the team's radio series at the start of the baseball season. In one instance it serves as a climax for a broadcast which begins with Costello receiving a telegram from [[Joe DiMaggio]] asking Costello to take over for him due to his injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/details/otr_abbottandcostello/Abbott_and_Costello_-_Whos_On_First_Original_30_Min_Live_Rad.mp3 |id= #94 |format= Radio |series= Old Time Radio (OTR) |title= Abbott and Costello - Whos On First Original 30 Min Live |website= [[Internet Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (In this case, the unidentified right fielder would have been Costello himself. While Joe DiMaggio was best known as a center fielder, when Abbott and Costello honed the sketch in 1936-7, Joe DiMaggio had played a number of games at right field (20 in 1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dimagjo01.shtml |title= Joe DiMaggio |series= Statistics and History |website= Baseball Reference }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Writing credit==
Writing credits for the sketch are unknown&lt;ref name="O'Dell National Registry 2002" /&gt; though, over the years, numerous people have claimed or been given credit for it.  Such claims typically lack reasonable corroboration. For example, a 1993 obituary of comedy sketch writer Michael J. Musto states that, shortly after Abbott and Costello teamed up, they paid Musto $15 to write the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Neill |first= Brian |date= November 1, 1993 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51788949.html?dids=51788949:51788949&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |title= Michael Musto, 76, writer, filmmaker Series |department= Obituaries |work= [[St. Petersburg Times]] |page= 5B |via= ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several 1996 obituaries of songwriter [[Irving Gordon]] mention that he had written the sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/239116/Irving-Gordon |title= Irving Gordon |work= EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |year= 1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Oliver |first= Myrna |title= Irving Gordon: Composer of 'Unforgettable' |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-03/news/mn-5236_1_irving-gordon |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= December 3, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances and derivatives==
The sketch has been reprised, updated, alluded to, and parodied innumerable times over the decades in all forms of media. Some notable examples include:

* The comedy troupe [[The Credibility Gap]] did a [[rock group]] variation on this routine involving a promoter, played by [[Harry Shearer]], and a newspaper advertising salesman, played by [[David Lander|David L. Lander]], confusing the night's acts as [[proper nouns]]. The acts were [[The Who]], [[The Guess Who]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Robert |last= Lloyd |url= http://www.laweekly.com/1999-11-18/film-tv/sketch-artists/ |title= Sketch Artists |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date= November 10, 1999 |accessdate= September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://harryshearer.com/projects/credebility-gap/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Johnny Carson]] did a variation of the routine involving the then president [[Ronald Reagan]] preparing for a press briefing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evt6As72m4 |website=[[YouTube]] |title=Johnny Carson as Reagan, a "Who's On First" spoof}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1988 film ''[[Rain Man]]'', the film's titular character played by actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] begins to nervously repeat the skit when his brother Charlie, played by actor [[Tom Cruise]], makes him anxious by meddling with his personal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/quotes|title=Rain Man (1988)|accessdate=October 3, 2018|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eugene Levy]] and [[Tony Rosato]] performed a variation on this theme on the TV series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', with the rock groups [[The Band]], The Who, and Yes. The final punchline changed to "This is for the birds ([[The Byrds]])!" "Ah, they broke up long ago!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmovie.com/work/sctv-midnight-express-special-329627 |title= SCTV: Midnight Express Special: Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards |publisher= Allmovie.com |date= September 8, 2011 |accessdate= September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode "K-Acme TV", Gogo pays homage to the routine with anthropomorphic letters Y, U and R.
* In the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' segment "Woodstock Slappy", [[Slappy Squirrel|Slappy and Skippy Squirrel]] attend the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], where they pay homage to the routine. Similar to the SCTV version, Slappy confuses [[The Who]], [[The Band]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]] for proper nouns.&lt;ref name="Animaniacs"&gt;{{cite episode |series= [[Animaniacs]] |number= 59 |title= Ragamuffins / Woodstock Slappy |date= March 1, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peace train"&gt;{{cite news |last= Mendoza |first= N.F. |title= Shows for Youngsters and Their Parents Too: 'Animaniacs' Get on the Peace Train; Disney's 'Red' Gets a Court Trial |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-14/news/tv-26862_1_disney-channel |accessdate= October 1, 2011 |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date= August 14, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode [[Marge Simpson in: "Screaming Yellow Honkers"]], [[Superintendent Chalmers]] and [[Principal Skinner]] attempt to perform the routine, but Chalmers gives up after Skinner says his first line: "Not the pronoun, but rather a player with the unlikely name of 'Who' is on first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Marge Simpson in 'Screaming Yellow Honkers' (1999): Quotes |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701170/quotes?item=qt1309492 |website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Garfield &amp; Friends]]'' segment "Who Done It?", Orson hires three dog brothers named Who, What and Where to help out on the farm. Their sister's name is Why and their uncle's name is Forget It.
* Professional wrestler [[Jim Neidhart]] competed in the [[World Wrestling Federation]] under the ring name "Who" in 1996, serving as an excuse for commentators to make "Who's on First" jokes during his matches.
* In 2002 playwright Jim Sherman wrote a variation called "Hu's on First" featuring [[George W. Bush]] being confused when [[Condoleezza Rice]] tells him that the new leader of China is named [[Hu Jintao|Hu]], pronounced similarly to the word "Who". Bush also misunderstands Rice's references to [[Yassir Arafat]] ("yes, sir") and [[Kofi Annan]] ("coffee").&lt;ref name=latimeshu&gt;{{cite news|title=Hey George, Hu is the new leader of China|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/15/entertainment/ca-verbatim15 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate= August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The biography of Lou Costello written by his daughter Chris is titled ''Lou's on First''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lou's on First|last=Costello|first=Chris|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=1982|isbn=0312499140|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comedy duo Slovin &amp; Allen performed a version of the routine updated to substitute the actual names of the mid-1990s NY Yankees for "who", "what", etc.  
*The video game ''[[Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes]]'' contains a puzzle based on and named after ''Who's on First'', where the two players must communicate verbally to describe the contents and layout of a screen, using words and homophones of words a person would normally use in that situation.
* A variant of unknown origin, called "Abbot and Costello do Hebrew," is popular in the Jewish American community. Its humor draws from the homophonic similarity of a number of words in English â hu, he, me, ma, and dag are homophones of the Hebrew words for he, she, who, what, and fish respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stuff.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/netsam/hebrewLesson.html|title=Abbott and Costello do Hebrew|first=David|last=Policar|website=Stuff.mit.edu|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The skit is an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] on the [[Google Assistant]] and [[Siri]]. When asking "OK Google, Who's on first?" she will reply with "Yes, he is." or "Exactly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smartphones.gadgethacks.com/how-to/google-assistant-101-70-easter-eggs-interesting-voice-commands-0179384/|title=Google Assistant 101: 70 Easter Eggs &amp; Interesting Voice Commands|work=WonderHowTo|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asking Siri, she says "Correct.

* The Shakespeare Theatre of NJ performed a Shakespearean version of the skit in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaGHVWKrcpQ |title = Shakespeare's Who's On First |date= December 24, 2006 |accessdate= January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the special, "Unhinged in Hollywood", Jeff Dunham performs an iteration of the skit with Little Jeff, a ventriloquist puppet modeled after him. The skit involves Jeff getting confused by the names of Little Jeff's pets. He also makes it clear that this is an allusion to the original skit.
*''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' featured a variation of the routine called "Who's on First?: The Sequel" with guest stars [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. In the skit, Seinfeld plays third baseman "I Don't Know," and Crystal plays first baseman "Who." ''The Tonight Show''{{'}}s headwriter, A.D. Miles, plays the second baseman "What", narrator Steve Higgins plays Lou Costello, and host [[Jimmy Fallon]] plays Bud Abbott.
*Three episodes of ''[[Family Guy]]'' make reference to the routine - "[[Extra Large Medium]]", "[[You Can't Do That on Television, Peter]]" and "[[Secondhand Spoke]]"

==Real-life parallels==

*In September 2007, [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] [[shortstop]] [[Chin-lung Hu]], a late-season callup from [[Albuquerque Isotopes|Albuquerque]], got his first major league hit against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]; commenting on his stopping at first base, Dodgers announcer [[Vin Scully]] said, "Shades of Abbott and Costello, I can finally say, 'Hu is on first base'."&lt;ref name=Hu&gt;{{cite web|last=Krell|first=David|editor-last1=Pattison|editor-first1=Mark|editor-last2=Larkin|editor-first2=Kevin|url=https://sabr.org/node/47629|title=Lou Costello|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=February 10, 2018|website=Sabr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Scully enunciates "Hu ... is" (rather than "Hu's" as cited) per YouTube video of an ESPN highlight.

'''Zoobomb''' is a weekly bicycling activity in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States]] during which participants ride [[bicycle]]s rapidly downhill in the city's [[Tualatin Mountains|West Hills]].  Zoobomb began in 2002.&lt;ref name="ww2005"&gt;{{cite web | first = Brandon | last = Hartley | title = Still Bombing after all these years | publisher = [[Willamette Week]] | date = August 24, 2005 | url = http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=6645 | accessdate=2011-11-06| quote= The club began locally in 2002 when Zach Archibald, fresh off a bus from Texas, met a few people who rolled up on mini-bikes outside Rocco's Pizza at Southwest 10th Avenue and Oak Street. They eventually took Archibald up to Washington Park to go bombing, and the club fell together once word got out.  Zoobombers are mostly teenagers and twentysomethings, with an occasional older rider thrown in. Skateboarders, longboarders and riders of "assacres" (low-rider scooters) have also joined in the weekly run, which routinely draws over a hundred people and has lured riders from as far away as Britain, South America and Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Participants carry their bikes on [[MAX Light Rail]] to the [[Washington Park (MAX station)|Washington Park]] station next to the [[Oregon Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portland's Bike Culture Creates Market |url= http://news.opb.org/article/portlands-bike-culture-creates-market/|accessdate=1 October 2010| newspaper=OPB| date=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2011"/&gt; From there, participants take the elevator to the surface and then ride their bikes down the hills in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TWO-WHEELED TERRORISTS| url= http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=28528&amp;category=22107|accessdate=2010-10-01 | newspaper=The Portland Mercury|date=February 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is often repeated several times throughout the night.&lt;ref name="bbc2011"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15591350 |  title= Close-up: Zoobombing in Portland, Oregon | date= 5 November 2011 | publisher= [[BBC News]] | accessdate= 2011-11-06 | quote= Some of the bikes are left chained up in a pile in the city centre, which has itself become a local landmark. The ride, often repeated several times in an evening, starts with a journey on Portland's light rail system then a hike to the top of a hill, near the city's zoo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{rquote|right|The people that are going 35-mph-plus have backgrounds in BMX, mountain biking, bike messengering or downhill skateboarding.  I don't know that people showing up for the first time understand this.|Zoobomber Mark Verno in August 2005&lt;ref name="ww2005"/&gt;}}
There is an emphasis on unusual bicycles, first and foremost the children's bicycles or "minibikes," but extending to [[tall bike]]s, [[swing bike]],&lt;ref name="ww2005"/&gt; choppers, non-functional bicycles, skateboards,&lt;ref name="ww2005"/&gt; [[longboard (skateboard)|longboards]],&lt;ref name="ww2005"/&gt; etc.
The Zoobombers are made up of a wide demographic, with a tendency towards young adults.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}  The event is treated in a very lighthearted fashion, including a large amount of socializing between rides.  Riders often dress up in costume or decorate their bicycles.  Parents have brought their children on rides, and a legally blind person "The Blind Bomber" regularly attends (on a tandem bike, behind a sighted rider).{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Though not technically a race, there is some prestige in getting down the hill first.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  However, there is never shame in getting down the hill last, as safety and fun are what is encouraged, not going fast.  The participants espouse a "[[pack it in, pack it out]]/leave no trace" philosophy in an effort to maintain cleanliness in the areas where they congregate.  Zoobomb tries to be a positive force in the community by providing a safe environment{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} to have a good time and to support bicycle advocacy and alternative non-polluting transportation.

==Zoobomb Pile==

Though many riders bring their own bicycles, the participants maintain a "Zoobomb pile".  This is a tower of minibikes anchored to a bicycle rack at the Zoobomb meeting point. These are spare bikes that are used as loaners for would-be Zoobombers who don't have their own bike. The pile has become a local landmark.&lt;ref name="bbc2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bikeportland.org/2007/10/02/zoobomb-pyle-will-become-official-public-art/| title=Zoobomb pile will become official public art|publisher= BikePortland.org |date=October 2, 2007| accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, a new pile was dedicated, in a ceremony attended by Portland mayor [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sam Adams at Zoobomb Pile Dedication  | publisher = [[The Oregonian]] | date = March 28, 2010 | url = http://photos.oregonlive.com/photogallery/2010/03/sam_adams_at_zoobomb_pyle_dedi.html | accessdate=2011-11-06| quote= Mayor Sam Adams hangs with the Zoobomb crew at the dedication of the new Pile.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new pile is located at SW 13th and Burnside.

There are several annual events hosted by Zoobomb organizers and participants, including:
*Zoobomb Century in June
*MiniBikeWinter in February
*Zoobomb Summer Olympics (aka BiffDay) in August
*Alleykitten Invitational

Zoobomb has inspired Hoodbomb, where participants gather at the [[Timberline Lodge]] and bomb the {{convert|5.5|mi|adj=on}} course of Timberline Road on [[Mount Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Frochtzwajg| first=Jonathan|title=State police lose tolerance with dangerous Hoodbombing|url=http://www.sandypost.com/news/story.php?story_id=128149095457218900| accessdate=2010-10-01 |newspaper=The Sandy Post|date=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
