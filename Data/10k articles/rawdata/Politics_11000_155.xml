The '''Agricultural Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|hr|2642}}; {{USPL|113|79}}, also known as the '''2014 U.S. Farm Bill'''), formerly the "Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013", is an [[act of Congress]] that [[Authorization bill|authorize]]s nutrition and agriculture programs in the United States for the years of 2014-2018.&lt;ref name=cbo2642long&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 2642 conference version|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr2642LucasLtr.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill authorizes $956 billion in spending over the next ten years.&lt;ref name="Hpass956B"/&gt;

The bill passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on January 29, 2014, and the [[United States Senate]] on February 4, 2014 during the [[113th United States Congress]]. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law on February 7, 2014. The bill is considered two years late, since farm bills are traditionally passed every five years.&lt;ref name=bernstein29&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|title=Farm Bill Proves Politics Isn't Dead.

==Background==

===Farm bills===
{{main|United States farm bill}}

In the United States, the '''farm bill''' is the primary [[Agricultural policy in the United States|agricultural and food policy tool]] of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].  The comprehensive [[omnibus bill]] is passed every five years or so by the [[United States Congress]] and deals with both agriculture and all other affairs under the purview of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. It usually makes amendments and suspensions to provisions of permanent law, reauthorizes, amends, or repeals provisions of preceding temporary agricultural acts, and puts forth new policy provisions for a limited time into the future.  Beginning in 1973, farm bills have included titles on commodity programs, trade, rural development, farm credit, conservation, agricultural research, food and nutrition programs, marketing, etc.&lt;ref name="CRS"&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition – Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212033139/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-02-12 }},&lt;/ref&gt; Farm bills can be highly controversial and can impact [[international trade]], [[natural environment|environmental]] conservation, [[food safety]], and the well-being of [[rural communities]]. The [[agricultural subsidy]] programs mandated by the farm bills are the subject of intense debate both within the U.S. and internationally.

The farm bill was first created during the [[Great Depression]] to give financial assistance to farmers who were struggling due to an excess crop supply creating low prices, and also to control and ensure an adequate food supply.&lt;ref name=Crissman&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate approves new farm bill |author=Alison Crissman |url=http://www.dailyiowan.com/2013/06/12/Metro/33464.html |work=[[The Daily Iowan]] |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first farm bill, known as the [[Agriculture Adjustment Act]] (AAA), was passed by Congress in 1933 as a part of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name=Neuman&gt;{{cite news |title=Why The Farm Bill's Provisions Will Matter To You |author=Scott Neuman |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/13/154862017/why-the-farm-bills-provisions-will-matter-to-you |work=[[NPR]] |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]] is the most recent farm bill, prior to this one.

==Provisions of the bill==
The bill includes cuts to [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP), commonly known as "food stamps".&lt;ref name=nytNixonHapproves&gt;{{cite news|last=Nixon|first=Ron|title=House Approves Farm Bill, Ending 2-Year Impasse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/politics/house-approves-farm-bill-ending-2-year-impasse.html?_r=0|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the $8 billion in cuts will mean that 850,000 households will lose $90/month in benefits.&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt; However, the bill increases funding to food banks by $200 million.&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt; SNAP is the largest portion of spending in the bill.&lt;ref name="PlumerWashPost"/&gt; The $8 billion in cuts comes from setting a minimum of $20 per year for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to receive the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) deduction, disallow [[medical marijuana]] as a deduction and ruling that lottery winners and persons convicted of certain crimes (murder, aggravated sexual abuse, [[sexual assault]], and sexual exploitation and other abuse of children) can't get food stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Agricultural Act of 2014: Sections 4005-4009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill would start a new pilot program to encourage people on food stamps to try to find jobs.&lt;ref name="PlumerWashPost"/&gt;

The bill places income caps on farm subsidies, has a price support program for dairy farmers and ends direct payment subsidies, which paid farmers whether or not they actually grew any crops.&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt; This subsidy had cost $5 billion a year.&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt; The bill also removes federal restrictions aimed at growing [[industrial hemp]] and allows any states that have legalized its manufacturing to set up research programs to study the benefits of cultivating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Greg|date=8 February 2014|title=Farm bill clears the way for hemp production|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/08/farm-bill-clears-the-way-for-hemp-production/|newspaper=The Daily Caller|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agricultural Act of 2014 also contained the [[Christmas Tree Research and Promotion Order]], a [[commodity checkoff program]] that established the [[Christmas Tree Promotion Board]].&lt;ref name=usda14&gt;"[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateU&amp;navID=LatestReleases&amp;page=Newsroom&amp;topNav=Newsroom&amp;leftNav=&amp;rightNav1=LatestReleases&amp;rightNav2=&amp;resultType=Details&amp;dDocName=STELPRDC5106950&amp;dID=197485&amp;wf=false&amp;description=As+Required+by+New+Farm+Bill%2C+USDA+to+Allow+Christmas+Tree+Research+and+Promotion+Program+to+Move+Forward+ As Required by New Farm Bill, USDA to Allow Christmas Tree Research and Promotion Program to Move Forward]", press release, ''[[United States Department of Agriculture]]'', Agricultural Marketing Service, April 4, 2014, accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spending===
According to [[Brad Plumer]] at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the spending in the bill (FY 2014-2023) breaks down in the following manner:&lt;ref name=PlumerWashPost&gt;{{cite news|last=Plumer|first=Brad|title=The $956 billion farm bill, in one graph|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/28/the-950-billion-farm-bill-in-one-chart/|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
! Area !! Amount
|-
| Food stamps and nutrition || $756 billion
|-
| Crop insurance || $89.8 billion
|-
| Conservation || $56 billion
|-
| Commodity programs || $44.4 billion
|-
| Everything else || $8.2 billion
|}

In total, this spending represents about 2.1% of projected federal spending over that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2014 to 2024|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45653|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
[[File:Congressional Budget Office's report on the Agriculture Act of 2014.pdf|thumb|left|Effects on direct spending and revenues of the conference agreement on H.R. 2642, as reported on January 27, 2014.]]

''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] about the effects on direct spending and revenues of the conference agreement on H.R. 2642, as reported on January 27, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2642cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2642 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45049|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that direct spending stemming from the programs authorized by the conference agreement would total $956 billion over the 2014-2023 period, of which $756 billion would be for nutrition programs.&lt;ref name="2642cbo"/&gt; Relative to spending and revenues projected under the CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO estimates that enacting the conference agreement would lower budget deficits by $16.6 billion over that 10-year period.&lt;ref name="2642cbo"/&gt; The CBO reported that original House version, [[Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (H.R. 1947; 113th Congress)]], would have reduced direct spending by $51.8 billion and increased revenues by $60 million.&lt;ref name="cbo2642long"/&gt; The original Senate version, [[Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954; 113th Congress)]], would have decreased direct spending by $17.7 billion and increased revenues by $50 million.&lt;ref name="cbo2642long"/&gt;

Most spending under the legislation would stem from provisions regarding nutrition (title IV), crop insurance (title XI), commodity programs (title I), and conservation programs (title II).&lt;ref name="2642cbo"/&gt;

Title I - Commodities. CBO estimates that enacting title I would reduce spending on commodity programs by $14.3 billion over the 2014-2023 period, $3 billion to $4 billion less than under the House- and Senate- passed bills. The conference agreement, as well as both the House and Senate bills, would end fixed payments and certain other existing forms of price and income support to producers. They would all establish new programs that would require producers to choose between price supports or a guarantee of some of their expected revenue.&lt;ref name="cbo2642long"/&gt;

Title IV - Nutrition. Title IV of the conference agreement would reduce nutrition spending by $8 billion over the 2014-2023 period, CBO estimates. The House-passed bill would reduce such spending by $39 billion over the 10-year period. It includes two provisions not contained in the conference agreement that would reduce spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by restricting the definition of categorical eligibility for the program and reducing the number of waivers from work requirements available for certain adult SNAP recipients. The Senate-passed bill would reduce nutrition spending by $4 billion over the next 10 years, about half the reduction in the conference agreement. It contains a proposal to limit heating and cooling allowances for SNAP participants that is less restrictive than the provision include in the conference agreement.&lt;ref name="cbo2642long"/&gt;

Title XI - Crop Insurance. The conference agreement's provisions on crop insurance would increase costs by $5.7 billion over the 2014-2023 period, CBO estimates. Total spending for crop insurance over the 2014-2023 period would increase by about $9 billion under the House-passed legislation and by about $5 billion under the Senate-passed legislation.&lt;ref name="cbo2642long"/&gt;

This estimate does not include the additional discretionary spending for agricultural programs that would result from implementing the conference agreement; such spending would be subject to future appropriation actions. CBO also has not reviewed the conference agreement for intergovernmental or private-sector mandates.&lt;ref name="2642cbo"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
[[File:Agricultural Act of 2014 Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2642.pdf|thumb|right|Agricultural Act of 2014 Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2642]]

===Legislation in 2013===
The Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (version H.R. 2642) was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on July 10, 2013 by [[Frank Lucas (Oklahoma)|Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK)]], the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=2642allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2642 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2642/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to that committee. On July 11, 2013, the House voted in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll353.xml Roll Call Vote 353] to pass the bill 216-208, after several failed attempts were made to delay or amend the bill.&lt;ref name="2642allactions"/&gt; The [[United States Senate]] received the bill on July 16, 2013. On July 18, 2013, the Senate voted to amend the bill by replacing most of it with language from their proposed farm bill, the [[Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954; 113th Congress)]]. The amended bill passed the Senate by [[unanimous consent]] on July 18, 2013 and the Senate requested a conference with the House on the bill. The Senate selected Senators Stabenow, Leahy, Harkin, Baucus, Brown, Klobuchar, Bennet, Cochran, Chambliss, Roberts, Boozman, and Hoeven as their conferees.&lt;ref name="2642allactions"/&gt;

===Conference committee===

* [[Suzan DelBene]] (D-WA)
* [[Gloria Negrete McLeod]] (D-CA)
* [[Filemon Vela, Jr.]] (D-TX)&lt;ref name="2642allactions"/&gt;

On January 27, 2014, the [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt333/CRPT-113hrpt333.pdf Conference Committee report] was released. On January 29, 2014, the House voted 251-166 to pass the bill.&lt;ref name=Hpass956B&gt;{{cite news|title=House passes $956B farm bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/196819-house-passes-956b-farm-bill|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=29 January 2014|author=Pete Kasperowicz|author2=Erik Wasson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the House, a majority of Republicans voted in favor of the bill (163-62) and the Democrats split almost evenly (89-103).&lt;ref name="bernstein29"/&gt; The Senate then voted 68–32 on February 4, 2014, to approve the full five-year farm bill, sending it to President [[Barack Obama]] to be signed into law.&lt;ref name=passed&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=David|title=Congress approves five-year farm bill|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/congress-approves-farm-bill-103114.html?hp=t1_3|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=Politico|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=finalvote&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 113th Congress - 2nd Session|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00021|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Both Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]] and Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] supported the bill and asked other Republicans to do so.&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt; However, both men indicated they would have preferred additional changes.&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt;

On January 29, 2014, after passage in the House, it was considered "unclear" what President Obama thought of the farm bill because he had previously "signaled his opposition to any bill that cut food stamps and expanded crop insurance."&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt;

[[Feeding America]] said that the cuts to food stamps would "result in 34 lost meals per month for the affected households."&lt;ref name="nytNixonHapproves"/&gt;

Major '''Aichatou Ousmane Issaka''', deputy director of social work at the military hospital of [[Niamey]], is one of the first military women in [[Niger]].  In 2016 she received the [[United Nations Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award]] for her service in Gao, Mali with the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force, [[United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali|MINUSMA]], during 2014-2015.  She served as a captain in the civilian-military cooperation cell, training fellow officers and reaching out to local women, in accordance with principles of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] (2000) to increase participation of women and to integrate gender perspectives in peacekeeping efforts. Issaka also accompanied otherwise all-male patrols, making them more accessible to women and children. She was the first recipient of this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/military/advocateaward.shtml|title=UN Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award|last=|first=|date=2016|website=United Nations Peacekeeping|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/newsFr/storyF.asp?NewsID=38006#.WO7VsnrGpj9|title=Une capitaine nigérienne ayant servi au sein de la MINUSMA récompensée par l'ONU|last=|first=|date=September 7, 2016|website=Centre d'actualités de l'ONU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nigerinter.com/2016/09/minusma-capitaine-aichatou-ousmane-issaka-une-nigerienne-recompensee/|title=MINUSMA : Capitaine Aichatou Ousmane Issaka, une nigérienne récompensée !|last=|first=|date=September 8, 2016|website=Niger Inter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia World Schools Debating Championship''', commonly coined as '''AWSDC''', is an international debate competition founded by the Debate Society of [[Anglo Singapore International School]] in 2013. The 1st Asia World Schools Debating Championship was held from 1–8 August 2013 at Anglo Singapore International School's Campus in Sukhumvit 64, Bangkok, Thailand including 7 preliminary rounds, and single elimination playoffs thereafter. The tournament was centred on the theme, "Youth Activism: It's Our Turn". 30 teams from all over the world participated; including Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Philippines, Korea, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About AWSDC|url=http://awsdc2014.weebly.com/about-awsdc.html|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd AWSDC was held once again in Bangkok, Thailand from 31 July- 4 August 2014 at Anglo Singapore International School. It is the official pre-tournament of  [[World Schools Debating Championships]] (WSDC) Thailand 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd AWSDC 2014 Thailand|series=World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC)|url=http://awsdc2014.weebly.com/|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournament Format ==
AWSDC adapts the [[World Schools Style debate]] format which is a combination of the [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary]] and [[Australia-Asia debate|Australia-Asian]] formats. All debates are carried out in English only. Each team consists of 3-5 debaters who each make 8 minute speeches either as side proposition or side opposition for or against a motion respectively. AWSDC emphasises high quality debates and adjudicating in order to provide a platform for young student debaters to improve and achieve their full potential. We also encourage friendly competition where student debaters not only gain academic knowledge but also build friendships with people of diverse backgrounds.

An '''avocation''' is an activity that someone engages in as a hobby outside their main occupation. There are many examples of people whose professions were the ways that they made their livings, but for whom their activities outside their workplaces were their true passions in life.&lt;ref name=saunders&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dragonintuitive.com/avocation-vs-vocation/ |title= Avocation-vs-vocation |author= Travis Saunders |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Your-avocation-may-save-your-life-373723.php |title= Your avocation may save your life. |author= Robert Miller |date= 10 February 2010 |work= The News-Times |publisher= Hearst Corporation |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, as with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]] and others, people who pursue an avocation are more remembered by history for their avocation than for their professional career.

Many times a person's regular vocation may lead to an avocation. Many forms of humanitarian campaigning, such as work for organizations like [[Amnesty International]] and [[Greenpeace]], may be done by people involved in the law or human rights issues as part of their work.&lt;ref name=10202006Boyd&gt;{{cite news |last= Boyd |first= B |date=20 October 2006 |title=A secret history of the old Ball game. | url= http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/revolver-1.1018425 |newspaper=Irish Times  |access-date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people involved with youth work pursue this as an avocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bowdoin.edu/bowdoinmagazine/archives/features/002157.shtml |title= Avocation in Wood |author= Craig Giammona |date= |work= Bowdoin |publisher= |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avocation in literature==
{{quote|But yield who will to their separation, &lt;br&gt;My object in living is to unite &lt;br&gt;My avocation and my vocation &lt;br&gt;As my two eyes make one in sight. &lt;br&gt;Only where love and need are one, &lt;br&gt;And the work is play for mortal stakes, &lt;br&gt;Is the deed ever really done &lt;br&gt;For heaven and the future's sakes.|[[Robert Frost]]|Two Tramps in Mud Time, st. 9}}

Britain First has unsuccessfully contested elections to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Mayor of London|mayoralty of London]].

==History==
Britain First was founded by [[Jim Dowson]], who ran a call centre in [[Dundonald]], East Belfast, for the BNP.  Dowson's links with the BNP as a fundraiser ended acrimoniously in October 2010 when he was accused of groping a female activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stewart |first = Stephen |title = BNP money man quits after model accuses him of groping her in hotel room |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103142015/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/bnp-money-man-quits-after-1074247 |archive-date = 3 November 2015 |url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/bnp-money-man-quits-after-1074247 |work = [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |location = Glasgow, Scotland |date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stewart |first = Stephen |title = Exposed: Scottish BNP No.2 unmasked as man behind Britain First Defence Force's sickening invasion of mosques |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930124119/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exposed-scottish-bnp-no2-unmasked-3607390 |archive-date = 30 September 2015 |url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/exposed-scottish-bnp-no2-unmasked-3607390 |work = [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |location = Glasgow, Scotland |date=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[Calvinist]] minister,&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/britain-first-far-right-anti-muslim-extremists-mosques|title=Britain First: inside the extremist group targeting mosques|date=19 June 2014|work=[[Channel 4 News]]|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowson is a Scottish [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]]. Based in [[Ballygowan]], [[Northern Ireland]], he also led an [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] campaign, the [[UK Life League]]. He is linked to [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] groups in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

Other former officials from the BNP joined Dowson in the formation of Britain First. Its current leader, Paul Golding, had been a district councillor in [[Sevenoaks District|Sevenoaks]], Kent, in 2009–11 representing the BNP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Madden |first = Sophie |title = Former BNP Councillor Paul Golding heads Britain First nationalist movement |url = http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/9069403.Ex_Swanley_BNP_councillor_heads_new_nationalist_movement/ |work = News Shopper |date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the BNP's Communications Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Paul Golding |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034952/http://www.bnp.org.uk/category/person/paul-golding |archive-date = 29 November 2014 |url = http://www.bnp.org.uk/category/person/paul-golding |website = bnp.org.uk |publisher = [[British National Party]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain First was launched through the "British Resistance" website in May 2011.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web |title = Introducing Britain First |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110529100650/http://www.thebritishresistance.co.uk/pp-news/980-introducing-britain-first# |archive-date = 29 May 2011 |url = http://thebritishresistance.co.uk/pp-news/980-introducing-britain-first |website = thebritishresistance.co.uk |publisher = The British Resistance |date = 26 May 2011 |access-date = 26 April 2013 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others involved in Britain First's launch included the former South East regional organiser of the BNP, Andy McBride, and Kevin Edwards, a former BNP councillor and organiser in Wales.

The party's structure is similar to that of [[Ulster loyalist]] groups in [[Northern Ireland]], insofar as the group has a political wing backed up by a [[paramilitary]] action force (named "Britain First Defence Force"). The action force's members assume titles  such as "[[provost marshal]]", and a document written by [[Jim Dowson]] said that "I have lived in the worst trouble spots of [[Belfast]]; I have had high powered machine gun fire rip bricks from my house and have been injured by grenade attack. Sometimes we had to defend our homes from the traditional enemy, other times from the forces of the state, the police and army."&lt;ref name=four /&gt;

Britain First announced in 2014 its intention to launch in America, as "America First" (not to be confused with [[America First Party (2002)|America First Party]] or President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[2018 United States federal budget|2018 United States federal budget, America First]]), but it failed to materialise.&lt;ref name=Mayer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Britain First and our American activists launch "America First" | archive-url = https://archive.is/20170123123007/https://www.britainfirst.org/britain-first-american-activists-launch-america-first/ | archive-date = 23 January 2017 | url = https://www.britainfirst.org/britain-first-american-activists-launch-america-first/ | website = britainfirst.org | publisher = Britain First | date = October 2014 | access-date = 3 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Twitter suspended the accounts of Britain First and its leaders Golding and Fransen, after revising its rules on hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Twitter suspends Britain First leaders|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42402570|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Britain First was banned from Facebook, who said it broke community guidelines and was designed to incite racial hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43398417|title=Facebook bans Britain First pages|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2018|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National People's Party===
In November 2011, Britain First announced the registration of a political party, the "National People's Party", with Golding named as leader, Edwards as nominating officer and McBride as treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainfirst.org/about-us/people/ |title=The Britain First leadership team | website = britainfirst.org |publisher=Britain First |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainfirst.org/britain-first/national-peoples-party-authorised-by-electoral-commission/ |title=National People's Party official public launch | website = britainfirst.org |publisher=Britain First |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] register shows Britain First listed itself from November 2011 as a political party, with the same roles for the three officers, and no current or past listing for a National People's Party,&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web | title =Register of political parties | url =http://electoralcommission.org.uk | website = electoralcommission.org.uk | publisher= [[Electoral Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is not clear whether the National People's Party has a separate existence. The Britain First website carries a constitution for the Party stating, among other things, that "The campaign group Britain First will ... be entitled to put forward a representative to sit on the Standing Committee", a six-person group "tasked with the direction of the Party and running all its affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainfirst.org/constitution/|title=National People's Party constitution|website=britainfirst.org |publisher=Britain First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland offshoot===
The principal figures in Britain First, Dowson and Golding, launched a new political party in [[Northern Ireland]] in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite news |last = Young |first = Connla |title = Union flag protesters launch new party |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430092418/http://www.irishnews.com/news/union-flag-protesters-launch-new-party-1250590 |archive-date = 30 April 2013 |url = http://www.irishnews.com/news/union-flag-protesters-launch-new-party-1250590 |work = [[The Irish News]] |date = 25 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowson was registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] as the [[Protestant Coalition]]'s leader, and Golding as its treasurer.&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; However, Dowson stated at the launch that the Coalition had no one leader.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

Golding had flown into Belfast in December 2012 to help co-ordinate [[Belfast City Hall flag protests|protests]] over the decision by [[Belfast City Council]] to limit the flying of the [[Union flag]] over [[Belfast City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McAleese |first = Deborah |title = Former BNP man and Nick Griffin ex-crony Paul Golding flies to Belfast for loyalist flag protest | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/former-bnp-man-and-nick-griffin-excrony-paul-golding-flies-to-belfast-for-loyalist-flag-protest-29005554.html | work = [[Belfast Telegraph]] | date = 15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowson had been prominent in the protests, and at the time of the launch, was awaiting trial for public order offences, as was another of the Coalition's founders, [[Willie Frazer]].&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

The website and logo of the Protestant Coalition closely resembled those of Britain First, although neither site explicitly mentioned an organisational link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murdock | first = Jason | title = The Shambolic Genesis of The Protestant Coalition | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130815134230/http://atheismnorthernireland.com/2013/04/24/the-shambolic-genesis-of-the-protestant-coalition/ | archive-date = 15 August 2013 |url = http://atheismnorthernireland.com/2013/04/24/the-shambolic-genesis-of-the-protestant-coalition/ | website = atheismnorthernireland.com | publisher = Atheism: Northern Ireland | date = 24 April 2013 }} A comparison of the sites.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure of Jim Dowson===
In July 2014, founder Jim Dowson left Britain First. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that Dowson left because of the party's "mosque invasions", which he considered to be “provocative and counterproductive”, as well as “unacceptable and unchristian” and "just as bad" as [[Anjem Choudary]]. Paul Golding reacted to this by saying that Britain First was, "as far as right-wing organisations go, relatively scandal-free”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Sommerlad |first =Nick|title=Britain First founder quits over mosque invasions which attract ''racists and extremists'' |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britain-first-founder-quits-over-3923810 |accessdate=29 July 2014|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dearden | first = Lizzie | title = Britain First founder Jim Dowson quits over mosque invasions and 'racists and extremists' | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britain-first-founder-jim-dowson-quits-over-mosque-invasions-and-racists-and-extremists-9632770.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain First itself denied the ''Mirror''{{'s}} story, calling it "chief communist newspaper and lover of all things anti-British". The party claimed to have published a farewell letter from Dowson, in which he cited fatigue and the safety of his family as his reasons to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Andrew|title="Don't believe the media lies!" – Statement from Deputy Leader Andy McBride|url=https://www.britainfirst.org/dont-believe-media-lies-statement-deputy-leader-andy-mcbride/ | website = britainfirst.org|publisher=Britain First|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal to Polish immigrants to join ===
In July 2017, it was reported by ''[[BBC News]]'' that a string of Britain First videos designed to attract a [[Poles in the United Kingdom|Polish audience]] had appeared online, including a video from Jacek Miedlar, a Polish far-right former priest, an interview with a Polish media outlet that has over half a million views, and videos by Polish Britain First supporters encouraging others to support the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-40509632|title=The anti-immigration party trying to recruit immigrants|last=Devlin|first=Kayleen|date=11 July 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2017, Marek Zakrocki, a 48 year old Polish-born Britain First supporter, shouted, "[[White pride|White power]]" and gave a [[Nazi salute]] as he used a white van in an attempt to run over Kamal Ahmed, a curry house owner. The van mounted the pavement twice before making contact with Ahmed and the windows of the curry house were also smashed. Hours earlier, Zakrocki had told the police, "I'm going to kill a Muslim. I'm doing it for Britain." Copies of Britain First newspapers and flyers were found in Zackrocki's home and he also said he had donated money to the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-42223156|title=Nazi-salute man drove at curry shop owner|date=4 December 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/04/polish-born-britain-first-supporter-tried-run-curry-house-boss/|title=Polish born Britain First supporter tried to run over curry house boss|last=Evans|first=Martin|date=4 December 2017|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 January 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral history==
===2014 European elections===
Britain First registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 10 January 2014.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

In 2014, the party registered the phrase "Remember [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]]" for use in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European elections]]. The chair of the Electoral Commission later issued an apology "for the offence that has been caused" by accepting the registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Electoral Commission issues grovelling apology after extremist party, Britain First, uses Lee Rigby slogan | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/26/electoral-commission-britain-first-lee-rigby_n_5217680.html | work = [[Huffington Post]] | date = 26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Britton | first = Paul | title = Lee Rigby's mother outraged after political party allowed to use his name on ballot papers | url = http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/lee-rigbys-mother-outraged-after-7037042 | work = [[Manchester Evening News]] | publisher = [[Trinity Mirror]] | date =26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned by [[Andrew Neil]] on the BBC's ''Daily Politics'' about the offence caused to Rigby's mother, Paul Golding said "We apologise to the mother of Lee Rigby, but it was a major act of terrorism, it was a big public event. He was a serving soldier".&lt;ref name=dailypol/&gt;

Britain First stood candidates for the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European elections]] in [[Wales (European Parliament constituency)|Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote 2014: European election candidates for Wales|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-27127311|accessdate=12 May 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote 2014: European election candidates for Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27128651|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encouraged English supporters, in the absence of a Britain First candidate, to instead vote for the [[English Democrats]] or the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), while warning against voting for the BNP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who to vote for tomorrow if not Britain First?|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=473136309498302&amp;set=vb.300455573433044&amp;type=2&amp;theater|work=Britain First|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party came 8th of 11 in Wales, with 6,633 votes (0.9%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote 2014 - Wales|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu-regions/W08000001|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7th of 9 in Scotland with 13,639 votes (1.02%, more than the BNP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote 2014 - Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu-regions/S15000001|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rochester and Strood by-election, 2014===

Britain First stood its first parliamentary candidate for the [[Rochester and Strood by-election]] on 20 November 2014, nominating its Deputy Leader, Jayda Fransen. The party had been active in nearby [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]] in opposition to a planned mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francis|first=Paul|title=George Osborne, Theresa May and Chris Grayling to visit Rochester and Strood ahead of by-election caused by Mark Reckless' defection to Ukip|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news/top-tories-to-hit-campaign-25513/|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=[[KM Group|Kent Online]]|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Mail]] refused to deliver a leaflet for the party because it believed it to be illegal. The company said it could refuse to carry election mail if it considered the contents threatening or abusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Britain First Rochester election mail leaflet dubbed illegal | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-29858335 | work = [[BBC News]] | date =31 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UKIP]] won the by-election. Britain First finished 9th of 13 candidates, with 56 votes (0.14%), finishing below the [[Official Monster Raving Loony Party|Monster Raving Loony Party]] (with 151 votes, 0.38%) and above the Patriotic Socialist Party (with 33 votes, 0.08%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rochester and Strood Constituency Parliamentary By-Election 20 November 2014 | url = http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/Rochester%20and%20Strood%20By-election.pdf | website = medway.gov.uk | publisher = [[Medway Council]] | access-date = 7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the count, the ''BBC News'' reporter [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] was criticised on [[Twitter]] for taking a [[selfie]] with Fransen, stating that he did not know who she was and that he would check before appearing in any future photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swinford|first1=Steven|title=Nick Robinson apologises for Britain First 'selfie'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/11245011/Nick-Robinson-apologises-for-Britain-First-selfie.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London mayoral election, 2016===

On 27 September 2015, Paul Golding announced that he would stand as a candidate in the [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 London mayoral election]]. He received 31,372 or 1.2% of the vote, coming eighth of twelve candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London elections 2016: results|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2016/london/results|accessdate=7 May 2016|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the victory speech of Labour's [[Sadiq Khan]], he turned his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain First candidate turns back on Khan speech|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-05-07/britain-first-candidate-turns-back-on-khan-speech/|accessdate=7 May 2016|website=[[ITV News]]|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and actions==
===Action against Islamists===
In May 2013, following the [[murder of Lee Rigby]], Britain First released a video threatening to place Islamist cleric [[Anjem Choudary]], who was accused of radicalising Rigby's killers, under [[citizen's arrest]] if the [[Metropolitan Police]] would not arrest him&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Chris|title=Britain First: More than the mere sum of the parts left over by the BNP and EDL|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/britain-first-more-then-the-mere-sum-of-the-parts-left-over-by-the-bnp-and-edl|website=blogs.lse.ac.uk | publisher =British Politics and Policy at [[London School of Economics|LSE]]|date = 21 November 2014|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entry of mosques and distribution of leaflets and Bibles===
In May 2014, members of Britain First invaded ten [[Bradford]] mosques, as well as ones in [[Glasgow]],&lt;ref name=dailypol&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain First's leader Paul Golding on BNP breakaway|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27427023|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luton]] and [[East London]].&lt;ref name=four/&gt; During the mosque invasions—some of which they filmed—uniformed members of Britain First presented worshippers with army-issue Bibles and with leaflets on [[Child grooming#Localised grooming|grooming gangs]]: they confronted elders about alleged "Muslim grooming gangs" in the area; and they proselytised Christianity, telling one person to "reject the false prophet [[Muhammad]] and read the Bible". In Bradford they also went to the re-election campaign office of a Muslim city councillor, demanding action on grooming gangs and telling him that he "had been warned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Police investigate far-right 'invasions' of Bradford and Glasgow mosques|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/police-far-right-invasions-bradford-glasgow-mosques-britain-first|accessdate=8 December 2017|agency=The Guardian|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dailypol/&gt; In response, the Member of Parliament for [[Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford West]] [[George Galloway]] said, "This is a grave and national issue.

In July 2014, Britain First entered the Crayford Mosque in South London, demanding that its segregated entrances be removed, with Golding saying, "When you respect women we’ll respect your mosques."

In August 2014, after a report which revealed that over  [[Rotherham sex grooming case|1,400 children had been sexually abused in Rotherham]], mainly by Pakistani men, Britain First protested inside the headquarters of [[Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council]] with a banner saying "Justice for victims of Muslim grooming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Ewan|title=Rotherham Child Abuse Scandal: EDL and Britain First Stage Protests Following 'Appalling' Report|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rotherham-child-abuse-scandal-edl-britain-first-stage-protests-following-appalling-report-1463039|accessdate=15 September 2014|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claimed defence of Nigel Farage===
In May 2014, Britain First announced that it would be deploying "hundreds of ex-[[British Armed Forces|British Forces]]" alongside "several armoured ex-army Land Rovers" to protect the UKIP leader [[Nigel Farage]] after he had been opposed on the street by supporters of Scottish independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacNab|first1=Scott|title='Armoured cars' offered to Farage in Scotland|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/armoured-cars-offered-to-farage-in-scotland-1-3404216|accessdate=30 November 2014|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst acknowledging that UKIP and Britain First were "rival" right-wing organisations, it stated that the two parties remain "patriots together" and as such it was willing to "put our men and our resources at UKIP's disposal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain first to deploy armoured patrol vehicles and ex-military volunteers to protect UKIP leader Nigel Farage|url=https://www.britainfirst.org/britain-first-to-deploy-armoured-patrol-vehicles-and-ex-military-volunteers-to-protect-ukip-leader-nigel-farage/ | website = britainfirst.org|publisher=Britain First|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, a group of anti-UKIP protesters went to a pub where Farage and his family were dining and allegedly scared his children into running away. Later that month Britain First went to that group's meeting in London "to give these traitors their comeuppance". No injuries were reported, but a 48-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault.&lt;ref name=withnall&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=Britain First 'acting like Ukip henchmen' by invading meeting of activists in revenge for pub protest against Nigel Farage|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/britain-first-acting-like-ukip-henchmen-by-invading-meeting-of-activists-in-revenge-for-pub-protest-against-nigel-farage-10146379.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UKIP rejects associations with Britain First, stating "On the fringes of our politics are nutters and we don’t want them anywhere near us".&lt;ref name=ukip&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Britain First accuses Ukip of 'playing political game' with snub over Rochester photo|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-first-accuses-ukip-of-playing-political-game-with-snub-over-rochester-photo-9824058.html|accessdate=29 October 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=withnall/&gt;

===Jews in London===
In 2015, Britain First offered "solidarity patrols" in areas of London with high Jewish populations while blaming anti-Semitism on Islam. The [[Community Security Trust]], an organisation against anti-Semitism, has warned Jews not to become involved with Britain First, and has likened this policy to similar ones by the [[English Defence League]] and the BNP, saying that all of these groups were opposing Muslims more than supporting Jews.&lt;ref name=israel&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghert-Zand|first1=Renee|title=British Jews say 'no thanks' to nationalist group's support|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/british-jews-say-no-thanks-to-nationalist-groups-support/|accessdate=15 February 2015|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calais===
Britain First visited the French port of [[Calais]] in the middle of 2015, during a period of attempted migration to the United Kingdom [[Migrants around Calais|via the town]]. Afterwards, the party was approached by the documentary maker [[Ross Kemp]] to feature in a documentary film about the contemporary rise in nationalism. The party rejected Kemp's offer, calling him a "leftwing actor"; a producer responded by saying that Kemp listens to all opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopkins|first1=Steven|title=Britain First reject Ross Kemp immigration film, saying move would 'drag them through gutter'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/08/12/britain-first-refuse-to-speak-to-ross-kemp_n_7975478.html|accessdate=18 August 2015|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the organisation were recorded for a [[BBC Three]] documentary titled "We Want Our Country Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Mark|title=BBC Three has big plans, but are young people still watching?|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13628499.BBC_Three_has_big_plans__but_are_young_people_still_watching_/|accessdate=1 September 2015|work=[[Herald Scotland]]|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
The organisation has been described as [[fascism|fascist]] by ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Sam|title=Trump, Britain First, and the Purveyors of Racism and Bigotry|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-britain-first-and-the-purveyors-of-racism-and-bigotry|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=The New Yorker|date=30 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics.co.uk,&lt;ref name="Bienkov"/&gt; ''[[GQ]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain First: the feeble fascist criminals who Donald Trump just retweeted|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/britain-first|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=British GQ|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''&lt;ref name="sabin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sabin|first1=Lamiat|title=Britain First threatens direct action on journalists over Lynda Bellingham claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/fascist-group-britain-first-to-start-direct-action-on-mail-and-sun-journalists-over-lynda-post-9817774.html|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=The Independent|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. The group's website has disputed this, listing fascism as one of several "alien and destructive political or religious doctrines" it opposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Robert|title=Britain First: anti-Islam group that bills itself as a patriotic movement|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/29/britain-first-anti-islam-group-that-bills-itself-as-a-patriotic-movement|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=the Guardian|date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDemocracy]] has said that Britain First is not fascist, since it does not oppose democratic politics and does not have a direct connection to older fascist groups, but that they are [[xenophobia|xenophobes]] and [[Islamophobia|Islamophobes]].&lt;ref name="vidgen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vidgen|first1=Bertie|title=Mythbusting Britain First - 5 things you need to know|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/bertie-vidgen/mythbusting-britain-first-5-things-you-need-to-know|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=openDemocracy|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been classified as part of the [[counter-jihad]] movement.{{sfn|Aked|2017|p=172}}

Britain First's stated aim is to protect "British and Christian morality", and it is "committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage" while it also "supports the maintenance of the indigenous British people as the demographic majority within our own homeland", that "Genuine British citizens will be put first in housing, jobs, education, welfare and health".&lt;ref name=Principles/&gt; The party self-styles itself as "loyalist".&lt;ref name=israel/&gt;

Paul Golding disputes interpretations that Jesus was pacifistic or liberal, justifying his belief by citing Jesus' apparent violence against the money lenders and his statement that he came to bring a sword rather than peace. Christian denominations across the UK have condemned the group as blasphemous to Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = York | first = Chris | title = Britain First denounced by every major Christian denomination in the UK|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/29/britain-first-denounced-every-christian-group_n_9111138.html?1454148258 | work = [[Huffington Post]] | accessdate = 1 February 2016 | date = 30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also campaigns against [[Islamism]], immigration and abortion. Britain First claims that it isn't opposed to individual Muslims, but is against the doctrine and religion of [[Islam]] itself, which they describe as "barbaric".&lt;ref name=BF1&gt;{{cite web|title= Homepage: frequently asked questions | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150516073109/https://www.britainfirst.org/ | archive-date = 16 May 2015 |url=https://www.britainfirst.org/ | website = britainfirst.org | publisher = Britain First |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It said in 2015 that Muslims are the only community not integrating, and that "Jews don't cause any problems".&lt;ref name=israel/&gt;

Its claimed objective is "to save this country and our people from the EU, politically correct, multicultural insanity that is now engulfing us".&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; The group opposes the [[European Union]], saying it is a socialist threat to individual national identities.&lt;ref name=BF1/&gt; Britain First Claims to have thousands of members who belong to ethnic minorities, and the group rejects the term [[racism]] as the "[invention of] a communist mass murderer to silence European opposition to 'multi-culturalism'".&lt;ref name=BF1/&gt;

==Controversies==
===Ideology===
A number of sources have criticised Britain First on various grounds. Some sources have noted the openly militaristic and violent nature of the group,&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | last = Meredith | first = Charlotte | title = Britain First 'desecrate' image of fearless Afghan heroine in 'Ban The Burka' campaign | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/21/britain-first-_n_5857250.html | work = [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] | date = 21 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in recruiting and training ex-soldiers, and unlawfully wearing political uniforms. Members of the group, including its founder Jim Dowson, have stated their desire for a religious war in the UK.&lt;ref name="Bienkov"/&gt;

A 2014 report on the links between Britain First and terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland said that behind populist Facebook posts "lies a small but dangerous group of religious fundamentalists intent on starting a 'Holy war'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Meredith | first = Charlotte | title = Britain First's Facebook page banned for 'hate speech'... then put back just an hour later | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/06/28/britain-first-facebook_n_5539413.html | work = [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] | date = 28 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, after the group held "Christian patrols" in a primarily Muslim area of [[Luton]], all major Christian denominations and organisations in the UK rejected Britain First and its ideology. The group was accused of "hi-jacking the name of Jesus Christ to justify hatred and spread fear".&lt;ref name=christian&gt;{{cite news | last = York | first = Chris | title = Britain First denounced by every major Christian denomination in the UK | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/29/britain-first-denounced-every-christian-group_n_9111138.html | work = [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] | date = 30 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, a petition to the [[Home Office]] was launched urging a ban on the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wright | first = Paul | title = Britain First's Holy War: Home Office condemns 'anti-Muslim propaganda' as petition calls for group to be banned | url = http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/britain-firsts-holy-war-home-office-condemns-anti-muslim-propaganda-petition-calls-group-1540893 | work = [[International Business Times]] | date = 29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misleading media===
Britain First has also attracted derision and condemnation for social media posts. These included a post which falsely labelled Afghanistan's first female police officer, who was murdered by the [[Taliban]], as a terrorist, and posts falsely linking the [[burqa]] and terrorism.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt; In March 2015 an American veteran stated his intention to sue for libel after the group shared a 'photoshopped' image of him. In the original image, the veteran was holding a sign reading "Boycott bigotry"; in the version shared by Britain First the sign reads, "Boycott bigotry and kill all non-Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Faridi | first = Hasan | title = Veteran reports Britain First for defamation over fake photo | url = http://www.yorkshirestandard.co.uk/news/veteran-reports-britain-first-for-defamation-over-fake-photo-10603/ | work = [[The Yorkshire Standard]] | date = 6 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain First also received criticism for posing for a photograph with naval cadets in [[Nottingham]], and then adding a caption falsely claiming that their activists were protecting the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Staff writer|title=Britain First criticised over Nottingham Sea Cadet poppy photo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-34760414|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, Britain First publishes media falsely labelling Muslims, who happened to be protesting against Islamopobia and bigotry, celebrating cricket results, or not even there, as "extremists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Morrison | first = Sean | title = Far right Britain First leader shares fake video of 'London Muslims celebrating Paris terror attack' | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/paul-golding-shared-video-falsely-claiming-muslims-celebrated-paris-terror-a3520926.html | work = [[London Evening Standard]] | date = 22 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Allegretti | first = Aubrey | title = Britain First’s Facebook video showing ‘Muslims Attack Welsh’ after Euro 2016 violence ridiculed | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/britain-first-facebook-video-muslims-attack-welsh_uk_57601ee0e4b00f4bac30c95e | work = [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] | date = 14 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchandise issues===
In August 2014, the [[Cabinet Office]] wrote to Britain First requesting that they remove an image of the [[The Crown|British crown]] from their merchandise. The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) had previously requested that the crown be removed from Britain First's online accounts. In response, Golding called the ASA a "toothless [[quango]] with no power which no one takes any notice of" and responded that the group's solicitors had deemed the crown distinct enough to be used without breaching regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Sarah|title=Government considers steps against Britain First over use of crown|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/27/government-cabinet-office-first-britain-royal-crown?CMP=twt_gu|accessdate=27 August 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASA published a ruling on 4 March 2015 upholding complaints about Britain First's use of the crown symbol, and about their selling merchandise falsely implying that it was British-made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2015/3/Lionheart-GB/SHP_ADJ_287682.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on Lionheart GB|date=4 March 2015| work=asa.org.uk | publisher = [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiously aggravated harassment===
In May 2017, Golding and Fransen were charged with religiously aggravated harassment over verbal attacks and leaflets they 
distributed in Thanet and Canterbury. They pleaded not guilty at a hearing on 17 October 2017; a "Persecuted Patriots Rally" organised on 4 November to show support attracted more opponents than supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kevin|last1=Rawlinson|title=Two Britain First leaders charged with religiously aggravated harassment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/20/two-britain-first-leaders-golding-fransen-charged-with-religiously-aggravated-harassment|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news|first1=Craig|last1=Simpson|title=Far-right group Britain First to march through Bromley|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/far-right-group-britain-first-696516|newspaper=[[The Croydon Advertiser|Croydon Advertiser]]|date=29 October 2017}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news| last = Staff writer |title= Britain First outnumbered at their own 'Persecuted Patriots' rally in Bromley |url =

===Posts retweeted by Donald Trump===
{{main|Donald Trump on social media#Britain First videos}}

In November 2017, the [[President of the United States]], [[Donald Trump]] caused controversy by re-broadcasting three [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] videos shared by [[Jayda Fransen]]. The re-tweets were responded to by Fransen and [[Paul Golding]] with the statement "God Bless you Trump!

Three weeks later, on 18 December, Twitter suspended the accounts of Golding, Fransen and Britain First.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/18/twitter-purge-suspends-account-of-far-right-leader-who-was-retweeted-by-trump/ |title=‘Twitter purge’ suspends account of far-right leader who was retweeted by Trump |first=Craig |last=Timberg |first2=Hayley |last2=Tsukayama |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later joined and ask all their followers to go to the [[Gab (social network)|Gab]] social networking service created as an alternative to social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Marsh, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/britain-first-gab-social-media-twitter-ban "Britain First signs up to fringe social media site after Twitter ban"], ''The Guardian'', 20 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a January 2018 interview with [[Piers Morgan]] for ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'', Trump said he was not familiar with Britain First when he retweeted them, saying, "If you are telling me they’re horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you’d like me to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-britain-first-tweets-apology-piers-morgan-jayda-fransen-anti-muslim-videos-islamophobia-a8178831.html |title=Donald Trump apologises for retweeting anti-Muslim videos from Britain First |first=Jon |last=Sharman |work=[[The Independent]] |date=24 January 2018 |accessdate= 1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 conference===
Britain First's 2017 conference in Bedfordshire, held at the beginning of December, was booked under a different name. The venue said it would not have taken the booking from Britain First if it had known who was behind it "as the values of our organisation conflicts with theirs in totality"; the booking fee was donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain First's meeting booking 'made under different name'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-42219595|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher= |website=BBC News|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the invited speakers at the conference was Jolene Bunting, an independent unionist city councillor in [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/britain-first-trump-retweets-the-truth-belfast-councillor-tells-party-conference-36375179.html|title=Britain First Trump retweets 'the truth,' Belfast councillor tells party conference|accessdate=8 December 2017|date=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunting had previously organised an anti-terrorist rally in front of [[Belfast City Hall]] in August 2017, with invited speakers including Golding and Fransen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work =[[Belfast Telegraph]]|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/unionist-councillor-defends-britain-first-appearance-at-belfast-rally-35974048.html|title=Unionist councillor defends Britain First appearance at Belfast rally|accessdate=8 December 2017|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fransen was subsequently arrested in London in November 2017 by detectives from the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]], charged with using "threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour" at the rally, and ordered to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on 14 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Arcy |first=Scott |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-first-arrested-far-right-extremism-jayda-fransen-speech-belfast-northern-ireland-a8063206.html |title=Jayda Fransen: Deputy leader of far-right group Britain First arrested over speech in Belfast|work=The Independent|agency=Press Association|date=19 November 2017|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-42040719|work= [[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 November 2017|date=19 November 2017|title=Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen charged}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, both her and Golding were re-arrested in Belfast.

=== Finsbury Park terrorist attack ===
On 19 June 2017, a van was [[Vehicle-ramming attack|driven into pedestrians]] in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London, near [[Finsbury Park Mosque]], injuring at least eight people. On 23 January 2018, it was alleged that the perpetrator of the [[2017 Finsbury Park attack|Finsbury Park attack]], Darren Osbourne, had had contact with far-right groups including Britain First. After the London Bridge attack on 3 June, he made several searches on [[Google Search|Google]] for Britain First leader Paul Golding and his deputy Jayda Fransen, as well as Tommy Robinson, one of the EDL's founders. He also received a direct Twitter message from Fransen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42790610|title=Finsbury Park: Jury sees CCTV of attack suspect 'hiring van'|date=23 January 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-who-drove-van-finsbury-11901579|title=Britain First tweeted man who 'drove van into Finsbury Park mosque worshippers'|last=Wardle|first=Sally|date=23 January 2018|work=Mirror|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facebook account ===
In March 2018, [[Facebook]] removed the accounts of Golding, Fransen and Britain First, on the grounds that they had repeatedly violated its community standards. Facebook explained that the group had "repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against [[Minority group|minority groups]], which disqualifies the pages from our services". At the time, more than two million people had "[[Facebook like button|liked]]" the group's Facebook page. The British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Theresa May]], and the [[mayor of London]], [[Sadiq Khan]], both welcomed the move. The group was also banned from setting up an official Facebook page in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/03/14/facebook-bans-pages-britain-first-leaders-paul-golding-jayda/|title=Facebook bans pages of Britain First and leaders Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen|last=Field|first=Matthew|date=14 March 2018|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=14 March 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43398417|title=Facebook bans Britain First pages|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=14 March 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Collins, head of research for the anti-fascist group [[Hope not Hate]], suggested in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the ban, combined with the imprisonment of the party's leaders, has the potential to lead to the collapse of Britain First, which has depended heavily on online activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/facebook-bans-britain-first-and-its-leaders|title=Facebook bans Britain First and its leaders|date=14 March 2018|first1=Alex|last1=Hern|first2=Kevin|last2=Rawlinson|publisher= |work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 the documentary programme ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' reported that prior to being taken down, Britain First's Facebook page had been one of several far-right pages specially protected by Facebook. According to a moderator, the page was protected because its popularity provided Facebook with a lot of advertising revenue.&lt;ref name="hern"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hern |first1=Alex |title=Facebook protects far-right activists even after rule breaches |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/17/facebook-protects-far-right-activists-even-after-rule-breaches-dispatches-c4 |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=16 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook’s Dublin moderators criticised for not removing abusive videos |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/facebook-s-dublin-moderators-criticised-for-not-removing-abusive-videos-1.3567707 |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=The Irish Times |date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside Facebook: Secrets of a Social Network - All 4 |url=https://www.channel4.com/programmes/inside-facebook-secrets-of-a-social-network |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Dispatch |agency=Channel 4 |date=17 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain First's page had broken Facebook's rules more than the number of times that would normally lead to the page being banned from the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stephen |title=Think you know how bad Facebook's extreme content moderation is?

==Murder of Jo Cox and possible proscription==
{{Main article|Murder of Jo Cox}}
On 16 June 2016, [[Jo Cox]] MP was fatally shot and stabbed outside a library in Birstall, by a man who eyewitnesses said shouted "Britain first" as he carried out the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = |title=U.K. MP dies after being shot by an assailant who reportedly shouted ‘Britain First’ before attack|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/british-labour-lawmaker-injured-in-shooting-near-leeds-reports-say|work=[[National Post]]|location=Canada|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One witness told ''BBC News'' that he was uncertain whether the suspect was shouting "Britain first" or "put Britain first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Staff writer|title=Jo Cox MP dead after shooting attack|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36550304|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another man said that he did not hear the words at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Staff writer|title=Cox witness says no one shouted Britain First|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/jo-cox-witness-says-no-one-shouted-britain-first-132375|work=[[LBC]]|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party issued a statement denying any involvement or encouragement in the attack and suggested that the phrase "could have been a slogan rather than a reference to our party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Boyle | first = Danny|title=Britain First party leader 'just as shocked as everyone else'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-leeds-witnesses-report/#update-20160616-1617|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=16 June 2016|quote=Jo Cox is obviously an MP campaigning to keep Britain in the EU so if it was shouted by the attacker it could have been a slogan rather than a reference to our party - we just don't know.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's leader, [[Paul Golding]], condemned the attack, saying, "We hope that this person who carried it out is strung up by the neck on the nearest lamp post.

'''Chua Beng Huat''' ({{zh|t=蔡明發|s=蔡明发|poj=Chhòa Bêng-hoat}}) is a [[Singapore]]an sociologist. He is a Provost Professor at the Department of [[Sociology]] at [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), and concurrently the Cluster Leader of the Cultural Studies in Asia program at the [[Asia Research Institute]] (ARI). Until mid-2015, Chua headed the Department of Sociology at [[National University of Singapore]].

Chua did not have an early start in [[social sciences]] or [[humanities]]. Instead, he studied [[Biology]] and [[Chemistry]] in his undergraduate years. In the 1960s where college campuses in [[North America]] were fertile ground for counterculture, his involvement with student political activities made him realize that he did not have the right personality for natural science.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/soccbh/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He headed to [[York University]], [[Toronto]], to take up [[Environmental Studies]] in 1970. A year later, he switched to [[Sociology]] and received a M.A and a PhD.&lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, ''International Sociological Association E-Bulletin'', No. 7, July 2007, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

On whether his lack of an undergraduate degree in [[Sociology]] posed an obstacle in his graduate years, Chua remarked, “Probably it was a blessing in disguise. I think if I had done undergraduate degrees in [[Sociology]], I would have sort of glossed over lots of important theoretical readings, feeling that I already know them. Because I didn’t, I read most of the classic texts during my first year in the M.A program. That probably was foundationally the most important thing that happened. I find that with that kind of grounding substantive fields are fairly easy to take up and put down. After twenty five years, I still think that is true.” &lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chua’s emphasis on the theoretical over the substantive is evident in his PhD dissertation. Written at a time when an understanding of how reality is socially constructed was just beginning to emerge, he used the Preliminary Report of the Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism to analyze how government reports are written such that they are demonstrably democratic. It was a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], [[ethnomethodological]] and [[interpretive]] piece that exposed mechanisms by which [[democracy]] is made visible in texts.

“I could have written on reports on crime or whatever because the substance was not important. The really important issue is the production of [[democracy]] textually in government reports because government reports, in whatever field, [[urban planning]] or [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] or [[policing]], must not be seen as biased in any particular way. It was the processes, procedures and practices – how to manage information that was coming into the report – that was important to me. Specifically, I was not interested in anything substantive. I was only interested in the practices of how one actually uses the structure of the text so that it would appear to be unquestionably democratic.” Commenting on his dissertation: “One of the interesting things I think most people don’t realize is that those kinds of ethnomethodological work can actually be used for social change. Knowing how reality is put together is to know, at the same time, how it can be deconstructed. If you know how reality is constructed, then you know how it can be changed.” &lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his graduate studies, Chua taught at [[Trent University]], [[Ontario]] for about seven or eight years. In 1984, the [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) offered him the Director of Research post. He returned to Singapore and took up the position.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; He began to stray away from wholly theoretical work and focused on writing critically about [[Singapore]] as well, including writing a weekly column in the national newspaper, [[The Straits Times]], for one year. As he explained, “Once I came back to Singapore, to a certain extent, what happens locally politically gets personalized. I feel not just the responsibility but also the right to be critically analytical of a society to which my own life is embedded. In that sense, I kind of changed from being an academic to a more public intellectual; in [[Canada]], I was basically an academic whose concerns are of conceptual and theoretical questions of how to do sociology.” &lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

His knack for scrutinizing the workings of Singapore society and his insistence on doing so publicly did not go unnoticed. Within a year, he was fired from his job at [[HDB]] for his critical writings of Singapore politics. He joined [[National University of Singapore|NUS]] afterward, and has been there since 1985.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; The turn of events did not make Chua ease up on his public assessments of social reality in Singapore and beyond. In fact, it freed him of the constraint of being a civil servant and his research and writings expanded into more areas.

==Current research interests ==
His research efforts are focused on three key areas: [[comparative politics]] in [[Southeast Asia]], urban and housing planning, and [[Cultural Studies]] in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, ''International Sociological Association E-Bulletin'', No. 7, July 2007, pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

One noteworthy work in the area of [[comparative politics]] in Southeast Asia is his discussion of communitarian politics. He asserts that [[liberalism]] and [[democracy]] do not necessarily have to go hand in hand in Asia. With nationhood being a new phenomenon and liberalism lacking deep historical roots in much of Asia, he questioned what other values instead of those of liberalism might be promoted in these regions, and analyzed dynamics that surround construing national ideologies in [[communitarian]] terms. In this way, he revealed how social practices in parts of Asia disrupt the global hegemony of liberalism. In ''Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore'' for instance, a book that radically reoriented the analysis of politics in Singapore, he demonstrated that the undisrupted reign of [[People’s Action Party]] (PAP) was based on its ability to develop and maintain a Gramscian sense of [[ideological]] [[hegemony]], since the mid-1970s, rather than on [[authoritarianism]]. This ideological hegemony had enabled the Party to shift towards the concept of ‘Asian democracy’, an attempt to supplant liberalism with ‘Asian’ [[communitarism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of urban and housing planning, Chua has made inquiries into the uniqueness of [[public housing in Singapore]], with it being neither an investment and consumer good in a free market, nor a social right as in [[socialist]] nations. In ''Political legitimacy and Housing: Stakeholding in Singapore'' for example, he shows that the success of its unique [[public housing]] system, which guarantees a home for all citizens, is a fundamental contribution to the [[ideological]] [[hegemony]] and thus legitimacy of the [[one-party state]] in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Legitimacy and Housing: Stakeholding in Singapore'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1990s, as the capitalist economies in [[East Asia]] developed, Chua turned his attention to popular consumer culture. This resulted firstly in editing, ''Consumption in Asia: lifestyles and identities'', a volume in the Routledge New Rich in Asia Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415232449/&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the attention-grabbing neon pink book ''Life is Not Complete without Shopping''. Playfully drawing its title from a 1996 National Day Rally speech by the then [[Prime Minister]] of [[Singapore]] [[Goh Chok Tong]], this book explored how Singapore’s social reality is constituted in an environment steeped in global consumer imagery. In it, he wrote about bodies, food, clothes and movies, diverse activities like hanging out at the town centre [[McDonald’s]], riding the escalator at [[Ngee Ann City]], a major shopping complex, and looking at price tags at [[Prada]] came together as analytical objects.&lt;ref&gt;''Life is Not Complete without Shopping'' (Singapore: Singapore University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s, Chua became increasingly interested in [[Cultural Studies]]. He became a founding Co-Executive Editor of the journal [[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]. With financial support from the [[Asia Research Institute]] at [[National University of Singapore]], where he leads the Cultural Studies in Asia Research Cluster, he organized conferences and workshops in related topics and themes. Edited volumes, such as ''Political Elections as Popular Culture'' and ''East Asian Pop Culture: analyzing the Korean Wave'', are results of these workshops. With these organizing and publication efforts, he has helped to develop a research community of scholars who are engaged in analyzing Asian pop music, film and television dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=24 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729194702/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=24 |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other interests ==
Chua is an avid supporter of the arts. He was the [[Artistic Director]] of a multi-disciplinary group show SENI in 2004, and served on the Board of Directors for FOCAS, a now-defunct not-for-profit publishing initiative that primarily concerned itself with contemporary art, politics and social change in [[Singapore]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Presently, he is on the International Advisory Board for the [[Asian Film Archive (AFA)]] and [[Chairman]] of the Board of Trustees of Temenggong Artists-In-Residence, a centre for artistic exchange and residence in [[Singapore]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30678">The '''constructive vote of no confidence''' (in German: ''konstruktives Misstrauensvotum'', in Spanish: ''moción de censura constructiva'') is a variation on the [[motion of no confidence]] that allows a [[parliament]] to withdraw confidence from a [[head of government]] only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor. The principle is intended to ensure that a replacement head of government has enough parliamentary support to govern.

The concept was first used on a national scale in [[West Germany]], but is today also used in other nations, such as [[Spain]], [[Hungary]], [[Lesotho]], [[Israel]], [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Albania]] and [[Belgium]].

==Germany== 
{{see also|Politics of Germany}}
Governments in the 1919 [[Weimar Republic]] were usually very unstable. As there was no [[election threshold]] for getting a seat in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], it was possible to get a seat with as little as 0.4 percent of the vote.  This resulted in a large number of parties getting seats, making it very difficult for a government to retain a majority.  Under the [[Weimar Constitution]], a [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] (or ''Reichskanzler'' as he was then called) would frequently be voted out of office without his successor having sufficient backing to govern. This led to a quick succession of many Chancellors in office.  Many of these chancellors were forced to rely on the emergency provisions of [[Article 48]] just to conduct the basic business of government.  In the latter years of the Weimar era, this frequently led to the imposition of cabinets that were dependent on the confidence of the [[President of Germany (Weimar Republic)|President]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. This instability was helped by and seen as contributing to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] under [[Adolf Hitler]].

To overcome this problem, two provisions were included in the 1949 German [[constitution]], the ''[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]'' ''(Grundgesetz).'' They stipulate that the Chancellor, or ''Bundeskanzler'' ([[Chancellor of Germany|Federal Chancellor]]) as he is now called, may be removed from office by majority vote of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' ("Federal Diet", the lower chamber/house of the German Federal Parliament) only if a prospective successor also has the support of a majority. The relevant provisions are as follows:

: '''Article 67.''' (1) The Bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the Federal Chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the Federal President to dismiss the Federal Chancellor. The Federal President must comply with the request and appoint the person elected.
: (2) Forty-eight hours must elapse between the motion and the election.

: '''Article 68.''' (1) If a motion of a Federal Chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the Bundestag, the Federal President may, upon the proposal of the Federal Chancellor, dissolve the Bundestag within twenty-one days. The right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the Bundestag with the majority of its members elects another Federal Chancellor.
: (2) Forty-eight hours must elapse between the motion and the vote thereon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|url = http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0315|website = www.gesetze-im-internet.de|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the failure of a [[motion of confidence]] does not automatically force either the resignation of the cabinet or a new election. Rather, the cabinet ''may'' continue as a [[minority government]] if there is not a positive majority for a prospective successor.

For a successful motion of no confidence, a majority of the members of Bundestag is needed to elect a new chancellor. This means that not participating in the vote or abstaining has the same effect as voting ''no''. This was of specific importance in the first (unsuccessful) use of this instrument.

Also, the Federal President may dissolve the legislature ''only'' after the failure of a motion of confidence, and the legislature may not dissolve itself either. This provision is intended to limit the power of the President. One consequence of this is that in contrast to many other parliamentary democracies, the Chancellor does not petition the President to dissolve the legislature. Rather, in the past, the Chancellor deliberately loses a motion of confidence.  However, this practice has been restricted by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] since the election of [[Helmut Kohl]] in 1982.

While [[Carlo Schmid (German politician)|Carlo Schmid]] is generally considered to be the main contributor to this constitutional innovation, the concept was actually first introduced after [[World War I]] in the [[Free State of Prussia]].  Its existence was a major reason why that state was governed by a centre-left coalition without interruption from 1919 to 1932.

===History of use===
Since 1949, only two constructive votes of no confidence have been attempted, and only one has been successful.

====1972 (failed vote)====
On 27 April 1972, an attempt to vote Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] (SPD) out of office in favor of opposition leader [[Rainer Barzel]] (CDU) failed by a margin of only two votes. This came as a surprise since it was known that several members of the SPD-FDP coalition strongly opposed Brandt's ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' and the government no longer had a clear majority after several deputies either switched over to the opposition or announced they would vote for the no-confidence motion. The numerous defections theoretically dropped the coalition to just 246 votes. The opposition nominally had 250 votes, just one vote over the 249 needed to topple Brandt. 

The vote was highly influenced by tactics. To hamper their deputies from voting for Barzel in the secret ballot, the leadership of the governing parties urged its deputies not to participate in the vote;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Hartmut |date=1999-05-17 |title=„Ein schäbiges Spiel“ |trans-title=A shoddy game |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13395450.html |language=de |journal=Der Spiegel |volume=1999 |issue=20 |pages=180-181 |access-date=2018-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a majority of deputies was needed for a successful vote, not participating meant in fact voting ''no''. Only the members of government and a few deputies of the governing parties voted, the first to ensure that dissenting deputies from CDU might remain secret. 

Despite this, Brandt believed he was finished, and the SPD had girded itself to be consigned to opposition. A number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt's defeat. In the end, only 260 votes were cast: 247 with yes, 10 with no, 3 abstaining, and 236 either absent or invalid. It was thus clear that the missing votes were within the CDU faction. In June 1973, CDU member Julius Steiner admitted to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine to have abstained from voting. Later, he claimed to have received 50,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] in return from one of the leading SPD figures, [[Karl Wienand]]. Leo Wagner of the CSU was suspected to have received a bribe as well, but conclusive evidence could not be found. 

After the 1990 [[German reunification]], it became clear that the bribe money that was offered to several CDU politicians came from the East German [[Stasi]] (secret police), who at the time saw a need for Brandt to stay in power. That is somewhat ironic since Brandt's ''Ostpolitik'' is today seen as one of the major steps that eventually led to the implosion of East Germany in 1989.

However, as the government was no longer backed by a majority in parliament, on 22 September, Chancellor Brandt proposed a [[motion of no confidence#The Basic Law: the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany|Motion of confidence]] to the ''Bundestag''. He lost intentionally to make way for the [[West German federal election, 1972]].

====1982 (successful vote)====
On 1 October 1982, [[Helmut Schmidt]] was successfully voted out of office in favor of [[Helmut Kohl]], marking the end of the SPD-FDP coalition. The vote was much easier than the earlier one since it was clear that the FDP wanted to switch over to a coalition with the CDU. Indeed, the FDP was already in negotiations at the time the vote happened. The FDP was no longer content with SPD economic policy and at the same time, the SPD was internally divided over [[NATO Double-Track Decision|NATO stationing of nuclear missiles in Germany]]. Still, the vote succeeded by a majority of only seven votes.

To obtain a clearer majority in the ''Bundestag'' (which seemed to be in reach according to the polls), after the vote, Helmut Kohl put up a motion of confidence in which the new CDU-FDP coalition intentionally voted against the Chancellor that it just put into power. This trick allowed for the dissolution of the ''Bundestag'' according to Article 68 ''Grundgesetz'' (see above). Still, the action triggered an appeal to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]], which, in a somewhat helpless ruling, upheld the move but set criteria for such motions in future. After all, the new ''Bundestag'' had already been elected in [[West German federal election, 1983|March 1983]], yielding a strong majority for the new coalition, which eventually lasted until [[German federal election, 1998|1998]].

===Gerhard Schröder's 2005 motion of confidence===

On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in the state (land) elections in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] announced he would call federal elections "as soon as possible". Constructive vote of no confidence were not used (Article 67), instead a [[motion of confidence]] (Article 68) in Chancellor Schröder was subsequently defeated in the ''Bundestag'' on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. The [[Federal Constitutional Court]], once again, allowed such [[motion of confidence]], and the Federal President dissolved the ''Bundestag'' according to the Article 68, Par. 2 of the [[Basic Law]]. The [[German federal elections, 2005]] were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by Angela Merkel achieved a majority in parliament. On October 10, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a ''grand coalition''. Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy. Merkel was elected Chancellor on 22 November.

==Spain==
{{see also|Politics of Spain}}
A very similar system to the German one exists in Spain today. It was approved in the new [[Constitution of Spain|constitution of 1978]] for the national Cortes (parliament) and also came into force in territorial assemblies (parliaments/assemblies of autonomous communities).

Under the Constitution, the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] (President of the Government) must resign if he proposes a vote of confidence to the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] (the lower chamber of the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'', Spanish parliament) and if he is defeated, or alternatively, if the Congress, on its own initiative, censures the government.  However, when a censure motion is introduced, a prospective replacement candidate for Prime Minister must be nominated at the same time. If the censure motion carries, the replacement candidate is deemed to have the confidence of the Congress of Deputies and thus automatically ascends as Prime Minister.

As with the German Basic Law, the term "constructive vote of no confidence" does not actually appear in the Spanish constitution. The relevant provisions are as follows:

:'''Article 113'''

1. The Congress of Deputies may require political responsibility from the Government by adopting a motion of censure (no confidence) by overall (absolute) majority of its Members.

2. The motion of censure (no confidence) must be proposed by at least one tenth of the Members of Congress of Deputies and shall include a candidate for the office of the Presidency of the Government.

3. The motion of censure (no confidence) may not be voted until five days after it has been submitted. 
During the first two days of this period, alternative motions may be submitted.

4. If the motion of censure (no confidence) is not adopted by the Congress of Deputies, its signatories may not submit another during the same period of sessions.

:'''Article 114'''

1. If the Congress of Deputies withholds its confidence from the Government, the latter shall submit its resignation to the King, whereafter the President of the Government shall be nominated in accordance with the provisions of Article 99.

2. If the Congress of Deputies adopts a motion of censure (no confidence), the Government shall present its resignation to the King and the candidate included in it shall be understood to have the confidence of the Chamber for the purposes provided in section 99. The King shall appoint him President of the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La Constitución en inglés|url = http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/constitucion/Pages/ConstitucionIngles.aspx|website = www.tribunalconstitucional.es|accessdate = 2015-09-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120117063355/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/constitucion/Pages/ConstitucionIngles.aspx|archivedate = 2012-01-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of the 1978 Constitution, there have been four attempted constructive votes of no confidence. The first successful vote came on 1 June 2018, when [[Mariano Rajoy]] was [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|voted out]] in favour of [[Pedro Sánchez (Spanish politician)|Pedro Sánchez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2018/06/01/actualidad/1527837969_067262.html|title=Pedro Sánchez, presidente del Gobierno tras ganar la moción de censura a Rajoy|last=Alberola|first=Miquel|date=2018-06-01|work=EL PAÍS|access-date=2018-06-01|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hungary==
{{see also|Politics of Hungary}}
The [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Hungary|National Assembly]] could  not remove the [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] unless a prospective successor was nominated at the same time. 

[[s:Constitution of the Republic of Hungary (1989)#Article 39/A.|Article 39A (1) of the constitution]] provided that:

:A motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister may be initiated by a written petition, which includes the nomination for a candidate for the office of Prime Minister, by no less than one-fifth of the Members of the National Assembly. A motion of no-confidence in the Prime Minister is considered a motion of no-confidence in the Government as well. Should, on the basis of this motion, the majority of the Members of the National Assembly withdraw their confidence, then the candidate nominated for Prime Minister in the motion shall be considered to have been elected.

Since 2012 new constitution named Fundamental Law has been in force and it has same regulation of the [[motion of no confidence]].

===Use===
In March 2009 the prime minister, [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]], announced he would hand over his position to a politician with a higher support of the parties of the Hungarian parliament. The [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) opposed most candidates for the post proposed by the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP), but on 30 March 2009, [[Gordon Bajnai]] managed to get the backing of both parties. A constructive motion of no confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány took place on 14 April. Bajnai became Prime Minister.

===Fundamental Law of Hungary===
Current '''Fundamental Law of [[Hungary]]''' (new [[Constitution of Hungary]] adopted in 2011) has similar provisions that allow only '''constructive vote of no confidence''' by the absolute majority of the [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly]] (parliament) members.

:'''Article 21'''

(1) One-fifth of the Members of the National Assembly may, together with the designation of a candidate for the office of Prime Minister, submit a written motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister.

(2) If the National Assembly supports the motion of no-confidence, it thereby expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister and simultaneously elects the person proposed for the office of Prime Minister in the motion of no-confidence. For such decision of the National Assembly, the votes of more than half of the Members of the National Assembly shall be required.

(3) The Prime Minister may put forward a confidence vote. The National Assembly expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister if more than half of the Members of the National Assembly do not support the Prime Minister in the confidence vote proposed by the Prime Minister.

(4) The Prime Minister may propose that the vote on a proposal submitted by the Government be simultaneously a confidence vote. The National Assembly expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister if it does not support the proposal submitted by the Government.

(5) The National Assembly shall decide on the question of confidence after the third day, but no later than eight days following the submission of the motion of no-confidence or of the Prime Minister’s motion pursuant to Paragraphs (3) or (4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The New Fundamental Law of Hungary|url = http://www.kormany.hu/en/news/the-new-fundamental-law-of-hungary|website = Government|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lesotho==
{{see also|Politics of Lesotho}}
Subsection (8) of section 87 of the [[Constitution of Lesotho]] stipulates that a motion of no confidence in the [[Prime Minister of Lesotho]] is of no effect unless the [[National Assembly of Lesotho|National Assembly]] nominates one of its members to be appointed prime minister in place of the incumbent:

:A resolution of no confidence in the Government of Lesotho shall not be effective for the purposes of subsections (5)(a) and (7)(e) unless it proposes the name of a member of the National Assembly for the King to appoint in the place of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.go.th/parcy/sapa_db/cons_doc/constitutions/data/Lesotho/Lesotho.pdf ''The Constitution of Lesotho''].

{{see also|Politics of Israel}}
The constructive vote of no confidence has been in place since the direct election of the [[Prime Minister of Israel]]  was abolished in 2001. By a vote of no confidence the [[Knesset]]
(parliament) did not elect new prime minister but only proposed a ''[[formateur]]'': a presumptive nominee charged with seeking to form a new government. The candidate proposed then might or might not secure a positive vote of confidence before becoming prime minister. The system, therefore, did not guarantee continuity in the same way as the constructive vote of no confidence was used in Germany and elsewhere. Amendment No. I of the [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law of Government 2001]] removed the ''formateur'', switching to a conventional constructive vote of no confidence. The [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law of Government 2001]] provides in Section 28 (b):

:An expression of no confidence in the Government shall be done by means of a resolution of the Knesset, adopted by the majority of its Members to express confidence in another Government that announced basic guidelines of its policy, its make-up and the distribution of functions among Ministers, as stated in article 13 (d). The new Government shall be established once the Knesset has expressed confidence in it, and from that time the Ministers shall go into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Basic Law: The Government (2001)|url = http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2001/Pages/Basic%20Law-%20The%20Government%20-2001-.aspx|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
{{see also|Politics of Poland}}
The [[Constitution of Poland]] (1997) states that the ''[[Sejm]]'' (lower chamber of the [[National Assembly]]) may remove the [[Council of Ministers]] (cabinet) only by a resolution 
(adopted by absolute majority of the ''[[Sejm]]'' members), which specifies the name of the new [[Prime Minister]] (President of the Council of Ministers).
:'''Article 158'''

The Sejm shall pass a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers by a majority of votes of the statutory number of Deputies, on a motion moved by at least 46 Deputies and that shall specify the name of a candidate for Prime Minister. If such a resolution has been passed by the Sejm, the President of the Republic shall accept the resignation of the Council of Ministers and appoint a new Prime Minister as chosen by the Sejm, and, on his application, the other members of the Council of Ministers and accept their oath of office.

A motion to pass a resolution referred to in para. 1 above, may be put to a vote no sooner than 7 days after it has been submitted. A subsequent motion of a like kind may be submitted no sooner than after the end of 3 months from the day the previous motion was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Constitution of the Republic of Poland|url = http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm|website = www.sejm.gov.pl|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albania==
{{see also|Politics of Albania}}
The [[Constitution of Albania]] (1998 as amended in 2008 and 2012) stipulates also that only '''constructive vote of no confidence''' may be adopted by the absolute majority of the [[unicameral]] [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] (parliament) deputies.

:'''Article 104''' [Motion of confidence]

1. The Prime Minister has the right to submit to the Assembly a motion of confidence in the Council of Ministers. If the motion of confidence is voted by fewer than half of all the members of the Assembly, within 48 hours from the voting on the motion, the Prime Minister asks the President of the Republic to dissolve the Assembly.

2. The President dissolves the Assembly within 10 days from receipt of the request. A request for a motion of confidence may not be submitted during the period when a motion of no confidence according to article 105 is being examined.

3. The motion may not be voted on unless three days have passed from its submission.

:'''Article 105''' [Motion of no confidence]

1. One fifth of the deputies have the right to submit for voting in the Assembly a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister in office, proposing a new Prime Minister.

2. The Assembly may vote a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister only by electing a new Prime Minister with the votes of more than half of all its members.

3. The President of the Republic decrees the discharge of the Prime Minister in office and the appointment of the elected Prime Minister no later than 10 days from the voting on the motion in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Constitutions - Legislationline|url = http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/constitutions|website = www.legislationline.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slovenia==
{{see also|Politics of Slovenia}}
According to the [[Constitution of Slovenia]] (1991 as amended in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2013) the [[National Assembly]] (''[[Državni zbor]]'', lower chamber of the Slovenian parliament) may pass a [[motion of no confidence]] in the [[Government]] only by '''constructive vote of no confidence'''.

:'''Article 116''' [Vote of no confidence]

The National Assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the Government only by electing a new President of the Government on the proposal of at least ten deputies and by a majority vote of all deputies. The incumbent President of the Government is thereby dismissed, but together with his ministers he must continue to perform his regular duties until the swearing in of a new Government.

No less than forty-eight hours must elapse between the lodging of a proposal to elect a new President of the Government and the vote itself, unless the National Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds majority vote of all deputies, or if the country is at war or in a state of emergency.

Where the President of the Government has been elected on the basis of the fourth paragraph of Article 111, a vote of no confidence is expressed in him if on the proposal of at least ten deputies, the National Assembly elects a new President of the Government by a majority of votes cast.

:'''Article 117''' [Vote of confidence]

The President of the Government may require a vote of confidence in the Government. If the Government does not receive the support of a majority vote of all deputies, within thirty days the National Assembly must elect a new President of the Government or in a new vote express its confidence in the incumbent President of the Government, or failing this, the President of the Republic dissolves the National Assembly and calls new elections. The President of the Government may tie the issue of confidence to the adoption of a law or to some other decision in the National Assembly. If such decision is not adopted, it is deemed that a vote of no confidence in the Government has been passed.

No less than forty-eight hours must elapse between the requirement of a vote of confidence and the vote itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Constitution » us-rs.si|url = http://www.us-rs.si/en/about-the-court/legal-basis/|website = www.us-rs.si|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
{{see also|Politics of Belgium}}
The [[Kingdom of Belgium]] adopted '''constructive vote of no confidence''' in the [[Constitution of Belgium]] (1994 coordinated text) article considering the [[dissolution of parliament]].

:'''Article 46'''  [Reasons for Dissolution]

(1) The King has only the right to dissolve the Chamber of Representatives if the latter, with the absolute majority of its members:

1) either rejects a motion of confidence in the federal Government and does not propose to the King, within three days from the day of the rejection of the motion, the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister;

2) or adopts a motion of disapproval (no confidence) with regard to the federal Government and does not simultaneously propose to the King the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister.

(2) The motions of confidence and disapproval can only be voted on after a delay of forty-eight hours after the introduction of the motion.

(3) Moreover, the King may, in the event of the resignation of the federal Government, dissolve the Chamber of Representatives after having received its agreement expressed by the absolute majority of its members.

(4) The dissolution of the Chamber of Representatives entails the dissolution of the Senate.

(5) The act of dissolution involves the convoking of the electorate within forty days and of the Chambers within two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Belgium: The Belgian Constitution|url = http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11637|website = www.wipo.int|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Westminster systems==
{{see also|Westminster system}}
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
In partisan [[Westminster system]]s, a constructive vote of no confidence is normally not required.  A prime minister faced with a vote of no confidence must either resign immediately or request a [[dissolution of parliament]] and fresh elections.  This system is normally stable because strong political parties in the Westminster system ensure a very small number of viable candidates to replace a prime minister, and also ensures frequent and stable [[majority government]]s.

However, this was not always the case historically, especially in Westminster systems without clearly defined political parties. In such circumstances, it was often the case that the sitting prime minister would be unpopular with parliamentarians but also might not have a viable successor who could have a better command of the parliament. In such cases, it was informally expected that parliament refrain from a vote of no confidence unless there was a reasonably obvious successor, in which case the prime minister would usually be expected to resign without recourse to fresh elections.

On the other hand, if a prime minister in a nonpartisan Westminster system sustained a vote of no confidence in spite of the lack of an obviously viable successor then depending on the circumstances he might have up to two alternatives to resignation: call fresh elections or attempt to continue governing in spite of the non-confidence vote.{{Where|date=July 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">{{Forms of government}}

A '''corporate republic''' is a theoretical [[form of government]] run primarily [[Private governance|like a business]], involving a [[board of directors]] and [[corporate title|executives]], in which all aspects of society are privatized by a single, or small groups of companies. The ultimate goal of this state is to increase the wealth of its shareholders, and the government acknowledges its status as a corporation. [[Utility|Utilities]], including [[hospital]]s, [[school]]s, the [[military]], and the [[Police|police force]], would be [[Privatization|privatized]]. The [[social welfare]] function carried out by the state is instead carried out by corporations in the form of pensions and benefits to employees. 

Corporate republics do not exist officially in the [[modern history]]. Historical states, such as post-classical [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] and the [[East India Company]], might be said to have been governed as corporate republics. Political scientists have also considered [[state socialism|state socialist]] nations (criticised as [[state capitalism|state capitalist]])  to be forms of corporate republics, with the state assuming full control of all economic and political life and establishing a monopoly on everything within national boundaries - effectively making the state itself equatable to a giant corporation.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Corporate republics are used in works of [[science fiction]] or [[political criticism|political commentary]] as a warning of the perceived dangers of  [[capitalism]]. In such works, they usually arise when one or more vastly powerful corporations depose a government either over an extended time period via [[regulatory capture]] or swiftly in a [[coup d'état]].

== Examples ==
The Imperial [[Corporatocracy#Historical corporatocracies|Trading Companies]] such as the various [[East India Company (disambiguation)|East India Companies]] should possibly be considered corporate states, being semi-sovereign with the power to wage war and establish colonies. [[Singapore]] has often been presented as a nation which exhibits many characteristics of a corporate republic today, especially with regard to its [[Politics of Singapore#Political background|hybrid governmental model]], status as a [[financial centre]] and as a prominent [[List of world's busiest transshipment ports|international]] [[Port#Port of call|port of call]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

*In the turn-based strategy game ''[[Civilization: Call to Power]]'', a corporate republic is one of the futuristic [[government]] types available in the Genetic Age.
*[[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series|Shinra]]: one of the antagonists in the [[role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' could be considered an example of a corporate republic due to its encompassing scope and massive power in planet affairs.
*[[Max Barry]]'s 2003 novel ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' portrays a world in which everything but the courts, police and military functions of government have been privatized, as has actually been proposed by [[minarchist]] [[libertarian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-349-11762-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The Texas '''Defence of Marriage Act''' is an act that specifies that US State of [[Texas]] does not recognise [[same-sex marriage]] or [[civil union]].

The statute was enacted in 2003, it made void in Texas any same-sex marriage or civil union.&lt;ref name="Texas Family Code sec. 6.204"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.6.htm#6.204 |title=Texas Family Code sec. 6.204 |publisher=Statutes.legis.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statute also prohibits the state or any agency or political subdivision of the state from giving effect to same-sex marriages or civil unions performed in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.6.htm#6.204 |title=Texas Family Code sec. 6.204(c) |publisher=Statutes.legis.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was signed by Governor [[Rick Perry]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://governor.state.tx.us/priorities/families/stronger_families/defense_of_marriage_act/ Texas Governor's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently [[Texas Proposition 2 (2005)]] wrote similar restrictions into the state constitution.

Early appeals based on the unconstitutionality of the restrictions have been lost, or lost on appeal.

On 26 February 2014 San Antonio-based Judge [[Orlando Luis Garcia|Orlando Garcia]] struck down the Texas state ban on same sex marriage stating that the "current prohibition has no legitimate governmental purpose."  A stay has been granted awaiting appeal.

[[File:Dyab Abou Jahjah.jpg|thumb|Dyab Abou Jahjah in 2008.]]
'''Dyab Abou Jahjah''' ({{lang-ar|دياب أبو جهجه}}, born 24 June 1971 in [[Hanine|Hanin]], [[Lebanon]]) is an [[Arab]] political activist and writer who was active in Europe between 2001 and 2007. He is the founder and former leader of the [[Arab European League]] (AEL), a [[Pan-Arabist]] movement that supports the interests of [[Muslim]] immigrants in Europe. Since then, Abou Jahjah took distance from identity politics and is more operating out of a non-ethnic, secular and leftist framework.

==Personal life==

He was born and grew up in southern [[Lebanon]] in [[Hanine|Hanin]], near the Lebanese-[[Israel]]i border. He gained refugee status in 1996 and became a Belgian citizen through marriage to a Belgian woman, from whom he much later divorced. He is now married to a Belgian Muslim woman, Nabila Boujdaine of Moroccan origin, who was also on the electoral lists for his MDP party in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180517192607/http://verkiezingen2004.belgium.be/nl/vla/preferred/preferred_e105_p2192.html 2004 elections]&lt;/ref&gt; N. Boujdaine is the sister of Saida from the book ''Saida'', written by ''De Standaard'' journalist, Tom Naegels&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.demorgen.be/plus/saida-boujdaine-vertelde-haar-levensverhaal-aan-schrijver-tom-naegels-b-1412181578459/ The book Saida from Tom Naegels]&lt;/ref&gt; and is the partner in a new organisation, Safe Have Aid,  established by Dyab Abou Jahjah and his brother&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slideshare.net/thierrydebels/abou-jahjah-actief-in-nieuwe-belgische-organisatie Save Haven Aid]&lt;/ref&gt;. He holds a [[Masters degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[Université catholique de Louvain]].

Abou Jahjah has written several books, among them an [[autobiography]] entitled "Between Two Worlds - the Roots of a Freedom Fight" that sold 7,000 copies in Belgium and the Netherlands. He was also the subject of two political biographies, one written by [[Mohammed Benzakour]]&lt;ref&gt;Abou Jahjah, nieuwlichter of oplichter?&lt;/ref&gt; and the other by Maroun Labaki, and a political analysis book written by the Belgian communist writer [[Ludo De Witte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboujahjah.org/books.html|title=Books|publisher=aboujahjah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Belgium===
In 1991, at the age of 19, Abou Jahjah left Lebanon: "I wanted to go abroad like a lot of Lebanese young people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/world/the-saturday-profile-an-outspoken-arab-in-europe-demon-or-hero.html?pagewanted=2%7ctitle=An%20Outspoken%20Arab%20in%20Europe:%20Demon%20or%20Hero?%7clast=Simons%7cfirst=Marlise%7cdate=1%20March%202003%7cwork=New%20York%20Times%7caccessdate=2009-03-27isearch.avg.com/tab?cid={4B48FBA9-7CCC-410C-852F-C796112A1951}&amp;mid=46959696aae447d0a55bc9e043cf1e69-115bfc5a2da0591dff3a31a668bf5e49e1a09944&amp;lang=en&amp;ds=AVG&amp;pr=fr&amp;d=2013-01-24%2012:24:11&amp;v=14.0.0.14&amp;pid=avg&amp;sg=&amp;sap=nt | work=The New York Times | first=Marlise | last=Simons | title=THE SATURDAY PROFILE; An Outspoken Arab in Europe: Demon or Hero? | date=2003-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abou Jahjah studied at [[Université catholique de Louvain]] (UCL) in Louvain la Neuve and obtained a master's degree in  political science and International relations. After several odd jobs during his study time, including factory work and construction labour, he became the director of vzw Welkom, the Immigrant working body for the Belgian ABVV trade Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-europe_islam/article_1908.jsp|title=Everyone is afraid: the world according to Abou Jahjah|work=openDemocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==

Abou Jahjah is a Social democrat and moderate Muslim, although he later revealed that he is rather a Muslim by culture and agnostic on faith.&lt;ref name="standaardboekhandel.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaardboekhandel.be/seo/nl/boeken/boeken_geschiedenis_hedendaagsetijd/9789085420965/Dyab+Abou+Jahjah/Dagboek+Beiroet-Brussel%7ctitle=Dagboek+Beiroet-Brussel%7cwork=standaardboekhandel|title=Dagboek Beiroet-Brussel|publisher=standaardboekhandel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an opponent of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].  He wants immigrants to be treated as full citizens who can keep their own [[culture]], rather than being treated as guests.  He was compared to the American activist [[Malcolm X]], also a Muslim, who opposed assimilation and the [[melting pot]] model of [[Racial integration|integration]].  He sees the integration of [[Armenians]] in Lebanon as the ideal model. He has said that, "America's race laws are more advanced than here. I have relatives in Detroit and they are Arab-Americans but they feel American. I don't feel European. Europe needs to make its concept of citizenship inclusive to all cultures and religions.

===Arab European League===

In 2000 Abou Jahjah founded the [[Arab European League]] in [[Antwerp]], a city with a large Muslim population. In the 2003 election the Arab European League partnered with the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] to form the [[RESIST (electoral list)]], which failed to win any seats and soon dissolved.&lt;ref name="WittePoliticalHistory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witte|first1=Els|title=Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards|date=2009|isbn=9054875178|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verkiezingen2003.belgium.be/electionshome/nl/result/senate/table_top.html|title=Senaat - Resultaat der lijsten -  Het Rijk|work=belgium.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2004 he started the MDP, but this party didn't obtain any elected participants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180517192607/http://verkiezingen2004.belgium.be/nl/vla/preferred/preferred_e105_p2192.html elections 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2006 Abou Jahjah announced that he will no longer be leading the AEL nor holding a leadership position.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Sabra and Shatila===

In 2001, Abou Jahjah founded the Sabra and Shatila committee, which brought a lawsuit against former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] for his alleged role in the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] committed, in adjacent refugee camps, during the [[Lebanese Civil War|Israel-Lebanon war]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/542/fo2.htm|title=Against the gray|last=Howeidy|first=Amira|date=July 12–18, 2001|work=Al-Ahram|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105201154/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/542/fo2.htm|archive-date=November 5, 2014|dead-url=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===9/11===

He said of Arab reaction to the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 terrorist attacks]] that "Most of us ... felt that day something that can not be described as joy, or as happiness, but rather as that sweet revenge feeling. We all had – except that small minority- a "what goes around comes around’" attitude", but he continued that "Now, almost two months after the eleventh of September, we see things clear(er). It is terrible how criminals can cause by their acts the misery for so many people, people of their own kind and people of their alleged enemy. How violence will breed violence that will breed more violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamonitors.net/dyababoujahjah1.html|title=Our Collateral damage, and theirs!|last=Abou Jahjah|first=Dyab|date=November 2001|work=Media Monitors Network|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative attitudes towards homosexuals===
In his own column in the Belgian daily ''De Standaard'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/1425322007679944/photos/pcb.1759563540922454/1759563194255822/?type=3&amp;theater |title= Onruststoker Abou Jahjah prijst tijdens... - Homo geweld en Justitie : Kroniek van een aangekondigd falen |publisher= [[Facebook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2018}} he stated "We (Belgians with Arab roots) are predominantly negatively disposed towards homosexuals. This isn't because we're immigrants, but rather because we're men. The idea that another man could desire us sexually, is for most heterosexual men a nightmare that can render them aggressive."

===Means to an end===
Abou Jahjah considers democracy a strong means to an end. Sharia would be instated after a democratic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1781499/2003/03/08/AEL-wil-sharia-via-democratie-invoeren.dhtml |title= AEL wil Sharia via democratie invoeren |work= trouw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, his messages are altogether mixed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2004/06/14/panther/|title=The Arabian Panther|first=Abigail R.|last=Esman|publisher=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jahjah suggested in a televised debate that a similar attack was likely in the Netherlands. "It's logical," he said. "You make war with us, we make war with you."

==Controversies==

===Arrest===

Abou Jahjah was arrested and detained for several days in 2002 after he allegedly organized [[riot]]s and called for violence. The riots broke out in [[Borgerhout]], a district of Antwerp, after a 27-year-old Belgian-Moroccan was shot by his [[Flemish people|Flemish]] neighbor. He was [[acquitted]] from all charges on October 21, 2008. A police officer who was watching him the night of the riots said that Abou Jahjah is innocent and that the evidence against him was fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/wankele-bewijzen-tegen-abou-jahjah/site72-section24-article16003.html Wankele bewijzen tegen Abou Jahjah - België - nieuws - Knack.be&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425231011/http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/wankele-bewijzen-tegen-abou-jahjah/site72-section24-article16003.html |date=2008-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. Current link is dead|date=July 2016}} His arrest sparked sharp debates and dominated Belgian politics for months. He gained a lot of support among Belgian intellectuals and academics and was considered as a political prisoner. 300 personalities signed a petition demanding a more moderate approach by the government in dealing with the AEL and the issue of immigration and discrimination in the country. The case became a famous example of [[demonization]] of political activists and violation of the separation of powers. The Abou Jahjah affaire is still taught as a case study in some law schools in Belgium and the Netherlands.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. |date=July 2016}}

===Theo van Gogh===

In the Netherlands, Abou Jahjah had a row with the late film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], who was known for his opposition to Islam. After van Gogh, who was supposed to be the moderator of a debate between him and [[Boris Dittrich]], insulted Abou Jahjah by calling him "de pooier van de profeet" ("the prophet's pimp") in front of an audience of 1000 people, Abou Jahjah stormed out of the theater, with his bodyguards in tow and refused to continue considering that a moderator should be neutral and not insult the guests. His opponent that day Boris Dietrich declared his sympathy to his position and his dismay to the behavior of Van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parool.nl/nieuws/2004/MEI/10/ams2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Israel-Lebanon war===

In July 2006 he announced that he would be going to Lebanon to help in whatever way he can defending his country against the attack by Israeli forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabeuropean.org/article.php?ID=117 Move to Lebanon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928020556/http://www.arabeuropean.org/article.php?ID=117 |date=2008-09-28 }}, AEL website&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Vlaams Belang]] leader [[Filip Dewinter]] called on the Belgian government to revoke Abou Jahjah's citizenship.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

He wrote a book on the Israel-Lebanon war called "Diary Brussels Beirut".&lt;ref name="standaardboekhandel.be"/&gt;

===Return to Lebanon===
Since 2007 Abou Jahjah left Belgium and resettled in Lebanon and focused on his management career as a CEO of a small BPO company, Jana SARL in Saida. He later confirmed in 2009 on his Facebook wall that he was "glad to be out of that shit-hole now".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lalibre.be/culture/medias-tele/le-quotidien-de-standaard-ne-publiera-plus-la-chronique-du-sulfureux-abou-jahjah-5873af1ecd708a17d55ea479&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in 2009 that he called on Facebook and in Arab language on his blog: "la valise ou le cercueil" and "And resist the occupier and colonizer constantly and without hesitation, and by all means necessary and available, and the most important thing, the armed struggle – until his expulsion from our land for good and unconditionally."&lt;ref&gt;http://joodsactueel.be/2017/01/10/abou-jahjah-roept-in-het-arabisch-al-langer-op-tot-gewapend-geweld/&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued visiting Europe regularly to speak at meetings and media shows. The VRT, the Belgian-Flemish state television was even accused of sympathising with him and promoting him after it became known that the TV station paid his airplane ticket and hotel costs to attend the famous Belgian talk show Phara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsbelang.be/nieuws/8819/|title=Heilige Abou Jahjah?|author=Vlaams Belang - Nationale redactie|work=vlaamsbelang.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered an authority on issues of immigration, and the Arab world. After the Arab spring, that Abou Jahjah supports adamantly, he gained intellectual credit in the West as someone who has always defended the opinion that revolution is inevitable in the Arab world.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. |date=July 2016}} In 2008 a group of Flemish students videotaped an interview with him in which he was speaking in details about revolution in Egypt and elsewhere and expected it to happen within 5 years. Parts of the video were later shown on Belgian Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3QLFONSZlA|title=2008: Dyab Abou Jahjah over crisis Arabische regimes|date=25 February 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three young students from Arab origin in Belgium wrote that Abou Jahjah and his AEL were a chance to build a better understanding between communities, and that chance was missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/2461/Opinie/article/detail/285003/2008/05/22/Abou-Jahjah-een-gemiste-kans-voor-Vlaanderen.dhtml|title=Opinie: Abou Jahjah, een gemiste kans voor Vlaanderen  - Binnenland - De Morgen|work=De Morgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many argue today that it would have been much easier and more productive to dialogue with a person  like Abou Jahjah instead of the religious groups that appeared after he left Europe.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. |date=July 2016}} This opinion has been outed by many people including former rivals, like former prime minister Verhofstadt, the man who decreed his arrest.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. |date=July 2016}}

===Popular culture===
During the year of 2002 Abou Jahjah was the most mentioned name in the Belgian media, exceeding reference of the prime minister and the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaardboekhandel.be/seo/nl/boeken/boeken_mensmaatschappij_socialewetenschappen/9789056175276/Ludo+Witte/Wie+is+bang+voor+moslims%3F|first=Ludo |last=Witte|title=Wie is bang voor moslims?|work=standaardboekhandel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a household name in Belgium and in the Netherlands, and this was reflected in hundreds of caricatures and satires{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. He was played by the comedian {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul Groot|nl}} in the Dutch comedy show [[Kopspijkers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humortv.vara.nl/pa.321.cabaret-abu-jahjah-balkenende-beatrix.html|title=Cabaret: Abu Jahjah, Balkenende, Beatrix|work=Humor TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a main character in the best selling novel ''Los'' of writer [[Tom Naegels]] which was later filmed. ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Los (film)|nl}}'' was directed by {{Illm|Jan Verheyen (director)|lt=Jan Verheyen|nl|Jan Verheyen (filmregisseur)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Jan Verheyen Los (2008) |people = Caudron, Pepijn; De Graeve, Koen; Mouziane, Sana; Verheyen, Jan|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/7508453034}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name "Abou Jahjah" also was used as a protest slogan by Antwerp dock workers during a strike in clashes with the Police. It was also sung by supporters of football club [[RSC Anderlecht]] in its clashes with rivals [[Royal Antwerp]], as a tool to provoke the Antwerp supporters.

===Debating skills===

Abou Jahjah was called by Roderiek van Grieken of a Dutch debating institute a "perfect pure talent" in debating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benzakour.nl/materiaal/html/Art__Jahjah-Donner_Zemzem.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also as a solo speaker, Abou Jahjah drew very large crowds and could galvanize them to his causes{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. The renowned linguist Professor C. Delantsheer wrote a chapter on Abou Jahjah's rhetoric in a book published by Cambridge university in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;De Landtsheer, C. (2007). Crisis style or radical rhetoric? The speech by Dyab Abou Jahjah, leader of the Arab European League (AEL). In C. Hart, C., &amp; D. Lukes, D. (Eds.), Cognitive Linguistics and Critical Discourse Studies (pp. 57-80). Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Press&lt;/ref&gt; He had also presented a paper on the power of metaphors in the discourse of Abou Jahjah and presented it to an academical congress in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;De Landtsheer, C. (2004). Integrative complexity, metaphor power and modality in the rhetoric of Dyab Abou Jahjah, leader of the Arab European League (AEL). Paper 27th Conference ISPP, Lund, Sweden, 15–18 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Belgium==
In September 2013 Abou Jahjah returned to Belgium due to the dire security situation in Lebanon. He declared that for the time being he was choosing the security of his children over all other considerations. Upon his return, several opinion makers wrote articles welcoming him back. He declared that he will be founding a new movement that will seek to defend equal rights and social justice. From January 2014 he became a weekly columnist at the prestigious newspaper ''[[De Standaard]]''. In January 2017 ''De Standaard'' stopped his column, when Jahjah declared on the [[January 2017 Jerusalem vehicular attack]], the "liberation of Palestine 'by any means necessary' needs to take place" as calling for violence is not compatible with the policy of the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deredactie.be/permalink/1.2862527|title=De Standaard stopt met de column van Abou Jahjah|work=deredactie.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sotaliraq.com/blog/2017/01/09/belgian-newspaper-de-standaard-fires-arab-author-dyab-abou-jahjah/|title=Belgian newspaper De Standaard fires Arab author Dyab Abou Jahjah|work=Voice of Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after he was chosen as the 4th most influential Belgian of foreign origin by ''[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]]'' magazine, only preceded by then Belgian Prime Minister [[Elio Di Rupo]], [[Meyrem Almaci]] and [[Vincent Kompany]].

In British research policy, the '''Haldane principle''' is the idea that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians. It is named after [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], who in 1904 and from 1909 to 1918 chaired committees and commissions which recommended this policy.

==Overview==
The 1904 committee recommended the creation of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] which has evolved via the [[Universities Funding Council]] into the current higher education funding councils: [[Research Councils UK]], [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], [[Scottish Funding Council]] and [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]].

In 1918 Haldane's committee produced the "Haldane Report".  The report suggested that research required by government departments could be separated into that required by specific departments and that which was more general.  It recommended that departments should oversee the specific research but the general research should be under the control of autonomous [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], which would be free from political and administrative pressures that might discourage research in certain areas.  The principle of the autonomy of the research councils is now referred to as the Haldane Principle. The first research council to be created as a result of the Haldane Report was the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].

The principle has remained enshrined in British Government policy, but has been criticised and altered over the years.  In 1939 [[J.D. Bernal]] argued that social good was more important than researchers' freedom in deciding the direction of research.  [[Solly Zuckerman]] criticised it in 1971 for its artificial separation of basic and applied science, and the consequent elevation of the status of the former.

A major revision to the application of the Haldane Principle in British research funding came in the early 1970s with the Rothschild Report of 1971, and its implementation which transferred about 25% of the then Research Council funds, and the decisions on the research to be funded with them, back to government departments, a move later undone by Margaret Thatcher's government.

There is currently a debate about the extent to which the principle is still applied in practice.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39078281 BBC 24 02 2017: Minister to enshrine protection for research independence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]], which merged the research councils and the research part of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] into [[UK Research and Innovation]], enacted the Haldane principle as section 103(3): ''The “Haldane principle” is the principle that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken following an evaluation of the quality and likely impact of the proposals (such as a peer review process).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/section/103/enacted  Higher Education and Research Act 2017], legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Han chauvinism''' is a term coined by [[Mao Zedong]] on March 16, 1953, to criticize [[ethnocentrism]] among the majority [[Han (people)|Han people]] of China. In a party directive drafted for the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] titled "Criticize Han [[Chauvinism]]" ([https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-5/mswv5_25.htm text]), Chairman Mao said, "In some places the relations between nationalities are far from normal. For Communists this is an intolerable situation. We must go to the root and criticize the Han chauvinist ideas which exist to a serious degree among many Party members and cadres&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-5/mswv5_25.htm|title=Criticize Han Chauvinism|last=Tse-tung|first=Mao|date=|website=www.marxists.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared again in a 1956 speech, titled ''[[Ten Major Relationships|Ten Major Relations]]'', Mao stated that "on the relationship between the Han ethnicity and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnicities]]... we put the emphasis on opposing Han chauvinism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Li| first = Gucheng| title = A Glossary of Political Terms of The People's Republic of China | year = 1995| publisher = Chinese University Press | pages = 38–39| isbn  = 9789622016156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anti-chauvinistic idea is part of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s ''[[zhonghua minzu]]'' conception of China as a multi-ethnic [[nation]], both historically and in the present, which includes not only the Han but also 55 ethnic minorities. This is expressed in the [[constitution of the People's Republic of China]], which states that China is a "unitary [multiethnic] state created jointly by the people of all its ethnicities" and that "it is necessary to combat big [ethnic group] chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and to combat local [ethnic] national[ist] chauvinism".&lt;ref name="ghai"&gt;{{cite book| last = Ghai | first = Yash | title = Autonomy and Ethnicity: Negotiating Competing Claims in Multi-Ethnic States | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press| page = 77| isbn  = 9780521786423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRC's notions of Han chauvinism and China as a multicultural state have been subject to criticism mainly from the western media. One critical view is that the Han Chinese "are less homogeneous than official policy recognizes".&lt;ref name="ghai"/&gt; Zhonghua minzu has been criticized as an invention of the 20th century, and was adopted by the Communist Party only to criticize the failures of the rival [[Kuomintang]], which officially promoted zhonghua minzu as part of its nationalist ideology. Many policies are made to give privilege to minority ethnicity, causing grudges from the Han Chinese.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;{{cite book| last = Liu | first = Xiaoyuan | title = Recast All Under Heaven: Revolution, War, Diplomacy, and Frontier China in the 20th Century | year = 2010 | publisher = Recast All Under Heaven: Revolution, War, Diplomacy, and Frontier China in the 20th Century | pages = 115–116| isbn  = 9781441134899}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to reactions to [[affirmative action in the United States]], particularly allegations of {{Section link|Affirmative action in the United States|Reverse discrimination|nopage=y}}.

The '''Hawaii Independence Party''' is a political party that was a branch of the [[Nation of Hawaiʻi (organization)|Nation of Hawaiʻi]] organization. It broke off in 2015 when the Nation of Hawaii turned its focus towards a Hawaiian Nation rather than independence.

The Hawaii Independence Party is the only independence separatist political party from a surge of small pro-independence parties at the end of the 20th century from the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]]. 

According to the Hawaii Independence Party's platform, they support modern economics such as making Hawaii a [[bank]]ing and [[Market (economics)|trade center]] for the [[Pacific Rim]]. They also acknowledge the necessity of more efficiency for an acceptable lifestyle if Hawaii were to be self-reliant.

The [[Constitution Party (United States)|National Constitution Party]] has listed the HIP as a Hawaii affiliate in the past, but no longer does so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">'''Hegetorides''' was a  [[citizen]] of the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Thasos]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] (431-404 BC), mentioned by the 2nd-century historian [[Polyaenus]].&lt;ref&gt;Stratagems 2.33&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Lemprière|Lemprière]]'s [[Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica|''Classical Dictionary'']] claims that when Hegetorides saw that his city was besieged by Athenian forces and that there was a law declaring death to anyone who spoke of peace, he went into the [[agora]] with a rope tied around his neck. He told his fellow citizens to do whatever they wished with him, provided that they saved the city from the starvation and death that the continued war promised. The Thasians were shocked from their determination, sued for peace, and pardoned Hegetorides. 

The main classical authority on the Peloponnesian War, [[Thucydides]], does not mention Hegetorides at all, and appears to mention Thasos itself only once, in the context of [[Galepsus]], a colony of Thasos (Book V of his ''History of the Pelponnesian War''). It is possible that the story of Hegetorides originates prior to the Peloponnesian War, as Thasos revolted from the Athenian alliance around 463 BC and was attacked by Athens. Unfortunately, as respects the legitimacy of the tale, the Thasians do not appear to have sued for peace. When, in 411 BC, Thasos revolted again during the Peloponnesian War, a Spartan governor assumed power on the island, suggesting the Thasians, rather than suing for peace, prevailed over Athens.

'''Soviet historiography''' is the methodology of [[history]] studies by historians in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR). In the USSR, the study of history  was marked by restrictions imposed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). Soviet historiography is itself the subject of modern studies.

==Theoretical approaches==
George M. Enteen identifies two approaches to the study of Soviet historiography. A [[totalitarian]] approach associated with the Western analysis of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian society, controlled by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this school "thought that signs of dissent merely represented a misreading of commands from above."&lt;ref name="Enteen2002Recent"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;363&lt;/sup&gt; For Enteen the other school of writing on Soviet historiography is the social-history school which draws attention to "important initiative from historians at odds with the dominant powers in the field."&lt;ref name="Enteen2002Recent"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;363&lt;/sup&gt; Enteen is unable to decide between these different approaches based on current literature.

In Markwick's view there are a number of important post war historiographical movements, which have antecedents in the 1920s and 1930s. Surprisingly these include culturally and psychologically focused history. In the late 1920s Stalinists began limiting individualist approaches to history, culminating in the publication of Stalin and other's ''[[The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)|"Short Course" History of the Soviet Communist Party]]'' (1938).&lt;ref name="Stalin1938Short"/&gt; This crystallised the ''piatichlenka'' or five acceptable moments of history in terms of [[Vulgar Marxism|vulgar dialectical materialism]]: primitive-communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and socialism.&lt;ref name="Markwick2006Cultural"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt; Following publication of the "Short course", on 14 November 1938 the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] issued a special statement that the course and its chapter "About dialectic and historical materialism" were declared as "encyclopedia of philosophical knowledge in a field of [[Marxism-Leninism]]", in which were given "official and verified by the Central Committee interpretation of basic issues of history of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Marxism-Leninism and without allowing any other arbitrary interpretations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ogurtsov |first1=Aleksandr |author-link1= |display-authors= |author-mask= |last-author-amp= |translator-last1= |translator-first1= |translator-link1= |translator-mask1= |date= |year= |orig-year= |chapter=Подавление философии |script-chapter= |trans-chapter=Suppression of philosophy |chapter-url=http://ihst.ru/projects/sohist/ogur89.htm  |chapter-format= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |display-editors= |title=Суровая драма народа: Учёные и публицисты о природе сталинизма |script-title= |trans-title=The harsh drama of the people: Scientists and publicists about the nature of Stalinism |url= |dead-url= |format= |type= |series= |language=Russian |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location=Moscow |publisher=[[Politizdat]] |publication-date=1989 |page= |pages=512 |at= |nopp= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doi-broken-date= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |lay-summary= |lay-source= |lay-date= |quote= |name-list-format= |mode= |postscript= |ref=Огурцов }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the triumph of [[Stalinist]] history was being imposed, different modes of history began to emerge. These included BA Romanov's ''People and Morals in Ancient Rus''' (1947), a study of ''[[mentalités]]'' at the height of the [[Zhdanovshchina]]. However, it was not until the [[20th Congress of the CPSU]] that different schools of history emerged from the Stalinist freeze. Firstly, a "new direction" within Leninist materialism emerged, as an effectively loyal opposition to Stalinist dialectical materialism, secondly a social psychology of history emerged through a reading of Leninist psychology, thirdly a "culturological" tendendency emerged.&lt;ref name="Markwick2006Cultural"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;284–285&lt;/sup&gt;

Soviet-era historiography was deeply influenced by Marxism. Marxism maintains that the moving forces of history are determined by material production and the rise of different socioeconomic formations. Applying this perspective to socioeconomic formations such as slavery and feudalism is a major methodological principle of Marxist historiography. Based on this principle, historiography predicts that there will be an abolition of capitalism by a socialist revolution made by the working-class. Soviet historians believed that Marxist–Leninist theory permitted the application of categories of dialectical and historical materialism in the study of historical events.&lt;ref name="Historiography" /&gt;

Marx and Engels' ideas of the importance of class struggle in history, the destiny of the working class, and the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the revolutionary party are of major importance in Marxist methodology.&lt;ref name="Historiography" /&gt;

Marxist–Leninist historiography has several aspects. It explains the social basis of historical knowledge, determines the social functions of historical knowledge and the means by which these functions are carried out, and emphasizes the need to study concepts in connection with the social and political life of the period in which these concepts were developed.&lt;ref name="Historiography" /&gt;

It studies the theoretical and methodological features in every school of historical thought. Marxist–Leninist historiography analyzes the source-study basis of a historical work, the nature of the use of sources, and specific research methods. It analyzes problems of historical research as the most important sign of the progress and historical knowledge and as the expression of the socioeconomic and political needs of a historical period.&lt;ref name="Historiography" /&gt;

Soviet historiography has been severely criticized by scholars, chiefly—but not only—outside the Soviet Union and Russia. Its status as "scholarly" at all has been questioned, and it has often been dismissed as [[ideology]] and [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Zalejko" /&gt; [[Robert Conquest]] concluded that "All in all, unprecedented [[state terrorism|terror]] must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities. The accompanying falsifications took place, and on a barely credible scale, in every sphere. Real facts, real statistics, disappeared into the realm of fantasy. History, including the [[History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|history of the Communist Party]], or rather ''especially'' the history of the Communist Party, was rewritten. [[Unperson]]s disappeared from the official record. A new past, as well as new present, was imposed on the captive minds of the Soviet population, as was, of course, admitted when truth emerged in the late 1980s."&lt;ref name="reflections" /&gt;

That criticism stems from the fact that in the Soviet Union, science was far from independent. Since the late 1930s, Soviet historiography treated the [[party line (politics)|party line]] and reality as one and the same.&lt;ref name="Osipova" /&gt; As such, if it was a science, it was a science in service of a specific political and ideological agenda, commonly employing [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]].&lt;ref name="Markwick" /&gt; In the 1930s, historical [[archive]]s were closed and [[original research]] was severely restricted. Historians were required to pepper their works with references—appropriate or not—to Stalin and other "Marxist–Leninist classics", and to pass judgment—as prescribed by the Party—on pre-revolution historic [[Russian people|Russian]] figures.&lt;ref name="keep" /&gt; [[Nikita Khrushchev]] commented that "Historians are dangerous and capable of turning everything upside down. They have to be watched."&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt;

The state-approved history was openly subjected to [[politics]] and [[propaganda]], similar to [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|philosophy]], [[Socialist realism|art]], and [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|many fields of scientific research]].&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt; [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|The Party]] could not be proven wrong, it was infallible and reality was to conform to this line. Any non-conformist history had to be erased, and questioning of the official history was illegal.&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt;

Many works of Western historians were forbidden or [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|censored]], and many areas of history were also forbidden for research because, officially, they had never happened.&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt; For this reason, Soviet historiography remained mostly outside the international historiography of the period.&lt;ref name="Zalejko" /&gt; Translations of foreign historiography were produced (if at all) in a truncated form, accompanied by extensive censorship and "corrective" footnotes. For example, in the Russian 1976 translation of [[Basil Liddell Hart]]'s ''History of the Second World War'' [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|pre-war purges of Red Army officers]], the secret protocol to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], many details of the [[Winter War]], the [[occupation of Baltic states|occupation of the Baltic states]], the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], Allied assistance to the Soviet Union during the war, many other Western Allies' efforts, the Soviet leadership's mistakes and failures, criticism of the Soviet Union and other content were [[censorship in the Soviet Union|censored out]].&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;

The official version of Soviet history was dramatically changed after every major governmental shake-up. Previous leaders were denounced as "enemies", whereas current leaders usually became the subject of a [[personality cult]]. Textbooks were rewritten periodically, with figures—such as [[Leon Trotsky]] or [[Joseph Stalin]]—disappearing from their pages or being turned from great figures to great villains.&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suv" /&gt;

Certain regions and periods of history were made unreliable for political reasons. Entire historical events could be erased, if they did not fit the party line. For example, until 1989 the Soviet leadership and historians, unlike their Western colleagues, had denied the existence of a secret protocol to the Soviet-German [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, and as a result the Soviet approach to the study of the [[Soviet-German relations before 1941]] and the origins of [[World War II]] were remarkably flawed.&lt;ref name="jstor1" /&gt; In another example, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939]] as well as the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919–1920 were censored out or minimized in most publications, and research was suppressed, in order to enforce the policy of 'Polish-Soviet friendship'.&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt; Similarly, the enforced [[collectivisation]], the wholesale deportations or massacres of small nationalities in the [[Caucasus]] or the disappearance of the [[Crimean Tatars]] were not recognized as facts worthy of mention.&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt; Soviet historians also engaged in producing false claims and falsification of history; for example Soviet historiography falsely claimed that the [[Katyn massacre]] was carried out by Germans rather than by Soviets.&lt;ref name="ipn_eng_news_high_katyn_decision" /&gt; Yet another example is related to the case of [[Extermination of Soviet prisoners of war by Nazi Germany#Soviet reprisals against former POWs|Soviet reprisals against former Soviet POWs returning from Germany]]; some of them were treated as traitors and imprisoned in [[Gulag]]s for many years, yet that policy was denied or minimized by Soviet historians for decades and modern Western scholars have noted that "In the past, Soviet historians engaged for the most part in a [[disinformation]] campaign about the extent of the prisoner-of-war problem."&lt;ref name="MU" /&gt;

==Marxist influence==
{{details|Marxist historiography}}

The Soviet interpretation of [[Marxism]] predetermined much of the research done by historians. Research by scholars in the USSR was limited to a large extent due to this predetermination. Some Soviet historians could not offer non-Marxist theoretical explanations for their interpretation of sources. This was true even when alternate theories had a greater explanatory power in relation to a historian's reading of source material.&lt;ref name="Zalejko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt;

The Marxist theory of [[historical materialism]] identified [[means of production]] as chief determinants of the historical process. They led to the creation of [[social class]]es, and [[class struggle]] was the motor of history. The [[sociocultural evolution]] of societies was considered to progress inevitably from [[slavery]], through [[feudalism]] and [[capitalism]] to [[socialism]] and finally [[communism]]. In addition, [[Leninism]] argued that a [[vanguard party]] was required to lead the working class in the revolution that would overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism.

Soviet historiography interpreted this theory to mean that the creation of the Soviet Union was the most important turning event in human history, since the USSR was considered to be the first socialist society. Furthermore, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]—considered to be the vanguard of the working class – was given the role of permanent leading force in society, rather than a temporary revolutionary organization. As such, it became the protagonist of history, which could not be wrong. Hence the unlimited powers of the Communist Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the history itself.&lt;ref name="Satter1" /&gt; It also followed that a worldwide victory of [[communist countries]] is inevitable. All research had to be based on those assumptions and could not diverge in its findings.&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt; In 1956, [[Soviet Academy of Sciences|Soviet academician]] [[Anna Pankratova]] said that "the problems of Soviet historiography are the problems of our Communist ideology."&lt;ref name="Markwick" /&gt;

Soviet historians have also been criticized for a Marxist bias in the interpretation of other historical events, unrelated to the Soviet Union. Thus, for example, they assigned to the rebellions in the [[Roman Empire]] the characteristics of the [[social revolution]].&lt;ref name="Zalejko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferro" /&gt;

Often, the Marxist bias and propaganda demands came into conflict: hence the peasant rebellions against the early Soviet rule, such as the [[Tambov Rebellion]] of 1920–21, were simply ignored as inconvenient politically and contradicting the official interpretation of the Marxist theories.&lt;ref name="Osipova" /&gt;

[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized the Slavic roots in the foundation of the Russian state in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Oleksander |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives. In contrast, Soviet historians stated that the Slavs laid the foundations of their statehood long before the Norman/Viking raids, while the Norman/Viking invasions only served to hinder the historical development of the Slavs. They argued that [[Rus' (name)|Rus']] composition was Slavic and that Rurik and Oleg' success was rooted in their support from within the local Slavic aristocracy.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;. After the dissolution of the [[USSR]], [[Novgorod]] acknowledged its Viking history by incorporating a Viking ship into its logo.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet historians trace the origin of feudalism in Russia to the 11th century, after the founding of the Russian state. The class struggle in medieval is emphasized because of the hardships of feudal relations. For example, Soviet historians argue that uprisings in Kiev in 1068-69 was a reflection of the class struggle. There was a constant struggle between the powers of the princes and those of the feudal aristocracy, known as the boyars. In regions like Novgorod, the boyar aristocracy was able to limit the prince's power by making the office and the head of church elective.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The Mongol conquests of the 13th had significant consequences for Russia. Soviet historians emphasize the cruelty of Genghis Khan and the suffering and devastation that Russia endured. Soviet historians attribute the success of Genghis Khan to the fact that feudalism among his people had not developed, which would have involved with feudal and political strife. By contrast, the peoples opposed to the Mongols were in a mature state of feudalism and the political disunity that went with it. Soviet historians conclude that the Mongol domination had disastrous consequences for Russia's historical progress and development. It is also argued that by bearing the full weight of the Mongolian invasions, Russia helped to save Western Europe from outside domination.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The struggle against foreign domination and the heroism of its participants is a recurring theme in Soviet historiography. Soviet historians have an upbeat assessment of Alexander Nevsky, characterized as one of the greatest military leaders of his time for defeating the German knights' invasions of Russia in the 13th century. Much importance is attached to the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), which marked the beginning of the end of the Mongol domination of Russia. Dmitry Donskoi for his leadership of the anti-Mongol struggle is credited for being an outstanding military commander and contributing significantly to the unity of the Russian lands.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==Reliability of statistical data==

{{quote|"The deceptive figure". This is the translation of a widely cited article (''"Lukavaia Tsifra"'') by journalist [[Vasilii Seliunin]] and economist [[Grigorii Khanin]], in Novyi Mir, February 1987, #2: 181-202&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;}}

Various [[Sovietologist]]s have raised the issue of the quality (accuracy and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]]) of data published in the Soviet Union and used in historical research.&lt;ref name="reflections" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eberstadt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; The Marxist theoreticians of the Party regarded statistics as a [[social science]]; hence many applications of statistical mathematics were curtailed, particularly during the Stalin era.&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt; Under [[central planning]], nothing could occur by accident.&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt; The [[law of large numbers]] or the idea of [[standard deviation|random deviation]] were decried as "false theories".&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt; Statistical journals were closed; world-renowned statisticians like [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] or [[Eugen Slutsky]] abandoned statistical research.&lt;ref name="Salsburg"/&gt;

As with all Soviet historiography, the reliability of Soviet statistical data varied from period to period.&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; The first revolutionary decade and the period of Stalin's dictatorship both appear highly problematic with regard to statistical reliability; very few statistical data were published from 1936 to 1956.&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; Notably, the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 census]]' organizers were executed and results destroyed altogether, and no further censuses were conducted until 1959.&lt;ref name=Volkov&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/knigi/polka/gold_fund08.html A.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Volkov ''Census of 1937 Facts and Fictions''] originally published in Перепись населения СССР 1937 года. История и материалы/Экспресс-информация. Серия "История статистики". Выпуск 3-5 (часть II). М., 1990/ с. 6-63&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of data improved after 1956 when some missing data was published and Soviet experts themselves published some adjusted data for the Stalin era;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; however the quality of documentation has deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;

Some researchers say that on occasion the Soviet authorities may have completely "invented" statistical data potentially useful in historical research (such as economic data invented to prove the successes of the Soviet industrialization, or some published numbers of [[Gulag]] prisoners and terror victims - as Conquest claims).&lt;ref name="reflections"/&gt; Data was falsified both during collection - by local authorities who would be judged by the central authorities based on whether their figures reflected the [[central economy]] prescriptions - and by internal propaganda, with its goal of portraying the Soviet state in the most positive light to its own citizens.&lt;ref name="Eberstadt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; Nonetheless the policy of not publishing - or simply not collecting - data that was deemed unsuitable for various reasons was much more common than simple falsification; hence the many gaps in Soviet statistical data.&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt; Inadequate or missing documentation for much of Soviet statistical data is also a significant problem.&lt;ref name="Eberstadt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt;

==Credibility==
Not all areas of Soviet historiography were equally affected by the ideological demands of the government; additionally, the intensity of these demands varied over time.&lt;ref name="Dronin"/&gt; The impact of ideological demands also varied based on the field of history. The areas most affected by ideological demands were 19th and 20th century history, especially Russian and Soviet history.&lt;ref name="A History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-First Century, Third Edition"/&gt; Part of the Soviet historiography was affected by extreme ideological bias, and potentially compromised by the deliberate distortions and omissions. Yet part of Soviet historiography produced a large body of significant scholarship which continues to be used in the modern research.&lt;ref name="Heer"/&gt;

==Life experiences of individual Soviet historians==
[[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] (1862–1932) was held in the highest regard as a historian in the Soviet Union and was elected to the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] in 1929. He emphasized [[Marxist]] theory, downplaying the role of personality in favour of [[economics]] as the driving force of history. However, posthumously{{When|date=September 2009}}, Pokrovsky was accused of "vulgar sociologism", and his books were banned. After Stalin's death, and the subsequent renouncement of his policies during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], Pokrovsky's work regained some influence.

When Burdzhalov, then the deputy editor of the foremost Soviet journal on history, in spring of 1956 published a bold article examining the rôle of Bolsheviks in 1917 and demonstrated that Stalin had been an ally of Kamenev — who had been executed as a traitor in 1936 — and that Lenin had been a close associate of Zinoviev — who had been executed as a traitor in 1936 —, Burdzhalov was moved to an uninfluential post.

==Underground historiography==
The [[Brezhnev Era]] was the time of ''[[samizdat]]'' (circulating unofficial manuscripts within the USSR) and ''tamizdat'' (illegal publication of work abroad). The three most prominent Soviet dissidents of that era were [[Alexandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Roy Medvedev]].&lt;ref name="dissidents"/&gt; Of the ''tamizdat'' authors, Solzhenitsyn was the most famous, publishing ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' in the West in 1973. Medvedev's ''Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism'' was published in 1971 in the West.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; Neither could publish in the Soviet Union until the advent of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]].

==Influence of Soviet historiography in modern Russia==
The 2006 Russian book, ''A Modern History of Russia: 1945-2006: A Manual for History Teachers''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071902707.html New Manuals Push A Putin's-Eye View In Russian Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; has received significant attention as it was publicly endorsed by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Putin said that "we can't allow anyone to impose a sense of guilt on us," and that the new manual helps present a more balanced view of Russian history than that promoted by the West. The book says that repressions, carried out by Stalin and others, were "a necessary evil in response to a cold war started by America against the Soviet Union." It cites a recent opinion poll in Russia that gave Stalin an approval rating of 47%, and states that "The Soviet Union was not a democracy, but it was an example for millions of people around the world of the best and fairest society."

''[[The Economist]]'' contends that the book is inspired by Soviet historiography in its treatment of the [[Cold War]], as it claims that the Cold War was started by the [[United States]], that the Soviet Union was acting in self-defense, and that the USSR did not lose the Cold War but rather voluntarily ended it. According to ''The Economist'', "rabid anti-Westernism is the leitmotif of [the book's] ideology."&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; However, this single book is only one out of many approved by the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science]], many promoting opposite views.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2009 president [[Dmitri Medvedev]] created the [[Historical Truth Commission]], against the perceived anti-Soviet and anti-Russian slander. Officially, the Commission's mission is to "defend Russia against falsifiers of history and those who would deny Soviet contribution to the victory in [[World War II]]".&lt;ref name="kremlin"/&gt; Also, [[United Russia]] has proposed a draft law, that would mandate jail terms of three to five years "for anyone in the former Soviet Union convicted of rehabilitating Nazism".&lt;ref name="Medvedev Creates History Commission"/&gt;

A '''holiday tree''' is a term generally used to describe a tree associated with the [[Christmas and holiday season]]. It became notable as a term used to refer to public tree lighting ceremonies in the United States, where the term [[Christmas tree]] was avoided due to concerns about [[separation of church and state]] and/or political correctness.

'''Human Rights Defense Center''' is a non-profit [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] organization that campaigns on behalf of prisoner rights across the [[United States|United States of America]].  The organization advocates for the rights of people in "state and federal prisons, local jails, immigration detention centers, civil commitment facilities, [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] jails, juvenile facilities and military prisons."&lt;ref name="humanrightsdefensecenter.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/|title=Home        - Human Rights Defense Center|work=humanrightsdefensecenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major focuses of the Human Rights Defense Center (HRDC) include work on free speech issues, government transparency and accountability, as well as opposition to the [[Prison-industrial complex|private prison industry]].

HRDC is also the parent organization of [[Prison Legal News]] (PLN), a monthly publication that covers litigation and other criminal justice news, which is the nation's longest running newspaper produced by and for prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/human-rights-publication-prison-legal-news-founded-by-a-convicted-murderer-now-based-in-lake-worth-6460811|title=Human Rights Publication Prison Legal News, Founded by a Convicted Murderer, Now Based in Lake Worth|last=Ant|first=Fire|date=2013-12-26|website=Broward Palm Beach New Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Prison Legal News|PLN]], HRDC also publishes and offers books to prisoners pertaining to legal and self-help resources designed to help "prisoners navigate through the legal system"&lt;ref name="Langford"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/prison-magazine-is-most-censored-in-the-us/|title=Prison Magazine is Most Censored in the US|last=Langford|first=Cameron|date=2016-07-12|website=Courthouse News Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is currently running a number of campaigns, including but not limited to its Campaign for Prison Phone Justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonphonejustice.org/|title=Rates and Kickbacks        - Prison Phone Justice|work=prisonphonejustice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Stop Prison Profiteering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://actionnetwork.org/groups/stop-prison-profiteering|title=Stop Prison Profiteering: Stop Prison Profiteering|work=actionnetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign, and the Prison Ecology Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/environment/environmental-justice-for-prisoners|title=Environmental Justice for Prisoners|last=Kirchner|first=Lauren|date=2015-07-30|website=Pacific Standard Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of HRDC's funding is through revenue earned from its publishing and litigation, as well as book sales, but the organization also receives individual donations as well as crowdfunding efforts on its behalf.&lt;ref name="humanrightsdefensecenter.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/media/annualreports/HRDC%202015%20Annual%20Report%20FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |title=HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE CENTER 2015 ANNUAL REPORT |website=Humanrightsdefensecenter.org |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==
HRDC's founder, president,and executive director is Paul Wright, who is also the founding editor of ''[[Prison Legal News]].'' In 2003 Wright, a former military policeman and a graduate of the University of Maryland, was released from prison in Washington State after having served 17 years.&lt;ref name="humanrightsdefensecenter.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/about/staff/|title=American Bar Association Journal|last=Hudson JR.|first=David L.|date=2016-10-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|work=www.abajournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright cofounded the monthly newsletter ''Prison Legal News'' together with Ed Mead in 1990 while till incarcerated.&lt;ref name="humanrightsdefensecenter.org2"/&gt; He first mailed it to friends, then began to distribute it more widely. During that period Wright also "successfully litigated a wide variety of censorship and public records cases against prison systems around the country…both as a plaintiff and on behalf of [[Prison Legal News|PLN]]."&lt;ref name="humanrightsdefensecenter.org2"/&gt;

== Funding ==
The HRDC is mainly funded through revenue generated from its publishing and litigation activities, largely through PLN subscriptions as well as advertising revenue that amounts to more that $165,000 annually.&lt;ref name="Langford"/&gt;  The organization holds fundraisers and is also supported by the following foundation funders: Community Foundation of Massachusetts; Funding Exchange; Jewish Community Fund; Open Society Foundation; Proteus Fund; Sonya Staff Foundation; Irvin Stern Foundation; Youth Emergency Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/about/funders/|title=Funders        - Human Rights Defense Center|work=humanrightsdefensecenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Litigation ==
The main focus of HRDC's litigation and activism is the condition of the incarcerated, and the incarceration's lasting effect on their lives.  The cases brought by HRDC often involve [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issues regarding prisons' attempt at censorship of ''Prison Legal News'' and other literature published or produced by [[Prison Legal News|PLN]].

This however is not the limit of their activities. The organization has and continues to litigate plenty of cases involving "individual prisoners who suffer death by serious injury as a result unconstitutional prison or jail policies." &lt;ref name="humanrightsdefensecenter.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/action/litigation/|title=Litigation - Human Rights Defense Center|work=humanrightsdefensecenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also file class action lawsuits aimed at stopping the financial exploitation of prisoners' and their families. Examples of cases filed:
* After learning about sporadic censorship of Prison Legal News in the U.S Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX), HRDC filed a suit on behalf of PLN against the Federal Bureau of Prisons in October 2015. The Bureau of Prisons (Bop) had refused to deliver PLN's monthly issue due to it containing information "related to legal proceedings involving ADX prisoners and staff" but PLN argued that the "refusal to deliver served no legitimate penological interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15010|title=Case Profile: Prison Legal News v. Federal Bureau of Prisons|last=Kenner|first=Amanda|date=2017-01-22|website=Clearing House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit resulted with the government amending its policies regarding the distribution of PLN's monthly newsletter. See: ''Prison Legal News'' v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, Case No. 15-cv-2184.
* In October 2015, Prison Legal News filed a lawsuit against the [[Knox County, Tennessee]] Sheriff for adopting a 'postcards only' mail policy; by this policy the department banned all mail sent by PLN to prisoners. PLN claimed the Sheriffs Office "refused to deliver all [PLN] publications and enveloped mail" from "November 2014 to October 6. 2015" and therefore the prisoners were denied access to PLN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15056|title=Case Profile: Prison Legal News v. Jones|last=Gopal|first=Lakshimi|date=2015-10-26|website=Clearing House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''PLN v. Knox County Sheriff,'' Case No. 3:15-cv-00452.
* In response to the statewide ban on Prison Legal News by the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC), PLN filed a lawsuit in November 2014, challenging the ban. Although the FDOC changed their policy, certain private prison companies continued to censor PLN.  In August 2015 "the district court ruled that FDOC's censorship of PLN was permissible but that FDOC had violated PLN's due process rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2015/12/prison-newspaper-seeks-to-overturn-florida-ban.html|title=Prison newspaper seeks to overturn Florida ban|last=|first=|date=2015-12-16|website=Tampa Bay Business Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, PLN filed its opening brief to the Eleventh Circuit asking the court to "reverse the district court's judgment as to the First Amendment censorship claim, to affirm the court's ruling as to the due process claim and to expand the latter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridajusticeinstitute.org/homepage-featured/prison-legal-news-vs-florida-department-corrections/|title=FJI Sues Florida Department of Corrections to Stop Censorship of Prison Legal News|last=Dante|first=|date=2015-12-08|website=Florida Justice Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See: Prison Legal News v. Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, U.S Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Case No, 15-14220 &amp; 15-14221.
* In January 2015, PLN together with other plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's Revictimization Relief Act which "allowed victims of personal injury crimes to bring a civil action against the perpetrator of that crime, 'for conduct which perpetuates the continuing effect of the crime on the victim'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/prison-complex/entry/17898/pennsylvanias-revictimization-relief-act-struck-down-by-federal-judge|title=Pennsylvania's "Revictimization Relief Acr" Struck Down by Federal Judge|last=Lavender|first=George|date=2015-05-01|website=In These Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they are able to provide evidence of mental anguish resulting from an offender exercising their free speech. The law was struck down as unconstitutional and the court ruled in favor of PLN. See: ''PLN v. Kane, PA,'' Case No. 1:15-cv-00045.

== Other activities and campaigns ==
'''Campaign for Prison Phone Justice'''
The Campaign for Prison Phone Justice, which was cofounded by HRDC, started in 2011 in order to challenge the high fees for telephone use being charged by contractors in jails in the U.S. On October 22, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moved to cap the rates for prisoner phone calls in order to rein in what the FCC called "excessive rates and egregious fees on phone calls paid by some of society's most vulnerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/inmate-telephone-service|title=Inmate Telephone Service|last=|first=|date=2016-11-08|website=Federal Communications Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Supreme Court ruled that the FCC could not cap rates charged by contract providers but could cap associated fees for service.

'''Stop Prison Profiteering Campaign''' (SPP)
This campaign is intended to fight the financial exploitation of prisoners  and aims at stopping companies who charge excessive fees when people attempt to help their incarcerated friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shawnhawkins.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/stop-prison-profiteering/|title=Stop Prison Profiteering|last=boden|first=|date=2015-11-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|work=Shawn Hawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRDC has been working in conjunction with the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] to investigate "the fees associated with debit cards" in order to prohibit them and give "prisoners the ability to opt out of debit cards when they are released from prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationinside.org/campaign/StopPrisonProfiteering/posts/action-alert-prison-debit-cards/|title=Action Alert: Prison Debit Cards|work=nationinside.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prison Ecology Project'''
The Prison Ecology Project (PEP) states as its mission "to map the intersections of mass incarceration and environmental degradation, and create action plans to address the multitude of problems found there."&lt;ref name="nationinside.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-ecology/|title=Prison Ecology Project|work=nationinside.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PEP is concerned with the environmental impact of poorly regulated prison facilities, sewage systems, industrial waste and construction, on the threatened species and communities in the area.&lt;ref name="nationinside.org"/&gt;

'''International sanctions''' are political and economic decisions that are part of diplomatic efforts by [[countries]], [[United Nations Security Council|multilateral]] or [[Regional organization|regional organizations]] against states or organizations either to protect national security interests, or to protect international law, and defend against threats to international peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic Sanctions Reconsidered|last=Hufbauer|first=Gary|publisher=Peterson Institute for International Economics|year=2007|isbn=978-088132-407-5|location=Washington, DC|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43115210|title=The sanctions decade : assessing UN strategies in the 1990s|last=1946-|first=Cortright, David,|date=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|others=Lopez, George A.|year=|isbn=1555878911|location=Boulder, Colo.|pages=1|oclc=43115210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/423/sanctions-policy_en|title=Sanctions policy - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/en/decisions-102|title=Assembly of the African Union Fourteenth Ordinary Session {{!}} African Union|last=|first=|date=|website=au.int|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions principally include the temporary imposition on a target of economic, trade, diplomatic, cultural or other restrictions (sanctions measures) that are lifted when the motivating security concerns no longer apply, or when no new threats have arisen. 

According to the [[Charter of the united nations|Charter of the United Nations]], only the UN Security Council has a mandate by the international community to apply sanctions (Article 41) that must be complied with by all UN member states (Article 2,2). They serve as the international community's most powerful peaceful means to prevent threats to international peace and security or to settle them. Sanctions do not include the use of military force. However, if sanctions do not lead to the diplomatic settlement of a conflict, the use of force can be authorized by the Security Council separately under Article 42.

UN sanctions should not be confused with unilateral sanctions that are imposed by individual countries in furtherance of their strategic interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008962905|title=The evolution of UN sanctions : from a tool of warfare to a tool of peace, security and human rights|last=Enrico,|first=Carisch,|publisher=Springer|others=Rickard-Martin, Loraine,, Meister, Shawna R.,|year=2017|isbn=9783319600048|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=454 ff|oclc=1008962905}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Typically intended as strong economic coercion, measures applied under unilateral sanctions can range between coercive diplomatic efforts, economic warfare, or as preludes to war. 

There are several types of sanctions.
*'''[[Economic sanctions]]''' – typically a ban on [[trade]], possibly limited to certain sectors such as [[armaments]], or with certain exceptions (such as [[food]] and [[medicine]])&lt;ref&gt;Haidar, J.I., 2015."[http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/haidar-jamal-ibrahim/sanctions.pdf Sanctions and Exports Deflection: Evidence from Iran]," Paris School of Economics, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Mimeo&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[International sanctions#Diplomatic sanctions|Diplomatic sanctions]]''' – the reduction or removal of diplomatic ties, such as [[embassy|embassies]].
*'''[[International sanctions#Military sanctions|Military sanctions]]''' – military intervention
*'''[[International sanctions#Sport sanctions|Sport sanctions]]''' – preventing one country's people and teams from competing in international events.
*'''[[International sanctions#Sanctions on Environment|Sanctions on Environment]]''' – since the declaration of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], international environmental protection efforts have been increased gradually. 

Economic sanctions are distinguished from [[trade sanctions]], which are applied for purely economic reasons, and typically take the form of [[tariff]]s or similar measures, rather than bans on trade.

==Types==

===Reasons for sanctioning===
Sanctions formulations are designed into three categories. The categories are used to differentiate between the political contexts due to the global nature of the act.

First category involves such sanctions that are designed to force cooperation with [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman, S., &amp; Pouligny, B. (2003). ''Are Sanctions Meant to Work? The Politics of Creating and Implementing Sanctions Through the United Nations''. Global Governance, 9(4), 503–18. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the sanctions placed on [[Iraq]] in Resolution No. 661 on August 6, 1990, after the initial invasion of neighboring Kuwait. The United Nations placed an [[embargo]] on the nation in an attempt to prevent armed conflict. Resolution 665 and Resolution 670 were further added creating both naval and air blockade on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Conforti. B (1991). "Non-Coercive Sanctions in the United Nations Charter: Some Lessons from the Gulf War". ''The European Journal of International Law'', 2(1), 110–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the initial sanctions was to coerce Iraq into following international law, which included the recognized sovereignty of Kuwait.

The second category of design is those sanctions with the purpose to contain a threat to peace within a geographical boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman, S., &amp; Pouligny, B. (2003).

The three categories are a blanket explanation on the reasons sanctions are applied to nations, but it does not go as far as to say that voting members share the same political reasons for imposing them. It is often the case for many nations to be driven by self-interests in one or more categories when voting on whether or not to implement sanctions.

===Diplomatic sanctions===
Diplomatic sanctions are political measures taken to express disapproval or displeasure at a certain action through diplomatic and political means, rather than affecting economic or military relations. Measures include limitations or cancellations of high-level government visits or expelling or withdrawing diplomatic missions or staff.

===Economic sanctions===
{{main|Economic sanctions}}
{{Contradicts other|date=January 2015|1=Economic sanctions}}
Economic sanctions can vary from imposing import duties on goods to, or blocking the export of certain goods from the target country, to a full naval [[blockade]] of the target's ports in an effort to verify, and curb or block specified imported goods.

Well known examples of economic sanctions include:

* Napoleon's [[Continental System]] of 1806–1814, directed against British trade&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Rhodesia#Sanctions|United Nations sanctions against Zimbabwe]]
* [[Iraq sanctions|United Nations sanctions against Iraq]] (1990–2003)
* the [[United States embargo against Cuba]]

Since 1993 many countries have imposed trade sanctions on [[Burma|Burma (Myanmar)]].

The case of [[South Africa]] gives rise to the typical example used for arguing for the effectiveness of sanctions, though that alleged effectiveness remains a matter of debate.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

On May 13, 1998, the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] imposed economic sanctions on [[India]] following that country's second round of [[nuclear test]]s. Japan lifted its sanctions against India three years later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The US lifted its sanctions against India in 2001.

In 2001/2002 the United States imposed economic sanctions against the state of Zimbabwe, through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 or [[ZDERA]], {{USBill|107|s|494}}, vetoing or voting against access to financing, debt relief and rescheduling, and forcing the Zimbabwean government to operate on a cash-only basis.

===Military sanctions===
Similarly military sanctions can range from carefully targeted military strikes to degrade a nation's conventional or non-conventional capabilities, to the less aggressive form of an [[arms embargo]] to cut off supplies of arms or dual-use items.

===Sport sanctions===
Sport sanctions are used as a way of [[psychological warfare]], intended to crush the morale of the general population of the target country. The only instance where sports sanctions were used were the [[sanctions against Yugoslavia|international sanctions]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], 1992–1995, enacted by [[UN Security Council]] by resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|757]]. The [[Gleneagles Agreement]] approved by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1977, committed member nations to discourage contact and competition between their sportsmen and sporting organisations, teams or individuals from [[South Africa]]. However, it was not binding and unable to stop events such as the [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa]] or the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand]].

===Sanctions on individuals===
The United Nations Security Council can implement sanctions on political leaders or economic individuals. These persons usually find ways of evading their sanction because of political connections within their nation.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman, S., &amp; Pouligny, B. (2003). Are Sanctions Meant to Work? The Politics of Creating and Implementing Sanctions Through the United Nations. Global Governance, 9(4), 503-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions on Environment===
The sanctions on environment include both economic and political issues such as trade since these are all interdependent. The trade barriers and restrictions on trade are the key factors since they are engaged with the problems of endangered species, ozone-depleting chemicals and environmental laws. Although the sanctions and laws regarding the environment are relatively new, recent concerns over the environmental issues encouraged individuals and governments to actively cooperate in dealing the problems.

==Sanctions in international law==
Entities favorable to the target of another government's sanctions may claim that sanctions imposed by single countries or by an intergovernmental body like the United Nations are "illegal" or "criminal" due to, in the case of economic sanctions, the [[right to development]] or, in the case of military sanctions, the [[Right of self-defense]].

A 1996 report by [[International Progress Organization]] criticized sanctions as "an illegitimate form of collective punishment of the weakest and poorest members of society, the infants, the children, the chronically ill, and the elderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.i-p-o.org/sanct.htm|title = Appeal against sanctions: Commission on Human Rights: Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Forty-eighth session (5–30 August 1996).  Agenda item 13: International peace and security as an essential condition for the enjoyment of human rights, above all the right to life|date = 15 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for use===
Sanctions have long been the subject of controversy as scholars question their effects on citizens, the level of ethnocentrism involved when designing and implementing sanctions, and the possibility of ineffectiveness.  

Supporters of sanctions argue that regardless of sanctions' effects on a group of people, those citizens were most likely already being oppressed by their government. Supporters also argue that sanctions are the best alternative international tool, as opposed to taking no action, and that in the absence of sanctions, oppressive regimes have no incentive to reform.

On the side of opposition, it is asserted that sanctions are a way to promote American values and diminish the culture of a state. In a counterargument, support is argued on the basis that something must be done and [[democratic peace theory]] is cited, as sound reasoning for any possible traces of cultural insensitivity. It is also noted that the US has little to lose, in regards to public perception, as many around the world already have a distaste for American policies and actions.

In regards to the effectiveness of the outcomes of sanction implementation, supporters concede that multilateral sanctions have been found to work 33% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ang|first1=Adrian|last2=Peksen|first2=Dursun|title=When Do Economic Sanctions Work?|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2007|volume=60|pages=135–45|doi=10.1177/1065912906298632}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is argued that while sanctions are not a hundred percent effective, it is not the case that they are never effective.

Dissolution of sanctions...
There are several ways to remove and dissolve sanctions that have been implemented on a nation(s). In some cases such as those implemented on Iraq in 1990, only a reverse resolution can be used to remove the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, G. A., &amp; Cortright, D. (2004). "Containing Iraq: Sanctions Worked". ''Foreign Affairs'', 83(4), 90–103. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done when no provision is put in the resolution for the removal of sanctions. This is generally only done if the sanctioned party has shown willingness to adopt certain conditions of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman, S., &amp; Pouligny, B. (2003). ''Are Sanctions Meant to Work? The Politics of Creating and Implementing Sanctions Through the United Nations''. Global Governance, 9(4), 503–18. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way sanctions can be removed is when time limits are implemented with the initial sanction. After an extended duration the sanction will eventually be lifted off the nation despite cooperation. Additional sanctions may be placed however if the Security Council deems it necessary. The practice of time limitations has grown over the years and allows for gradual removal of restrictions on nations conforming to at least partial conditions imposed by the Security Council .

[[Image:Map of Ireland's capitals.png|thumb|A political map of Ireland]]
The '''Irish Question''' was a phrase used mainly by members of the British ruling classes from the early 19th century until the 1920s. It was used to describe [[Irish nationalism]] and the calls for [[Irish republicanism|Irish independence]].

For the political history see [[Irish issue in British politics]]

The phrase came to prominence as a result of the 1800 [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] which forced the parliament of [[Ireland]] into a single governing body with the parliament of [[Great Britain]], based in Westminster, with its usage persisting until the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921, which partitioned the island into two territories: a state now called [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (which was originally called the [[Irish Free State]]), and [[Northern Ireland]], which remains part of the [[United Kingdom]].

In 1844, a future British prime minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], defined the Irish Question:
{{quote|A dense population, in extreme distress, inhabit an island where there is an Established Church, which is not their Church, and a territorial aristocracy the richest of whom live in foreign capitals. Thus you have a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church; and in addition the weakest executive in the world. That is the Irish Question.'|Hansard&lt;ref&gt;The State of Ireland,  Hansard, 16 February 1844&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
In 1886, with the introduction of the first Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons, the term 'the Anglo-Irish Quarrel'&lt;ref&gt;''The Anglo-Irish Quarrel: A Plea for Peace'', John O'Connor Power, London, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; gained favour and  became more acceptable than the implied condescension of 'the Irish Question'.

Issues relating to Northern Ireland since the 1920s are often referred to as either "[[The Troubles]]" or "[[The Irish Problem]]".

The Irish question affected British politics much the way that the nationalities problem affected Austria. Normal British domestic issues could not be adequately addressed because of the political divisions created by the oppression of Ireland. The split of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] hurt the cause of further social and political reform. The people who could agree about reforms could not agree on Ireland, and Ireland seemed more important. Because the two traditional parties failed to deal with the social questions, by the turn of the 20th century a newly organised [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] began to fill the vacuum.

In 2017, the term was also used to describe issues associated with the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border#brexit|UK-Irish border]] and [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toynbee|first1=Polly|title=The Irish question may yet save Britain from Brexit {{!}} Polly Toynbee|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/27/irish-question-save-britain-brexit-leo-varadkar|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41689168|title=Brexit viewed from Brussels: The Irish question}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kangleipak Communist Party''' is a political party in [[Manipur]]. Named after [[Kangleipak]], the ancient name of Manipur, it was initially led by the [[Communism|communist ideologues]] — Ibohanbi and Ibopishak.&lt;ref name="ToI-10016542"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/KCPs-ultra-Left-turn-worries-Manipur/articleshow/10016542.cms |title=KCP's ultra-Left turn worries Manipur |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |first=Caesar |last=Mandal |location=Kolkata |date=17 September 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eToI"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=8&amp;edlabel=TOIKM&amp;mydateHid=18-09-2011&amp;pubname=&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar00801&amp;format=&amp;publabel=TOI |title=NE rebels embrace Maoist ideology |first=Caesar |last=Mandal |location=Kolkata |publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

==Splinter factions==
The KCP has now been divided into numerous factions, of which the known are:&lt;ref name="ToI-10016542"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eToI"/&gt;

#[[Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist / Ibungo Ngangom)]]
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Prithvi)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Mangang)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council)
#[[Kangleipak Communist Party (Maoist)]]
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Lamphel)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Sunil Meitei)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Mobile Task Force)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Lamyanba Khuman)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Loyallakpa)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (Noyon)
#Kangleipak Communist Party (City Meitei)

==Background==
This faction of the Kangleipak Communist Party came into existence in the late 2000s following the failure of certain party leaders to commit themselves to Marxism and Maoism. The incumbent chairman of its Politburo Standing Committee (highest decision-making body), Ibungo Ngangom, who used to head the Information and Public Relations Department of the Kangleipak Communist Party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesangaiexpress.manipur.us/2008/12/01/] {{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the main force behind the emergence of this faction, which has now become the most prominent one among the KCP factions. Though it came up as a separate group around 2010, it still sticks to 14 April 1980 as its rising day, because of the fact that the Kangleipak Communist Party was originally established on this date.

==Ideology==
The Kangleipak Communist Party under the leadership of Ibungo Ngangom is a group that follows [[Marxism]] and [[Maoism]]. But what makes this group a unique communist party is the fact that its chairman has often spoken about ideological flexibility and adopting the so-called bamboo policy. According to Ibungo Ngangom, communism is a living ideology and nobody must hesitate to 'adjust' in order to make it realistic and successful. He also talked about trying to achieve a higher level of compatibility between [[Marxism]] and [[Maoism]]. The group especially promotes the principle 'from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/you-might-be-a-marxist-if-you-believe-in-from-each-according-to-their-abilities-to-each-according-to-their-needs/|title=You Might Be a Marxist If ... You Believe in From Each According to Their Abilities, to Each According to Their Needs  » pa|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational Structure==
The Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist) under the leadership of Ibungo Ngangom has two main organs: Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), which is a combination of its legislative and judiciary bodies; and General Administrative Council (GAC), which is the executive branch of the group.

===Politburo Standing Committee===
The Politburo Standing Committee consists of Ibungo Ngangom (Chairman), Amumacha Mangang (Deputy Chairman), Thoiba Meetei (Senior Member), Wangba Angomcha (Senior Member), Angousana Moi-rangcha (Senior Member), James Paomei (Member), Sanatombi Chanu Lourembam (Member), Moramba Meetei (Member),Tomthin Mangang (Member), Sanatomba (Member), Wangthoi (Member). Initially, it was a five-member committee. But it was expanded into an eleven-member committee during its recent bi-annual conference.&lt;ref name="thesangaiexpress.com"/&gt;

===General Administrative Council===
Following the expansion of the politburo standing committee, the general administrative council of the outfit has also been reshuffled&lt;ref name="thesangaiexpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thepeopleschronicle.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeopleschronicle.in/?p=13397|title=:: Manipur News - Manipur Daily - Poknapham - Manipuri News!|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Ibungo Ngangom (Secretary-in-Chief, also heading Foreign Affairs Department, Fund-raising Department and Central Intelligence Wing), Amumacha Mangang (Deputy Secretary-in-Chief), Wangba Angomcha (Secretary, Public Affairs Department), Angousana Moirangcha ( Secretary, Finance &amp; Budgetary Affairs Department), Sanatombi Chanu (Secretary, Information &amp; Public Relations Department), James Paomei (previously Secretary, Public Affairs Department, he will now be Central Liaison Officer, Intra- Departmental Liaison Centre), Thoiba Meetei (previously Secretary, Finance &amp; Budgetary Affairs Department, he will now be Auditor-in-Chief, Audit Commission), Sanatomba Khumancha (previously Commander, Bir Tikendrajit Cadre, i.e. Special Contingency Response Wing, he is now Commander, Paona Cadre, i.e. Jungle Guerrilla Warfare Wing), Moramba Meetei (previously Commander, Paona Cadre, i.e. Jungle Guerrilla Warfare Wing, he is now Commander, Thangal Cadre, i.e. Urban Guerrilla Warfare Wing), Tomthin Mangang (previously Commander, Thangal Cadre, i.e. Urban Guerrilla Warfare Wing, he is now Commander, Bir Tikendrajit Cadre, i.e. Special Contingency Response Wing), Wangthoi ( previously Chief Intelligence Officer, Central Intelligence Wing, he is now Secretary, Capitalistic Concerns Regulation and Taxation Cell), announced the outfit.

==Legal status==
The Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist) is an organization that has been continuously banned under section 35 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 by the Government of India for 'waging war' against the Indian State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mha.nic.in/BO|title=Banned  Organisations -|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other groups==
The Foreign Affairs Department of the group, which is led by none other than its PSC Chairman has been endeavouring to establish contacts and relations with many communist parties throughout the world. The group is also said to have established some links with certain Maoist groups of Nepal, though it has not openly admitted it. Moreover, in a recent press release, the group has expressed its willingness to cooperate and coordinate with the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]].&lt;ref name="thesangaiexpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thepeopleschronicle.in"/&gt; According to some sources with close links with the group, it has also decided to work together with other anti-India separatist groups of states like Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya.

==Ban on the Celebrations of Indian Independence Day and Republic Day in Manipur==
The Kangleipak Communist Party (Marxist-Maoist) has imposed a permanent ban on the celebrations of Indian Independence Day and Republic Day in Manipur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifp.co.in/page/items/27834/kcp-calls-aug-15-as-go-back-india-day-deliberates-on-negative-implications-of-frequent-bandhs-and-gen-strike|title=KCP calls Aug 15 as ‘Go Back India Day’, deliberates on negative implications of frequent bandhs and gen strike|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesangaiexpress.com/page/items/54868/kcp-speaks-out-mind-on-issues|title=KCP speaks out mind on issues|date=8 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165634/http://www.thesangaiexpress.com/page/items/54868/kcp-speaks-out-mind-on-issues|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this group, Kangleipak was annexed by the Union of India under the guise of the Manipur Merger Agreement, which was signed by the then king of Kangleipak, who no longer had any authority to ink such an agreement as Kangleipak was already a democratic society under the command of an elected body of legislators. So it has been struggling to reclaim the robbed sovereignty of Kangleipak (Manipur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Manipur-merged-with-India-under-duress-say-rebels/articleshow/47549243.cms|title=Manipur merged with India under duress, say rebels - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OccupyManipur/posts/1381727768726765|title=Occupied Manipur, Right to Self Determination - Timeline - Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kangleipak Communist Party (Maoist)==
{{main|Maoist Communist Party of Manipur}}
In 2009, numerous comrades of the KCP coalesced and organised a convention, and reconstructed the party's [[Central Committee]]. Forthwithly after the plenum, they named the faction as "Kangleipak Communist Party (Maoist)," which has now evolved into the [[Maoist Communist Party of Manipur]]. However, the Kangleipak Communist Party led by Ibungo Ngangom has emerged as the leading group at least in terms of ideological positions and changes brought about within the group following his release from prison on 4 April 2015 after spending about 12 consecutive years in various prisons in India, including Tihar Jail. According to recent press releases of this group, led by Ibungo Ngangom, the group's primary goal is not only to liberate Kangleipak (Manipur) but also establish communism in Kangleipak through the scientific socialism of Karl Marx.&lt;ref name="thepeopleschronicle.in"/&gt; This makes this group a unique communist party of Manipur.&lt;ref name="ToI-10016542"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eToI"/&gt;

The '''League of Nations''' (abbreviated as '''LN''' or '''LoN''' in English, ''{{lang|fr|La Société des Nations}}'' {{IPA-fr|la sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃|}} abbreviated as '''{{lang|fr|SDN}}''' or '''{{lang|fr|SdN}}''' in [[French language|French]]) was an [[intergovernmental organisation]]&lt;!-- "organisation" is correct in British English --&gt; founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] that ended the [[World War I|First World War]].

The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Great Powers of World War I]] (France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan were the permanent members of the executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting [[Red Cross]] medical tents, [[Benito Mussolini]] responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|title=The Elusiveness of Trust: the experience of Security Council and Iran|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Transnational Foundation of Peace and Future Research|last=Jahanpour|first=Farhang|format=PDF|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727102504/http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was weakened by the fact that the [[United States]] never officially joined the League and the [[Soviet Union]] joined late and only briefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The participation of the Soviet Union in universal international organizations.: A political and legal analysis of Soviet strategies and aspirations inside ILO, UNESCO and WHO | author=Osakwe, C O | year=1972 | publisher=Springer | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2OmtJvNjHoC | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pericles, Lewis | year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | title=Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-ImKOwYvsoC | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Historical Dictionary of the League of Nations | author=Ginneken, Anique H.

The onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war.

===Background===
[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|right|The [[First Geneva Convention|1864 Geneva Convention]], one of the earliest formulations of [[international law]]]]
The concept of a peaceful community of nations had been proposed as far back as 1795, when [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=Mount Holyoke College|title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=16 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211750/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|archive-date=14 May 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states.{{sfn|Skirbekk|Gilje|2001|p=288}} Kant argued for the establishment of a peaceful world community, not in a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm|title=Perpetual Peace|author=Kant, Immanuel|year=1795|publisher=Constitution Society|accessdate=30 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007175416/http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm|archive-date=7 October 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the ''status quo'' between European states and so avoid war.{{sfn|Reichard|2006|p=9}}{{sfn|Rapoport|1995|pp=498–500}} This period also saw the development of international law, with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.{{sfn|Bouchet-Saulnier|Brav|Olivier|2007|pp=14–134}}&lt;ref&gt;F.S Northedge, ''The League of Nations: Its Life and Times, 1920–1946'' (1986) p 10&lt;/ref&gt; As historians William H. Harbaugh and [[Ronald E. Powaski]] point out, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was the first [[President of the United States|American President]] to call for an international league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powaski|first=Ronald|title=Toward an Entangling Alliance: American Isolationism, Internationalism, and Europe, 1901–1950|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313272745|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDAoVZqHwocC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/espada/roosevelt_life.htm About Theodore Roosevelt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407022005/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/espada/roosevelt_life.htm |date=7 April 2017 }}, "Roosevelt's attitude toward a league of nations varied with his changing emphases on realism, nationalism, and internationalism.

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by the peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889 (and is currently still in existence as an international body with a focus on the various elected legislative bodies of the world.)  The IPU was founded with an international scope, with a third of the members of [[parliament]]s (in the 24 countries that had parliaments) serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its foundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means. Annual conferences were established to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. Its structure was designed as a council headed by a president, which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Before the League of Nations | publisher =The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument | accessdate =14 June 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081209120513/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument | archive-date =9 December 2008 | dead-url =no | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial proposals===
[[File:1st Viscount Bryce 1893.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Lord Bryce]], one of the earliest advocates for a League of Nations.]]
At the start of the First World War the first schemes for international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support, particularly in Great Britain and the United States. [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson]], a British political scientist, coined the term "League of Nations" in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation. Together with [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Lord Bryce]], he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the [[Bryce Group]], later the [[League of Nations Union]].&lt;ref name="northedge"&gt;{{cite book|last = Northedge|first = F. S.|title = The League of Nations: Its life and times, 1920–1946| publisher = [[Leicester University]] Press|year = 1986|isbn=0-7185-1194-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then governing [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In Dickinson's 1915 pamphlet ''After the War'' he wrote of his "League of Peace" as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war and thus could write that, "the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion." The ‘Proposals’ of the Bryce Group were circulated widely, both in England and the US, where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbFznQEACAAJ|title=The League of Nations and the Rule of Law, 1918–1935|author=Sir Alfred Eckhard Zimmern|year=1969|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell|pages=13–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two weeks of the start of the war, feminists began to mobilise against the war.{{sfn|Marchand|2015|pp=182-184}} Having been barred from participating in prior peace organizations,{{sfn|Marchand|2015|p=102}} American women formed a Women's Peace Parade Committee to plan a silent protest to the war. Led by chairwoman [[Fanny Garrison Villard]], women from trade unions, feminist organizations, and social reform organizations, such as [[Kate Waller Barrett]], [[Mary Ritter Beard]], [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Rose Schneiderman]], [[Lillian Wald]], and others, organized 1500 women, who marched down [[Manhattan]]'s [[Fifth Avenue]] on August 29, 1914.{{sfn|Marchand|2015|pp=182-184}} As a result of the parade, [[Jane Addams]] became interested in proposals by two European suffragists—Hungarian [[Rosika Schwimmer]] and British [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Baroness Pethick-Lawrence|Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]]—to hold a peace conference.{{sfn|Marchand|2015|p=194}} On 9–10 January 1915, a peace conference directed by Addams was held in [[Washington, D. C.]], where the delegates adopted a platform calling for creation of international bodies with administrative and legislative powers to develop a "permanent league of neutral nations" to work for peace and disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Woman's Peace Party Full Fledged for Action|journal=The Survey|date=23 January 1915|volume=XXXIII|issue=17|pages=433–434|url=https://archive.org/stream/surveycharityorg33survrich#page/433/mode/1up|accessdate=31 August 2017|publisher=Survey Associates for the Charity Organization Society of New York City|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Intend to End Strife|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13465910/women_intend_to_end_strife_the/|accessdate=31 August 2017|publisher=''[[The Washington Herald]]''|date=10 January 1915|location=Washington, D.

Within months a call was made for an international women's conference to be held in [[The Hague]]. Coordinated by [[Mia Boissevain]], [[Aletta Jacobs]] and [[Rosa Manus]], the Congress, which opened on April 28, 1915{{sfn|Everard|de Haan|2016|pp=64-65}} was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and non-[[belligerent]] [[nation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Veen|first1=Sietske|title=Hirschmann, Susanna Theodora Cornelia (1871-1957)|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|website=Huygens ING|publisher=Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands|accessdate=30 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830163944/http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|archivedate=30 August 2017|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the establishment of an organization which would become the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).{{sfn|Jacobs|1996|p=94}} At the close of the conference, two delegations of women were dispatched to meet European heads of state over the next several months. They secured agreement from reluctant Foreign Ministers, who overall felt that such a body would be ineffective, but agreed to participate or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other nations agreed and if President [[Woodrow Wilson]] would initiate a body. In the midst of the War, Wilson refused.{{sfn|Caravantes|2004|pp=101-103}}{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=110-125}}

In 1915, a similar body to the Bryce group proposals was set up in the United States by a group of like-minded individuals, including [[William Howard Taft]]. It was called the [[League to Enforce Peace]] and was substantially based on the proposals of the Bryce Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|jstor= 2705943 |title=Toward the Concept of Collective Security: The Bryce Group's "Proposals for the Avoidance of War," 1914–1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and the imposition of sanctions on aggressive countries. None of these early organisations envisioned a continuously functioning body; with the exception of the [[Fabian Society]] in England, they maintained a legalistic approach that would limit the international body to a court of justice. The Fabians were the first to argue for a "Council" of states, necessarily the [[Great Power]]s, who would adjudicate world affairs, and for the creation of a permanent secretariat to enhance international co-operation across a range of activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjVlcgAACAAJ|title=International Government|author=Leonard Woolf|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar|isbn=9781177952934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the [[Diplomatic history of World War I|diplomatic efforts surrounding World War I]], both sides had to clarify their long-term war aims. By 1916 in Britain, the leader of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and in neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation, when Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position With an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a "league of nations to insure peace and justice." British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, "behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Yearwood, "‘On the Safe and Right Lines’: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916–1918." ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;P. M. H. Bell, ''The Origins of the Second World War in Europe'' (2007) p 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Several empires collapsed: first the [[Russian Empire]] in February 1917, followed by the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]].  Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as "[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}

In London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]]. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918. It was led by [[Walter Phillimore]] (and became known as the Phillimore Committee), but also included [[Eyre Crowe]], [[William Tyrrell, 1st Baron Tyrrell|William Tyrrell]], and [[Cecil Hurst]].&lt;ref name="northedge"/&gt; The recommendations of the so-called [[Walter Phillimore|Phillimore Commission]] included the establishment of a "Conference of Allied States" that would arbitrate disputes and impose sanctions on offending states. The proposals were approved by the British government, and much of the commission's results were later incorporated into the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="jclare"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American History|accessdate=10 December 2013|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/essays/1901-/the-league-of-nations-karl-j-schmidt.php|title=The League of Nations – Karl J.

[[File:JanSmutsFM.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Jan Smuts]] helped to draft the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]].]]
The French also drafted a much more far-reaching proposal in June 1918; they advocated annual meetings of a council to settle all disputes, as well as an "international army" to enforce its decisions.&lt;ref name="jclare"/&gt;

The American President Woodrow Wilson instructed [[Edward M. House]] to draft a US plan which reflected Wilson's own idealistic views (first articulated in the [[Fourteen Points]] of January 1918), as well as the work of the Phillimore Commission. The outcome of House's work, and Wilson's own first draft, proposed the termination of "unethical" state behaviour, including forms of espionage and dishonesty. Methods of compulsion against recalcitrant states would include severe measures, such as "blockading and closing the frontiers of that power to commerce or intercourse with any part of the world and to use any force that may be necessary..."&lt;ref name="jclare"/&gt;

===Establishment===
[[File:No-nb bldsa 5c006.jpg|thumb|The official opening of the League of Nations, 15 November 1920]]
At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, Wilson, Cecil and Smuts all put forward their draft proposals. After lengthy negotiations between the delegates, the [[Cecil Hurst|Hurst]]–[[David Hunter Miller|Miller]] draft was finally produced as a basis for the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIcrAAAAYAAJ|title=The drafting of the Covenant|author=David Hunter Miller|year=1969|publisher=Johnson Reprint Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more negotiation and compromise, the delegates finally approved of the proposal to create the League of Nations ({{lang-fr|Société des Nations}}, {{lang-de|Völkerbund}}) on 25 January 1919.{{sfn|Magliveras|1999|p=8}} The final [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On 28 June 1919,{{sfn|Magliveras|1999|pp=8–12}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=35–36}} 44 states signed the Covenant, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] or joined it during the conflict.

French women's rights advocates invited international feminists to participate in a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference.&lt;ref name="Sydney Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inter-Allied Women's Conference in Paris|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13469530/the_sydney_morning_herald/|accessdate=31 August 2017|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=23 May 1919|location=Sydney, New South Wales, Australia|page=5|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030613/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13469530/the_sydney_morning_herald/|archive-date=1 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women and the Peace Conference|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13469815/women_and_the_peace_conference_the/|accessdate=31 August 2017|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=18 February 1919|location=London, England|page=5|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901031301/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13469815/women_and_the_peace_conference_the/|archive-date=1 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drexel|first1=Constance|title=Women Gain Victory at Paris Conference|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13469357/the_los_angeles_times/|accessdate=31 August 2017|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|date=15 March 1919|location=Los Angeles, California|page=2|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901031443/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13469357/the_los_angeles_times/|archive-date=1 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men,&lt;ref name="Sydney Herald"/&gt; those rights were ignored.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=200-202}} Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organization.{{sfn|Meyer|Prügl|1999|p=20}} They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|p=2}} At the [[Zürich]] Peace Conference held between 17–19 May 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] for both is punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|pp=200-202}} Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, [[Catherine Marshall (suffragette)|Catherine Marshall]], a British suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.{{sfn|Wiltsher|1985|p=212}}

The League would be made up of a General Assembly (representing all member states), an Executive Council (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent secretariat. Member states were expected to "respect and preserve as against external aggression" the territorial integrity of other members and to [[Disarmament|disarm]] "to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety." All states were required to submit complaints for [[arbitration]] or [[judicial inquiry]] before going to war.&lt;ref name="northedge"/&gt; The Executive Council would create a [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] to make judgements on the disputes.

Despite Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in October 1919,{{sfn|Levinovitz|Ringertz|2001|p=170}} the United States never joined. Senate Republicans led by [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] wanted a League with the reservation that only Congress could take the U.S. into war. Lodge gained a majority of Senators. Wilson refused to allow a compromise and the needed 2/3 majority was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Hewes, "Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations."'' Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 114.4 (1970): 245-255.

The League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations came into force.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=51}} On 1 November 1920, the headquarters of the League was moved from London to [[Geneva]], where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/3DA94AAFEB9E8E76C1256F340047BB52/$file/sdn_chronology.pdf League of Nations Chronology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404121418/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/3DA94AAFEB9E8E76C1256F340047BB52/$file/sdn_chronology.pdf |date=4 April 2015 }}, The United Nations Office at Geneva&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palais Wilson]] on Geneva's western lakeshore, named after US President Woodrow Wilson in recognition of his efforts towards the establishment of the League, was the League's first permanent home.

==Languages and symbols==
[[File:Flag of the League of Nations (1939).svg|thumb|Semi-official flag of the League of Nations from 1939 to 1941.]]The official languages of the League of Nations were French and English.{{sfn|League of Nations|1935|p=22}} The League rejected adopting [[Esperanto]] as its working language. China and Japan wanted Esperanto but France was strongly opposed.{{sfn|Forster|1982|pp=171–76}}

In 1939, a semi-official emblem for the League of Nations emerged: two five-pointed stars within a blue pentagon. They symbolised the Earth's five continents and five "[[Historical race concepts|races]]". A bow at the top displayed the English name ("League of Nations"), while another at the bottom showed the French ("''Société des Nations''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 September 2011|url=http://visit.un.org/wcm/content/site/visitors/lang/en/home/about_us/un_offices|title=Language and Emblem|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923093857/http://visit.un.org/wcm/content/site/visitors/lang/en/home/about_us/un_offices|archivedate=23 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main constitutional organs of the League were the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. It also had two essential wings: the Permanent Court of International Justice and the [[International Labour Organization]]. In addition, there were several auxiliary agencies and commissions.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=48, 66}} Each organ's budget was allocated by the Assembly (the League was supported financially by its member states).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=5 October 2011|title=Budget of the League|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/pictorialsurvey/lonapspg30.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823153107/http://www.indiana.edu/~league/pictorialsurvey/lonapspg30.htm|archive-date=23 August 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relations between the Assembly and the Council and the competencies of each were for the most part not explicitly defined. Each body could deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the League or affecting peace in the world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred to either.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=48–49}}

Unanimity was required for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was a reflection of the League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=53}}

The Permanent Secretariat, established at the seat of the League at Geneva, comprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the [[Secretary General|general secretary]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=50}} Its principal sections were Political, Financial and Economics, Transit, Minorities and Administration (administering the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and [[Gdańsk|Danzig]]), Mandates, Disarmament, Health, Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children), Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux, Legal, and Information. The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the League's civil service. In 1931 the staff numbered 707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=15 September 2011|publisher=United Nations Office at Geneva|url=http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/detail.aspx?ID=245|title=League of Nations Secretariat, 1919–1946|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212075827/http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/detail.aspx?ID=245|archive-date=12 December 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly consisted of representatives of all members of the League, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote.&lt;ref name="UNOG"&gt;{{cite web | title =Organization and establishment:The main bodies of the League of Nations | publisher =The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/84C4520213F947DDC1256F32002E23DB?OpenDocument | accessdate =18 May 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081209115248/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/84C4520213F947DDC1256F32002E23DB?OpenDocument | archive-date =9 December 2008 | dead-url =no | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It met in Geneva and, after its initial sessions in 1920,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=72}} it convened once a year in September.&lt;ref name="UNOG"/&gt; The special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members, the periodical election of non-permanent members to the Council, the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court, and control of the budget. In practice, the Assembly was the general directing force of League activities.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=48–50}}

The League Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly's business.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=48}} It began with four permanent members ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]]) and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three-year term.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=42–48}} The first non-permanent members were [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Greece]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=15 September 2011|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/photos.htm|publisher=University of Indiana|title=League of Nations Photo Archive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909035837/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eleague/photos.htm|archive-date=9 September 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the Council was changed several times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926. [[Werner Dankwort]] of Germany pushed for his country to join the League; joining in 1926, Germany became the fifth permanent member of the Council. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven, and the Soviet Union was made a permanent member giving the Council a total of fifteen members.&lt;ref name=photo/&gt; The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=15 September 2011|publisher=University of Indiana|title=Chronology 1939|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1939.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927120649/http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1939.htm|archive-date=27 September 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the Disarmament Commission, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] Commission, the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation]]&lt;ref&gt;Grandjean, Martin (2016).

The Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget was provided by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/pcijoverview.htm|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=Permanent Court of International Justice|publisher=University of Indiana|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827192713/http://www.indiana.edu/~league/pcijoverview.htm|archive-date=27 August 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Childlabourcoal.jpg|thumb|Child labour in a coal mine, United States, c. 1912]]

The International Labour Organization was created in 1919 on the basis of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=179–80}} The ILO, although having the same members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference and its own Secretariat. Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations. [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]] was its first director.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=53}}

[[File:Kamerun children weaving.jpg|thumb|right|Child labour in [[Kamerun]] in 1919|alt=A row of more than a dozen children holding wooden looms stretches into the distance.]]
The ILO successfully restricted the addition of lead to paint,{{sfn|Frowein|Rüdiger|2000|p=167}} and convinced several countries to adopt an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase the rights of women in the workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=179–80}} After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;{{cite web | title =Origins and history | publisher =International Labour Organization | url =http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Origins_and_history/lang--en/index.htm | accessdate =25 April 2008 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080427052744/http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Origins_and_history/lang--en/index.htm | archivedate =27 April 2008 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League's health organisation had three bodies: the Health Bureau, containing permanent officials of the League; the General Advisory Council or Conference, an executive section consisting of medical experts; and the Health Committee. The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=182}} This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]], and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.{{sfn|Baumslag|2005|p=8}}

The League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual co-operation since its creation.{{sfn|Grandjean|2018}} The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] became the first chairman of the committee.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=186–187}} The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=187–189}}

Introduced by the second [[International Opium Convention]], the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in [[opium]], morphine, cocaine and heroin. The board also established a system of import certificates and export authorisations for the legal international trade in [[narcotics]].{{sfn|McAllister|1999|pp=76–77}}

The [[1926 Slavery Convention|Slavery Commission]] sought to eradicate [[slavery]] and slave trading across the world, and fought forced prostitution.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=185–86}} Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in those countries. The League secured a commitment from [[Ethiopia]] to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with [[Liberia]] to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery. The United Kingdom had not supported Ethiopian membership of the League on the grounds that "Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission."&lt;ref&gt;British Cabinet Paper 161(35) on the "Italo-Ethiopian Dispute" and exhibiting a "Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on British interests in Ethiopia" dated 18 June 1935 and submitted to Cabinet by [[John Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby|Sir John Maffey]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=185–86}}

The League also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing the [[Usambara Railway|Tanganyika railway]] from 55 to 4 percent. Records were kept to control slavery, prostitution, and the [[Human trafficking|trafficking of women and children]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=166}} Partly as a result of pressure brought by the League of Nations, [[Afghanistan]] abolished slavery in 1923, [[Iraq]] in 1924, [[Nepal]] in 1926, [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and [[Persia]] in 1929, [[Bahrain]] in 1937, and [[Ethiopia]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1976|publisher=Americana Corporation|title=''The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 25''|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also established the [[Nansen passport]] as a means of identification for [[stateless people]].{{sfn|Torpey|2000|p=129}}

The Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women sought to inquire into the status of women all over the world. It was formed in 1937, and later became part of the United Nations as the Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief Survey of Women's Rights|author=de Haan, Francisca|work=UN Chronicle|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 September 2011|date=25 February 2010|url=https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/chronicle/cache/bypass/home/archive/issues2010/empoweringwomen/briefsurveywomensrights?ctnscroll_articleContainerList=1_0&amp;ctnlistpagination_articleContainerList=true|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016104326/http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/chronicle/cache/bypass/home/archive/issues2010/empoweringwomen/briefsurveywomensrights?ctnscroll_articleContainerList=1_0&amp;ctnlistpagination_articleContainerList=true|archive-date=16 October 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LN member states animation.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|right|A map of the world in 1920–45, which shows the League of Nations members during its history]]
Of the League's 42 founding members, 23 (24 counting [[Free French Forces|Free France]]) remained members until it was dissolved in 1946. In the founding year, six other states joined, only two of which remained members throughout the League's existence. Under the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Germany]] (in fact the ''Deutsches Reich'' or German Empire) was admitted to the League of Nations through a resolution passed on September 8 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of the League of Nations|publisher=United Nations Office at Geneva|accessdate=9 October 2018|url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/3DA94AAFEB9E8E76C1256F340047BB52/$file/sdn_chronology.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525212944/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/3DA94AAFEB9E8E76C1256F340047BB52/$file/sdn_chronology.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional 15 countries joined later. The largest number of member states was 58, between 28 September 1934 (when [[Ecuador]] joined) and 23 February 1935 (when [[Paraguay]] withdrew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/nationalmember.htm|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=National Membership of the League of Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909020709/http://www.indiana.edu/~league/nationalmember.htm|archive-date=9 September 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 1937, [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] became the last state to join the League. The first member to withdraw permanently from the League was [[Costa Rica]] on 22 January 1925; having joined on 16 December 1920, this also makes it the member to have most quickly withdrawn. Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and [[Haiti]] the last (April 1942). [[Iraq]], which joined in 1932, was the first member that had previously been a [[League of Nations mandate]].{{sfn|Tripp|2002|p=75}}

The Soviet Union became a member on 18 September 1934,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} and was expelled on 14 December 1939{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} for [[Winter War|invading Finland]]. In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own rule: only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for expulsion (United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]), short of the majority required by the Covenant. Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt). This was one of the League's final acts before it practically ceased functioning due to the Second World War.{{sfn|Magliveras|1999|p=31}}

==Mandates==
{{Main|League of Nations mandate}}
At the end of the First World War, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] were confronted with the question of the disposal of the former German colonies in Africa and the Pacific, and the several Arabic-speaking provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] adopted the principle that these territories should be administered by different governments on behalf of the League – a system of national responsibility subject to international supervision.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=192–193}} This plan, defined as the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]], was adopted by the "Council of Ten" (the heads of government and foreign ministers of the main Allied powers: Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=96|date=July 1921|title=The Mandate System of the League of Nations|pages=74–77|author=Myers, Denys P|doi=10.1177/000271622109600116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

League of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=193}} The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=198}} and also organised [[plebiscite]]s in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join. There were three mandate classifications: A, B and C.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=195}}

The A mandates (applied to parts of the old Ottoman Empire) were "certain communities" that had {{Quotation|...reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.&lt;ref name="Mandate"&gt;{{cite web | last =League of Nations | year =1924 | title =The Covenant of the League of Nations:Article 22 | publisher =The Avalon Project at Yale Law School | url =http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/leagcov.asp | accessdate =20 April 2009 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110726080156/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/leagcov.asp | archive-date =26 July 2011 | dead-url =no | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; |Article 22|The Covenant of the League of Nations}}

The B mandates were applied to the former [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] that the League took responsibility for after the First World War. These were described as "peoples" that the League said were {{Quotation|...at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League.&lt;ref name="Mandate" /&gt;|Article 22|The Covenant of the League of Nations}}

South West Africa and certain South Pacific Islands were administered by League members under C mandates. These were classified as "territories" {{Quotation|...which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population."&lt;ref name="Mandate" /&gt;|Article 22|The Covenant of the League of Nations}}

===Mandatory powers===
The territories were governed by mandatory powers, such as the United Kingdom in the case of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]], and the [[Union of South Africa]] in the case of South West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=194–195}} With the exception of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], which joined the League on 3 October 1932,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=216}} these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/history.shtml|accessdate=15 September 2011|publisher=United Nations|title=The United Nations and Decolonization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903215926/http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/history.shtml|archive-date=3 September 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the mandates, the League itself governed the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] for 15 years, before it was returned to Germany following a plebiscite, and the [[Free City of Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]], Poland) from 15 November 1920 to 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=73–75}}

==Resolving territorial disputes==
The [[aftermath of World War I|aftermath of the First World War]] left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70–72}}

As the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}

===Åland Islands===
{{Main|Åland crisis}}
[[Åland]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the Åland Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77–78}}

===Upper Silesia===
The Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82–83}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 percent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}

On 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas – for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}

===Albania===
The frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103–105}}

The borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed, and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}

Mussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}

===Memel===
{{Main|Klaipėda Revolt}}
The port city of [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (now [[Klaipėda]]) and [[Klaipėda Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Allied control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaipėda Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.

===Hatay===
{{Main|Hatay State}}
With League oversight, the [[Sanjak]] of [[İskenderun|Alexandretta]] in the [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] was given autonomy in 1937. Renamed Hatay, its parliament declared independence as the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] in September 1938, after elections the previous month. It was annexed by [[Turkey]] with French consent in mid-1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=117–121|author=Çaǧaptay, Soner|title=Islam, secularism, and nationalism in modern Turkey|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-38458-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosul===
{{Main|Mosul Question}}
The League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of [[Mosul Vilayet|Mosul]] in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107–108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131–135}}

===Vilnius===
{{Main|Żeligowski's Mutiny}}
After the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish–Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish–Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwałki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwałki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}

After a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaipėda Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78–79}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}

===Colombia and Peru===
{{Main|Colombia–Peru War|Leticia dispute}}
There were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salomón-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land as a result organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414–415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro|Luis Sánchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=251}} In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and [[Putumayo River]]s, and a pledge of [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The verdict of the League|year=1934|editor=Hudson, Manley|publisher=World Peace Foundation|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saar===
[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 percent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=72–73}}{{sfn|Churchill|1986|p=98}}

==Other conflicts==
In addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/%28httpPages%29/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=The United Nations in the Heart of Europe|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132257/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|archive-date=10 November 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece and Bulgaria===
{{Main|Incident at Petrich}}
After an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}} Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=126–127}} The League condemned the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}}

===Liberia===
Following accusations of forced labour on the large American-owned [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] rubber plantation and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation.{{sfn|Miers|2003|pp=140–141}} The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia.{{sfn|Miers|2003|p=188}} In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia and led to the resignation of President [[Charles D. B. King]] and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.{{sfn|Miers|2003|p=188}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=W.E.

The Mukden Incident, also known as the "Manchurian Incident" was a decisive setback that weakened The League because its major members refused to tackle Japanese aggression. Japan itself withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Rector Smith, ''The Manchurian crisis, 1931-1932: a tragedy in international relations'' (1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the agreed terms of the [[Twenty-One Demands]] with China, the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the [[South Manchurian Railway]], a major trade route between the two countries, in the Chinese region of [[Manchuria]].  In September 1931, a section of the railway was lightly damaged by the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] as a pretext for an invasion of Manchuria.{{sfn|Iriye|1987|p=8}}{{sfn|Nish|1977|pp=176–178}} The Japanese army claimed that Chinese soldiers had sabotaged the railway and in apparent retaliation (acting contrary to orders from Tokyo, {{sfn|Scott|1973|p=208}}) occupied all of Manchuria. They renamed the area [[Manchukuo]], and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with [[Pu Yi]], the former emperor of China, as its executive head.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=139}} This new entity was recognised only by the governments of Italy, Spain and Nazi Germany; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China.

The League of Nations sent observers. The [[Lytton Report]] appeared a year later (October 1932). It declared Japan to be the aggressor and demanded Manchuria be returned to China.  The report passed 42–1 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156–161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:
:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918-1940'' (1955) p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaco War===
{{Main|Chaco War}}
The League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]], which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=242–243}} and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum.{{sfn|Levy|2001|pp=21–22}} Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio López at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].{{sfn|Bethell|1991|p=495}} Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American Conference]] offered to mediate instead. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=248}} It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, Paraguay had seized control of most of the region, as was later recognised by the 1938 truce.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=103}}

===Italian invasion of Abyssinia===
{{Main|Abyssinia Crisis|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}
[[File:SelassieInJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]] escaping Ethiopia via Jerusalem]]
In October 1935, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini sent 400,000 troops to invade Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]).{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=222–225}} Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]] led the campaign from November 1935, ordering bombing, the use of chemical weapons such as [[mustard gas]], and the poisoning of water supplies, against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=222–225}}{{sfn|Hill|Garvey|1995|p=629}} The modern [[Italian Army]] defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians and captured [[Addis Ababa]] in May 1936, forcing Emperor of Ethiopia [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]] to flee.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=221}}

The League of Nations condemned Italy's aggression and imposed economic sanctions in November 1935, but the sanctions were largely ineffective since they did not ban the sale of oil or close the [[Suez Canal]] (controlled by Britain).{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=245}} As [[Stanley Baldwin]], the British Prime Minister, later observed, this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack.&lt;ref name = "events"&gt;{{cite book|title=Events Leading Up to World War II|publisher=Library of Congress|year=1944|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1935, the US President, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], invoked the recently passed [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] and placed an embargo on arms and munitions to both sides, but extended a further "moral embargo" to the belligerent Italians, including other trade items. On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=71}} The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=298}}

The [[Hoare–Laval Pact]] of December 1935 was an attempt by the British Foreign Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] and the French Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]] to end the conflict in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men.{{sfn|Baer|1976|pp=121–155}} In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author =[[Haile Selassie I]]| title =Appeal to The League of Nations:June 1936, Geneva, Switzerland| publisher =Black King| url =http://www.black-king.net/haile%20selassie%2001e.htm| accessdate =6 June 2008| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080325023216/http://www.black-king.net/haile%20selassie%2001e.htm| archivedate =25 March 2008| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abyssinian crisis showed how the League could be influenced by the self-interest of its members;{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=303}} one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] into an alliance.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=77}}

===Spanish Civil War===
{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}
On 17 July 1936, the [[Spanish Army]] launched a coup d'état, leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] (the elected leftist national government) and the Nationalists (conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army).{{sfn|Lannon|2002|pp=25–29}} [[Julio Álvarez del Vayo]], the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain's territorial integrity and political independence. The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. [[Adolf Hitler]] and Mussolini continued to aid General [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban [[International Brigades|foreign volunteers]], but this was in practice a symbolic move.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=264–265, 269–270}}

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
Following a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, [[Wellington Koo]], appealed to the League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn [[Battle of Shanghai|defence of Shanghai]], a city with a substantial number of foreigners.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=270}} The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the [[Nine Power Treaty|Nine Power Treaty Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The China White Paper|page=10|editor=van Slyke, Lyman|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/china.htm|title=Japanese Attack on China 1937|accessdate=15 September 2011|publisher=Mount Holyoke University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831141400/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/china.htm|archive-date=31 August 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure of disarmament==
{{Further|World Disarmament Conference}}
Article 8 of the Covenant gave the League the task of reducing "armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=League of Nations |year=1924 |title=The Covenant of the League of Nations:Article 8 |publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm |accessdate=17 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415165629/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant amount of the League's time and energy was devoted to this goal, even though many member governments were uncertain that such extensive disarmament could be achieved or was even desirable.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=113, 123}} The Allied powers were also under obligation by the Treaty of Versailles to attempt to disarm, and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had been described as the first step toward worldwide disarmament.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=113, 123}} The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932–1934 [[World Disarmament Conference]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}} Members of the League held different views towards the issue. The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=173}} Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}

The [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states. It was a failure.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Temperley, ''The Whispering Gallery Of Europe'' (1938),  [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.216023  online]&lt;/ref&gt; A one-year moratorium on the expansion of armaments, later extended by a few months, was proposed at the start of the conference.{{sfn|Goldblat|2002|p=24}} The Disarmament Commission obtained initial agreement from France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies but no final agreement was reached.  Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s. 

The League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler's [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]], occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] and ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[Austria]], which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Meirion and Susie|last=Harries|title=Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army|page=163|isbn=0-394-56935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy and Spain in 1937.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=47, 133}} The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after [[Winter War|it invaded Finland]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=273}}

==General weaknesses==
[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumb|'''The Gap in the Bridge'''; the sign reads "This League of Nations Bridge was designed by the President of the U.S.A."
Cartoon from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, 10 December 1920, satirising the gap left by the US not joining the League.]]
The onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=276–278}}

===Origins and structure===
The origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a "League of Victors".{{sfn|Gorodetsky|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Raffo|1974|p=1}} The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=226–227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=0-19-822650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279–282, 288–292}}

===Global representation===
Representation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}

In January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded, as Communist regimes were not welcomed. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1937. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a "peace-loving country", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}

===Collective security===
Another important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe "to defend against the enemies of internal order",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253–254}}

On 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.&lt;ref name = "events" /&gt;}}

Ultimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}
In this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;Ditrych, Ondrej. '' 'International Terrorism' as Conspiracy: Debating Terrorism in the League of Nations''. [[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

American diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:
:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacifism and disarmament===
The League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54–5}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238–240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134–135}}

When the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, "Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us, because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:

{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}

The Foreign Office minister Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that "a solemn league and covenant" would just be "a treaty, like other treaties". "What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned "pledge of common action" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that "It is all a question of real military preponderance". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}

As the situation in Europe escalated into war, the Assembly transferred enough power to the Secretary General on 30 September 1938 and 14 December 1939 to allow the League to continue to exist legally and carry on reduced operations.{{sfn|Magliveras|1999|p=31}} The headquarters of the League, the [[Palace of Nations]], remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=399}}

At the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]], the Allied powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations. Many League bodies, such as the International Labour Organization, continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN.&lt;ref name="ILO"/&gt; The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more effective than the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=278–280}}

The final meeting of the League of Nations took place on 18 April 1946 in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldatwar.net/timeline/other/league18-46.html League of Nations Chronology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230095126/http://worldatwar.net/timeline/other/league18-46.html |date=30 December 2004 }} Philip J. Strollo&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates from 34 nations attended the assembly.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=404}} This session concerned itself with liquidating the League: it transferred assets worth approximately $22,000,000 (U.S.) in 1946&lt;ref name="SyracuseHerald"&gt;
"League of Nations Ends, Gives Way to New U.N.", ''Syracuse Herald-American'', 20 April 1946, p. 12
&lt;/ref&gt; (including the Palace of Nations and the League's archives) to the UN, returned reserve funds to the nations that had supplied them, and settled the debts of the League.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=404}} [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]], addressing the final session, said:

{{quote|Let us boldly state that aggression wherever it occurs and however it may be defended, is an international crime, that it is the duty of every peace-loving state to resent it and employ whatever force is necessary to crush it, that the machinery of the Charter, no less than the machinery of the Covenant, is sufficient for this purpose if properly used, and that every well-disposed citizen of every state should be ready to undergo any sacrifice in order to maintain peace ... I venture to impress upon my hearers that the great work of peace is resting not only on the narrow interests of our own nations, but even more on those great principles of right and wrong which nations, like individuals, depend.&lt;br /&gt;
The League is dead. Long live the United Nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=404}}
}}
The Assembly passed a resolution that "With effect from the day following the close of the present session of the Assembly [i.e., April 19], the League of Nations shall cease to exist except for the sole purpose of the liquidation of its affairs as provided in the present resolution."&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal | author = Denys P. Myers | title  = Liquidation of League of Nations Functions | journal = The American Journal of International Law | volume = 42 | issue  = 2 | year = 1948 | pages = 320–354 | doi=10.2307/2193676| jstor  = 2193676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Board of Liquidation consisting of nine persons from different countries spent the next 15 months overseeing the transfer of the League's assets and functions to the United Nations or specialised bodies, finally dissolving itself on July 31, 1947.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

The archive of the League of Nations was transferred to the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] and is now an entry in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]].

In the past few decades, by research using the League Archives at Geneva, historians have reviewed the legacy of the League of Nations as the United Nations has faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the [[rule of law]] across the globe; strengthened the concept of [[collective security]], giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like [[epidemics]], [[slavery]], [[child labour]], colonial tyranny, [[refugee|refugee crisis]] and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the [[mandate system]] put the colonial powers under international observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=Susan|title=Back to the League of Nations|date=October 2007|publisher=American Historical Review|page=1091|jstor=40008445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David Kennedy]] portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalised", as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987}}

The principal Allies in the Second World War (the UK, the USSR, France, the U.S., and the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]) became permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 1946; in 1971, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] replaced the Republic of China (then only in control of [[Taiwan]]) as permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]], and in 1991 the [[Russian Federation]] assumed the seat of the dissolved USSR.

Decisions of the Security Council are binding on all members of the UN, and unanimous decisions are not required, unlike in the League Council. Permanent members of the Security Council can wield a veto to protect their vital interests.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=278–281}}

==History==
The organization was formed in 1994 by [[Michael Hill (activist)|Michael Hill]] and others, including attorney [[Jack Kershaw]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?n=jack-kershaw&amp;pid=145402616&amp;fhid=4485 Jack Kershaw Obituary&lt;/ref&gt;  The League of the South was named in reference to the League of United Southerners, a group organized in 1858 to shape Southern public opinion and the [[Lega Nord]] (Northern League), a very successful [[populism|populist]] movement in [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name="los-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dixienet.org/rights/faq.shtml|title=League of the South FAQ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410180433/http://dixienet.org/rights/2013/faq_frequently_asked_questions.php|archive-date=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LOS' first meeting was represented with a group of 40 men, 28 of whom formed an organization then known as The Southern League. The name was changed to The League of the South in 1996 in order to avoid confusion with the minor league baseball organization also known as The Southern League. There were Southern professors among them.  Michael Hill was the leader and still is. He was a British history professor and specialist in [[Celts|Celtic history]] at [[Stillman College]], which is considered to be a historically black school in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], Ala. However, Hill has since left his teaching position.&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/league-south&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the group supported [[Pat Buchanan]] and the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buchanan's Bid Transforms the Reform Party; Candidate's Stands Draw Extreme Right Support|last=Edsall|first=Thomas B. |work=The Washington Post |date=23 July 2000|page=4|quote=Patrick J. Buchanan's presidential bid has turned the once- centrist Reform Party into a magnet attracting leaders and activists of such extreme right organizations as the National Alliance, the Liberty Lobby, the Council of Conservative Citizens and the League of the South. [...] * Alabama League of the South, a pro-secession organization, recently published an article in its newsletter declaring that "conservatives do have a place to go. The Reform Party is America First on nation-defining issues. . . . It is essential that Buchananism lives on after the 2000 election."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, The League's main publication has been ''The Free Magnolia'', a quarterly tabloid.

==Views==
The League has been described as using [[England|English]] and [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] mythology "belligerently against what is perceived as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] celebration of [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] Southern diversity".&lt;ref name="Whitmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitmore Jones|first1=Suzanne|last2=Monteith|first2=Sharon|title=South to a new place: region, literature, culture|publisher=LSU Pres`|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8071-2840-4|page=341|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9EHgwrwz-AC&amp;pg=PA341|accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walkowitz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walkowitz|first=Daniel J.|title=Memory and the impact of political transformation in public space |year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3364-7|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j36rRnvHXbgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22league+of+the+south%22+%22white+supremacist%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vUvtTPOHHsOFhQeT4tjMDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22league%20of%20the%20south%22%20%22white%20supremacist%22&amp;f=false|author2=Lisa Maya Knauer |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Stephen E.|title=Encyclopedia of modern American extremists and extremist groups|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-313-31502-2|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group believes that the Southern United States should be an independent country ruled by white men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/white-nationalist-group-linked-violent-street-brawls-descends-florida-792854|title=White nationalist group linked to violent street brawls descends on Florida|date=2018-01-27|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 they asked US congress to pay $5 billion in reparations for "property" (which at the time included human beings) which was taken or destroyed by Union forces during the Civil War. The group's legal counsel Jack Kershaw said their proposal included paying reparations to [[African-Americans]] due to the supposed negative effect the end of slavery had on their ancestors: "Blacks were better off in antebellum times in the South than they were anywhere else. [...] They lost a lot too when that lifestyle was destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Group seeks reparations for Civil War 'atrocities'|last=Ahmed|first=Saeed|date=2001-04-13|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
The League defines Southern culture as profoundly [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[pro-life]]. The League describes Southern Culture as being inherently [[Anglo-Celtic]] in nature (originating in the [[British Isles]]), and they believe the South's core [[Anglo-Celtic]] culture should be preserved.&lt;ref name="Core"/&gt;&lt;ref name="los-faq"/&gt;

According to the League, the South has had a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society "impressed upon it".&lt;ref name="Core"/&gt; The ''League's Core Beliefs Statement'' characterizes homosexuality and promiscuity as "perversity" which should be stigmatized.&lt;ref name="Core"/&gt; 

===Politics===
The League believes that what it calls "the Southern people" have the right to [[secession|secede]] from the United States, and that they "must throw off the yoke of imperial [federal, or central government] oppression". The League promotes a Southern Confederation of sovereign, independent States. The League favors strictly limited [[immigration]], opposes [[Standing army|standing armies]] and any regulation whatsoever of firearms.&lt;ref name="Core"/&gt; This proposed independent nation is described by League publications as part of a process to convince "the Southern people" have a unique identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagueofthesouth.net/static/homepage/intro_articles/ls-grand-strategy.html ''The Grand Strategy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233747/http://www.leagueofthesouth.net/static/homepage/intro_articles/ls-grand-strategy.html |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League focuses on recruiting and encouraging "cultural secession".&lt;ref name="los-faq"/&gt;  In November 2006 its representatives attended the First North American Secessionist Convention of secessionists from a different parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Shapiro, "Modern-Day Secessionists Will Hold a Conference on Leaving the Union," ''The New York Sun,'' September 27, 2006, 6; Paul Nussbaum, "Coming together to ponder pulling apart, Latter-day secessionists of all stripes convene in Vermont, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 it co-hosted the Second North American Secessionist Convention in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Bill Poovey,
[http://www.wilmingtonstar.com/article/20071004/NEWS/710040357/-1/State Secessionists Meeting in Tennessee], Associated Press, reprinted in ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 3, 2007; Leonard Doyle, [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article3028714.ece Anger over Iraq and Bush prompts calls for secession from the US] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117122523/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article3028714.ece |date=2008-01-17 }}, Independent, UK, October 4, 2007; [http://wdef.com/news/secessionists_say_second_north_american_secessionists_convention/10/2007 WDEF News 12 Video report on Secessionist Convention], October 3, 2007. The Third North American Secessionist Convention will be held in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], on November 14–16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the group announced it would be holding an event celebrating the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], while honoring [[John Wilkes Booth]] as a hero.&lt;ref name="booth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2015/02/22/league-of-the-south-plans-april-celebration-of-lincolns-assassination-in-maryland/|title=League of the South Plans April Celebration of Lincoln's Assassination|first=Warren|last=Throckmorton}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 2015, it was organized by the vice chairman of the Maryland-Virginia chapter of the League, Shane Long. The LOS's main Facebook page put it bluntly: "Join us in April to celebrate the great accomplishment of John Wilkes Booth. He knew a man who needed killing when he saw him!"&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"/&gt;

The League has attempted to form paramilitary groups on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=League of the South Announces Formation of 'Southern Defense Force'|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/02/06/league-south-announces-formation-%E2%80%98southern-defense-force%E2%80%99|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League of the South is opposed to [[fiat currency]], personal [[income tax]]ation, [[central bank]]ing, [[property tax]]es and most state regulation of business. The League supports [[sales tax]]es and user fees.&lt;ref name="Core"/&gt;

== Charges of racism ==
In the summer of 2000, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) labeled the League of the South a "racist hate group" and issued a report filled with allegations of racist statements, especially by the League's President Michael Hill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/league-of-the-south SPLC article on League of South]; also see [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=845#4 SPLC article on Michael Hill].&lt;/ref&gt; Hill responded by dismissing the label as being politically motivated, claiming that he welcomed the designation as a "badge of honor" and expressing his belief that the designation was designed to discredit the League of the South.&lt;ref&gt;John DeSantis, [http://www.culteducation.com/reference/league/league1.html Civil War revisionism all cited by watchdog group], from The Sun Herald, September 7, 2000, reproduced at Ross Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006 First North American Secessionist Convention, when the issue of the League of the South and racism was raised, Don Kennedy, identified as "a leader of the League of the South", stated: "How can you believe in liberty and discriminate against your neighbor? Equality before the law is something we want, and we're on the record for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nussbaum |first=Paul |date=6 November 2006 |title=Coming Together to Ponder Pulling Apart |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}&lt;/ref&gt; News stories about the Second North American Secessionist Convention also mentioned the SPLC's allegations, as well as skeptical responses from convention attendees. Convention organizer [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] responded: "They call everybody racists. There are, no doubt, racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt, racists everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Poovey, Associated Press, October 3, 2007; Leonard Doyle, Independent, UK, October 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]] Hill wrote on the League's website that "In a free &amp; independent South, Islam would be banned, Muslims deported, and all mosques closed down. The ownership of firearms, including military grade, would be encouraged for all Southern citizens in order to protect the public from such incidents as occurred overnight in Orlando, Florida".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenz|first1=Ryan|title=U.S. Racists Respond to Mass Shooting at LGBT Nightclub In Orlando|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/06/12/us-racists-respond-mass-shooting-lgbt-nightclub-orlando|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 decision, the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled that a blog post describing a family as white supremacist, based on a photo  showing a League of the South bumper sticker on the family car, was not defamatory because it was an opinion based on disclosed facts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/362729251/Weidlich-v-Rung ''Weidlich v. Rung'', 2017 WL 4862068 (Tenn. App.  Oct. 26, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The League's Board of Directors is composed of Michael Hill, Mark Thomey, Mike Crane, Sam Nelson, and John Cook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dixienet.org/rights/boardmembers.shtml The League's website]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the founding members were [[Thomas Fleming (political writer)|Thomas Fleming]], [[Thomas Woods]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Applebome, Peter|title=Could the Old South Be Resurrected?; Cherished Ideas of the Confederacy (Not Slavery) Find New Backers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/07/arts/could-old-south-be-resurrected-cherished-ideas-confederacy-not-slavery-find-new.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|website=nytimes.com|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=28 September 2016|date=7 March 1998|quote=...Mr. Woods, one of the founding members of the League of the South.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/02/21/last_of_the_confederates/|title=Last of the Confederates|last=Young|first=Cathy|date=February 21, 2005|website=The Boston Globe|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2005/06/01/behind-the-jeffersonian-veneer|title=Behind the Jeffersonian Veneer|last=Young|first=Cathy|date=2005-06-01|website=Reason|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grady McWhiney]], [[Clyde N.

The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]] holds '''elections''' to its [[unicameral]] legislative body, the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]. The maximum period between general elections of the assembly is five years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=L09.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779753659&amp;display=html |title=Legislative Assembly Act|year=1983|publisher=Queen's Printer|accessdate=March 17, 2011|at=Section 3(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsalberta.ab.ca/Public%20Website/faq.htm|title=Common Questions|author=[[Elections Alberta]]|year=2008|publisher=Elections Alberta|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant Governor]] is able to call one at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Act|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=E01.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779733903|work=Province of Alberta|publisher=Alberta Queen's Printer|accessdate=April 9, 2011|author=Office Consolidation|year=2000}}&lt;br&gt;'''1.1.1.nn''' ""writ" means a writ of election issued by the Chief Electoral Officer pursuant to an order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council."&lt;br&gt;'''39.0''' "Every election shall be commenced by the passing of an order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council"&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] has typically asked the Lieutenant Governor to call the election in the fourth or fifth year after the preceding election. The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.

To date, no political party has returned to power in Alberta after being removed in a previous election. The province has been ruled by four "dynasties": the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] (1905–1921); the [[United Farmers of Alberta#Political history|United Farmers of Alberta]] (1921–1935), the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]] (1935–1971), and the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative (PC) Association]] (1971–2015). No [[minority government]] has ever been elected.  Thus, Alberta can be said to have continuously had a [[dominant-party system]] for its entire political history, though the dominant party has changed over time. In 2015, the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|NDP]] were elected to government for the first time in Alberta's history, ending the longest political dynasty in Canada.

Alberta's [[Alberta general election, 1905|first election]] was fought in 25 single-member [[first past the post]] districts, and like other Canadian jurisdictions at the time, introduced double-member constituencies in [[Edmonton (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton]] and [[Calgary (provincial electoral district)|Calgary]] in [[Alberta general election, 1909|1909]] to accommodate their population. These were both broken up into three single-member districts by [[Alberta general election, 1917|1917]], as the overall number of districts increased rapidly.

The [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] government introduced five-member [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921]], and briefly made [[Medicine Hat (provincial electoral district)|Medicine Hat]] a double-member district. Because each voter in the cities was given five votes, the Liberal party was defeated despite winning a higher total number of votes than the [[United Farmers of Alberta|United Farmers]], who had much higher support in the rural single-member districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/albertas-political-dynasties/article24255480/|title=The PC dynasty falls: Understanding Alberta’s history of one-party rule|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFA government, which had campaigned on electoral reform, introduced [[alternative vote]] (AV) in the rural constituencies in [[Alberta general election, 1926|1926]]. Edmonton and Calgary were also converted to [[single transferable vote]] (STV) districts, where exhaustive vote transfers resulted in roughly proportional results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lop.parl.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2016-06-e.html?cat=government#txt34|title=Electoral Systems and Electoral Reform in Canada and Elsewhere: An Overview|last=Barnes|first=André|date=11 January 2016|work=Library of Parliament|access-date=2018-07-12|last2=Lithwick|first2=Dara|location=Ottawa|language=en-CA|last3=Virgint|first3=Erin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704034822/https://lop.parl.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2016-06-e.html?cat=government#txt34|archive-date=2018-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These parallel systems, STV in the cities and AV in the rest of the province, lasted until [[Ernest Manning]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government abolished both for the [[Alberta general election, 1959|1959 election]], without public consultations or a referendum. This broke the urban constituencies into single-member districts and reintroduced first past the post across the province, which remains the system used in Alberta and throughout Canada.

'''Lord High Commissioner''' is the style of [[high commissioner|High Commissioner]]s, i.e. direct representatives of the monarch, in three cases in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the United Kingdom, two of which are no longer extant. Consequently, the remaining office is often known in short simply as the Lord High Commissioner.

==Ecclesiastic: Church of Scotland==
{{main article|Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland}}

The lord high commissioner to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] is the [[British sovereign]]'s personal representative to the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]] (the Kirk), reflecting the latter's role as the [[national church]] of [[Scotland]], and the Sovereign's role as a member of that Church.

==Historical political offices==
===Scottish Parliament===
See [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland]]
===Ionian Islands Protectorate===
There were ten incumbents in 1815–1863, representing the British [[protectorate|protecting power]] to the ''United States of the Ionian Islands'' as a federal [[Septinsular Republic]] of seven formerly Venetian (see [[Ionian Islands under Venetian rule]]) Ionian islands (Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura, Ithaca, Cerigo and Paxos), officially a [[joint protectorate]] of the Allied Christian Powers, de facto a UK [[amical protectorate]], as established under the 1815 [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]].
The office ceased when the islands were integrated in independent Greece in 1864.

The incumbents were:
*1815–1823: Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] 
*1823–1832: Sir [[Frederick Adam]]
*1832–1835: [[George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent|The Lord Nugent]]
*1835–1840: Sir [[Howard Douglas]]
*1840–1843: [[James Alexander Stewart Mackenzie]]
*1843–1849: [[John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton|The Lord Seaton]]
*1849–1855: Sir [[Henry George Ward]]
*1855–1859: Sir [[John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar|John Young]]
*1859–1863: Sir [[Henry Knight Storks]]

In addition, between November 1858 and March 1859, [[William Ewart Gladstone]] served as high commissioner extraordinary to determine the political future of the Ionian Islands. He recommended that the Ionian Islands remain under British protection.  However, when the [[Bavaria]]n-born [[King of Greece]], [[Otto I of Greece|Otto I]], was deposed and replaced by the [[Anglophile]] king [[George I of Greece|George I]], the Ionian Islands were ceded to Greece, ending the position of lord high commissioner.

Dr. Lu (Mabel) Miao is the Co-founder, Vice President and Secretary-General of the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), a Beijing-based premier non-governmental Chinese think tank. In ten years under the leadership of Dr. Miao and the other Co-founder Dr. Wang Huiyao, CCG has grown from a small research center with a limited staff into China’s largest independent think tank boasting over 100 full-time research and professional staff positions. Through her vision and unwavering dedication, she helped build a strong foundation for the organization’s research and policy advisory capacities over areas of international migration, global trade and investment relations, and global governance. Beijing’s recent decision to establish two new state apparatus: the National Immigration Administration and the International Development Agency, testifies to the think tank’s unique policy advocacy capability in the Chinese context.

She also chairs the organizing committees of the China and Globalization Forum and the China Outbound Forum, CCG’s two annual flagship conferences attended by the nation’s business elites, opinion leaders, and senior government officials. She is also a member of the prestigious B20 China Business Council. In June 2018, she was awarded “Management Excellence Award” by China Management Science Society.

The idea originated in an era of realignment among the Armenians who were unhappy that the area, inhabited predominantly by an Armenian population remains under the jurisdiction of [[Azerbaijan]]. From the 1970s, with the support of the first secretary of the Central Committee of Communist Party of [[Azerbaijan SSR]], [[Heydar Aliyev]], a policy of settling [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|NKAO]] by [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] was being implemented. The [[Sumgait pogrom|Armenian pogroms in Sumgait]] and [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|Baku]] only exacerbated these trends, which led to military clashes between troops of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] and the forces of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army]] (Artsakh).

'''Michael Ableman''' is an American-Canadian author, organic farmer, educator, and advocate for [[sustainable agriculture]]. Michael has been farming organically since the early 1970s and is considered one of the pioneers of the organic farming and urban agriculture movements. He is a frequent lecturer to audiences all over the world and the winner of numerous awards for his work. Ableman is the author of four trade published books: ''From the Good Earth: A celebration of growing food around the world; On Good Land: The autobiography of an urban farm; A farmer's journey in search of real food and the people who grow it'', and most recently ''Street Farm; Growing Food, Jobs, and Hope on the Urban Frontier.'' Michael Ableman is the founder of the [http://www.fairviewgardens.org/about/history/ Center for Urban Agriculture at Fairview Gardens in Goleta, California] where he farmed for 20 years; co-founder and director of [[Sole Food Street Farms]] and the charity Cultivate Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia; and founder and director of the Center for Arts, Ecology and Agriculture based at his family home and farm on [[Salt Spring Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelableman.com|title=Michael Ableman {{!}} Michael Ableman|website=www.michaelableman.com|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ableman originally intended to become a photographer. However, in 1972 he joined an agrarian commune east of Ojai, California where he was to eventually manage {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of pear and apple orchards.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesunmagazine.org/_media/article/pdf/330_Ableman.pdf |title=Earthly Delights: Cultivating A New Agricultural Revolution |accessdate=2009-02-24 |work=The Sun Magazine |publisher= |last=Cooper |first=Arnie |date=June 2003 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a time managing a nursery on the coast north of Santa Barbara, in 1981 Ableman took a job grafting orange trees at Fairview Gardens.  When the previous manager left, Ableman remained, "farm-sitting," until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;

Under Ableman's leadership, the farm was saved from development and preserved under one of the earliest and most unusual active agricultural conservation easements of its type in the country.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt;

A frequent speaker at conferences throughout North America, Ableman gave a plenary presentation on the future of farming at the [[Bioneers]] conference in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Collective Heritage Institute (2007) [https://secure.bioneers.org/view/2005audio_viewlist Bioneers 2005 Conference Catalogue]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved on 2009-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ableman lives with his family on an organic farm on [[Saltspring Island, British Columbia|Saltspring Island]], [[British Columbia]].
Ableman now lives and farms at the historic 120-acre [[Foxglove Farm]] where he also directs the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130511164753/http://www.foxglovefarmbc.ca/programs/about-the-centre/ Center For Arts, Ecology, and Agriculture].

Michael, along with [[Seann Dory]] co-founded North America's largest Urban Agriculture project, [[Sole Food Street Farms]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]].  Sole Food transforms vacant urban land into street farms that grow artisan quality fruits and vegetables and provides jobs to residents in the downtown Eastside of Vancouver who face for whatever reason challenges to employment.

Michael Ableman and Seann Dory were brought together around a half-acre parking lot on Hastings and Hawks streets on the downtown east-side of Vancouver. Seann wanted to grow food and employ people from the neighborhood, Michael had the experience to make it happen.

Together they forged a working relationship and ultimately developed a very ambitious plan to create urban production farms throughout Vancouver that would employ individuals working through the challenges of material poverty, addiction, and mental illness while generating large quantities of food.

==Foxglove Farm==
Foxglove Farm is a 120-acre [[organic farm]] on [[Salt Spring Island]] in [[British Columbia, Canada]] owned by Ableman. Foxglove Farm is home to the Centre for Arts, Ecology and Agriculture which specializes in agricultural and culinary arts workshops.

The '''Ministry of Agriculture, Agrifood, and Forestry''' ({{lang-fr|Ministère de l'agriculture, de l'agroalimentaire et de la forêt}}) of France is the governmental body charged with [[regulation]] and policy for [[agriculture]], [[food]], and [[forestry]].

The Ministry's headquarters are in the Hôtel de Villeroy, at 78 Rue de Varenne in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://agriculture.gouv.fr/mentions-legales Mentions légales]." Ministry of Agriculture. 8 June 2007. Retrieved 6 May 2011.

Prior to 21 June 2012, the Ministry's remit was somewhat different; its full title was '''Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries, Rural Affairs and Spatial Planning''' ({{lang-fr|Ministère de l'Agriculture, de l'Alimentation, de la Pêche, de la Ruralité et de l'Aménagement du territoire}}).

The regional directorates for food, agriculture and forests (DRAAFs) oversee the implementation of policies for agriculture, food (particularly health safety), aquaculture and forests. Their missions cover the content and organisation of agricultural education. They contribute to employment policy in the fields of farming, agri-food, forestry and freshwater aquaculture.&lt;ref&gt;booklet linked below&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

'''Physicians in the United States Congress''' have been a small minority, but substantially overrepresent the number of practicing physicians in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total Professionally Active Physicians|url=http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-active-physicians/|publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=September 30, 2014|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of physicians serving and running for Congress has risen over the last 50 years from 5 in 1960, down to a nadir of 2 in 1990, to a maximum of 21 in 2013 and a  decrease to 14 in 2017. Possible explanations for this development have been increasing [[Health care finance in the United States|health care spending]], increased [[health care reform debate in the United States]], leading up to the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|Healthcare Reform Act]].

In public opinion research by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) from 2013, voters rated physicians expertise in health care, "understanding of the problems facing our [[healthcare industry]], including the bureaucratic red tape that is strangling [[health care providers]] and driving up the [[Health care prices in the United States|cost of health care]] for most Americans" as most convincing statement of a physician candidate for Congress. Physicians in Congress have received large [[campaign contribution]]s from health care [[trade association]]s and from peers through physician associations such as the AMA.

==History ==
In 1776, 11 percent of signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] were physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford GE|title=Physician Signers of the Declaration of Independence|year=1976|publisher=Science History Publications|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise two (5 percent) of the 39 individuals crafting the [[US Constitution]] in 1787 were physicians.&lt;ref name="JAMA1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jameson|first=MG|title=Physicians and American political leadership|journal=JAMA|year=1983| volume=249|pages=929–930|doi=10.1001/jama.249.7.929}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the first 100 years of Congress (1789–1889) 252 (or 4.6 percent) of 5405 members were physicians.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraus|first=Chad K|author2=Thomas A. Suarez|title=Is There a Doctor in the House?... Or the Senate? Physicians in US Congress, 1960-2004|journal=JAMA|date=November 3, 2004|volume=292|issue=17|pages=2125–2129 |doi=10.1001/jama.292.17.2125|pmid=15523073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st century===
The number of physicians serving and running for Congress has risen over the last 50 years from 5 in 1960, down to 3 in 1970 and a nadir of 2 in 1990 up to 10 (2000)&lt;ref name=JAMA/&gt; to a maximum of 21, including one female physician, in 2013,&lt;ref name=ama13&gt;{{cite web|title=Physicians of the 113th Congress|url=http://www.patientsactionnetwork.com/physicians-of-the-113th-congress/|website=Patient Action network|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=May 28, 2015|date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2015, there were 18, and as of 2017 15 physicians.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt; and a small decrease to 15 in 2017.
 
Physicians in the US Congress have been a small minority, but they substantially overrepresent the number of practicing physicians in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total Professionally Active Physicians|url=http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-active-physicians/|publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=September 30, 2014|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Possible explanations for the increase since the 1990s have been increasing [[Health care finance in the United States|health care spending]],&lt;ref name="focus"/&gt; increased [[health care reform debate in the United States]], leading up to the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|Healthcare Reform Act]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Motivations==
[[Tom Coburn]] said, "physicians have watched the profession undergo tremendous realignments that are shifting doctors' responsibilities away from patient care, changes they attribute to the government's inefficacy".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Jim McDermott was quoted as saying "They want to have their hands right there on the handle so they can pull it one way or another."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Physicians "balked at the idea of lawmakers with no medical experience making decisions that could upend the profession", per Andy Harris.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Kelley Paul, wife of Rand Paul said in 2015 when he made his 2016 White House bid, "Being a physician gives Rand a unique perspective in Washington, simply because he's trained to diagnose a problem and find a solution." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jordyn Phelps|title=Rand Paul Makes 2016 White House Bid Official: 'We Have Come To Take Our Country Back'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rand-paul-makes-2016-white-house-bid-official/story?id=30135296|accessdate=April 15, 2015|work=ABC news|date=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party membership===
In 2013, three quarters of physicians in Congress were Republican,&lt;ref name=ama13/&gt; and 80% as of 2017.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt; As a possible reason [[Jim McDermott]] offered, "politically conservative physicians were more likely to chafe at the direction of changes in health care, with greater oversight by the government and a more regulated role for the private sector. It's a fundamental debate about what is in the public good."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

During the 2016 cycle the AMA [[political action committee]] spent $2 million with "direct contributions to 348 physician-friendly [Congressional] candidates (58% Republican and 46% Democratic)".&lt;ref name="ampac"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ampaconline.org/about-us/ampac-election-report/ |title=The 2016 Cycle AMPAC Election Report |date=n.d. |access-date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender, geography and medical specialty===
Of the 27 physicians in Congress since 2005, 93% have been men, which is in stark contrast to 70% male physicians in general, 63% were from the South (vs 35% of all Congressional members) and 26% were surgeons (vs 11% of all US physicians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldenberg |first=MN |url=https://sma.org/southern-medical-journal/article/house-calls-physicians-in-the-us-congress-2005-2015/ |title=House Calls: Physicians in the US Congress, 2005-2015. |journal=Southern Medical Journal |date=November 2015 |volume=108 |issue=11 |pages=657–61 |doi=10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
In 2013, the AMA funded 3 focus groups of voters across the country and an online survey to research [[public opinion]] on physicians as Congressional candidates. The top scoring potential message for a physician was to link back to health care [[expertise]] "Because physicians work in health care on a daily basis, they bring a clear understanding of the problems facing our [[healthcare industry]], including the bureaucratic red tape that is strangling [[health care providers]] and driving up the [[Health care prices in the United States|cost of health care]] for most Americans."&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ampaconline.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Physicians-as-Candidates-Presentation.pdf |title=Physicians as Candidates Program- Key findings of research conducted in April &amp; May 2013 on behalf of AMPAC's Physicians as Candidates Research Program |date=September 2014 |website=AMPAC |publisher=AMA |at=page 27 |format=PowerPoint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidates, 2014===
Senate candidates in 2014 included "an obstetrician in North Carolina, [[Milton R. Wolf]], a radiologist in Kansas, a liver disease specialist in Louisiana, and Representatives [[Paul Broun]] and [[Phil Gingrey]] in Georgia, all of them Republicans. At least 26 more physicians were running for the House, some for re-election." per a ''New York Times'' article from March 2014.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Is There a Doctor in the House? Yes, 17. And 3 in the Senate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/politics/doctors-confident-in-their-healing-powers-rush-for-congress.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2013|author=Jeremy W. Peters |accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==113th Congress (2013–2015)==
From 2013 to 2015 there were 20 physicians in U.S.Congress, 19 of whom were male and 16 were members of the Republican party.

'''Pidgeon Pagonis''' (born 1986) is an [[intersex]] American activist, writer, artist, and consultant.&lt;ref name="queerav-oct2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Intersex Activist and Artist Pidgeon Pagonis|url=https://thequeerav.com/interview-intersex-activist-pidgeon/|website=The Queer AV|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an advocate for [[intersex human rights]] and against nonconsensual [[intersex medical interventions]].&lt;ref name="nbc-may2016" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Pagonis was born in 1986 in [[Chicago, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="windy-oct2016" /&gt; and has Mexican and Greek ancestry.&lt;ref name="queerav-oct2016" /&gt; As a child, Pagonis, who is queer and [[nonbinary]] and uses ''they/them'' pronouns,&lt;ref name="cnn-apr2014"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kat Kinsman|title=Intersex dating: Finding love across the intersection|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/15/living/intersex-dating-relate/index.html|accessdate=January 8, 2017|agency=CNN|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ef-jun29-2016"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pidgeon Pagonis|title=7 Ways Adding 'I' to the LGBTQA+ Acronym Can Miss the Point|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/intersex-lgbtq-misses-the-point/|website=[[Everyday Feminism]]|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was diagnosed with [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS).&lt;ref name="paper-aug2016"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hilary Weaver|title=Meet Chicago's White-House-Honored Intersex Activist, Pidgeon Pagonis|url=http://www.papermag.com/meet-chicagos-white-house-honored-intersex-activist-pidgeon-pagonis-1967101092.html|website=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were not told of this condition, but instead were raised as a girl, told that they had [[ovarian cancer]] (when they in fact had no ovaries, but internal [[testes]]), and subjected to a series of surgeries to alter their genitalia.&lt;ref name="nbc-may2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paper-aug2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-apr2014" /&gt;

They learned about intersex traits during their freshman year in college, while attending a lecture at [[DePaul University]]. They subsequently accessed their own medical records, and learned the truth about their condition.&lt;ref name="paper-aug2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-apr2014" /&gt;

They graduated from DePaul with bachelor's and master's degrees in women and [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name="windy-oct2016" /&gt;

==Activism==
Pagonis joined the advocacy organization [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]] a few years after discovering they were intersex.&lt;ref name="paper-aug2016" /&gt; They became the leadership coordinator of the youth program at interACT.&lt;ref name="paper-aug2016" /&gt; In 2013, Pagonis testified with [[Mauro Cabral]], [[Natasha Jiménez]] and Paula Sandrine Machado before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] about the medical interventions they were subjected to as an intersex child.&lt;ref name="interact-apr2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pursuit of Happiness in Our Original Beautiful Bodies: Pidgeon Pagonis' Recent Testimony before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|url=http://interactadvocates.org/the-pursuit-of-happiness-in-our-original-beautiful-bodies-pidgeon-pagonis-recent-testimony-before-the-inter-american-commission-on-human-rights/|website=interACT|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newcity-4may2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Workman|first1=Michael|title=The Conversation: Pidgeon Pagonis and the Fight for Intersex Rights|url=http://www.newcity.com/2017/05/04/pidgeon-pagonis-and-the-fight-for-intersex-rights/|accessdate=May 20, 2017|newspaper=[[Newcity]]|date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also featured in the 2012 documentary ''[[Intersexion]]''.&lt;ref name="windy-oct2016" /&gt;

In 2014, Pagonis created a documentary of their own, ''The Son They Never Had: Growing Up Intersex'', which they tour around the country, advocating against nonconsensual "corrective surgeries".&lt;ref name="windy-oct2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nwu-oct2016"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Leah Dunlevy|title=Intersex activist calls for increased awareness about 'corrective surgeries'|url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2016/10/14/campus/intersex-activist-calls-for-increased-awareness-about-corrective-surgeries/|accessdate=January 8, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Northwestern]]|date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was published in a [[bioethics]] journal, ''[[Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics]]''.&lt;ref name="bioethics-2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Georgiann Davis|authorlink1=Georgiann Davis|author2=Pidgeon Pagonis|title=Normalizing Intersex: The Transformative Power of Stories|journal=[[Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics]]|date=2015|volume=5|issue=2|pages=103–106|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/589209/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voices-2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pidgeon Pagonis|title=Voices: Personal Stories from the Pages of NIB|date=2016|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|pages=18–21|url=http://www.nibjournal.org/news/documents/Voices_2016_OA_FINAL-withOLOS_version_001.pdf|accessdate=January 8, 2017|chapter=The Son They Never Had|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109185051/http://www.nibjournal.org/news/documents/Voices_2016_OA_FINAL-withOLOS_version_001.pdf|archivedate=January 9, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Son They Never Had'' was also shown at the [[Leeds]] Queer Film Festival in the [[UK]] in March 2017.&lt;ref name="lqff-mar2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leeds Queer Film Festival 2017 Film Programme|url=https://www.leedsqueerfilmfestival.co.uk/programme|website=Leeds Queer Film Festival|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Pagonis created the [[hashtag activism|hashtag campaign]] #intersexstories for [[Intersex Awareness Day]]. The campaign attracted a huge following, with many intersex people sharing their stories.&lt;ref name="nbc-may2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzfeed-oct2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sarah Karlan|title=People Took To Twitter To Share Their Deeply Personal #IntersexStories|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/people-shared-their-personal-intersexstories-on-twitter-for|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagonis also appeared in a popular [[BuzzFeed]] video about intersex bodies, identities and experiences.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed-mar2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lizz Warner|author2=Jen Ruggirello|title=What It's Like To Be Intersex|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizzwarner/what-its-like-to-be-intersex|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eo-apr2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniela Capistrano|title=7 Up-and-Coming Stars Who Are Changing How We Think About Gender|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/163327_7_up_and_coming_stars_who_are_changing_how_we_think_about_gender/|website=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pagonis appeared on the cover of the January 2017 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' "Gender Revolution" issue. They were one of the intersex activists who wrote in expressing concern that being intersex was defined by the magazine as a [[Disorders of sex development|disorder]].

The '''Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command''' ({{lang-ar|الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين – القيادة العامة}}) or '''PFLP-GC''' is a [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian nationalist]] militant organisation based in [[Syria]]. It was founded in 1968 by [[Ahmed Jibril]] after splitting from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) based on claims that it was producing impotent intellectuals, and not making any meaningful progress in terms of armed struggle to liberate Palestine. In the 1970s and 1980s it was involved in the [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon]] and launched a number of attacks against [[Israel]]i soldiers and civilians; including the [[Avivim school bus massacre]] (1970), the bombing of [[Swissair Flight 330]] (1970), the [[Kiryat Shmona massacre]] (1974) and the [[Night of the Gliders]] (1987). Since the late 1980s it has been largely inactive, but during the [[Syrian Civil War]] it has been fighting on the side of the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8BG16X20121217?irpc=932|title=Syrian rebels take over Palestinian camp in Damascus|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has a paramilitary wing called the Jihad Jibril Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=510710 "PFLP-GC divided on Syria stance"]. [[Ma'an News Agency]], 9 August 2012. Retrieved 26 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jibril joined with [[George Habash]] in 1967 as more or less an equal partner in the PFLP leadership. When he quickly tired of the group's lack of field initiative, he was therefore still able to leave while retaining a significant retainer of his previous supporters. One of his most hated enemies within the group, [[Naif Hawatmeh]], unintentionally provided him with the pretext: While Jibril wrestled with Habash over why the Popular Front was so dependent on theoretical discussion rather than armed struggle, Hawatmeh tried to influence the PFLP in the direction of an ideology as leftist as possible.

Jibril decided that Hawatmeh's theorizing was chafing the PFLP and producing an organization of impotent intellectuals, and declared as such when he formed the General Command. Habash, he stated, had become a puppet to the professors of the exile, the elite among the refugees who were well-educated and wealthy, yet preached class revolution to the masses in the camps.

==History==

=== Formation ===
The PFLP-GC was founded in 1968 as a Syrian-backed splinter group from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP). It was - and still is - headed by Secretary-General [[Ahmed Jibril]], also known by the ''[[kunya (arabic)|kunya]]'' "Abu Jihad" (not to be confused with [[Khalil al-Wazir]], the head of Fatah's armed wing who used the same ''nom de guerre''), a former military officer in the [[Military of Syria|Syrian Army]] who had been one of the PFLP's early leaders. The PFLP-GC declared that its primary focus would be military, not political, complaining that the PFLP had been devoting too much time and resources to [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophizing.

Although the group was initially a member of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), it always opposed [[Yasser Arafat]] and opposes any political settlement with [[Israel]]; for this reason, it has never participated in the [[Oslo Accords|peace process]]. The PFLP-GC left the PLO in 1974 to join the [[Rejectionist Front]], protesting what they saw as the PLO's move towards an accommodation with Israel in the Arafat-backed [[Palestinian Liberation Organization#Ten Point Program|Ten Point Program]] of the [[Palestinian National Council]] (PNC). Unlike most of the organizations involved in the Rejectionist Front, the PFLP-GC never resumed its role within the PLO.

From the start, the PFLP-GC was more concentrated on means than ends. They never depended on a political platform; most of their recruits were young, exiled, poor, illiterate, and angry. The General Command promised a gun in every hand, and the means to write their own narrative rather than read and praise those of others as the better off exiles did in universities in Europe.

Jibril still used iron discipline to keep his fighters loyal and professional, and the General Command's insurgents were as a result for decades considered the best trained of any of the Palestinian guerrilla groups. What may have helped Jibril was Hawatmeh's own 1969 defection from the PFLP to form the [[Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PDFLP, later without the "Popular"), after Habash tried to compensate for some of the problems that had caused Jibril's exit.

===1970s and 1980s===
{{main|Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict}}
{{Further|Night of the Gliders}}
In the 1970s and 1980s, the group carried out a number of attacks on Israeli soldiers and [[civilians]], and gained notoriety for using spectacular means. After 1969 Habash could no longer claim that he was the head of the true organization, as all three of the group's original triumvirate were now separate. Nevertheless, due to the PFLP's spectacular successes, including the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]] (September 1970), [[Lod Airport Massacre]] (1971), and coordination with the [[Fatah]]-backed [[Black September (group)|Black September]] group in the [[Munich massacre|Munich Olympic killings]] ( 5–6 September 1972), Habash continued to be the first among equals among the Rejectionist Front, the groups that refused any permanent settlement in a framework other than military victory.

From 1970-73, the group targeted a number of aircraft; typically having members seduce single young women and promise them a life of adventure and love - often while getting them addicted to drugs - before asking them to carry some cash and a mysterious package onto a flight to Tel Aviv. While the girls assumed they were helping their "boyfriends" pass drugs, they were unknowingly carrying explosives.&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt;

On 21 February 1970, the group used its first [[barometric triggers]] to detonate two in-flight airliners nearly simultaneously. A [[Swissair]] flight to [[Tel Aviv]] that fell in [[Aargau]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]], killing 41, and an [[Austrian Airlines]] flight from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv, which actually failed to destroy the aircraft, which made an [[emergency landing]].&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite book|last = Katz|first = Samuel M. |title = Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the manhunt for the al-Qaeda terrorists|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PFLP-GC was also responsible for the [[Avivim school bus massacre]] in 1970 and the [[Kiryat Shmona massacre]] in 1974.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Jibril focused on carving out a stake of the PLO recruitment in Lebanese refugee camps. While Fatah absorbed enormous casualties in the 1982 Lebanon War, the General Command succeeded in surviving, and at the end retained most of its previous manpower.

In one of its most famous attacks, a PFLP-GC guerrilla landed a motorized [[hang glider]] (apparently supplied by Libya)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meib.org/articles/0209_s1.htm "Sponsoring Terrorism: Syria and the PFLP-GC" (September 2002)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711152214/http://www.meib.org/articles/0209_s1.htm |date=11 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; near an Israeli army camp near Kiryat Shemona in Northern Israel on 25 November 1987. He succeeded to kill six soldiers and wounded several others, before being shot dead himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1&amp;id=548182002|title=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action has been seen by some as providing the catalyst for the eruption of the [[First Intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trend.infopartisan.net/trd1200/t051200.html|title=Die linke Opposition in der PLO und in den besetzten Gebiete|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PFLP-GC has not been involved in major attacks on Israeli targets since the early 1990s, but it reportedly cooperated with the [[Hezbollah]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in South Lebanon.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Supporters of the Libyan convicted of the [[Lockerbie bombing]] have suggested the PFLP-GC was in fact responsible.&lt;ref&gt;The German Connection, Emerson &amp; Duffy, New York Times Magazine, 11 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and 2000s ===
Following the rise of Hamas in the 1987–1991 [[First Intifada]] among Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jibril found an able ally in resisting the trend started by Fatah leader [[Yasser Arafat]] toward a negotiated settlement to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. By that time, the Rejectionist Front was composed primarily of leftist groups, among them the PFLP, DFLP, General Command, PLF, and numerous other small factions. However, the members of these PLO groups were limited in their ability to confront Fatah, which never lost its supremacy within the umbrella organization. The only group that waged uninterrupted attrition against Arafat was the [[Fatah Revolutionary Council]] led by maverick hardliner Sabri al-Banna (better known as [[Abu Nidal]]), who was viewed by other Palestinian organizations as not so much a guerrilla as a pure criminal with no higher goal than deposing the moderates at the head of the PLO.

Though many Palestinians still were opposed to compromising on the principle of defeating Israel by armed struggle, the existing groups could not channel their desires, as many of them were led by the elite among the exile population, who were detached from the reality of the refugee camps, be they in the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan. Many leaders of Palestinian groups lived in luxurious accommodations throughout the Eastern Bloc, Europe, or various Arab states, especially Syria, Iraq, and Libya. Jibril uniquely insisted on living in a specially designed security bunker in the Lebanon mountains, a hilly terrain that was more attuned to the image of a guerrilla leader than Arafat's mansions in Tunis.

With the emergence of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad throughout the 1980s, Jibril proved more able to cope than Habash and his other allies in the Rejectionist Front. This was enabled by a factor that had nothing to do with his abilities or beliefs: While Habash was a [[Greek Orthodox]] and Hawatmeh a [[Greek Catholic]] Christian, Jibril was a Muslim.

Throughout the 1980s the General Command actively cooperated with the nascent [[Hezbollah]] paramilitary group (made mostly of [[Shia Muslim]]s) dedicated to armed struggle against Israel, as well as with Syria and Iran, both of whom fund and arm Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In the mid-1990s, Jibril held conferences with these groups in Tehran and Damascus in order to achieve tighter coordination of activities, though his organization remained small and its own actions were more concerned with aiding Hezbollah and achieving an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The Israelis never forgot Jibril's spectacular exploits, especially the Night of the Hang Gliders, and used a variety of operations to try and kill him, none successfully, although his son and heir Jihad Ahmed Jibril was assassinated by a car bomb on 20 May 2002, with the identity of the assassins unknown. Due to these activities, the General Command is regarded as the most hard-line of the old insurgent groups, and currently resists the Oslo Accords from its bases in Syria and Lebanon.

===Syrian Civil War===
At the beginning of the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2011, the PFLP-GC was an ally of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] government of Syria. The PFLP-GC was based in [[Yarmouk Camp]] – a district of Damascus that is home to the biggest community of Palestinian refugees in Syria.&lt;ref name=googlenews&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jevFaBhWboO5_Mqrgpk7ycShh4RQ?docId=CNG.493b5bfef777e0c4e6e2103828c1614e.1b1]&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the PFLP-GC's central committee opposed this alliance with the Assad government and resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=jibril-expel&gt;[http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/14427/ "Ahmad Jibril to be expelled from the PLO"]. ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)]]'', 18 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, it helped the [[Syrian Army]] to fight the [[Syrian opposition|Syrian rebels]] in and around Yarmouk.

At the beginning of the war, tensions arose in Yarmouk between the PFLP-GC and anti-government Palestinian residents. On 5 June 2011, a number of Yarmouk residents were [[2011 Israeli border demonstrations|shot dead while protesting at the Israeli border]]. Allegedly angered by the PFLP-GC's refusal to take part in the protests, thousands of mourners burnt down its headquarters in Yarmouk. PFLP-GC members fired on the crowd, killing 14 Palestinians and wounding 43.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=394412 "Report: 14 Palestinians killed in Syria camp"].

On 3 August 2012, 21 civilians were killed when the Syrian Army shelled Yarmouk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/03/230127.html "At least 21 killed in shelling on Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Syria: NGO"]. [[Al Arabiya]], 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian president [[Mahmoud Abbas]] condemned the Syrian Army for shelling the camp and chided the PFLP-GC for dragging Palestinians into the conflict.&lt;ref name=googlenews/&gt;

On 5 December 2012, [[Yarmouk camp fighting (December 2012)|fighting erupted]] in Yarmouk between the Syrian Army and PFLP-GC on one side, and Syrian rebels on the other. The rebels included the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) and a group made up of Palestinians, called Liwa al-Asifa or Storm Brigade. By 17 December, the rebels had won control of Yarmouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=296510|title='Capturing Yarmouk camp another Syrian rebel gain'|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Government and rebel representatives agreed that all armed groups should withdraw from Yarmouk and leave it as a neutral zone. The agreement also said that the PFLP-GC should be dismantled and its weapons surrendered. However, a spokesman for the pro-rebel Palestine Refugee Camp Network said, "the implementation of the truce has been problematic" because of "intermittent" government shelling of Yarmouk and clashes on its outskirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/20/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html "Syrian fight now 'overtly sectarian,' U.N. says"].

Its role in Lebanon after the Syrian Army Left Lebanon in 2005 (see [[Cedar Revolution]]) is uncertain, and it has been involved in a number of clashes with Lebanese security forces. In late October 2005, the [[Military of Lebanon|Lebanese Army]] surrounded camps of the PFLP-GC in a tense standoff, after Lebanese authorities claimed that the PFLP-GC was receiving Syrian arms across the border. The group has come under fierce criticism within Lebanon, accused of acting on Syria's behalf to stir up unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=21365|title=Outrage after PFLP-GC gunmen shoot two|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries [[Indemnity]] Act''' (commonly called the '''Price-Anderson Act''') is a [[United States]] [[federal law]], first passed in 1957 and since renewed several times, which governs liability-related issues for all non-[[military]] nuclear facilities constructed in the United States before 2026. The main purpose of the Act is to partially compensate the nuclear industry against liability claims arising from [[nuclear incident]]s while still ensuring compensation coverage for the general public.  The Act establishes a [[no fault insurance]]-type system in which the first approximately $12.6 billion (as of 2011) is industry-funded as described in the Act. Any claims above the $12.6 billion would be covered by a Congressional mandate to retroactively increase nuclear utility liability or would be covered by the federal government. At the time of the Act's passing, it was considered necessary as an incentive for the private production of [[nuclear power]] — this was because electric utilities viewed the available liability coverage (only $60 million) as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearpowerprocon.org/pop/Price-Anderson.htm Price-Anderson Act]. Nuclear Power Pro/Con. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the Act survived a constitutional challenge in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group]]'' (see [[Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act#Constitutional challenge|below]]).  The Act was last renewed in 2005 for a 20-year period.

==How the law works==

===Funding and procedures===
Power reactor licensees are required by the act to obtain the maximum amount of insurance against nuclear related incidents which is available in the insurance market ({{As of|2017|lc=on}}, $450 million per reactor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Increase in the Maximum Amount of Primary Nuclear Liability Insurance|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/30/2016-31368/increase-in-the-maximum-amount-of-primary-nuclear-liability-insurance|website=Federal Register|accessdate=12 February 2017|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any monetary claims that fall within this maximum amount are paid by the insurer(s). The Price-Anderson fund, which is financed by the reactor companies themselves, is then used to make up the difference. As of September, 2013, each reactor company is obliged to contribute up to $121,255,000 per reactor in the event of an accident with claims that exceed the $450 million insurance limit. {{As of|2013}}, the maximum amount of the fund is approximately $12.61 billion ($121,255,000 X 104 reactors) if all of the reactor companies were required to pay their full obligation to the fund. This fund is not paid into unless an accident occurs. However, fund administrators are required to have contingency plans in place to raise funds using loans to the fund, so that claimants may be paid as soon as possible. Actual payments by companies in the event of an accident are capped at $18,963,000 per year until either a claim has been met, or their maximum individual liability (the $121,255,000 maximum) has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2210- United States Code: Title 42,2210. Indemnification and limitation of liability | LII / Legal Information Institute]. Law.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=NRC-2008-0512  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023112403/http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=NRC-2008-0512 |date=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a maximum combined primary+secondary coverage amount of up to $13.06 billion for a hypothetical single-reactor incident.

If a coverable incident occurs, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) is required to submit a report on the cost of it to the courts and to Congress. If claims are likely to exceed the maximum Price-Anderson fund value, then the President is required to submit proposals to Congress. These proposals must detail the costs of the accident, recommend how funds should be raised, and detail plans for full and prompt compensation to those affected. Under the Act, the administrators of the fund have the right to further charge plants if it is needed. If Congress fails to provide for compensation, claims can be made under the [[Tucker Act]] (in which the government waives its [[sovereign immunity]]) for failure by the federal government to carry out its duty to compensate claimants.

Price-Anderson also covers [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) facilities, private licensees, and their subcontractors including the [[USEC]] uranium enrichment plants, national laboratories and the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]]. Any payments from the fund for accidents arising at DOE facilities come from the US treasury. The fund size for such installations is set by legislation (also at $12.6 billion), rather than being based upon the number of plants contributing to the fund.

Since Price-Anderson was enacted, nuclear insurance pools have paid out about $151 million ($70 million of which was related to the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]]) in claims, while the Department of Energy has paid out $65 million.

=== Alterations to normal civil court procedures ===
The Act makes a number of changes to typical [[Civil procedure|civil court procedures]]:
*[[Jurisdiction]] is automatically transferred to [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] no matter where the accident occurred.
*All claims from the same incident are [[Joinder|consolidated]] into one Federal court, which is responsible for prioritizing payouts and sharing funds equitably should there be a shortfall.
*Companies are expressly forbidden to defend any action for [[damages]] on the grounds that an incident was not their fault.
*An open-ended time limit is applied, which allows claimants three years to file a claim starting from the time they discover damage.
*Individuals are not allowed to claim [[punitive damages]] against companies. (The act makes no provision for punishing companies responsible for an incident, but nuclear licensing regulations specify fines for breaches of safety regulations and criminal charges apply unaffected.)

==History of the Act==

=== Origins ===
The Price-Anderson Act is named for Representative [[Charles Melvin Price]] (D-Ill.) and Senator [[Clinton Presba Anderson]] (D-N.M.), both of whom eventually chaired Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which followed the development of nuclear technology during [[World War II]], had created a framework for operation of nuclear plants under government control. The intention of the government was to apply this technology to civilian industry, especially in using nuclear plants to generate electricity. In 1954 the [[Atomic Energy Act Amendments]] Act removed the government monopoly on operating nuclear plants by creating a licensing system for private operators. The structure of the insurance industry as it existed until 1955 was incapable of providing the extent of coverage needed to adequately address the risks of nuclear power. The "amount of insurance required could not be underwritten at the time by any single or joint company effort".&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

A power plant, [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station|Shippingport]], was eventually constructed, but electric utility executives expressed concerns about limited size of liability coverage offered by the insurance market ($60 million). A nuclear accident of privately held nuclear power appeared to be an impossible barrier since the possible magnitude of claims could bankrupt any electric utility held responsible. Nor could an insurance company offer insurance policies with limits beyond its own resources to pay. Because of these difficulties, it looked like it would be extremely unlikely that electric utilities would want to enter the nuclear power industry.

The potential magnitude of worst-case accidents has been the subject of several major studies, such  as [[WASH-740]], [[WASH-1400]], [[CRAC-II]], and [[NUREG-1150]]. In November 2012, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) published [[State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses]] (SOARCA), which examines potential safety failures with probabilities of "occurring more than once in a million reactor years, or more than once in ten million reactor years for accidents that may bypass containment features."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/research/soar.html|title=NRC: State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA)|date=9 June 2009|publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]]|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1935/|title=State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA) Report (NUREG-1935)|date=7 November 2016|publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]]|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address these issues, Congress introduced the Price-Anderson Act in 1957. The Act required companies to obtain the maximum possible insurance coverage against accidents, determined to be $60 million, and provided a further government commitment of $500 million to cover any claims in excess of the private insurance.  Companies were relieved of any liability beyond the insured amount for any incident involving radiation or radioactive releases regardless of fault or cause. The act was intended to be temporary, and to expire in August 1967 as it was assumed that once the companies had demonstrated a record of safe operation they would be able to obtain insurance in the private market. At the same time, Congress encouraged the insurance industry to develop a way that power plant operators could meet their financial protection responsibilities. The insurance industry responded by creating an insurance pool called American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), which today includes 60 U.S. property and casualty insurance companies who represent some of the largest insurance companies in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnucins.com/History.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707134037/http://www.amnucins.com/History.html |date=2011-07-07 }}. Amnucins.com (2001-09-11). Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extensions ===
By 1966 it had become apparent that the industry would still be unable to obtain adequate private insurance, so the act was extended until 1976. A provision was added to the Act which prevented companies from offering certain defenses to damages claims (particularly defenses which claimed that the accident had not been their fault). A minimum time limit was also introduced (which could be surpassed by state law), giving claimants three years after discovering harm in which to make a claim. The alterations were intended to make the process of obtaining funds from reactor companies easier, and to remove discrepancies in different states where different laws applied. The new provisions only applied to incidents where a significant escape of radioactive material was deemed to have occurred (an ENO, extraordinary nuclear occurrence).

In 1975 the act was extended for 12 years, up until 1987. The total amount of insurance remained the same, but a provision was added requiring each of the 60 or so reactors then in existence to contribute between $2 million and $5 million in the event of an uninsured accident. The insurance ceiling for each individual company was increased to $140 million. These measures eliminated the contribution of the federal government to the insurance pool. However, an explicit commitment was made that in the event of a larger accident, Congress would take whatever actions were necessary to provide full and prompt claims to the public. This included the possibility of additional charges to reactor companies above and beyond the prescribed limits set forth in the Act.

In 1988 the act was extended for 15 years up to August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg1066.pdf |title=Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 ~ P.L. 100-408 |date=August 20, 1988 |series=102 Stat. 1066 ~ House Bill 1414 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/1414 |title=H.R. 1414 ~ Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 |date=March 4, 1987 |series=P.L. 100-408 ~ 102 Stat. 1066 |publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual insurance for each generator was increased to $200 million, and the total fund to $9.5 billion. For each reactor owned, the reactor company was liable to contribute up to $63 million towards compensation for any claim against any company, though this could only be recovered at a maximum rate of $10 million per year. Assessments were to be adjusted for inflation every 5 years. The same level of indemnity was provided for government DOE facilities, while small reactors (education and research oriented) were required to obtain $250,000 insurance and have a government-backed pool of $500 million in the event of accident. This extension provided that all cases resulting from a nuclear accident to be heard in a federal court, rather than local courts.

In February 2002 the act was temporarily extended to December 2003. After some debate in 2003, the Act was extended to 2017. The individual insurance for each site was increased to $300 million while fund contributions per reactor were increased to $95.8 million. In 2005 it was extended again through 2025 via the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].

=== Usage ===

Over the first 43 years of the Price-Anderson Act to 2000, the secondary insurance was not required. A total of $151 million was paid to cover claims (including legal expenses), all from primary insurance, including $71 million for [[Three Mile Island]]. Additionally, the Department of Energy paid about $65 million to cover claims under liability for its own nuclear operations in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/funds-fs.html NRC: Fact Sheet on Nuclear Insurance and Disaster Relief Funds]. Nrc.gov. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional challenge ==
The [[constitutionality]] of the Price-Anderson Act was upheld in June, 1978 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=438&amp;invol=59 link].  The lawsuit challenged the act on two grounds — first, that it violated the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] because it did not ensure adequate compensation for victims of accidents, and that it violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] because it treats nuclear accidents differently from other accidents.

The court concluded:
*''It is clear that Congress' purpose was to remove the economic impediments in order to stimulate the private development of electric energy by nuclear power while simultaneously providing the public compensation in the event of a catastrophic nuclear incident.''
*''The record supports the need for the imposition of a statutory limit on liability to encourage private industry participation and hence bears a rational relationship to Congress' concern for stimulating private industry's involvement in the production of nuclear electric energy.''
*''The Price-Anderson Act does, in our view, provide a reasonably just substitute for the common-law or state tort law remedies it replaces.''
*''The District Court's finding that the Act tends to encourage irresponsibility in matters of safety and environmental protection cannot withstand careful scrutiny, since nothing in the liability-limitation provision undermines or alters the rigor and integrity of the process involved in the review of applications for a license to construct or operate a nuclear power plant, and since, in the event of a nuclear accident the utility itself would probably suffer the largest damages.''
*''We view the congressional assurance of a &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;then&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; $560 million fund for recovery, accompanied by an express statutory commitment, to "take whatever action is deemed necessary [438 U.S. 59, 91] and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences of" a nuclear accident, 42 U.S.C. 2210 (e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), to be a fair and reasonable substitute for the uncertain recovery of damages of this magnitude from a utility or component manufacturer, whose resources might well be exhausted at an early stage.''
*''There is no equal protection violation, since the general rationality of the Act's liability limitation, particularly with reference to the congressional purpose of encouraging private participation in the exploitation of nuclear energy, is ample justification for the difference in treatment between those injured in nuclear accidents and those whose injuries are derived from other causes.''

==Compared to other industries==
US law requires payment of 8 cents per [[barrel (volume)|barrel]] of oil to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for all oil imported or produced. In exchange for the payment, operators of [[oil platform|offshore oil platforms]], among others, are limited in liability to $75 million for damages, which can be paid by the fund, but are not indemnified from the cost of cleanup. As of 2010, before payouts related to the [[Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion]], the fund stood at $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/us/02liability.html Tax on Oil May Help Pay for Cleanup]. May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydroelectric industry is not generally held financially liable for catastrophic incidents such as dam failure or resultant flooding. For example, dam operators were not held liable for the 1977 failure of the [[Teton Dam]] in Idaho that caused approximately $500 million in property damage.&lt;ref name=cilj&gt;Meehan, Taylor. "Lessons from the Price-Anderson nuclear industry indemnity act for future clean energy compensatory models." Conn. Ins. LJ 18 (2011): 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many industries have no explicit liability cap, in practice, liability in such industries may be limited to the assets of the company held to be at fault. In addition, liability can be disputed in the absence of strict liability laws. As a non-power example, after the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]], the [[Union Carbide Corporation]] claimed the accident was caused by sabotage and settled for only $470 million.&lt;ref name=cilj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hazarika|first1=Sanjoy|title=BHOPAL PAYMENTS BY UNION CARBIDE SET AT $470 MILLION|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/15/business/bhopal-payments-by-union-carbide-set-at-470-million.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=New York Times|date=15 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Cost of electricity by source#External costs of energy sources}}
The Price-Anderson Act has been criticized by various think tanks and environmental organizations, including [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], [[Greenpeace International]], [[Public Citizen]] and the [[Cato Institute]]. Public Citizen has been particularly critical of Price-Anderson; it claims that the Act understates the risks inherent in atomic power, does not require reactors to carry adequate insurance, and would therefore result in taxpayers footing most of the bill for a catastrophic accident.&lt;ref name=PublicCitizen&gt;

In 2008 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the value of the subsidy at only $600,000 per reactor per year, or less than one percent of the levelized cost for new nuclear capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-02-nuclear.pdf Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity], pp. 28-29.

The Price-Anderson Act has been used as an example of [[corporate welfare]] by [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref name=Nader_CW/&gt;

Price-Anderson has been criticized by many of these groups due to a portion of the Act that indemnifies Department of Energy and private contractors from nuclear incidents even in cases of gross negligence and willful misconduct (although criminal penalties would still apply). "No other government agency provides this level of taxpayer indemnification to non-government personnel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/cmep/energy_enviro_nuclear/electricity/energybill/articles.cfm?ID=10322 Public Citizen | Energy Program | Energy Program – Price-Anderson Reauthorization in H.R.6: An Insurance Scam for the Nuclear Industry].

Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Department counters those critics by saying that the distinction is irrelevant, since the damage to the public would be the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuccamountain.org/price003.htm Eureka County, Nevada – Yucca Mountain Information Office – Price-Anderson Act Report].

These beyond-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power, as [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, or large [[dam failure]]s in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf Availability of Dam Insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf |date=2016-01-08 }} 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">A '''''pronunciamiento''''' ({{IPA-es|pɾonunθjaˈmjento|lang}}, {{lang-pt|pronunciamento}} {{IPA-pt|pɾunũsiɐˈmẽtu|}}; "proclamation , announcement or declaration") is a form of military rebellion or ''[[coup d'état]]'' particularly associated with [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Latin America]], especially in the 19th century.

== Typology ==

[[File:Pronunciamento en Lisboa.jpg|thumb|300px|Pronunciamiento in [[Lisbon]].]]

The ''pronunciamiento'' is one category of [[praetorianism]]: the practice of military figures acting as political actors in their own right, rather than as the politically-neutral instrument of civilian government.

In a classic ''coup d'état'' a rebel faction which controls some critical element of the armed forces seizes control of the state by a sudden movement, organized and executed in stealth.

A ''pronunciamiento'', in contrast, is by definition a public performance designed to rally public opinion to a dissident faction. A group of military officers, often mid-ranking, ''publicly'' declare their opposition to the current government (head of state and/or cabinet, who may be legally elected civilians or the result of a previous coup).

''Pronunciamientos'' are normally 'bloodless' or close to it, intending to bring about a change in government or regime by ''threatening'' violence and publicly demonstrating the lack of support for a given government, rather than the swift actual violence of a normal coup.

The goal may be, as in the classic coup, to install one of the military rebels in power. But more often its aim is to tip the balance of public opinion so that a a favoured prominent civilian opposition leader might called to form a government.


Stanley Payne characterises the ''pronunciamiento'', in contrast to the "''classic military coup''", thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''The pronunciamiento was sometimes oblique and indirect, consisting of no more than strong statements, encouragements, or threats by powerful generals intended to influence the government’s policy. However, the most spectacular and important pronunciamientos were those that involved some form of force. Ordinarily, the armed pronunciamiento was a revolt by one section of the Armt –sometimes a very small section– which raised the flag of rebellion in its district and hoped that its example would lead other units to rally round, or would at least break the government’s nerve''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and the Military in Spain|last=Payne|first=Stanley|publisher=|year=1967|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Generally, a ''pronunciamento'' originated with a small number of officers motivated by fear of the current government's persecution of political dissidents, or of its perceived inability to resist invasion or revolution. This small group would then spend a preparatory period "sounding out" the larger community of officers to determine if their views are widely shared. After the pronunciamiento the would-be rebel officers then wait for the rest of the armed forces to declare for or against the government.&lt;ref name="Luttwak"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Luttwak, Edward|title=Coup d'État: A Practical Handbook|publisher=Fawcett|location=Greenwich, CT|year=1969|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no fighting at this point; if the rebellion has no support the organizers lose. They may have to flee the country or retire from the armed forces, or they may be arrested, and typically they would face a lenient fate. If the bulk of the armed forces declare in favor of the ''pronunciamiento'' the government resigns. It is similar to a [[vote of no-confidence]], except that it is issued by the armed forces, not by the legislature.

== History ==

The origins of the ''pronunciamiento'' lie in the [[Peninsular War|Spanish and Portuguese resistance to Napoleonic rule]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] created the conditions for the intervention of the military in a [[Plebiscitarianism|plebiscitary]] act of 'no-confidence' on the presumed behalf of the nation. The wars had brought together large groups of ordinary men from all across a given state, while at the same time exposing them en masse to political ideas. Conscription to fight a foreign occupier or invader had the effect of subjecting individuals from different corners of the [[Ancien Régime|multiethnic dynastic state]] to similar experiences, generating a practical sense of belonging to one same 'nation'.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D. 'Armed Forces'. In J Innes and M Philip, ''Re-Imagining Democracy in the Mediterranean, 1780-1860''. Oxford, 2018. p245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spain, A Modern History.|last=Madariaga|first=Salvador|publisher=|year=1961|isbn=|location=Cape|pages=172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After brief experiences of democratic government and constitutional liberties,1814-15 saw the [[Holy Alliance|restoration]] of [[Legitimists|absolute monarchy]] under pan-European dynastic houses such as the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonapartes]], [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] or [[House of Habsburg|Hapsburgs]]. This gave rise to the sentiment that the conscript army of citizen-soldiers (see [[Levée en masse]] and [[National Militia (Spain)|Milicia Nacional]]) was a truer expression of the people and the nation than the monarchs themselves, paving the way for elements within the army to take politics into their own hands.

This process in Spain has been compared to the experience of France during the same period: from [[Napoleon|Bonaparte's]] own military-backed [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup of 1799]], to the participation of liberal generals [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], Gérard and Mouton in the 1830 [[July Revolution|overthrow]] of the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Chanet, J 'La République entre tradition parlementaire et tentation du coup d’État'. ''Cahiers Jaurès'', 200 (2011). pp 69-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''pronunciamiento'' was also used under parliamentary regimes where the legislature had split into many micro-factions, rendering it impossible for the government to identify the public mood. Elements within the army might then intervene as a 'referendum' to influence parliament or government towards a desired direction.

In Spain, the principle of a segment of the military intervening in politics through a plebiscitary gesture had been generated by the national mass mobilisation of the [[Spanish War of Independence|War of Independence]] against [[First French Empire|Bonapartist France]]. Subsequently, the [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|restoration of the absolute monarchy]] prompted the liberal [[Rafael del Riego|General Riego]] to mount a military rising in 1820, demanding the restoration of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]]. For the next half-century a cycle of military interventions, both ''pronunciamientos'' and classic ''coup d'états'', would occur whenever Spain entered a deadlocked political crisis. Intervention could come from generals associated with the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical-democratic]] left ([[Juan Prim, 1st Marquis of los Castillejos|Prim]]), the [[Progressive Party (Spain)|Liberal]] centre-left ([[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Espartero]]), the [[Liberal Union (Spain)|conservative-liberal]] centre([[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan|O'Donnell]]) or the [[Moderate Party (Spain)|Conservative-liberal]] right ([[Ramón María Narváez, 1st Duke of Valencia|Narváez]], [[Arsenio Martínez Campos|Martínez Campos]]). This particular fifty-year cycle came to a fifty-year close with the [[Restoration (Spain)|Bourbon Restoration of 1874]].&lt;ref&gt;Castells Olivan, I. ‘Le libéralisme insurrectionnel espagnol (1814-1830)'. ''Annales Historiques de la Révolution Française''. 336 (2004). pp 221-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* The first modern ''pronunciamiento'' in Spanish history was that of Lieutenant-Colonel Rafael Riego against King Ferdinand VII, in 1820.
* Another prominent ''pronunciamiento'' was the successful [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|rebellion of September 1868]] against [[Isabella II of Spain]], by Generals [[Juan Prim, 1st Marquis of los Castillejos|Juan Prim]] and [[Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre|Francisco Serrano]], initiating the [[Sexenio Democrático|Six Democratic Years]] and [[First Spanish Republic|First Republic]].
* The First Republic ended with the ''pronunciamiento'' of General Martínez Campos in 1874, leading to the [[Restoration (Spain)|First Bourbon Restoration]].
* The unsuccessful 1932 rebellion against the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] by [[José Sanjurjo]] (known as the ''sanjurjada''), was also an example. However, the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|military uprising of 1936]] that initiated the [[Spanish Civil War]] was not. [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] writes that "Mola's plans were made clear in a circular in April. The planned rising was to be no ''pronunciamiento'' of the old style. Two branches of the plot, one civil, one military, were to be set up in all the provinces of Spain."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War'' (Penguin Books Ltd, 1968) p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Mexico]], where such declarations were often quite detailed, formal, and issued as written texts, they were given the name of [[Plans in Mexican history|plans]]. The most famous one was spoken, the ''Grito de Dolores'' ([[Cry of Dolores]]) of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in 1810, which initiated the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

Outside of the Hispanophone and Lusophone world, events that have been termed a "pronunciamiento" include:

* The 1815 'Flight of the Eagle', [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] march on Paris while converting to his cause the royalist soldiers dispatched to intercept him;
*the Greek [[Goudi Pronunciamiento]] of 1909, a proclamation by the officers of the Military League that power be handed to the Liberal leader [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]];
* [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Appeal of 18 June|Appeal of 18 June 1940]], a proclamation urging military and civilian disobedience against the Vichy Regime;&lt;ref&gt;The philosopher Raymond Aron termed General De Gaulle's methods those of "a general in the style of the Latin American pronunciamiento". Cited by Bavarez N, “Aron et de Gaulle: le grand fossé”, Revue de Politique Française 2 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the 1961 [[Algiers Putsch]] by French generals against De Gaulle's planned decolonisation of Algeria;&lt;ref&gt;De Gaulle, broadcast of 23 April 1961: "An insurrectionary power has established itself in Algeria through a military pronunciamento"&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Turkish coup d'état|Turkish Military Memorandums]] of [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|1971]] (a proclamation by right-wing nationalist officers against the [[Süleyman Demirel|Demirel]] government) and [[1997 Turkish military memorandum|1997]] (by secularist liberal officers against the Islamist [[Necmettin Erbakan|Erbakan]] government).

'''Sectarian democracies''' are  multiethnic/multifactional countries where the ethnic group with the greatest power has a democratic government that does not allow  minorities to participate in the democratic process of that nation.There are several countries that highlight this sort of government.The opposite of sectarian democracy is consociationalistic democracy.

==Present-day Iraq==
Present day [[Iraq]] is a sectarian democracy where the [[Shiite]] controls the majority of the government. This is partly because Shiites in Iraq are the dominant religious group and partly because many Sunnis boycotted the elections. Despite the sectionality of the government it must be remembered that there are elected Sunnis and Kurds in power.

==Apartheid South Africa==
Under [[apartheid]], [[South Africa]] was a sectarian democracy which some called a "white only democracy".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} White South Africans enjoyed the right to vote and to participate in the political process whereas the Black South Africans were oppressed.The end of apartheid brought about consociationalist-like  government allowing for powersharing between Black and White South Africans.

==Turkey==
Present day [[Turkey]] is another example of a sectarian democracy where Turkish Muslims have the true right to participate in the political process. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Former Northern Ireland==
The political power was concentrated in the hands of the Protestant Unionists and this led to sectarian violence until the establishment of a [[consociationalism|consociationalist]]-like government which allowed powersharing between the Protestant Unionists and the Catholic Nationalists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Selenium yeast''', produced by fermenting ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' in a [[selenium]]-rich media, is a recognized source of organic food-form selenium.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schrauzer G | year = 2006 | title = Selenium yeast: composition, quality, analysis, and safety | url = | journal = Pure Appl Chem | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 105–109 | doi=10.1351/pac200678010105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, virtually all of the selenium structurally substitutes for sulfur in the amino acid [[methionine]] thus forming [[selenomethionine]] via the same pathways and enzymes that are used to form sulfur-containing methionine.  Owing to its similarity to S-containing methionine, selenomethionine is taken up nonspecifically and becomes part of yeast protein. It is this metabolic route that makes selenium yeast valuable in animal and human nutrition, since it offers the same organic form of selenium produced by food-chain [[autotrophs]] (i.e., most plants and certain blue-green algae).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schrauzer GN | year = 2003 | title = The nutritional significance, metabolism and toxicology of selenomethionine | url = | journal = Adv Food Nutr Res | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 73–112 | doi=10.1016/s1043-4526(03)47002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human health applications==

Selenium is physiologically essential and may also offer a protective effect against several degenerative diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navaro-Alarcon M, Lopez-Martinez M | year = 2000 | title = Essentiality of selenium in the human body: relationship with different diseases | url = | journal = Sci Total Environ | volume = 249 | issue = | pages = 347–371 | doi=10.1016/s0048-9697(99)00526-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic form of selenium provided by selenium yeast has been shown to differ in bioavailability and metabolism compared with inorganic (e.g., selenate, selenite) forms of dietary selenium.&lt;ref&gt;Schrauzer G. Selenomethionine: A review of its nutritional significance, metabolism and toxicity" ''J Nutr'' 2000;130:1653-1656.&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary supplementation using selenium yeast has been associated with increased ability to counteract oxidative stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ravn-Haren G, Bugel S, Krath B, etal | year = 2008 | title = A short-term intervention trial with selenate, selenium-enriched yeast and selenium-enriched milk: effects on oxidative defence regulation | url = | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 883–892 | doi=10.1017/s0007114507825153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, selenium yeast has been used in a wide range of studies aimed at examining the importance of selenium status in the incidence and progression of a variety of infectious and degenerative diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lovell M, Xiong S, Lyubartseva G, Markesbery W | year = 2009 | title = (Sel-Plex diet) decreases amyloid burden and RNA and DNA oxidative damage in APP/PS1 mice | url = | journal = Free Radic.

*'''Cancer'''. Although selenium is promoted for its claimed anti-cancer effect, there is no good evidence of it being helpful in treating or preventing cancer, or with helping alleviate the side-effects of cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/selenium |title=Selenium |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, some trials suggest harmful effects of selenium exposure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinceti|first=Marco|last2=Dennert|first2=Gabriele|last3=Crespi|first3=Catherine M.|last4=Zwahlen|first4=Marcel|last5=Brinkman|first5=Maree|last6=Zeegers|first6=Maurice P.

Selenium yeast supplementation of food-animal diets has an added nutritional benefit to human consumers of food-animal products. Dietary selenomethionine-containing plant or yeast protein can be also stored nonspecifically in animal protein, which can result in nutritionally useful selenium content in meat, milk, and eggs. Consequently, strategies to supplement animal feed with selenium yeast have led to the development of selenium-rich functional foods, including selenium-enriched eggs and meats for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Surai PF, Karadas F, Pappas A, Sparks N | year = 2006 | title = Effect of organic selenium in quail diet on its accumulation in tissues and transfer to the progeny | url = | journal = Br Poult Sci | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 65–72 | doi=10.1080/00071660500475244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navas-Carretero S, Cuervo M, Abete I, Zulet M, Martinez J | year = 2010 | title = Frequent consumption of selenium-enriched chicken meat by adults causes weight loss and maintains their antioxidant status | url = | journal = Biol Trace Elem Res | volume = 143| issue = | pages = 8–19| doi=10.1007/s12011-010-8831-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisinin V, Papazyan T, Surai PF | year = 2009 | title = Producing selenium-enriched eggs and meat to improve the selenium status of the general population | url = | journal = Crit Rev Biotech | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 18–28 | doi=10.1080/07388550802658030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahan D.

==Safety==

Since 2000, selenium yeast (''S. cerevisiae'' CNCM I-3060) has been reviewed and received the following approvals for use in animal and human diets:
*	U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use as a supplement to feed for chickens, turkeys, swine, goats, sheep, horses, dogs, bison, and beef and dairy.&lt;ref&gt;Sel-Plex receives authorisation [online]. Available at: http://www.allaboutfeed.net/news/sel-plex-receives-authorisation-id98.html. Accessed January 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*	European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approval for use as a feed supplement for all animal species and categories.&lt;ref&gt;Commission of the European Communities. Commission regulation (EC) No 1750/2006 of 27 November 2006 concerning the authorisation of selenomethionine as a feed additive [online]. Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:330:0009:0011:EN:PDF. Accessed January 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Organic Materials Review Institute approval for use as a feed supplement for all animal species.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Materials Review Institute. Sel-Plex [online]. Available at: http://www.omri.org/simple-opl-search/results/sel-plex. Accessed January 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*	European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approval for human health claims linking dietary intake of selenium yeast to "protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage, normal function of the immune system, normal thyroid function and normal spermatogenesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = European Food Safety Authority | year = 2006 | title = Opinion of the scientific panel on additives and products or substances used in animal feed on the safety and efficacy of the product Sel-Plex®2000 as a feed additive according to regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 | doi = 10.2903/j.efsa.2006.348 | journal = EFSA Journal | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A review of the scientific literature concluded that selenium yeast from reputable manufacturers is adequately characterised, of reproducible quality, and shows no evidence of toxicity in long-term supplementation studies at doses as high as 400 and 800 micrograms per day (exceeding the EC tolerable upper intake level of 300 micrograms per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rayman M, Infante H, Sargent M | year = 2008 | title = Food-chain selenium and human health: spotlight on speciation | url = | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 238–253 | doi=10.1017/s0007114508922522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical chemistry==

Total selenium in selenium yeast can be reliably determined using open acid digestion to extract selenium from the yeast matrix followed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Connolly C, Power R, Hynes M | year = 2004 | title = Validation of method for total selenium determination in yeast by flame atomic absorption spectrometry | url = | journal = Biol Trace Elem Res | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 87–94 | doi=10.1385/bter:100:1:087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determination of the selenium species selenomethionine can be achieved via proteolytic digestion of selenium yeast followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).&lt;ref&gt;European Food Safety Authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14974">'''''Shtrafbats''''' ({{lang-ru|штрафбат}}, {{lang|ru|штрафной батальон}}) were [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] [[penal battalions]] that fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in [[World War II]].

The ''shtrafbats'' were greatly increased in number by [[Joseph Stalin]] in July 1942 via [[Order No. 227]] (Директива Ставки ВГК №227). Order No. 227 was a desperate effort to re-instill discipline after the panicked routs of the first year of combat with Germany. The order—popularized as the "Not one step back!" (Ни шагу назад!, Ni shagu nazad!) Order—introduced severe punishments, including [[summary execution]], for unauthorized retreats.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Tolstoy 1981{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his order, Stalin also mentioned [[Hitler]]'s successful use of penal battalions (known as ''[[Strafbattalion|Strafbataillone]]'') as a means to ensure obedience among regular [[Wehrmacht]] units.

==Organization==
Pursuant to Order No. 227, the first penal battalions were originally planned at 800 men; penal companies were also authorized, consisting of between 150 and 200 men per company.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Suvorov 1982{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the battalions already serving with Armies, other battalions, subordinated to Fronts (the equivalent of Army Groups), were introduced. The first penal battalion deployed under the new policy was sent to the [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] Front on August 22, 1942, shortly before German troops reached the [[Volga]] river. It consisted of 929 disgraced officers convicted under Order No. 227 who were demoted to the lowest enlisted rank and assigned to the penal battalion. After three days of assaults against the Germans, only 300 were alive.

Soviet penal units were formally standardized in the order entitled  'Status of Penal Units of the Army' (''Положение о штрафных батальонах действующей армии'') of November 26, 1942, by [[Georgiy Zhukov]], then a Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Penal battalions or ''shtrafbats'' were set at 360 men per battalion,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and were commanded by midrange and senior Red Army officers and political officers (''[[politruk]]s''). Penal companies (штрафная рота, 100 to 150 per unit) were commanded by sergeants ([[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]) and [[private (rank)|private]]s.

Penal units consisted of two types of personnel: permanent and temporary. Permanent personnel were staff officers, company commanders, platoon leaders, political officers, and other junior commanders. Temporary personnel were the ''shtrafniks'' who were sent to the unit for their crimes or wrongdoings in order to redeem themselves with their own blood.

In some penal units like the 8th Detached Penal (Officer) Battalion, platoons sometimes had up to 50 men, companies  were 300 men, and the battalion could be as big as 850 men; which implies that a penal battalion was sometimes larger than a regular rifle battalion of the Red Army. Interesting to note is that on paper, the battalion was to be commanded by a Colonel with two deputies, a chief of staff, and a political officer. The companies were to be commanded by Majors and their platoons by Captains.&lt;ref name="Pyl'cyn"&gt;Pyl'cyn 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably because in this instance, the ''shtrafniks'' consisted of former officers of the Red Army.

The total number of people convicted to penal units from September 1942 to May 1945 was 422,700. Very few of whom were known to have survived the war.  &lt;ref&gt;Krivosheev, G. F. (1997). Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century. Greenhill Books. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-280-4}} {{ISBN|978-1-85367-280-4}}. p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Men ordinarily subject to penal military unit service included:
* Those convicted of desertion or cowardice under Order No. 227. While cowardice under fire was punished with instant execution, soldiers or officers in rear areas suspected of having a "reluctance to fight" could (and frequently were) summarily stripped of rank and reassigned to a ''shtrafbat'' under Order 227.&lt;ref&gt;Suvorov 1982{{Page needed|date=February 2011}} Deserters were not the only category under Order No. 227. Any officer or enlisted soldier who had demonstrated a reluctance to fight was normally stripped of rank and sentenced to a penal unit.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soviet [[Gulag]] labor camp inmates. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Infantry battalions===
Penal battalion service in infantry roles was the most common use of ''shtrafniki'', and viewed by many Soviet prisoners as tantamount to a death sentence. The term of service in infantry penal battalions and companies was from one to three months (the maximum term was usually applied to those qualifying for the death penalty, the standard punishment for Order No. 227). Standard rates of conversion of imprisonment terms into penal battalion terms existed. Convicts sentenced to infantry units were eligible for commutation of sentence and assignment to a Red Army line unit if they either suffered a combat injury (the crime was considered to be "cleansed in blood") or had accomplished extremely heroic deeds in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Lebed 1997 {{Page needed|date=February 2011}}: "My father [then serving in a penal battalion] never shirked his duty...But there was a catch - in order to be transferred from the penal battalion to a regular unit, you had to shed your blood, to redeem yourself. But after the Finnish War, wisdom won out, and he was assigned to a line unit."&lt;/ref&gt; They could also theoretically receive military decorations for outstanding service and if released were considered fully rehabilitated, though those suspected of political disloyalties remained marked men and often continued to be persecuted after the war's end.

Different commanders had different attitudes when releasing the shtrafniks from the unit and returning them to their regular units. 65th Army commander General [[Pavel Batov]] only rehabilitated shrafniks who were killed or wounded in action and used the remaining shtrafniks until the end. General [[Alexander Gorbatov]] released all shtrafniks who had bravely fought in a battle, regardless of whether they were wounded or not.&lt;ref name="Pyl'cyn"&gt;Pyl'cyn 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air force===
Pilots or gunners serving in air force penal squadrons were at a marked disadvantage in obtaining remission of sentence via a combat injury since the nature of air combat usually meant that any injury was fatal. Pilots received no credit for missions flown, and were normally kept in service until they were killed in action.  Former Soviet Air Force pilot Artiom Afinogenov recalled the use of air force penal squadrons near [[Stalingrad]]:

{{quote|Penal squadron pilots were sent to the most dangerous places, first of all, to Volga bridge crossings, where the future of Stalingrad was decided, to air fields and enemy tank concentrations. So it was only penal squadrons that were sent to attack these targets, yet these operational flights were not taken into consideration. You keep flying missions and killing Germans, yet it is held that nothing happens, so nothing goes on your record. To be released from penal service you have to be wounded in fighting. But when a military pilot is flying a mission, the first wound he receives may very often be the last one.&lt;ref&gt;Voice of Russia, ''Interview of Artiom Afinogenov'' (2003), [http://www.vor.ru/55/Stalingrad/History_4_eng.html Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304172405/http://www.vor.ru/55/Stalingrad/History_4_eng.html |date=2010-03-04 }}  (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The death rate among gunners serving in penal squadrons was exceptionally high. While prisoners assigned as gunners could theoretically clear their sentences after surviving ten missions, like the infantry they were frequently transferred to penal mine-clearing units before reaching this total.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Combat service==
Pursuant to Order No. 227, any attempt to retreat without orders, or even a failure to advance was punished by [[barrier troops]] ('zagraditel'nye otriady') or "anti-retreat" detachments of the Soviet special organization known as [[SMERSH]] (''Smert shpionam''), Russian for "Death to spies".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; SMERSH units were used to shoot retreating men serving in penal units should the latter commence a retreat after failing either to advance to secure an objective, or to stop a German attack via counter-attack.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mawdsley 2003, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, with nowhere else to go, the penal battalions usually advanced in a frenzy, running forwards until they were killed by enemy minefields, artillery, or heavy machine-gun fire. If the men survived and occupied their objective, they were rounded up and used again in the next assault.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In some cases, shtrafniks performed their duty very well even though there were no barrier troops blocking the unit's rear.&lt;ref name="Pyl'cyn"&gt;Pyl'cyn 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The battalions were headed by staffs or ordinary soldiers and officers. While out of the line, discipline was enforced by an armed guard company, backstopped by [[NKVD]] or SMERSH detachments. Staff and guards were highly paid and got special pension benefits for their unpleasant and sometimes dangerous work. During the war, Soviet penal units were widely employed. Some units achieved considerable fame; General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]'s well-regarded [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th Army]] was composed completely of penal infantry units.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Rokossovsky himself had been "rescued" from the Gulag by Stalin in 1940 after being imprisoned and tortured for 4 years for supporting [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]; after the onset of [[Blitzkrieg]] proved Tukhachevsky's theories of armored warfare correct, Rokossovsky was quietly released from prison and restored to his rank by Stalin, who even bemusedly commented on Rokossovsky's missing [[fingernails]] (which had all been pulled out during his torture) while assigning him the command.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The simultaneous formation of penal units and ancillary rearguard blocking troops in Order No. 227 has occasionally led to a modern misconception that penal units were rearguarded by regular units of the Red Army. Although the practice of using regular army troops as a rearguard or blocking force was briefly implemented, it was soon discovered that the rearguard did not always carry out their orders with regards to penal unit personnel who retreated or fled from the Germans. Consequently, until the end of the war, the task of preventing unauthorized withdrawal of penal unit personnel from the battlefield was handled by the anti-retreat SMERSH detachments of the Soviet NKVD.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Photo graph of Tailrace fishing Inks Dam 06231996.jpg|thumb|{{center|Tailrace fishing at the [[Inks Dam]], Texas}}]]
[[File:Alvin Wirtz Dam Tailrace Fishing 06251997.jpg|thumb|{{center|Tailrace fishing at the [[Wirtz Dam]], Texas}}]]

'''Tailrace fishing''' is [[angling]] immediately below natural or man-made [[dams]] or restrictions to the flow of water on [[rivers]], canals, streams or any other flowing current. Fishing in a tailrace requires a distinct set of skills in that lures or bait must be moved through the flowing water to the feeding spots in the currents. Hydro tailrace fishing occurs in the discharge of [[hydroelectric]] power stations below a dam. Fishing below [[spillway]]s is another form of tailrace fishing in which the [[turbulent]] water below the dam creates pockets of water that trap bait fish and attract gamefish.

==Types of tailrace fishing==
[[File:Tailrace fishing Mansfield Dam.jpg|thumb|{{center|Tailrace fishing at the [[Mansfield Dam]], Texas}}]]
Hydro tailrace fishing is a more modern form of fishing the turbulent waters below reservoirs. The term hydro generation refers to the massive generators within a
dam structure that are propelled by the force of gravity pushed by the vessel of water through an impellar which rotates the rotor causing lines of magnetic flux thus creating electric current which can then be transmitted as electricity. When vanes or valves are opened the water immediately flows from the above reservoir, causing turbulent water below the dam structure. Generation once started can last for a few minutes and up to months at times if all mechanical conditions and market demand is required from the governing utility or municipality. Hydro tailrace fishing is angling with  rod and reel using artificial or live bait through these swift waters.

Kinetic tailrace fishing is angling with fishing rod and reel below a [[dam]], [[spillway]] or [[weir]] or any structure which has a drop in elevation that causes turbulent or swift moving water at its base. An example would be Mission Valley Dam on the Guadalupe River on the northern end of Lake Dunlap in New Braunsfels, Texas. Free flowing rivers and streams which flow over a Dam structure are the most common types of dams that can provide tailrace fishing.

==Access==
Hydro tailrace fisherman face many obstacles in securing their rights as a group of fishermen. One example of regaining lost rights is the [[Freedom to Fish Act]] that came out of a dispute with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] attempt to restrict access below dams on the [[Cumberland River]].

'''Thomas Luckmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|m|ən}}; October 14, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American-Austrian sociologist of [[Germans|German]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] origin who taught mainly in [[Germany]]. His contributions were central to studies in sociology of communication, [[sociology of knowledge]], [[sociology of religion]], and the [[philosophy of science]].

During [[World War II]], in 1943, he and his mother moved to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1944 he was drafted for the army,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Endreß|first=Martin|date=2016|title=Thomas Luckmann (October 14, 1927–May 10, 2016)|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2|journal=Human Studies|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=487–491|doi=10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2|issn=0163-8548|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the [[Luftwaffe]] where he served as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Luckmann: ''„Teilweise zufällig, teilweise, weil es doch Spaß macht“.'' In: Monika Wohlrab-Sahr (Hrsg.): ''Kultusoziologie: Paradigmen – Methoden – Fragestellungen''. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2010, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he became a [[prisoner of war]], and escaping after three months. He then settled in Vienna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Luckmann studied [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] and [[University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950 he married Benita Petkevic, with whom he moved to the United States, where he studied at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The couple had three daughters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He worked as a professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Konstanz]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 to his retirement,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adam|first=F|last2=Čas|first2=B|date=2004|title=Utemeljitev za imenovanje dr.

He died at the age of 88 on May 10, 2016, at his home in Austria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Work  ==

Luckmann was a follower of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologically]] oriented school of [[sociology]], established by the Austrian-American scholar [[Alfred Schütz]]. He contributed to the foundation of phenomenological sociology, the sociology of religion in modern societies, and the sociology of knowledge and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his works, he developed the theory of [[social constructionism]], which argues that all knowledge, including the most basic common sense knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by social interactions. Together with [[Peter L. Berger]], he wrote the book ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' in 1966. The book was an important part of the move in sociology, and partiuclarly the sociology of religion, away from the view of religion and religious values as central to [[Social order|the social order]], arguing that social order is socially constructed by individuals and/or groups of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767737455|title=Encyclopedia of global religion|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Juergensmeyer, Mark., Roof, Wade Clark.|isbn=9781452266565|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=767737455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he continued the work of Alfred Schütz, drawing on Schütz's notes and unfinished manuscripts to complete ''[[Structures of the Life-World]]'', published (posthumously for Schütz) in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Together with [[Richard Grathoff]] and Walter M. Sprondel, Luckmann founded the [[Social Science Archive Konstanz]] (also known as the Alfred Schütz Memorial Archives).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Luckmann was a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and held honorary doctorates from the Universities of [[University of Linköping|Linköping]], [[University of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]], [[University of Trier|Trier]] and [[University of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1998 he was awarded an [[List of Honorary Doctors of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology|honorary doctorate from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary Doctors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ntnu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Luckmann became an honorary member of the Slovenian Sociological Association.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[German Sociological Association]] awarded him a prize for his outstanding lifetime contribution to sociology at its 2002 Congress, and Luckmann became an honorary member in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Treaty of Westminster''', concluded between the Lord Protector of the English Commonwealth, [[Oliver Cromwell]], and the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Netherlands]], was signed on [[Old Style and New Style dates|5/15 April 1654]].&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Frances G. (ed.)|authorlink=Frances Gardiner Davenport|title=European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies, Vol.2 1650-1697 |year=1929; repr. 2004|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd|isbn=1-58477-422-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDPF4ILESaUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA7&amp;dq=Davenport+Treaty+Westminster+1654&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oGhkUdzTLMWfiAKJoIGQDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} The treaty ended the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] (1652-1654). The treaty is otherwise notable because it is one of the first treaties implementing [[international arbitration]] as a method of conflict resolution in early modern times. A secret clause, obliging the States of Holland to enact the [[Act of Seclusion]], played an important part in Dutch internal politics during the [[First Stadtholderless Period]].

==Negotiations==
The negotiation of the treaty started long before the war. The [[Commonwealth of England]] had been established only in 1649, and the new state was seeking international recognition. Older established states, like the [[Dutch Republic]], looked somewhat askance at the "upstart" England, which was ruled by "king killers." The Dutch Republic had actively supported the [[Cavalier|royalist]] cause in the [[English Civil War]] because of the family ties between the [[stadtholder]] [[William II, Prince of Orange]] and the English royal family. The death of William II in 1650 and the establishment of a new  [[Dutch States Party|States Party]] regime in the Dutch Republic cleared the way for a thaw in Anglo-Dutch diplomatic relations.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|7}}

===Proposed union and counter-proposals===
The negotiations about better relations started in earnest in the Spring of 1651. [[Walter Strickland]] and [[Oliver St John]] went to [[The Hague]] to talk about the removal of the royalist exiles who had sought asylum in the Netherlands (among whom was the pretender [[Charles II of England|Charles Stuart]]) from the Republic, but more importantly about a political union between the two states, on the ground that they were similar in respect of politics, religion, and commerce. The Dutch government replied with a number of counter-proposals in matters they held dear, like principles of (then-emerging) international law, such as [[freedom of the seas]], limitation of the concept of [[contraband]] to "instruments of war", freedom from capture of neutral goods on neutral ships in time of war. These were all matters that the English at the time disputed. Furthermore, the Dutch asked that [[letter of marque|letters of reprisal]] (a common practical cause of friction between states) should not be granted in peacetime. Finally, they asked that Dutch merchants should have the same privileges as the English in English dominions in Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;That demand was motivated by the enactment by Parliament in October 1650 of an Act for Prohibiting trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda, and Antigua, which (though not directed expressly at the Dutch) hindered Dutch trade. See Davenport, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The demands, collected in 36 draft-articles, were presented to the English ambassadors on 14/24 June 1651. They returned to England without an agreement having been reached.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

On 9/19 October 1651 the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the first of the [[Navigation Acts]], which was perceived as aimed at the ruination of Dutch commerce,&lt;ref&gt;This danger has often been overestimated. Though it represented a serious blow, the Act did not fundamentally endanger the Dutch trading system. See [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815)]]. England was a relatively minor market for the Dutch economy in comparison with the Baltic, France and Spain. Cf. Israel, p. 715. One might add that the restrictions on competition embodied in the Act also harmed the English economy, especially English consumers, and producers in the Caribbean and American colonies. Cf. Jenkinson, p. 49ff.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly on the instigation of St. John, who was aggrieved by his cool treatment in The Hague.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|8}} This motivated the Dutch government to send a delegation of three commissioners: [[Jacob Cats|Cats]], [[Paulus van de Perre|Van de Perre]], and [[Gerard Pietersz. Schaep|Schaep]] to London to reopen the negotiations about the 36 articles, and to gain suspension of the Navigation Act till the negotiations would have been completed. The latter demand was immediately rejected by the [[English Council of State]], and the English negotiators upped the ante by formulating additional demands: reparations for alleged injuries to English commerce in Greenland, Brazil and the East Indies, and free access for the English [[East India Company|E.I.C.]] to the East Indies (which had effectively been blocked by its Dutch competitor, the [[Dutch East India Company|V.O.C.]]). Remarkably, the English offered at this time to acquiesce in this exclusion from the East Indies, but insisted on retaining the restrictions in the Navigation Act. At the same time, they declined to talk about the delineation of the Dutch and English possessions in North America ([[New Netherland]] and the [[New Haven Colony]], respectively) about which a preliminary local agreement had been concluded, but not finalized by the metropolitan powers, in the [[Treaty of Hartford (1650)|Hartford Agreement]] of 19 September 1650.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|1–6, 8–9}}

===Diplomacy by other means&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrasing [[Carl von Clausewitz]]:''Der Krieg ist eine bloße Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln'' (War is merely a continuation of politics by other means) in: {{cite book|last=Clausewitz|first=Carl von|title=Vom Kriege|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Meanwhile, relations between the two countries became tense, when, in answer to depredations of English [[privateer]]s against neutral Dutch shipping in an undeclared maritime conflict between the Commonwealth and France,&lt;ref&gt;The Dutch also objected to the abuse of the Navigation Act as a pretext by English privateers, and worse English [[prize court]]s, to condemn innocent Dutch ships that were captured on the [[International waters|High Seas]]. This, more than the economic effect of the Act, was a ''[[casus belli]]'' for the Dutch. Cf. Israel, p. 715&lt;/ref&gt;  the Dutch started a program of naval expansion, by which the English (who had recently expanded their own fleet) felt threatened. After a naval incident about saluting the English flag in the "English Seas" the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] started and the negotiations were suspended.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|9}}

The war was lost militarily by the Dutch, who after a number of lost naval battles were blockaded in their own country by the [[Commonwealth Navy]]. This caused great economic hardship. On the other hand, the English in their turn were victimized by a wider Dutch "encirclement" that blocked English shipping from the Baltic by Denmark, a Dutch ally, aided by a strong Dutch naval detachment cruising near the [[Øresund|Sound]], and from South-East Asia by the V.O.C. English trade with the Mediterranean was also greatly hampered by Dutch privateering and naval activity, especially after the [[Battle of Leghorn]]. Both countries after a while were so economically exhausted that they hankered after peace.&lt;ref name=Israel&gt;{{cite book|last=Israel|first=J.I.|title=The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness and Fall, 1477-1806|year=1995|publisher=Oxford U.P.|isbn=0-19-873072-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|721–722}}

===Peace negotiations===
[[File:John Lambert.jpg|150px|left|thumb|English commissioner [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]]]]
[[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] agreed to open peace negotiations in London in June 1653. The Dutch government sent a delegation, consisting of the commissioners [[Hieronymus van Beverningh|Beverningh]], [[Willem Nieupoort|Nieupoort]] (for the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]]), Van de Perre (for the [[States of Zeeland]]), and [[Allart Pieter van Jongestall|Jongestal]] (for the States of Friesland). Their English counterparts were [[Henry Lawrence (President of the Council)|Lawrence]], [[John Lambert (general)|Lambert]], [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton|Montagu]], and [[Philip Sidney, 3rd Earl of Leicester|Lisle]]. The negotiations started where they had left off in 1652: the Dutch reiterated their 36 articles and demanded access to the American colonies; the English replied with a restatement of their demand for reparations and their previously rejected proposal for a political union between the two countries. Cromwell proposed that "while the two countries should retain their municipal laws" the two countries should "be under one supreme power, consisting of representatives of both countries" and "natives of both countries should mutually enjoy their privileges, without any difference or distinction."&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|10–11}}
[[File:Hieronymus van Beverningh.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Dutch commissioner [[Hieronymus van Beverningh]]]]
After Jongestal and Nieupoort had returned to The Hague to receive instructions regarding this startling proposal in mid-August 1653, the English side toned down the proposal in favor of a less far-reaching proposal for an alliance between the Protestant Powers of Europe and France, against the Catholic Powers, in which the Commonwealth and the Republic would take the lead; a commission, consisting of an equal number of members from each country, to determine differences peacefully; a joint fleet to "secure the sea;" liberty of the inhabitants of both countries to trade in Europe and overseas; the assignment of trade in East Asia solely to the Dutch in exchange for indemnification of the E.I.C.; the assignment of trade in the Americas (except Brazil, that was to be divided in influence spheres between the two countries) exclusively to the Commonwealth; and Dutch naval assistance to English attempts at conquest in Spanish America. (The two remaining Dutch ambassadors rejected the last proposal out of hand, as it would jeopardize the good relations which the Dutch Republic had recently established with Spain).&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Jongestal and Nieuport returned in November 1653 with instructions to reject the proposed union, but to seek a close alliance commensurate with maintenance of Dutch independence. Later that month the English side presented a draft treaty of 27 articles. In two of those articles the phrase that subjects of both countries might trade in each other's dominions ''saving the laws and ordinances of either commonwealth'' appeared. This phrase, though innocuous at first sight, represented the English intention to maintain the provisions of the Navigation Act. The Dutch representatives countered with amendments to the proposed articles that would free their commerce from the restrictions of the Act. In addition they proposed to regulate commerce outside Europe. This was followed by further exchanges of proposals that were unacceptable to one side or the other. Finally it was agreed to keep silent about regulation of trade outside Europe, and to recognize the right of both parties to reciprocal indemnification for injuries suffered (except those suffered in the course of the hostilities, for which reciprocal immunities were granted).&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp| 12}}

The treaty appeared ready for signing when suddenly two new obstacles were raised. In the first place the Dutch asked for the [[Christian V of Denmark|King of Denmark]] (their ally in the war) to be included in the treaty. Secondly, Cromwell demanded that the then-four-year-old [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]]&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, the little boy would grow into the man who in 35 years' time would, in a sense, realize Cromwell's project for a political union between the two countries in the [[Glorious Revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; should be excluded from future government appointments, like the stadtholderate, or the [[Captain general|captaincy-general]] of the [[Dutch States Army|States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;This was to be art. 12 in the draft-treaty. Cf.{{cite web|last=Olthof|first=Kees|title=Acte van Seclusie, een gesouffleerd Cromwell Initiatief?|url=http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2011-0812-200610/werkstuk%20Diplomatieke%20Praktijken%20pdf.pdf|year=2011|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230459/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2011-0812-200610/werkstuk%20Diplomatieke%20Praktijken%20pdf.pdf|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}, pp. 18-26&lt;/ref&gt; The first demand was accepted, but the second at first appeared unacceptable to the Dutch ambassadors, who returned home. Secret direct negotiations between Cromwell and De Witt (represented by Beverningh), led to agreement on the matter of the exclusion of the Prince, however without the knowledge of the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. A secret clause, requiring the enactment of what became known as the [[Act of Seclusion]] by the States of Holland as a precondition for ratification of the treaty by the Commonwealth, would be added to the treaty that would only bind the States of Holland.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt;{{rp|722}} The Dutch ambassadors returned to England after a few weeks' absence (only the representatives of Holland being aware of the secret clause) and completed the negotiations, tying up a number of loose ends, especially the important provisions in art. 30 of the treaty, laying down the principles of arbitration of mutual claims by a commission of equal representation convening in London, backed up by a provision charging the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Protestant Swiss Cantons]] with binding arbitration, in case the arbiters in London could not reach agreement.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|12}} The treaty was signed on 5/15 April 1654, and ratified by both states within a fortnight (ratification resolution of the States General 12/22 April 1654,&lt;ref name=Verbael&gt;{{cite book|title=Verbael gehouden door de Heeren H. van Beverningk, W.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Honthorst,_Gerard_van_-_Willem_III_op_driejarige_leeftijd_in_Romeins_kostuum_-_1654.png|left|thumb|200px|[[William III of England|Prince William]] in martial attire in 1654 by [[Gerard van Honthorst]]]]
With hindsight, the most momentous provision in the treaty was the secret clause concerning the Act of Seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;The English text of the clause is given by Jenkinson, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; When the secret eventually leaked, it caused a political crisis in the Dutch Republic. Eventually, De Witt was able to remain in power, and the furore subsided. The Act of Seclusion remained in effect, playing a part in Dutch internal politics, until the very end of the De Witt regime, even after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] seemingly obviated its existence.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt;{{rp|722–726}}

The British historian [[Jonathan Israel]] writes that otherwise, taking into account that the Republic "lost" the war militarily, the treaty was remarkably lenient for the Dutch. He ascribes this to the diplomatic acumen of De Witt, who managed to avoid doing any major concession to England's maritime and colonial interests.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt;{{rp|726}} Cromwell did not achieve his main objectives: the coveted political union came to naught&lt;ref&gt;Though some face-saving generalities were included in the preamble and the first article, referring to "... a more intimate and nearer alliance, confederacy, and union, than heretofore ..."; Cf. Davenport, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the E.I.C. remained in fact blocked from freedom of trade in the East Indies (this freedom for British commerce would be achieved only in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1784, ending the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]).

On the other hand, the Dutch realized few of the objectives in their 36 articles. Matters like the freedom of the seas (as regards Dutch shipping), the principle of [[Freedom of navigation|"free ship, free goods"]] (the inviolability of neutral shipping in time of war), and the restriction of the concept of contraband, had to wait till the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]] and the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)]].

The matter of the fraught phrase respecting the laws and ordinances of both states by each other's merchants in each other's dominions went by default when the Dutch commissioner Van de Perre died during the negotiations (He had been the champion of the [[Dutch West India Company]] which was especially hurt by the Navigation Act, and had therefore been the driving force behind the Dutch attempts to get the Act repealed, or at least amended). This clause therefore remained in the treaty, but the Dutch did not agree to interpret this as a recognition of the Navigation Act. Instead, the Dutch peace delegation remained behind to try and negotiate a repeal of the Act, but this effort was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|12}} This matter would have to wait also to the Breda treaty, in which the Dutch won concessions mitigating the Act (or rather its 1660 successor). Meanwhile, Dutch merchants honored the Act in the breach. However, in art. 12 of the treaty the parties accorded each other what would later become known as "[[most favored nation]]" status.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|17}}

[[File:Akte van Seclusie Nl-HaNA 3.01.04.03 62.jpg|thumb|The [[Act of Seclusion]]]] 
Of lasting importance was art. 30, which set up a commission to arbitrate all claims of both sides to which the treaty did not extend immunity (under e.g. articles 3 and 16). New here was that the principle of [[Arbitration|binding arbitration]] by a third party (the Protestant Swiss Cantons&lt;ref&gt;The reason why the Swiss Cantons were selected may simply have been that they were available. The Cantons, worried about the weakening of the "Protestant Cause" in Europe by the war between the main supporters of that cause, had sent a special envoy, the Town Clerk of [[Schaffhausen]] [[Johann Jacob Stockar]], to mediate between the two parties. This eventually met with much appreciation from both sides. Cf. Verbael, pp. 14, 15, 27, 29, 139, 169&lt;/ref&gt;) was first agreed on as a means of conflict resolution in an international treaty.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darby|first=W.E.|title=International Tribunals: A Collection of the Various Schemes which Have Been Propounded and of Instances in the Nineteenth Century|year=1904|location=Dent|pages=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch were also unsuccessful in obtaining ratification of the 1650 Hartford agreement concerning the border between New Netherland and Connecticut.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;{{rp|12}} This matter would be finally resolved by the transfer of New Netherland to England by the Treaty of Westminster of 1674.

The Dutch were forced to make three minor humiliating concessions. They promised to punish those culpable in the [[Amboyna Massacre]] exemplarily (art. 27). However, no such people were still alive to be punished, as the Dutch probably well knew. The matter of reparation for the affair was handled under the arbitration agreement of art. 30 of the treaty. The commissioner's awarded a relatively trifling sum to the descendants of the victims of the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=W.W. and P.E. Roberts|title=A History of British India|year=1899|publisher=Longman, Green &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|427}}

Furthermore, the Dutch promised in art. 13 of the treaty to go on saluting the flag of English warships in the "English Seas" (i.e. mainly the [[English Channel]]) "as in the times of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]." This did not, however, imply an admission of sovereignty of England over those "English Seas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last="B.F."|title=art. IV The Dominion of the Seas|journal=The Law Magazine, Or, Quarterly Review of Jurisprudence|year=1841|pages=71–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

Thirdly, the treaty contained the provision that rebels designated by either of the two countries were to be banished. This first of all targeted the pretender Charles Stuart, who had since 1648 found asylum in the Republic at the court of his sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]] and her husband stadtholder William II. He subsequently had to move to the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Ironically, a similar clause was to be included in the treaties Charles II himself concluded with the Republic in 1662, 1667 and 1674, after his Restoration, but then aimed at the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sprunger|first=K.L.|title=Dutch puritanism|year=1982|publisher=Brill|pages=398–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;
