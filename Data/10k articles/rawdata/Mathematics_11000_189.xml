==Biography==
Borodin did his undergraduate studies at [[Rutgers University]], earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1963. After earning a master's degree at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in 1966 (while at the same time working P/T as a programmer at [[Bell Laboratories]]), he continued his graduate studies at [[Cornell University]], completing a doctorate in 1969 under the supervision of [[Juris Hartmanis]].
He joined the Toronto faculty in 1969 and was promoted to full professor in 1977. He served as department chair from 1980 to 1985, and became University Professor in 2011.&lt;ref name="up"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pims"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Allan Bertram Borodin|id=42043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Borodin was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1991. In 2008 he won the [[CRM-Fields-PIMS prize|CRM-Fields PIMS Prize]].&lt;ref name="pims"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/press/07-08/071206.borodin.html Allan Borodin: Recipient of the 2008 CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize], retrieved 2012-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/fellows/2011.shtml AAAS Members Elected as Fellows in 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113205143/http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/fellows/2011.shtml |date=January 13, 2012 }}, retrieved 2012-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and a fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] in 2014 ''"For contributions to [[theoretical computer science]] in complexity, [[Online algorithm|on-line algorithms]], resource tradeoffs, and models of algorithmic paradigms."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://awards.acm.org/press_releases/fellows-2014b.pdf ACM Names Fellows for Innovations in Computing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109095116/http://awards.acm.org/press_releases/fellows-2014b.pdf |date=2015-01-09 }}, ACM, January 8, 2015, retrieved 2015-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">In [[mathematics]], the '''Andreotti–Frankel theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last1=Andreotti|first1=Aldo|author1-link=Aldo Andreotti|last2=Frankel|first2=Theodore|author2-link=Theodore Frankel|year=1959}}, states that if &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth algebraic variety|smooth]], complex [[affine variety]] of [[complex dimension]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; or, more generally, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Stein manifold]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then in fact &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is [[homotopy equivalent]] to a [[CW complex]] of [[real dimension]] at most ''n''. In other words, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has only half as much topology.

Consequently, if &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{C}^r&lt;/math&gt; is a closed connected complex submanifold of complex dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has the homotopy type of a &lt;math&gt;CW&lt;/math&gt; complex of real dimension &lt;math&gt;\le n&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;H^i(V; \mathbf Z)=0,\text{ for }i&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;H_i(V; \mathbf Z)=0,\text{ for }i&gt;n. &lt;/math&gt;
This theorem applies in particular to any smooth, complex affine variety of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Binary logarithm plot with ticks.svg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.35|Graph of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''x''}} as a function of a positive real number {{mvar|x}}]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''binary logarithm''' ({{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}}) is the power to which the number {{math|2}} must be raised to obtain the value&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|n}}. That is, for any real number {{mvar|x}},
:&lt;math&gt;x=\log_2 n \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad 2^x=n.&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the binary logarithm of {{math|1}} is {{math|0}}, the binary logarithm of {{math|2}} is {{math|1}}, the binary logarithm of {{math|4}} is&amp;nbsp;{{math|2}}, and the binary logarithm of {{math|32}} is&amp;nbsp;{{math|5}}.

The binary logarithm is the [[logarithm]] to the base {{math|2}}. The binary logarithm function is the [[inverse function]] of the [[power of two]] function. As well as {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, alternative notations for the binary logarithm include {{math|lg}}, {{math|ld}}, {{math|lb}} (the notation preferred by [[ISO 31-11]] and [[ISO 80000-2]]), and (with a prior statement that the default base is&amp;nbsp;2) {{math|log}}.

Historically, the first application of binary logarithms was in [[music theory]], by [[Leonhard Euler]]: the binary logarithm of a frequency ratio of two musical tones gives the number of [[octave]]s by which the tones differ. Binary logarithms can be used to calculate the length of the representation of a number in the [[binary numeral system]], or the number of [[bit]]s needed to encode a message in [[information theory]]. In [[computer science]], they count the number of steps needed for [[binary search]] and related algorithms. Other areas
in which the binary logarithm is frequently used include [[combinatorics]], [[bioinformatics]], the design of sports [[tournament]]s, and [[photography]].

Binary logarithms are included in the standard [[C mathematical functions]] and other mathematical software packages.
The integer part of a binary logarithm can be found using the [[find first set]] operation on an integer value, or by looking up the exponent of a [[floating point]] value.
The fractional part of the logarithm can be calculated efficiently.

==History==
{{Main|History of logarithms}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Leonhard Euler]] was the first to apply binary logarithms to [[music theory]], in 1739.]]
The [[power of two|powers of two]] have been known since antiquity; for instance they appear in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], Props. IX.32 (on the [[factorization]] of powers of two) and IX.36 (half of the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]], on the structure of even [[perfect number]]s).
And the binary logarithm of a power of two is just its position in the ordered sequence of powers of two.
On this basis, [[Michael Stifel]] has been credited with publishing the first known table of binary logarithms in 1544. His book ''Arithmetica Integra'' contains several tables that show the [[integer]]s with their corresponding powers of two. Reversing the rows of these tables allow them to be interpreted as tables of binary logarithms.&lt;ref&gt;

 | year = 1544}}. A copy of the same table with two more entries appears on p.&amp;nbsp;237, and another copy extended to negative powers appears on p.&amp;nbsp;249b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century [[Jain]] mathematician [[Virasena]] is credited with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ''ardhacheda'' has been defined as the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ymud91nTc9YC&amp;pg=PA352 352]|title=[[The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics]]|first=G. G.|last=Joseph|edition=3rd|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is different for other integers, giving the [[p-adic order|2-adic order]] rather than the logarithm.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation|title=Cryptographic Applications of Analytic Number Theory: Complexity Lower Bounds and Pseudorandomness|volume=22|series=Progress in Computer Science and Applied Logic|first=Igor|last=Shparlinski|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2013|isbn=978-3-0348-8037-4|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z635BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern form of a binary logarithm, applying to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Definition and properties==
The binary logarithm function may be defined as the [[inverse function]] to the [[power of two]] function, which is a strictly increasing function over the positive [[real number]]s and therefore has a unique inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to Mathematics for Life Scientists|publisher=Springer|year=2012|first=E.|last=Batschelet|isbn=978-3-642-96080-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbT0CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|page=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, it may be defined as {{math|ln ''n''/ln 2}}, where {{math|ln}} is the [[natural logarithm]], defined in any of its standard ways. Using the [[complex logarithm]] in this definition allows the binary logarithm to be extended to the [[complex number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Microsoft Excel]] provides the &lt;code&gt;IMLOG2&lt;/code&gt; function for complex binary logarithms: see {{citation|title=Excel Scientific and Engineering Cookbook|first=David M.|last=Bourg|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2006|isbn=978-0-596-55317-3|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKctiVg2dyIC&amp;pg=PT248}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other logarithms, the binary logarithm obeys the following equations, which can be used to simplify formulas that combine binary logarithms with multiplication or exponentiation:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebra for College Students|first1=Bernard|last1=Kolman|first2=Arnold|last2=Shapiro|publisher=Academic Press|year=1982|isbn=978-1-4832-7121-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7vSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA334|pages=334–335|contribution=11.4 Properties of Logarithms}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 xy=\log_2 x + \log_2 y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2\frac{x}{y}=\log_2 x - \log_2 y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 x^y = y\log_2 x.&lt;/math&gt;
For more, see [[list of logarithmic identities]].

==Notation==
In mathematics, the binary logarithm of a number {{mvar|n}} is often written as {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, this is the notation used in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]'' and ''[[The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several other notations for this function have been used or proposed, especially in application areas.

Some authors write the binary logarithm as {{math|lg ''n''}},&lt;ref name="clrs"&gt;{{citation

==Applications==

===Information theory===
The number of digits ([[bit]]s) in the [[binary representation]] of a positive integer {{mvar|n}} is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integral part]] of {{math|1 + log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}}, i.e.&lt;ref name="sw11"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor + 1. &lt;/math&gt;

In information theory, the definition of the amount of [[self-information]] and [[information entropy]] is often expressed with the binary logarithm, corresponding to making the bit the fundamental unit of information. However, the [[natural logarithm]] and the [[Nat (unit)|nat]] are also used in alternative notations for these definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Information Theory|first=Jan C. A.|last=Van der Lubbe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-521-46760-5|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBuI_6MQTcwC&amp;pg=PA3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational complexity===
[[File:Binary search into array - example.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Binary search]] in a sorted array, an algorithm whose time complexity involves binary logarithms]]
The binary logarithm also frequently appears in the [[analysis of algorithms]],&lt;ref name="gt02"/&gt; not only because of the frequent use of binary number arithmetic in algorithms, but also because binary logarithms occur in the analysis of algorithms based on two-way branching.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;  If a problem initially has {{mvar|n}} choices for its solution, and each iteration of the algorithm reduces the number of choices by a factor of two, then the number of iterations needed to select a single choice is again the integral part of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}}. This idea is used in the analysis of several [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s. For example, in [[binary search]], the size of the problem to be solved is halved with each iteration, and therefore roughly {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}} iterations are needed to obtain a problem of size {{math|1}}, which is solved easily in constant time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Algorithms and Data Structures: The Basic Toolbox|first1=Kurt|last1=Mehlhorn|author1-link=Kurt Mehlhorn|first2=Peter|last2=Sanders|author2-link=Peter Sanders (computer scientist)|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-3-540-77977-3|pages=34–36|contribution=2.5 An example – binary search|url=http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/Toolbox/Introduction.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a perfectly balanced [[binary search tree]] containing {{mvar|n}} elements has height {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'' + 1) − 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Applied Combinatorics|first1=Fred|last1=Roberts|author1-link=Fred S. Roberts|first2=Barry|last2=Tesman|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4200-9983-6|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szBLJUhmYOQC&amp;pg=PA206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The running time of an algorithm is usually expressed in [[big O notation]], which is used to simplify expressions by omitting their constant factors and lower-order terms. Because logarithms in different bases differ from each other only by a constant factor, algorithms that run in {{math|''O''(log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n'')}} time can also be said to run in, say, {{math|''O''(log&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; ''n'')}} time. The base of the logarithm in expressions such as {{math|''O''(log ''n'')}} or {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} is therefore not important and can be omitted.&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|first=Michael|last=Sipser|authorlink=Michael Sipser|edition=3rd|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781133187790|contribution=Example 7.4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3f6CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277|pages=277–278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for logarithms that appear in the exponent of a time bound, the base of the logarithm cannot be omitted. For example, {{math|''O''(2&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is not the same as {{math|''O''(2&lt;sup&gt;ln ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} because the former is equal to {{math|''O''(''n'')}} and the latter to {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;0.6931...&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

Algorithms with running time {{math|''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'')}} are sometimes called [[linearithmic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sedgewick|Wayne|2011}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTpsAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186 p.&amp;nbsp;186].&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of algorithms with running time {{math|''O''(log ''n'')}} or {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} are:

Binary logarithms also occur in the exponents of the time bounds for some [[divide and conquer algorithm]]s, such as the [[Karatsuba algorithm]] for multiplying {{mvar|n}}-bit numbers in time {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}3&lt;/sup&gt;)}},&lt;ref&gt;Cormen et al., p.&amp;nbsp;844; Goodrich &amp; Tamassia, p.&amp;nbsp;279.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Strassen algorithm]] for multiplying {{math|''n'' &amp;times; ''n''}} matrices in time
{{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}7&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cormen et al., section 28.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of binary logarithms in these running times can be explained by reference to the [[master theorem (analysis of algorithms)|master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences]].

===Bioinformatics===
[[File:Mouse cdna microarray.jpg|thumb|upright=1|A [[microarray]] for approximately 8700 genes. The expression rates of these genes are compared using binary logarithms.]]
In [[bioinformatics]], [[microarray]]s are used to measure how strongly different genes are expressed in a sample of biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of {{math|1}}, a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of {{math|−1}}, and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Microarray Gene Expression Data Analysis: A Beginner's Guide|first1=Helen|last1=Causton|first2=John|last2=Quackenbush|first3=Alvis|last3=Brazma|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4443-1156-3|pages=49–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bg6D_7mdG70C&amp;pg=PA49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data points obtained in this way are often visualized as a [[scatterplot]] in which one or both of the coordinate axes are binary logarithms of intensity ratios, or in visualizations such as the [[MA plot]] and [[RA plot]] that rotate and scale these log ratio scatterplots.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Computational and Statistical Methods for Protein Quantification by Mass Spectrometry|first1=Ingvar|last1=Eidhammer|first2=Harald|last2=Barsnes|first3=Geir Egil|last3=Eide|first4=Lennart|last4=Martens|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-49378-6|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z3VbhLz6pMC&amp;pg=PA105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music theory===
In [[music theory]], the [[Interval (music)|interval]] or perceptual difference between two tones is determined by the ratio of their frequencies. Intervals coming from [[rational number]] ratios with small numerators and denominators are perceived as particularly euphonious. The simplest and most important of these intervals is the [[octave]], a frequency ratio of {{math|2:1}}. The number of octaves by which two tones differ is the binary logarithm of their frequency ratio.&lt;ref name="mga"&gt;{{citation|title=The Musician's Guide to Acoustics|first1=Murray|last1=Campbell|first2=Clive|last2=Greated|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-19-159167-9|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiCZwwFG0x0C&amp;pg=PA78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To study [[tuning system]]s and other aspects of music theory that require finer distinctions between tones, it is helpful to have a measure of the size of an interval that is finer than an octave and is additive (as logarithms are) rather than multiplicative (as frequency ratios are). That is, if tones {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} form a rising sequence of tones, then the measure of the interval from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|y}} plus the measure of the interval from {{mvar|y}} to {{mvar|z}} should equal the measure of the interval from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|z}}. Such a measure is given by the [[Cent (music)|cent]], which divides the octave into {{math|1200}} equal intervals ({{math|12}} [[semitone]]s of {{math|100}} cents each). Mathematically, given tones with frequencies {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the number of cents in the interval from {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is&lt;ref name="mga"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left|1200\log_2\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[millioctave]] is defined in the same way, but with a multiplier of {{math|1000}} instead of {{math|1200}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music|edition=4th|editor-first=Don Michael|editor-last=Randel|editor-link=Don Michael Randel|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-674-01163-2|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&amp;pg=PA416}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports scheduling===
In competitive games and sports involving two players or teams in each game or match, the binary logarithm indicates the number of rounds necessary in a [[single-elimination tournament]] required to determine a winner. For example, a tournament of {{math|4}} players requires {{math|1=log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}4 = 2}} rounds to determine the winner, a tournament of {{math|32}} teams requires {{math|1=log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}32 = 5}} rounds, etc. In this case, for {{mvar|n}} players/teams where {{mvar|n}} is not a power of 2, {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}} is rounded up since it is necessary to have at least one round in which not all remaining competitors play. For example, {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}6}} is approximately {{math|2.585}}, which rounds up to {{math|3}}, indicating that a tournament of {{math|6}} teams requires {{math|3}} rounds (either two teams sit out the first round, or one team sits out the second round). The same number of rounds is also necessary to determine a clear winner in a [[Swiss-system tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to Physical Education and Sport Science|first=Robert|last=France|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4180-5529-5|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dH2nB1CX2SMC&amp;pg=PA282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
In [[photography]], [[exposure value]]s are measured in terms of the binary logarithm of the amount of light reaching the film or sensor, in accordance with the [[Weber–Fechner law]] describing a logarithmic response of the human visual system to light. A single stop of exposure is one unit on a base-{{math|2}} logarithmic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Manual of Photography|first1=Elizabeth|last1=Allen|first2=Sophie|last2=Triantaphillidou|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2011|isbn=978-0-240-52037-7|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfWivY3mIgAC&amp;pg=PA228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btzs"&gt;{{citation|title=Beyond the Zone System|first=Phil|last=Davis|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=978-1-136-09294-7|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaVEAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the exposure value of a photograph is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 \frac{N^2}{t}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|N}} is the [[f-number]] measuring the [[aperture]] of the lens during the exposure, and {{mvar|t}} is the number of seconds of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Allen|Triantaphillidou|2011}},  [https://books.google.com/books?id=IfWivY3mIgAC&amp;pg=PA235 p.&amp;nbsp;235].&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary logarithms (expressed as stops) are also used in [[densitometry]], to express the [[dynamic range]] of light-sensitive materials or digital sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Visual Effects Society Handbook: Workflow and Techniques|first1=Susan|last1=Zwerman|first2=Jeffrey A.|last2=Okun|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-136-13614-6|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rLpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
[[File:SR-50 early TI calculator.agr.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[TI SR-50]] [[scientific calculator]] (1974). The ln and log keys are in the second row; there is no log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}key.]]

===Conversion from other bases===
An easy way to calculate {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''n''}} on [[calculator]]s that do not have a {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} function is to use the [[natural logarithm]] ({{math|ln}}) or the [[common logarithm]] ({{math|log}} or {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}}) functions, which are found on most [[scientific calculator]]s. The specific [[Logarithm#Change of base|change of logarithm base]] [[formulae]] for this are:&lt;ref name="btzs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Secret History: The Story of Cryptology|first=Craig P.|last=Bauer|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4665-6186-1|page=332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PA332}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 n = \frac{\ln n}{\ln 2} = \frac{\log_{10} n}{\log_{10} 2},&lt;/math&gt;
or approximately
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 n \approx 1.442695\ln n \approx 3.321928\log_{10} n.&lt;/math&gt;

===Integer rounding===
The binary logarithm can be made into a function from integers and to integers by [[rounding]] it up or down.  These two forms of integer binary logarithm are related by this formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor = \lceil \log_2(n + 1) \rceil - 1, \text{ if }n \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren_2002"&gt;{{citation |title=Hacker's Delight |title-link=Hacker's Delight |first=Henry S. |last=Warren Jr. |date=2002 |edition=1st |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-201-91465-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The definition can be extended by defining &lt;math&gt; \lfloor \log_2(0) \rfloor = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Extended in this way, this function is related to the [[number of leading zeros]] of the 32-bit unsigned binary representation of {{mvar|x}}, {{math|nlz(''x'')}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor = 31 - \operatorname{nlz}(n).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren_2002" /&gt;

The integer binary logarithm can be interpreted as the zero-based index of the most significant {{math|1}} bit in the input. In this sense it is the complement of the [[find first set]] operation, which finds the index of the least significant {{math|1}} bit. Many hardware platforms include support for finding the number of leading zeros, or equivalent operations, which can be used to quickly find the binary logarithm. The &lt;code&gt;fls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flsl&lt;/code&gt; functions in the [[Linux kernel]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API-fls.html fls], Linux kernel API, [[kernel.org]], retrieved 2010-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some versions of the [[libc]] software library also compute the binary logarithm (rounded up to an integer, plus one).

===Iterative approximation===

For a general [[positive number|positive real number]], the binary logarithm may be computed in two parts.&lt;ref name="ml73"&gt;{{citation

First, one computes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integer part]], &lt;math&gt;\lfloor\log_2 x\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; (called the characteristic of the logarithm).
This reduces the problem to one where the argument of the logarithm is in a restricted range, the interval [1,2), simplifying the second step
of computing the fractional part (the mantissa of the logarithm).
For any {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}, there exists a unique integer {{mvar|n}} such that {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''x'' &lt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, or equivalently {{math|1 ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' &lt; 2}}.  Now the integer part of the logarithm is simply {{mvar|n}}, and the fractional part is {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="ml73"/&gt;  In other words:
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 x = n + \log_2 y \quad\text{where } y = 2^{-n}x \text{ and } y \in [1,2)&lt;/math&gt;
For normalized [[floating point]] numbers, the integer part is given by the floating point exponent,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Production Rendering: Design and Implementation|first=Ian|last=Stephenson|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84628-085-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCC5aTR34C4C&amp;pg=PA270|pages=270–273|contribution=9.6 Fast Power, Log2, and Exp2 Functions}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for integers it can be determined by performing a [[count leading zeros]] operation.&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"&gt;{{Citation |title=Hacker's Delight |title-link=Hacker's Delight |first=Henry S. |last=Warren Jr. |date=2013 |orig-year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] – [[Pearson Education, Inc.]] |isbn=978-0-321-84268-8 |id=0-321-84268-5 |page=291 |contribution=11-4: Integer Logarithm|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XD9iAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fractional part of the result is {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}''y''}}, and can be computed iteratively, using only elementary multiplication and division.&lt;ref name="ml73"/&gt;
The algorithm for computing the fractional part can be described in [[pseudocode]] as follows:
# Start with a real number {{mvar|y}} in the half-open interval {{math|[1,2)}}.  If {{math|1=''y'' = 1}}, then the algorithm is done and the fractional part is zero.
# Otherwise, square {{mvar|y}} repeatedly until the result {{mvar|z}} lies in the interval {{math|[2,4)}}.  Let {{mvar|m}} be the number of squarings needed.  That is, {{math|1=''z'' = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{mvar|m}} chosen such that {{mvar|z}} is in {{math|[2,4)}}.
# Taking the logarithm of both sides and doing some algebra:
#:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\log_2 z &amp;= 2^m \log_2 y \\
\log_2 y &amp;= \frac{ \log_2 z }{ 2^m } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 + \log_2(z/2) }{ 2^m } \\
&amp;= 2^{-m} + 2^{-m}\log_2(z/2)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
# Once again {{math|''z''/2}} is a real number in the interval {{math|[1,2)}}. Return to step 1, and compute the binary logarithm of {{math|''z''/2}} using the same method.

The result of this is expressed by the following recursive formulas, in which &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of squarings required in the ''i''-th iteration of the algorithm:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\log_2 x &amp;= n + 2^{-m_1} \left( 1 + 2^{-m_2} \left( 1 + 2^{-m_3} \left( 1 + \cdots \right)\right)\right) \\
&amp;= n + 2^{-m_1} + 2^{-m_1-m_2} + 2^{-m_1-m_2-m_3} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case where the fractional part in step 1 is found to be zero, this is a ''finite'' sequence terminating at some point.  Otherwise, it is an [[infinite series]] that [[convergent series|converge]]s according to the [[ratio test]], since each term is strictly less than the previous one (since every {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}).  For practical use, this infinite series must be truncated to reach an approximate result.  If the series is truncated after the {{mvar|i}}th term, then the error in the result is less than {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;−(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hsp}}+ ... + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="ml73"/&gt;

===Software library support===
The &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt; function is included in the standard [[C mathematical functions]]. The default version of this function takes [[double precision]] arguments but variants of it allow the argument to be single-precision or to be a [[long double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification | page=226| contribution = 7.12.6.10 The log2 functions }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[MATLAB]], the argument to the &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt; function is allowed to be a [[negative number]], and in this case the result will be a [[complex number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Matlab® 5 Handbook|first1=Darren|last1=Redfern|first2=Colin|last2=Campbell|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1998|isbn=978-1-4612-2170-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQDaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141|page=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a [[polynomial sequence]], i.e., a sequence of [[polynomial]]s indexed by { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } in which the index of each polynomial equals its [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]], is said to be of '''binomial type''' if it satisfies the sequence of identities
:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x+y)=\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}\, p_k(x)\, p_{n-k}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

Many such sequences exist.  The set of all such sequences forms a [[Lie group]] under the operation of umbral composition, explained below. Every sequence of binomial type may be expressed in terms of the [[Bell polynomial]]s. Every sequence of binomial type is a [[Sheffer sequence]] (but most Sheffer sequences are not of binomial type).  Polynomial sequences put on firm footing the vague 19th century notions of [[umbral calculus]].

==Examples==
* In consequence of this definition the [[binomial theorem]] can be stated by saying that the sequence { ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ... } is of binomial type.
* The sequence of "[[lower factorial]]s" is defined by

::&lt;math&gt;(x)_n=x(x-1)(x-2)\cdot\cdots\cdot(x-n+1).&lt;/math&gt;

:(In the theory of special functions, this same notation denotes [[upper factorial]]s, but this present usage is universal among [[combinatorics|combinatorialists]].) The product is understood to be 1 if ''n'' = 0, since it is in that case an [[empty product]].  This polynomial sequence is of binomial type.

* Similarly the "[[upper factorial]]s"

::&lt;math&gt;x^{(n)}=x(x+1)(x+2)\cdot\cdots\cdot(x+n-1)&lt;/math&gt;

:are a polynomial sequence of binomial type.

* The [[Abel polynomials]]

::&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=x(x-an)^{n-1} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:are a polynomial sequence of binomial type.

* The [[Touchard polynomials]]

::&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)x^k&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''S''(''n'', ''k'') is the number of partitions of a set of size ''n'' into ''k'' disjoint non-empty subsets, is a polynomial sequence of binomial type.  [[Eric Temple Bell]] called these the "exponential polynomials" and that term is also sometimes seen in the literature.  The coefficients ''S''(''n'', ''k'' ) are "[[Stirling number]]s of the second kind".  This sequence has a curious connection with the [[Poisson distribution]]: If ''X'' is a [[random variable]] with a Poisson distribution with expected value &amp;lambda; then E(''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;lambda;).  In particular, when &amp;lambda; = 1, we see that the ''n''th moment of the Poisson distribution with expected value 1 is the number of partitions of a set of size ''n'', called the ''n''th [[Bell numbers|Bell number]].  This fact about the ''n''th moment of that particular Poisson distribution is "[[Bell numbers|Dobinski's formula]]".

==Characterization by delta operators==
It can be shown that a polynomial sequence { ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(x) : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ... } is of binomial type if and only if all three of the following conditions hold:

* The [[linear transformation]] on the space of polynomials in ''x'' that is characterized by

::&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)\mapsto np_{n-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:is [[shift-equivariant]], and

* ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = 1 for all ''x'', and
* ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = 0 for ''n'' &gt; 0.

(The statement that this operator is shift-equivariant is the same as saying that the polynomial sequence is a [[Sheffer sequence]]; the set of sequences of binomial type is properly included within the set of Sheffer sequences.)

===Delta operators===
That linear transformation is clearly a [[delta operator]], i.e., a shift-equivariant linear transformation on the space of polynomials in ''x'' that reduces degrees of polynomials by 1.  The most obvious examples of delta operators are [[difference operator]]s and differentiation.  It can be shown that every delta operator can be written as a [[power series]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n D^n&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D'' is differentiation (note that the lower bound of summation is 1).  Each delta operator ''Q'' has a unique sequence of "basic polynomials", i.e., a polynomial sequence satisfying
#&lt;math&gt;p_0(x)=1, \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;p_n(0)=0\quad{\rm for\ }n\geq 1,{\rm\ and}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;Qp_n(x)=np_{n-1}(x). \,&lt;/math&gt;
It was shown in 1973 by [[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], Kahaner, and [[Andrew Odlyzko|Odlyzko]], that a polynomial sequence is of binomial type if and only if it is the sequence of basic polynomials of some delta operator.  Therefore, this paragraph amounts to a recipe for generating as many polynomial sequences of binomial type as one may wish.

==Characterization by Bell polynomials==
For any sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of scalars, let

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(a_1,\dots,a_{n-k+1}) x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[Bell polynomials|Bell polynomial]].  Then this polynomial sequence is of binomial type.  Note that for each ''n'' ≥ 1,

:&lt;math&gt;p_n'(0)=a_n.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here is the main result of this section:

'''Theorem:''' All polynomial sequences of binomial type are of this form.

A result in Mullin and Rota, repeated in Rota, Kahaner, and Odlyzko (see ''References'' below) states that every polynomial sequence {&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of binomial type is determined by the sequence {&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;(0)&amp;nbsp;}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but those sources do not mention Bell polynomials.

This sequence of scalars is also related to the delta operator.  Let

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty {a_n \over n!} t^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;P^{-1}\left({d \over dx}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

is the delta operator of this sequence.

==Characterization by a convolution identity==
For sequences ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., define a sort of [[convolution]] by

:&lt;math&gt;(a \mathbin{\diamondsuit} b)_n = \sum_{j=0}^n {n \choose j} a_j b_{n-j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;a_n^{k\diamondsuit}\,&lt;/math&gt; be the ''n''th term of the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a\mathbin{\diamondsuit}\cdots\mathbin{\diamondsuit} a}_{k\text{ factors}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then for any sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, the sequence defined by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = 1 and

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n {a_n^{k\diamondsuit} x^k \over k!}\,&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' ≥ 1, is of binomial type, and every sequence of binomial type is of this form.  This result is due to Alessandro di Bucchianico (see '''References''' below).

==Characterization by generating functions==
Polynomial sequences of binomial type are precisely those whose [[generating function]]s are formal (not necessarily convergent) [[power series]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty {p_n(x) \over n!}t^n=e^{xf(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''(''t'') is a formal power series whose [[constant term]] is zero and whose first-degree term is not zero.  It can be shown by the use of the power-series version of [[Faà di Bruno's formula]] that

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty {p_n\,'(0) \over n!}t^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The delta operator of the sequence is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''D''), so that

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(D)p_n(x)=np_{n-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===A way to think about these generating functions===
The coefficients in the product of two formal power series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty {a_n \over n!}t^n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty {b_n \over n!}t^n&lt;/math&gt;

are

:&lt;math&gt;c_n=\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} a_k b_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

(see also [[Cauchy product]]).  If we think of ''x'' as a parameter indexing a family of such power series, then the binomial identity says in effect that the power series indexed by ''x'' + ''y'' is the product of those indexed by ''x'' and by ''y''.  Thus the ''x'' is the argument to a function that maps sums to products: an [[exponential function]]

:&lt;math&gt;g(t)^x=e^{x f(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''(''t'') has the form given above.

==Umbral composition of polynomial sequences==
The set of all polynomial sequences of binomial type is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the group operation is "umbral composition" of polynomial sequences.  That operation is defined as follows.  Suppose { ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } and { ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') : ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } are polynomial sequences, and

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n,k}\, x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the umbral composition ''p'' o ''q'' is the polynomial sequence whose ''n''th term is

:&lt;math&gt;(p_n\circ q)(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_{n,k}\, q_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;

(the subscript ''n'' appears in ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, since this is the ''n'' term of that sequence, but not in ''q'', since this refers to the sequence as a whole rather than one of its terms).

With the delta operator defined by a power series in ''D'' as above, the natural bijection between delta operators and polynomial sequences of binomial type, also defined above, is a group isomorphism, in which the group operation on power series is formal composition of formal power series.

==Cumulants and moments==
The sequence κ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of coefficients of the first-degree terms in a polynomial sequence of binomial type may be termed the [[cumulant]]s of the polynomial sequence.  It can be shown that the whole polynomial sequence of binomial type is determined by its cumulants, in a way discussed in the article titled ''[[cumulant]]''.  Thus

:&lt;math&gt; p_n'(0)=\kappa_n= \,&lt;/math&gt; the ''n''th cumulant

and

:&lt;math&gt; p_n(1)=\mu_n'= \,&lt;/math&gt; the ''n''th moment.

These are "formal" cumulants and "formal" [[moment (mathematics)|moments]], as opposed to cumulants of a [[probability distribution]] and moments of a probability distribution.

Let

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\kappa_n}{n!}t^n&lt;/math&gt;

be the (formal) cumulant-generating function.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(D) \,&lt;/math&gt;

is the delta operator associated with the polynomial sequence, i.e., we have

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(D)p_n(x)=np_{n-1}(x). \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The concept of binomial type has applications in [[combinatorics]], [[probability]], [[statistics]], and a variety of other fields.

:''"Bounded" and "boundary" are distinct concepts; for the latter see [[boundary (topology)]]. A [[circle]] in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the [[half plane]] is unbounded yet has a boundary.
In [[mathematical analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is called '''bounded''', if it is, in a certain sense, of finite size. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called '''unbounded'''. The word bounded makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding [[Metric_(mathematics)|metric]].

== Definition ==
[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|A real set with upper bounds and its [[supremum]].]]
A set ''S'' of [[real number]]s is called ''bounded from above'' if there is a real number ''k'' such that ''k'' ≥ '' s'' for all ''s'' in ''S''. The number ''k'' is called an '''upper bound''' of ''S''. The terms ''bounded from below'' and '''lower bound''' are similarly defined.

A set ''S'' is '''bounded''' if it has both upper and lower bounds. Therefore, a set of real numbers is bounded if it is contained in a [[interval (mathematics)|finite interval]].

== Metric space ==

A [[subset]] ''S'' of a [[metric space]] (''M'', ''d'') is '''bounded''' if it is contained in a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] of finite radius, i.e. if there exists ''x'' in ''M'' and ''r'' &gt; 0 such that for all ''s'' in ''S'', we have d(''x'', ''s'') &lt; ''r''. (''M'', ''d'') is a ''bounded'' metric space (or ''d'' is a ''bounded'' metric) if ''M'' is bounded as a subset of itself.

*[[Total boundlessness]] implies boundlessness. For subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; the two are equivalent.
*A metric space is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if it is [[Complete metric space|complete]] and totally bounded.
*A subset of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is compact if and only if it is [[closed set|closed]] and bounded.

== Boundedness in topological vector spaces ==
{{main|Bounded set (topological vector space)}}
In [[topological vector space]]s, a different definition for bounded sets exists which is sometimes called [[von Neumann bounded]]ness. If the topology of the topological vector space is induced by a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] which is [[homogeneous metric|homogeneous]], as in the case of a metric induced by the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of [[normed vector spaces]], then the two definitions coincide.

==Boundedness in order theory==

A set of real numbers is bounded if and only if it has an upper and lower bound. This definition is extendable to subsets of any [[partially ordered set]]. Note that this more general concept of boundedness does not correspond to a notion of "size". 

A subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set ''P'' is called '''bounded above''' if there is an element ''k'' in ''P'' such that ''k'' ≥ ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''S''. The element ''k'' is called an '''upper bound''' of ''S''. The concepts of '''bounded below''' and '''lower bound''' are defined similarly.  (See also [[upper and lower bounds]].)

A subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set ''P'' is called '''bounded''' if it has both an upper and a lower bound, or equivalently, if it is contained in an [[Interval (mathematics)#Intervals in order theory|interval]]. Note that this is not just a property of the set ''S'' but also one of the set ''S'' as subset of ''P''.

A '''bounded poset''' ''P'' (that is, by itself, not as subset) is one that has a least element and a [[greatest element]]. Note that this concept of boundedness has nothing to do with finite size, and that a subset ''S'' of a bounded poset ''P'' with as order the [[Binary_relation#Restriction|restriction]] of the order on ''P'' is not necessarily a bounded poset.

A subset ''S'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is bounded with respect to the [[Euclidean distance]] if and only if it bounded as subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the [[product order]]. However, ''S'' may be bounded as subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the [[lexicographical order]], but not with respect to the Euclidean distance.

A class of [[ordinal number]]s is said to be unbounded, or [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]], when given any ordinal, there is always some element of the class greater than it. Thus in this case "unbounded" does not mean unbounded by itself but unbounded as a subclass of the class of all ordinal numbers.

'''Ciphertext indistinguishability''' is a property of many [[encryption]] schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of [[Computational indistinguishability|indistinguishability]], then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of [[ciphertext]]s based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under [[chosen plaintext attack]] is considered a basic requirement for most [[provable security|provably secure]] [[asymmetric key encryption algorithm|public key cryptosystem]]s, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under [[chosen ciphertext attack]] and [[adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of [[semantic security]], and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.

A cryptosystem is considered ''secure in terms of indistinguishability'' if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing ({{frac|1|2}}). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than {{frac|1|2}}, then this adversary is considered to have an "advantage" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is ''not'' considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.

== Formal definitions ==

Security in terms of indistinguishability has many definitions, depending on assumptions made about the capabilities of the attacker. It is normally presented as a [[game]], where the cryptosystem is considered [[information security|secure]] if no adversary can win the game with significantly greater probability than an adversary who must guess randomly. The most common definitions used in cryptography are '''indistinguishability under [[chosen plaintext attack]]''' (abbreviated IND-CPA), '''indistinguishability under (non-adaptive) [[chosen ciphertext attack]]''' (IND-CCA1), and '''indistinguishability under [[adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]''' (IND-CCA2). Security under either of the latter definition implies security under the previous ones: a scheme which is IND-CCA1 secure is also IND-CPA secure, and a scheme which is IND-CCA2 secure is both IND-CCA1 and IND-CPA secure. Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of the three definitions of security.

=== Indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA)  {{anchor|IND-CPA}} ===

For a probabilistic [[asymmetric key encryption algorithm]], indistinguishability under [[chosen plaintext attack]] (IND-CPA) is defined by the following game between an adversary and a challenger. For schemes based on [[computational security]], the adversary is modeled by a [[probabilistic polynomial time]] [[Turing machine]], meaning that it must complete the game and output a ''guess'' within a polynomial number of time steps. In this definition E(PK, ''M'') represents the encryption of a message ''M'' under the key ''PK'':

#The challenger generates a key pair ''PK'', ''SK'' based on some security parameter ''k'' (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes ''PK'' to the adversary. The challenger retains ''SK''.
#The adversary may perform a polynomially bounded number of encryptions or other operations.
#Eventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_0, M_1&lt;/math&gt; to the challenger.
#The challenger selects a bit ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \in&lt;/math&gt; {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the ''challenge'' ciphertext ''C'' = E(PK, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_b&lt;/math&gt;) back to the adversary.
#The adversary is free to perform any number of additional computations or encryptions. Finally, it outputs a guess for the value of ''b''.

A cryptosystem is '''indistinguishable under chosen plaintext''' attack if every probabilistic polynomial time adversary has only a negligible "[[advantage (cryptography)|advantage]]" over random guessing. An adversary is said to have a negligible "advantage" if it wins the above game with probability &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \,+\, \epsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[negligible function]] in the security parameter ''k'', that is for every (nonzero) polynomial function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle poly()&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |\epsilon(k)| \;&lt;\; \left|\frac{1}{poly(k)}\right|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k \;&gt;\; k_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Although the adversary knows &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_1&lt;/math&gt; and PK, the probabilistic nature of E means that the encryption of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_b&lt;/math&gt; will be only one of many valid ciphertexts, and therefore encrypting &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_1&lt;/math&gt; and comparing the resulting ciphertexts with the challenge ciphertext does not afford any non-negligible advantage to the adversary.

While the above definition is specific to an asymmetric key cryptosystem, it can be adapted to the [[symmetric encryption|symmetric]] case by replacing the public key encryption function with an [[oracle machine|encryption oracle]], which retains the secret encryption key and encrypts arbitrary plaintexts at the adversary's request.

==== Symmetric IND-CPA Game, Formalized ====
The adversarial process of performing a chosen-plaintext attack is usually outlined in the form of a [[Cryptographic Game]]. To test for symmetric IND-CPA, the game described above is defined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/cse207/w-se.pdf|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Chapter 4: Symmetric Encryption|last2=Rogaway|first2=Phillip|date=September 21, 2005|website=|page=12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Bellare|first1=Mihir|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{K}
&lt;/math&gt; be a key generation function, &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{E}
&lt;/math&gt; be an encryption function, and &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{D}
&lt;/math&gt; be a decryption function. Let &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}\mathcal{E} = (\mathcal{K}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{D})
&lt;/math&gt; be a symmetric encryption scheme. The game &lt;math&gt;Guess&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

[[File:IND-CPA_Guess_Cryptographic_Game.svg|frameless|300x300px]]

As many times as it would like, an adversary selects two plaintext messages of its own choosing and provides them to the '''LR''' oracle which returns a ciphertext encrypting one of the messages. An adversary's advantage is determined by its probability of guessing the value of ''b,'' a value chosen at random at the beginning of the game which determines the message that is encrypted in the '''LR''' oracle. Therefore, its advantage is defined as:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Advantage_of_IND-CPA_Guess_Game.svg|frameless|456x456px]]

=== Indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack/adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA1, IND-CCA2) {{anchor|IND-CCA1|IND-CCA2}} ===

Indistinguishability under non-adaptive and adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA1, IND-CCA2) uses a definition similar to that of IND-CPA. However, in addition to the public key (or encryption oracle, in the symmetric case), the adversary is given access to a ''[[decryption oracle]]'' which decrypts arbitrary ciphertexts at the adversary's request, returning the plaintext. In the non-adaptive definition, the adversary is allowed to query this oracle only up until it receives the challenge ciphertext. In the adaptive definition, the adversary may continue to query the decryption oracle even after it has received a challenge ciphertext, with the caveat that it may not pass the challenge ciphertext for decryption (otherwise, the definition would be trivial).

#The challenger generates a key pair ''PK'', ''SK'' based on some security parameter ''k'' (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes ''PK'' to the adversary. The challenger retains ''SK''.
#The adversary may perform any number of encryptions, calls to the decryption oracle based on arbitrary ciphertexts, or other operations.
#Eventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_0,\, M_1&lt;/math&gt; to the challenger.
#The challenger selects a bit ''b'' ∈ {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the "challenge" ciphertext ''C'' = E(PK, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_b&lt;/math&gt;) back to the adversary.
#The adversary is free to perform any number of additional computations or encryptions.
##In the ''non-adaptive'' case (IND-CCA1), the adversary may ''not'' make further calls to the decryption oracle.
##In the ''adaptive'' case (IND-CCA2), the adversary may make further calls to the decryption oracle, but may not submit the challenge ciphertext ''C''.
#Finally, the adversary outputs a guess for the value of ''b''.

A scheme is IND-CCA1/IND-CCA2 secure if no adversary has a non-negligible advantage in winning the above game.

If an adversary is unable to tell if a message even exists, it gives the person who wrote the message [[plausible deniability]].

Some people building encrypted communication links prefer to make the contents of each encrypted datagram indistinguishable from random data, in order to make traffic analysis more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some people building systems to store encrypted data prefer to make the data indistinguishable from random data in order to make [[anti-computer forensics#Data hiding|data hiding]] easier.
For example, some kinds of [[disk encryption]] such as [[TrueCrypt#Identifying TrueCrypt volumes|TrueCrypt]] attempt to hide data in the innocent random data left over from some kinds of [[data erasure]].
As another example, some kinds of [[steganography]] attempt to hide data by making it match the statistical characteristics of the innocent "random" [[image noise]] in digital photos.

To support such [[deniable encryption]] systems, a few cryptographic algorithms are specifically designed to make ciphertext messages indistinguishable from random bit strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If an encryption algorithm E can be designed such that an attacker (typically defined as a polynomial-time observer) who knows a plaintext message m is unable to distinguish between E(m), the encryption of that message, and a freshly-generated random bit string of the same length as E(m),
then it follows that when E(m1) is the same length as E(m2),
those two encrypted messages will be indistinguishable from each other by that attacker, even if that attacker knows the plaintext m1 and m2 (IND-CPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most applications don't require an encryption algorithm to produce encrypted messages that are indistinguishable from random bits.
However, some authors consider such encryption algorithms to be conceptually simpler and easier to work with, and more versatile in practice—and most IND-CPA encryption algorithms apparently do, in fact, produce encrypted messages that are indistinguishable from random bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Equivalences and implications ==

Indistinguishability is an important property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications. However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties. Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, it is known that the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of [[malleability (cryptography)|non-malleability]] under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2). This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a property dealing with message integrity, rather than confidentiality. In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa. The following list summarizes a few known implications, though it is by no means complete.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \;\Rightarrow\; B&lt;/math&gt; means that property A implies property B. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \;\Leftrightarrow\; B&lt;/math&gt; means that properties A and B are ''equivalent''. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \;\not \Rightarrow\; B&lt;/math&gt; means that property A does not necessarily imply property B.

* IND-CPA &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; [[semantic security]] under CPA.
* NM-CPA ([[malleability (cryptography)|non-malleability]] under chosen plaintext attack) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; IND-CPA.
* NM-CPA ([[malleability (cryptography)|non-malleability]] under chosen plaintext attack) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \not \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; IND-CCA2.
* NM-CCA2 ([[malleability (cryptography)|non-malleability]] under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; IND-CCA2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6274">In mathematics, a  '''Demazure module''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Michel Demazure|last=Demazure|year1=1974a|year2=1974b}}, is a  submodule of a finite-dimensional representation generated by an extremal weight space under the action of a Borel subalgebra. The '''Demazure character formula''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Michel Demazure|last=Demazure|year=1974b|loc=theorem 2}},  gives the characters of Demazure modules, and is a generalization of the [[Weyl character formula]].
The dimension of a Demazure module is a polynomial in the highest weight, called a '''Demazure polynomial'''.

==Demazure modules==

Suppose that ''g'' is a complex semisimple Lie algebra, with a [[Borel subalgebra]] ''b'' containing a [[Cartan subalgebra]] ''h''. An irreducible finite-dimensional representation ''V'' of ''g'' splits as a sum of eigenspaces of ''h'', and the highest weight space is 1-dimensional and is an eigenspace of ''b''. The [[Weyl group]] ''W'' acts on the weights of ''V'', and the conjugates ''w''λ of the highest weight vector λ under this action are the extremal weights, whose weight spaces are all 1-dimensional.

A Demazure module is the ''b''-submodule of ''V'' generated by the weight space of an extremal vector ''w''λ, so the Demazure submodules of ''V'' are parametrized by the Weyl group ''W''.

There are two extreme cases: if ''w'' is trivial the Demazure module is just 1-dimensional, and if ''w'' is the element of maximal length of ''W'' then the Demazure module is the whole of the irreducible representation ''V''.

Demazure modules can be defined in a similar way for highest weight representations of [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s,  except that one now has 2 cases as one can consider the submodules generated by either the Borel subalgebra ''b'' or its opposite subalgebra. In the finite-dimensional these are exchanged by the longest element of the Weyl group, but this is no longer the case in infinite dimensions as there is no longest element.

==Demazure character formula==
===History===

The Demazure character formula was introduced by {{harv|Demazure|1974b|loc=theorem 2}}.
[[Victor Kac]] pointed out that Demazure's proof has a serious gap, as it depends on  {{harv|Demazure|1974a|loc=Proposition 11, section 2}}, which is false; see {{harv|Joseph|1985|loc=section 4}} for Kac's counterexample. {{harvtxt|Andersen|1985}}  gave a proof of Demazure's character formula using the work on the geometry of [[Schubert varieties]] by {{harvtxt|Ramanan|Ramanathan|1985}} and {{harvtxt|Mehta|Ramanathan|1985}}.  {{harvtxt|Joseph|1985}} gave a proof for sufficiently large dominant  highest weight modules using Lie algebra techniques. {{harvtxt|Kashiwara|1993}} proved a refined version of the Demazure character formula that {{harvtxt|Littelmann|1995}} conjectured (and proved in many cases).

===Statement===

The Demazure character formula is
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Ch}(F(w\lambda)) = \Delta_1\Delta_2\cdots\Delta_ne^\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
Here:
*''w'' is an element of the Weyl group, with reduced decomposition ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as a product of reflections of simple roots.
*λ is a lowest weight, and ''e''&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt; the corresponding element of the group ring of the weight lattice.
*Ch(''F''(''w''λ)) is the character of the Demazure module ''F''(''w''λ).
*''P'' is the weight lattice, and '''Z'''[''P''] is its group ring.
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of fundamental weights and the dot action is defined by &lt;math&gt;w\cdot u=w(u+\rho)-\rho&lt;/math&gt;.
*Δ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; for α a root is the endomorphism of the '''Z'''-module '''Z'''[''P''] defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\alpha(u) = \frac{u-s_\alpha \cdot  u}{1-e^{-\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
:and Δ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is Δ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; for α the root of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''discrete Poisson equation''' is the [[finite difference]] analog of the [[Poisson equation]]. In it, the [[discrete Laplace operator]] takes the place of the [[Laplace operator]]. The discrete Poisson equation is frequently used in [[numerical analysis]] as a stand-in for the continuous Poisson equation, although it is also studied in its own right as a topic in [[discrete mathematics]].

==On a two-dimensional rectangular grid==
Using the [[finite difference]] numerical method to discretize
the 2-dimensional Poisson equation (assuming a uniform spatial discretization, &lt;math&gt;\Delta x=\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;) on an ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' grid gives the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists|edition=2nd|first=Joe|last=Hoffman|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 9.  Elliptic partial differential equations|publisher=McGraw&amp;ndash;Hill|isbn=0-8247-0443-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
( {\nabla}^2 u )_{ij} = \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} (u_{i+1,j} + u_{i-1,j} + u_{i,j+1} + u_{i,j-1} - 4 u_{ij}) = g_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; 2 \le i \le m-1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 2 \le j \le n-1 &lt;/math&gt;.  The preferred arrangement of the solution vector is to use [[Enumeration|natural ordering]] which, prior to removing boundary elements, would look like:

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix} u_{11} , u_{21} , \ldots , u_{m1} , u_{12} , u_{22} , \ldots , u_{m2} , \ldots , u_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}^T
&lt;/math&gt;

This will result in an ''mn''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''mn'' linear system:

:&lt;math&gt; A\vec{u} = \vec{b} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
        ~D &amp; -I &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 \\
        -I &amp; ~D &amp; -I &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 \\
        ~0 &amp; -I &amp; ~D &amp; -I &amp; ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 \\
        \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
        ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 &amp; -I &amp; ~D &amp; -I &amp; ~0 \\
        ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 &amp; -I &amp; ~D &amp; -I \\
        ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; \ldots &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 &amp; -I &amp; ~D
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is the ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''m'' [[identity matrix]], and &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;, also ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''m'', is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
D =
\begin{bmatrix}
        ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 \\
        -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 \\
        ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 \\
        \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
        ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 \\
        ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 \\
        ~0 &amp; \ldots &amp; \ldots &amp; \ldots &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Golub, Gene H. and C. F. Van Loan, ''Matrix Computations, 3rd Ed.'',
The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, pages 177–180.&lt;/ref&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\vec{b}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{b} =
-\Delta x^2\begin{bmatrix} g_{11} , g_{21} , \ldots , g_{m1} , g_{12} , g_{22} , \ldots , g_{m2} , \ldots , g_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}^T.
&lt;/math&gt;

For each &lt;math&gt; u_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; equation, the columns of &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; correspond to a block of &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; components in  &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
        u_{1j} , &amp; u_{2j} , &amp; \ldots, &amp; u_{i-1,j}  , &amp; u_{ij} , &amp; u_{i+1,j} , &amp; \ldots , &amp; u_{mj}
\end{bmatrix}^{T}

&lt;/math&gt;

while the columns of &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; to the left and right of &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; each correspond to other blocks of &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; components within &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
        u_{1,j-1} , &amp; u_{2,j-1} , &amp; \ldots, &amp; u_{i-1,j-1}  , &amp; u_{i,j-1} , &amp; u_{i+1,j-1} , &amp; \ldots , &amp; u_{m,j-1}
\end{bmatrix}^{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
        u_{1,j+1} , &amp; u_{2,j+1} , &amp; \ldots, &amp; u_{i-1,j+1}  , &amp; u_{i,j+1} , &amp; u_{i+1,j+1} , &amp; \ldots , &amp; u_{m,j+1}
\end{bmatrix}^{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

respectively.

From the above, it can be inferred that there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; block columns of &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.  It is important to note that prescribed values of &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; (usually lying on the boundary) would have their corresponding elements removed from &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;.  For the common case that all the nodes on the boundary are set, we have &lt;math&gt; 2 \le i \le m - 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 2 \le j \le n - 1 &lt;/math&gt;, and the system would have the dimensions (''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2), where &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; would have dimensions&amp;nbsp;(''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2).

== Example ==

For a 5×5 ( &lt;math&gt; m = 5  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n = 5 &lt;/math&gt; ) grid with all the boundary nodes prescribed,
the system would look like:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} U \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} u_{22}, u_{32}, u_{42}, u_{23}, u_{33}, u_{43}, u_{24}, u_{34}, u_{44}
\end{bmatrix}^{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;
A =
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|ccc|ccc}
       ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 \\
       -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 \\
       ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 \\
       \hline
       -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 \\
       ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 \\
       ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 \\
       \hline
       ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 \\
       ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 \\
       ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4
\end{array}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{b} =
\left[\begin{array}{l}
        -\Delta x^2 g_{22} + u_{12} + u_{21} \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{32} + u_{31} ~~~~~~~~ \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{42} + u_{52} + u_{41} \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{23} + u_{13} ~~~~~~~~ \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{33}  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{43} + u_{53} ~~~~~~~~ \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{24} + u_{14} + u_{25} \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{34} + u_{35} ~~~~~~~~ \\
        -\Delta x^2 g_{44} + u_{54} + u_{45}
\end{array}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, the boundary &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;'s are brought to the right-hand-side
of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Cheny, Ward and David Kincaid, ''Numerical Mathematics and Computing 2nd Ed.'',
Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, Pacific Grove, 1985, pages 443–448.&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire system is 9&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;9 while &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; are 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3 and given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
D =
\begin{bmatrix}
       ~4 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 \\
       -1 &amp; ~4 &amp; -1 \\
       ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
-I =
\begin{bmatrix}
       -1 &amp; ~0 &amp; ~0 \\
       ~0 &amp; -1 &amp; ~0 \\
       ~0 &amp; ~0 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Methods of solution ==

Because &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} A \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; is block tridiagonal and sparse, many methods of solution
have been developed to optimally solve this linear system for &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} U \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.
Among the methods are a generalized [[Thomas algorithm]] with a resulting computational complexity of &lt;math&gt; O(n^{2.5}) &lt;/math&gt;, [[cyclic reduction]], [[successive overrelaxation]] that has a complexity of &lt;math&gt; O(n^{1.5}) &lt;/math&gt;, and [[Fast Fourier transform]]s which is &lt;math&gt; O(n \log(n)) &lt;/math&gt;. An optimal &lt;math&gt; O(n) &lt;/math&gt; solution can also be computed using [[multigrid methods]]. &lt;ref&gt;CS267: Notes for Lectures 15 and 16, Mar 5 and 7, 1996, https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture24/lecture24.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

In [[computational fluid dynamics]], for the solution of an incompressible flow problem, the incompressibility condition acts as a constraint for the pressure. There is no explicit form available for pressure in this case due to a strong coupling of the velocity and pressure fields. In this condition, by taking the divergence of all terms in the momentum equation, one obtains the pressure poisson equation.

For an incompressible flow this constraint is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \partial v_x }{ \partial x} + \frac{ \partial v_y }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; v_x &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in the &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; direction, &lt;math&gt; v_y &lt;/math&gt; is
velocity in &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v_z &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in the &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt; direction. Taking divergence of the momentum equation and using the incompressibility constraint, the pressure poisson equation is formed given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 p = f(\nu,V)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The discrete Poisson's equation arises in the theory of 
[[Markov chain]]s.    It appears as the relative value function for the dynamic programming equation in a  [[Markov decision process]], and  as the ''[[control variate]]'' for application in simulation variance reduction.&lt;ref name=MCSS&gt; S.

More precisely, it asserts the existence of positive constants ''c'' and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\max( |A+A|, |A \cdot A| ) \geq c |A|^{1+\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

whenever ''A'' is a finite non-empty set of real numbers of cardinality |''A''|, where &lt;math&gt;A+A = \{ a+b: a,b \in A \}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sum-set]] of ''A'' with itself, and &lt;math&gt;A \cdot A = \{ab: a,b \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is possible for ''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''A'' to be of comparable size to ''A'' if ''A'' is an [[arithmetic progression]], and it is possible for ''A''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''A'' to be of comparable size to ''A'' if ''A'' is a [[geometric progression]]. The Erdős–Szemerédi theorem can thus be viewed as an assertion that it is not possible for a large set to behave like an arithmetic progression and as a geometric progression simultaneously. It can also be viewed as an assertion that the real line does not contain any set resembling a finite subring or finite subfield; it is the first example of what is now known as the ''sum-product phenomenon'', which is now known to hold in a wide variety of rings and fields, including finite fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14338">'''FRACTRAN''' is a [[Turing-complete]] [[esoteric programming language]] invented by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. A FRACTRAN program is an [[sequence|ordered list]] of positive [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] together with an initial positive integer input ''n''. The program is run by updating the integer ''n'' as follows:
#for the first fraction ''f'' in the list for which ''nf'' is an integer, replace ''n'' by ''nf''
#repeat this rule until no fraction in the list produces an integer when multiplied by ''n'', then halt.

In ''The Book of Numbers'', John Conway and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]] gave a [[formula for primes]] in FRACTRAN:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-387-97993-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;A slightly different but equivalent sequence from Conway (1987) is:
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{17}{91}, \frac{78}{85}, \frac{19}{51}, \frac{23}{38}, \frac{29}{33}, \frac{77}{29}, \frac{95}{23}, \frac{77}{19}, \frac{1}{17}, \frac{11}{13}, \frac{13}{11}, \frac{15}{2}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{55}{1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{17}{91}, \frac{78}{85}, \frac{19}{51}, \frac{23}{38}, \frac{29}{33}, \frac{77}{29}, \frac{95}{23}, \frac{77}{19}, \frac{1}{17}, \frac{11}{13}, \frac{13}{11}, \frac{15}{14}, \frac{15}{2}, \frac{55}{1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Starting with ''n''=2, this FRACTRAN program generates the following sequence of integers:

:2, 15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, 390, 330, 290, 770, ... {{OEIS|id=A007542}}

After 2, this sequence contains the following powers of 2:

:&lt;math&gt;2^2=4,\, 2^3=8,\, 2^5=32,\, 2^7=128,\, 2^{11}=2048,\, 2^{13}=8192,\, 2^{17}=131072,\, 2^{19}=524288,\,  \dots&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A034785}}

which are the prime powers of 2.

== Understanding a FRACTRAN program ==
A FRACTRAN program can be seen as a type of [[register machine]] where the registers are stored in prime exponents in the argument ''n''.

Using [[Gödel numbering]], a positive integer ''n'' can encode an arbitrary number of arbitrarily large positive integer variables.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Gödel numbering]] cannot be directly used for negative integers, floating point numbers or text strings, although conventions could be adopted to represent these data types indirectly. Proposed extensions to FRACTRAN include [http://www.esolangs.org/wiki/Fractran_plus_plus FRACTRAN++] and [http://home.nvg.org/~oerjan/esoteric/bag/ Bag].&lt;/ref&gt; The value of each variable is encoded as the exponent of a prime number in the [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]] of the integer. For example, the integer

:&lt;math&gt;60 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1&lt;/math&gt;

represents a register state in which one variable (which we will call v2) holds the value 2 and two other variables (v3 and v5) hold the value 1. All other variables hold the value 0.

A FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive fractions. Each fraction represents an instruction that tests one or more variables, represented by the prime factors of its [[denominator]]. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;f_1 = \frac{21}{20} = \frac{3 \times 7}{2^2 \times 5^1}&lt;/math&gt;

tests v2 and v5. If &lt;math&gt;v_2 \ge 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_5 \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, then it subtracts 2 from v2 and 1 from v5 and adds 1 to v3 and 1 to v7. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;60 \cdot f_1 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \cdot \frac{3 \times 7}{2^2 \times 5^1} = 3^2 \times 7^1&lt;/math&gt;

Since the FRACTRAN program is just a list of fractions, these test-decrement-increment instructions are the only allowed instructions in the FRACTRAN language. In addition the following restrictions apply:

:*Each time an instruction is executed, the variables that are tested are also decremented.
:*The same variable cannot be both decremented and incremented in a single instruction (otherwise the fraction representing that instruction would not be in its [[lowest terms]]). Therefore each FRACTRAN instruction consumes variables as it tests them.
:*It is not possible for a FRACTRAN instruction to directly test if a variable is 0 (However, an indirect test can be implemented by creating a default instruction that is placed after other instructions that test a particular variable.).

== Creating simple programs ==
=== Addition ===
The simplest FRACTRAN program is a single instruction such as

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This program can be represented as a (very simple) algorithm as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FRACTRAN&lt;br&gt;Instruction
! Condition
! Action
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| v2 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v2&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v3
|-
|
| v2 = 0
| Stop
|}

Given an initial input of the form &lt;math&gt;2^a 3^b&lt;/math&gt;, this program will compute the sequence &lt;math&gt;2^{a-1} 3^{b+1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2^{a-2} 3^{b+2}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., until eventually, after &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; steps, no factors of 2 remain and the product with &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt; no longer yields an integer; the machine then stops with a final output of &lt;math&gt; 3^{a + b} &lt;/math&gt;. It therefore adds two integers together.

=== Multiplication ===
We can create a "multiplier" by "looping" through the "adder". In order to do this we need to introduce [[State (computer science)|states]] into our algorithm. This algorithm will take a number &lt;math&gt;2^a 3^b&lt;/math&gt; and produce &lt;math&gt;5^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Current State
! Condition
! Action
! Next State
|-
| rowspan="4" align="center" | A
| v7 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v7&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v3
| align="center" | A
|-
| v7 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v2 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v2
| align="center" | B
|-
| v7 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v2 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v3
| align="center" | A
|-
| v7 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v2 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v3 = 0
| Stop
|
|-
| rowspan="2" align="center" | B
| v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v3&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v5&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v7
| align="center" | B
|-
| v3 = 0
| None
| align="center" | A
|}

State B is a loop that adds v3 to v5 and also moves v3 to v7, and state A is an outer control loop that repeats the loop in state B v2 times. State A also restores the value of v3 from v7 after the loop in state B has completed.

We can implement states using new variables as state indicators. The state indicators for state B will be v11 and v13. Note that we require two state control indicators for one loop; a primary flag (v11) and a secondary flag (v13). Because each indicator is consumed whenever it is tested, we need a secondary indicator to say "continue in the current state"; this secondary indicator is swapped back to the primary indicator in the next instruction, and the loop continues.

Adding FRACTRAN state indicators and instructions to the multiplication algorithm table, we have:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FRACTRAN&lt;br&gt;Instruction
! Current State
! State&lt;br&gt;Indicators
! Condition
! Action
! Next State
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| rowspan="4" align="center" | A
| rowspan="4" | None
| v7 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v7&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v3
| align="center" | A
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| v7 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v2 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v2
| align="center" | B
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| v7 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v2 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v3
| align="center" | A
|-
|
| v7 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v2 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v3 = 0
| Stop
|
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{5 \cdot 7 \cdot 13}{3 \cdot 11}, \frac{11}{13}&lt;/math&gt;
| rowspan="2" align="center" | B
| rowspan="2" | v11, v13
| v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v3&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v5&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v7
| align="center" | B
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{11}&lt;/math&gt;
| v3 = 0
| None
| align="center" | A
|}

When we write out the FRACTRAN instructions, we must put the state A instructions last, because state A has no state indicators - it is the default state if no state indicators are set. So as a FRACTRAN program, the multiplier becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{455}{33}, \frac{11}{13}, \frac{1}{11}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{11}{2}, \frac{1}{3} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

With input 2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; this program produces output 5&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;ref group=note&gt;A similar multiplier algorithm is described at the [http://www.esolangs.org/wiki/Fractran Esolang FRACTRAN page].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FRACTRANmult0.gif|thumb|544px|center|The above FRACTRAN program, computing 3 times 2 (so that its input is &lt;math&gt;2^3\times 3^2=72&lt;/math&gt; and its output should be &lt;math&gt;5^6&lt;/math&gt; because 3 times 2 happens to be 6, at least in a FRACTRAN world...]]

=== Subtraction and division ===
In a similar way, we can create a FRACTRAN "subtracter", and repeated subtractions allow us to create a "quotient and remainder" algorithm as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FRACTRAN&lt;br&gt;Instruction
! Current State
! State&lt;br&gt;Indicators
! Condition
! Action
! Next State
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{7 \cdot 13}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 11}, \frac{11}{13}&lt;/math&gt;
| rowspan="3" align="center" | A
| rowspan="3" | v11, v13
| v2 &gt; 0 and&lt;br&gt;v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v2&lt;br&gt;Subtract 1 from v3&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v7
| align="center" | A
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3 \cdot 11}&lt;/math&gt;
| v2 = 0 and&lt;br&gt;v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v3
| align="center" | X
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{5 \cdot 17}{11}&lt;/math&gt;
| v3 = 0
| Add 1 to v5
| align="center" | B
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 \cdot 19}{7 \cdot 17}, \frac{17}{19}&lt;/math&gt;
| rowspan="2" align="center" | B
| rowspan="2" | v17, v19
| v7 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v7&lt;br&gt;Add 1 to v3
| align="center" | B
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{17}&lt;/math&gt;
| v7 = 0
| None
| align="center" | A
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| rowspan="2" align="center" | X
| rowspan="2" |
| v3 &gt; 0
| Subtract 1 from v3
| align="center" | X
|-
|
| v3 = 0
| Stop
|
|}

Writing out the FRACTRAN program, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{91}{66}, \frac{11}{13}, \frac{1}{33}, \frac{85}{11}, \frac{57}{119}, \frac{17}{19}, \frac{11}{17}, \frac{1}{3} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and input 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;11 produces output 5&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;7&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''n'' = ''qd'' + ''r'' and 0 ≤ ''r''  &lt; ''d''.

== Conway's prime algorithm ==
Conway's prime generating algorithm above is essentially a quotient and remainder algorithm within two loops. Given input of the form &lt;math&gt;2^n 7^m&lt;/math&gt; where 0 ≤ ''m''  &lt; ''n'', the algorithm tries to divide ''n''+1 by each number from ''n'' down to 1, until it finds the largest number ''k'' that is a divisor of ''n''+1. It then returns 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; 7&lt;sup&gt;''k''-1&lt;/sup&gt; and repeats. The only times that the sequence of state numbers generated by the algorithm produces a power of 2 is when ''k'' is 1 (so that the exponent of 7 is 0), which only occurs if the exponent of 2 is a prime. A step-by-step explanation of Conway's algorithm can be found in Havil(2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19461">In [[quantum information theory]], '''fidelity''' is a measure of the "closeness" of two quantum states. It expresses the probability that one state will pass a test to identify as the other. The fidelity is not a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the space of [[Mixed state (physics)|density matrices]], but it can be used to define the [[Bures metric]] on this space.

Given two states &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the fidelity is generally defined as the quantity &lt;math&gt;F(\rho, \sigma) = \left[\operatorname{Tr} \sqrt{\sqrt\rho \sigma\sqrt\rho}\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;. In the special case of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; pure states, the definition reduces to the squared overlap between the states: &lt;math&gt;F(\rho, \sigma)=|\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle|^2&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\rho=|\psi_\rho\rangle\!\langle\psi_\rho|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma=|\psi_\sigma\rangle\!\langle\psi_\sigma|&lt;/math&gt;. While not obvious from the general definition, the fidelity is symmetric: &lt;math&gt;F(\rho,\sigma)=F(\sigma,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Motivation ==

Given two [[Random variable|random variables]] ''X'', ''Y'' with values (1, ..., n) ([[Categorical variable|categorical random variables]]) and probabilities  ''p'' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ''q'' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''). The fidelity of ''X'' and ''Y'' is defined to be the quantity

:&lt;math&gt;F(X,Y) = \left(\sum _i \sqrt{p_i q_i}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The fidelity deals with the [[marginal distribution]] of the random variables.  It says nothing about the [[joint distribution]] of those variables.  In other words, the fidelity ''F(X,Y)'' is the square of the [[inner product]] of &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{p_1}, \cdots ,\sqrt{p_n})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{q_1}, \cdots ,\sqrt{q_n})&lt;/math&gt; viewed as vectors in [[Euclidean space]]. Notice that ''F(X,Y)'' = 1 if and only if ''p'' = ''q''. In general, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq F(X,Y) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;\sum _i \sqrt{p_i q_i}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Bhattacharyya coefficient]].

Given a [[Classical physics|classical]] measure of the distinguishability of two [[Probability distribution|probability distributions]], one can motivate a measure of distinguishability of two quantum states as follows.  If an experimenter is attempting to determine whether a [[quantum state]] is either of two possibilities &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the most general possible measurement they can make on the state is a [[POVM]], which is described by a set of [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]] [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semidefinite]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]] &lt;math&gt;\{F_i\} &lt;/math&gt;.  If the state given to the experimenter is &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, they will witness outcome &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i = \mathrm{Tr}[ \rho F_i ]&lt;/math&gt;, and likewise with probability &lt;math&gt;q_i = \mathrm{Tr}[ \sigma F_i ]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.  Their ability to distinguish between the quantum states &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is then equivalent to their ability to distinguish between the classical probability distributions &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.  Naturally, the experimenter will choose the best POVM he can find, so this motivates defining the quantum fidelity as the squared [[Bhattacharyya coefficient]] when extremized over all possible POVMs &lt;math&gt;\{F_i\} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\rho,\sigma) = \min_{\{F_i\}} F(X,Y) = \min_{\{F_i\}} \left(\sum _i \sqrt{\mathrm{Tr}[ \rho F_i ] \mathrm{Tr}[ \sigma F_i ]}\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It was shown by Fuchs and Caves that this manifestly symmetric definition is equivalent to the simple asymmetric formula given in the next section.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Fuchs, C. M. Caves: [http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v73/i23/p3047_1 "Ensemble-Dependent Bounds for Accessible Information in Quantum Mechanics"], ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' 73, 3047(1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Given two density matrices ''ρ'' and ''σ'', the '''fidelity''' is defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fidelity for Mixed Quantum States |first=Richard |last= Jozsa |journal=Journal of Modern Optics |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=2315–2323 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/09500349414552171|bibcode=1994JMOp...41.2315J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F(\rho, \sigma) = \left(\operatorname{Tr} \sqrt{\sqrt{\rho} \sigma \sqrt{\rho}}\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where, for a positive semidefinite matrix &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{M}&lt;/math&gt;  denotes its unique [[Matrix square root|positive square root]], as given by the [[spectral theorem]]. The Euclidean inner product from the classical definition is replaced by the [[Hilbert–Schmidt operator|Hilbert–Schmidt]] [[inner product]].

Some of the important properties of the quantum state fidelity are:

* '''Symmetry'''. &lt;math&gt;F(\rho,\sigma)=F(\sigma,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Bounded values'''. For any &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0\le F(\rho,\sigma) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F(\rho,\rho)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Consistency with fidelity between probability distributions'''. If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; [[Commutator|commute]], the definition simplifies to &lt;math display="block"&gt;F(\rho,\sigma) =
\left[\operatorname{Tr}(\sqrt{\rho\sigma})\right]^2 =
\left(\sum_k \sqrt{p_k q_k} \right)^2 =
F(\boldsymbol p, \boldsymbol q),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;p_k, q_k&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\rho,\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. To see this, remember that if &lt;math&gt;[\rho,\sigma]=0&lt;/math&gt; then they can be [[Simultaneously diagonalizable|diagonalized in the same basis]]: &lt;math display="block"&gt; \rho = \sum_i p_i | i \rangle \langle i |
\text{ and }
\sigma = \sum_i q_i | i \rangle \langle i |,&lt;/math&gt;so that &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}(\sqrt{\rho\sigma}) =
\operatorname{Tr}\left(\sum_k \sqrt{p_k q_k} |i\rangle\!\langle i|\right) =
\sum_k \sqrt{p_k q_k}.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Simplified expressions for pure states'''. If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[Purity (quantum mechanics)|pure]], &lt;math&gt;\rho=|\psi_\rho\rangle\!\langle\psi_\rho|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;F(\rho,\sigma) = \langle\psi_\rho|\sigma|\psi_\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This follows from &lt;math display="block"&gt;
F(\rho, \sigma) = \operatorname{Tr} \left[\sqrt{ | \psi_\rho \rangle \langle \psi_\rho |  \sigma | \psi_\rho \rangle \langle \psi_\rho |} \right]^2
= \langle \psi_\rho | \sigma | \psi_\rho \rangle \operatorname{Tr} \left[\sqrt{ | \psi_\rho \rangle \langle \psi_\rho |} \right]^2
= \langle \psi_\rho | \sigma | \psi_\rho \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;If both &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are pure, &lt;math&gt;\rho=|\psi_\rho\rangle\!\langle\psi_\rho|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma=|\psi_\sigma\rangle\!\langle\psi_\sigma|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;F(\rho, \sigma) = |\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle|^2&lt;/math&gt;. This follows immediately from the above expression for &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; pure.
* '''Equivalent expression'''. An equivalent expression for the fidelity is &lt;math display="block"&gt;F(\rho, \sigma) = 
\lVert \sqrt{\rho}  \sqrt{\sigma} \rVert_\mathrm{tr}^2 =
\Big(\operatorname{Tr}|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|\Big)^2,&lt;/math&gt;where the [[absolute value]] of an operator is here defined as &lt;math&gt;|A|\equiv \sqrt{A^\dagger A}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Explicit expression for qubits'''. If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are both [[qubit]] states, the fidelity can be computed as &lt;math display="block"&gt;F(\rho, \sigma) = \mathrm{tr}(\rho\sigma)+2\sqrt{\det(\rho)\det(\sigma)}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alternative definition ===
Some authors use an alternative definition &lt;math&gt;F':=\sqrt{F}&lt;/math&gt; and call this quantity fidelity.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Chuang"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|first1=Michael A.|last1=Nielsen|first2=Isaac L.|last2=Chuang|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521635035|url=http://www.michaelnielsen.org/qcqi/|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511976667}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; however is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bengtsson | first=Ingemar | title=Geometry of Quantum States: An Introduction to Quantum Entanglement | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom New York, NY | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-107-02625-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Walls | first1=D. F. | last2=Milburn | first2=G. J. | title=Quantum Optics | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | year=2008 | isbn=978-3-540-28573-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jaeger | first=Gregg | title=Quantum Information: An Overview | publisher=Springer | location=New York London | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-387-35725-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid confusion, &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt; could be called “square root fidelity”. In any case it is advisable to clarify the adopted definition whenever the fidelity is employed.

== Other properties ==

=== Unitary invariance ===

Direct calculation shows that the fidelity is preserved by [[Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)|unitary evolution]], i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\; F(\rho, \sigma) = F(U \rho \; U^*, U \sigma U^*) &lt;/math&gt;

for any [[unitary operator]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Uhlmann's theorem ===

We saw that for two pure states, their fidelity coincides with the overlap. Uhlmann's theorem&lt;ref name="Uhlmann1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhlmann |first1=A. |title=The "transition probability" in the state space of a ∗-algebra |journal=Reports on Mathematical Physics |volume=9 |issue=2 |year=1976 |pages=273–279 |issn=0034-4877 |doi=10.1016/0034-4877(76)90060-4 |url=http://www.physik.uni-leipzig.de/~uhlmann/PDF/Uh76a.pdf|bibcode=1976RpMP....9..273U }}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes this statement to mixed states, in terms of their purifications:

'''Theorem''' Let ρ and σ be density matrices acting on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Let ρ&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; be the unique positive square root of ρ and

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
| \psi _{\rho} \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n (\rho^{{1}/{2}} | e_i \rangle) \otimes | e_i \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n 
&lt;/math&gt;

be a [[purification of quantum state|purification]] of ρ (therefore &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{|e_i\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; is an orthonormal basis), then the following equality holds:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\rho, \sigma) = \max_{|\psi_{\sigma} \rangle} | \langle \psi _{\rho}| \psi _{\sigma} \rangle |^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;| \psi _{\sigma} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a purification of σ. Therefore, in general, the fidelity is the maximum overlap between purifications.

====Sketch of proof====
A simple proof can be sketched as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\Omega\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the vector

:&lt;math&gt;| \Omega \rangle= \sum_{i=1}^n | e_i \rangle \otimes | e_i \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

and σ&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; be the unique positive square root of σ. We see that, due to the unitary freedom in [[Matrix factorization|square root factorizations]] and choosing [[Orthonormal basis|orthonormal bases]], an arbitrary purification of σ is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;| \psi_{\sigma} \rangle = ( \sigma^{{1}/{2}} V_1 \otimes V_2 ) | \Omega \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s are [[Unitary operator|unitary operators]]. Now we directly calculate

:&lt;math&gt;
| \langle \psi _{\rho}| \psi _{\sigma} \rangle |^2
= | \langle \Omega | ( \rho^{{1}/{2}} \otimes I) ( \sigma^{{1}/{2}} V_1 \otimes V_2 ) | \Omega \rangle |^2
= | \operatorname{Tr} ( \rho^{{1}/{2}} \sigma^{{1}/{2}} V_1 V_2^T )|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

But in general, for any square matrix ''A'' and unitary ''U'', it is true that |Tr(''AU'')| &amp;le; Tr ((''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;frac12;&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, equality is achieved if ''U''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the unitary operator in the [[polar decomposition]] of ''A''. From this follows directly Uhlmann's theorem.

==== Proof with explicit decompositions ====
We will here provide an alternative, explicit way to prove Uhlmann's theorem.

Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi_\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\psi_\sigma\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be purifications of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. To start, let us show that &lt;math&gt;|\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle|\le\operatorname{Tr}|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|&lt;/math&gt;.

The general form of the purifications of the states is:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
  |\psi_\rho\rangle   &amp;=\sum_k\sqrt{\lambda_k}|\lambda_k\rangle\otimes|u_k\rangle, \\
  |\psi_\sigma\rangle &amp;=\sum_k\sqrt{\mu_k}|\mu_k\rangle\otimes|v_k\rangle,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;were &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_k\rangle, |\mu_k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho,\ \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{u_k\}_k, \{v_k\}_k&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary orthonormal bases. The overlap between the purifications is&lt;math display="block"&gt;\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle =
\sum_{jk}\sqrt{\lambda_j\mu_k} \langle\lambda_j|\mu_k\rangle\,\langle u_j|v_k\rangle =
\operatorname{Tr}\left(\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma U\right),&lt;/math&gt;where the unitary matrix &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;math display="block"&gt;U=\left(\sum_k |\mu_k\rangle\!\langle u_k| \right)\,\left(\sum_j |v_j\rangle\!\langle \lambda_j|\right).&lt;/math&gt;The conclusion is now reached via using the inequality &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{Tr}(AU)|\le \operatorname{Tr}(\sqrt{A^\dagger A})\equiv\operatorname{Tr}|A|&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math display="block"&gt;|\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle|=
|\operatorname{Tr}(\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma U)| \le
\operatorname{Tr}|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|.&lt;/math&gt;Note that this inequality is the [[triangle inequality]] applied to the singular values of the matrix. Indeed, for a generic matrix &lt;math&gt;A\equiv \sum_j s_j(A)|a_j\rangle\!\langle b_j|&lt;/math&gt;and unitary &lt;math&gt;U=\sum_j |b_j\rangle\!\langle w_j|&lt;/math&gt;, we have&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
|\operatorname{Tr}(AU)| &amp;=
\left|\operatorname{Tr}\left(\sum_j s_j(A)|a_j\rangle\!\langle b_j| \,\,\sum_k |b_k\rangle\!\langle w_k| \right)\right| \\ &amp;= 
\left|\sum_j s_j(A)\langle 
w_j|a_j\rangle\right|\\ &amp;\le
\sum_j s_j(A) \,|\langle  w_j|a_j\rangle| \\
&amp;\le
\sum_j s_j(A) \\
&amp;= \operatorname{Tr}|A|,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;s_j(A)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; are the (always real and non-negative) [[singular values]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, as in the [[singular value decomposition]]. The inequality is saturated and becomes an equality when &lt;math&gt;\langle w_j|a_j\rangle=1&lt;/math&gt;, that is, when &lt;math&gt;U=\sum_k |b_k\rangle\!\langle a_k|,&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;AU=\sqrt{AA^\dagger}\equiv |A|&lt;/math&gt;. The above shows that &lt;math&gt;|\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle|=
\operatorname{Tr}|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|&lt;/math&gt; when the purifications &lt;math&gt;|\psi_\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\psi_\sigma\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are such that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma U=|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|&lt;/math&gt;. Because this choice is possible regardless of the states, we can finally conclude that&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{Tr}|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|=\max|\langle\psi_\rho|\psi_\sigma\rangle|.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Consequences ====
Some immediate consequences of Uhlmann's theorem are
* Fidelity is symmetric in its arguments, i.e. ''F'' (ρ,σ) = ''F'' (σ,ρ). Note that this is not obvious from the original definition.
* ''F'' (ρ,σ) lies in [0,1], by the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]].
* ''F'' (ρ,σ) = 1 if and only if ρ = σ, since Ψ&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; implies ρ = σ.

So we can see that fidelity behaves almost like a metric. This can be formalized and made useful by defining
:&lt;math&gt; \cos^2 \theta_{\rho\sigma} = F(\rho,\sigma) \,&lt;/math&gt;

As the [[angle]] between the states &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the above properties that &lt;math&gt;\theta_{\rho\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative, symmetric in its inputs, and is equal to zero if and only if &lt;math&gt;\rho = \sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, it can be proved that it obeys the triangle inequality,&lt;ref name="Nielsen Chuang" /&gt; so this angle is a metric on the state space: the [[Fubini–Study metric]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Życzkowski, I. Bengtsson, ''Geometry of Quantum States'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with the fidelity between the corresponding probability distributions ===
Let &lt;math&gt;\{E_k\}_k&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary [[POVM|positive operator-valued measure]] (POVM); that is, a set of operators &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\sum_k E_k=I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_j E_k = \delta_{jk} E_j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E_k^2 = E_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for any pair of states &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, we have
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
  \sqrt{F(\rho,\sigma)} \le \sum_k \sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(E_k\rho)}\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(E_k\sigma)} \equiv \sum_k \sqrt{p_k q_k},
&lt;/math&gt;
where in the last step we denoted with &lt;math&gt;p_k, q_k&lt;/math&gt; the probability distributions obtained by measuring &lt;math&gt;\rho,\ \sigma&lt;/math&gt; with the POVM &lt;math&gt;\{E_k\}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

This shows that the square root of the fidelity between two quantum states is upper bounded by the [[Bhattacharyya coefficient]] between the corresponding probability distributions in any possible POVM. Indeed, it is more generally true that &lt;math display="block"&gt;F(\rho,\sigma)=\min_{\{E_k\}} F(\boldsymbol p,\boldsymbol q),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;F(\boldsymbol p, \boldsymbol q)\equiv\left(\sum_k\sqrt{p_k q_k}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the minimum is taken over all possible POVMs.

==== Proof of inequality ====
As was previously shown, the square root of the fidelity can be written as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{F(\rho,\sigma)}=\operatorname{tr}|\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma|,&lt;/math&gt;which is equivalent to the existence of a unitary operator &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sqrt{F(\rho,\sigma)}=\operatorname{tr}(\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma U).&lt;/math&gt;Remembering that &lt;math&gt;\sum_k E_k=I&lt;/math&gt; holds true for any POVM, we can then write&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sqrt{F(\rho,\sigma)}=\operatorname{tr}(\sqrt\rho\sqrt\sigma U)=
\sum_k\operatorname{tr}(\sqrt\rho E_k E_k\sqrt\sigma U) \le
\sum_k\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(E_k\rho)\operatorname{tr}(E_k \sigma)},&lt;/math&gt;where in the last step we used Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as in &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{tr}(A^\dagger B)|^2\le\operatorname{tr}(A^\dagger A)\operatorname{tr}(B^\dagger B)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Behavior under quantum operations ===
The fidelity between two states can be shown to never decrease when a non-selective [[quantum operation]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=M. A.|date=1996-06-13|title=The entanglement fidelity and quantum error correction|arxiv=quant-ph/9606012|bibcode=1996quant.ph..6012N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;F(\mathcal E(\rho),\mathcal E(\sigma)) \ge
F(\rho,\sigma),&lt;/math&gt; for any trace-preserving [[completely positive map]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Relationship to trace distance ===
We can define the [[trace distance]] between two matrices A and B in terms of the [[matrix norm|trace norm]] by

:&lt;math&gt;
D(A,B) = \frac{1}{2}\| A-B\|_{\rm tr} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

When A and B are both density operators, this is a quantum generalization of the [[statistical distance]].  This is relevant because the trace distance provides upper and lower bounds on the fidelity as quantified by the ''Fuchs–van de Graaf inequalities'',&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Fuchs and J. van de Graaf, "Cryptographic Distinguishability Measures for Quantum Mechanical States", ''IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory'' 45, 1216 (1999).  arXiv:quant-ph/9712042&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
1-\sqrt{F(\rho,\sigma)} \le D(\rho,\sigma) \le\sqrt{1-F(\rho,\sigma)} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Often the trace distance is easier to calculate or bound than the fidelity, so these relationships are quite useful.  In the case that at least one of the states is a [[pure state]] Ψ, the lower bound can be tightened.

:&lt;math&gt;
1-F(\psi,\rho) \le D(\psi,\rho) \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13183">In [[mathematics]], a '''filtration''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;  is an [[indexed set]] &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; of [[subobject|subobjects]] of a given [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, with the index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; running over some [[index set]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that is a [[totally ordered set]], subject to the condition that

::if &lt;math&gt;i\leq j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S_i\subset S_j&lt;/math&gt;.

If the index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the time parameter of some stochastic process, then the filtration can be interpreted as representing all historical but not future information available about the stochastic process, with the algebraic object &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; gaining in complexity with time. Hence, a process that is [[adapted process|adapted]] to a filtration &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, is also called '''non-anticipating''', i.e. one that cannot '''see into the future'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Björk|first=Thomas|year=2005|title=Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time|isbn=978-0-19-927126-9|section=Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, as in a [[filtered algebra]], there is instead the requirement that the &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; be [[Subalgebra#Subalgebras in universal algebra|subalgebras]] with respect to some operations (say, vector addition), but not with respect to other operations (say, multiplication), that satisfy &lt;math&gt;S_i \cdot S_j \subset S_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt;, where the index set is the natural numbers; this is by analogy with a [[graded algebra]].

Sometimes, filtrations are supposed to satisfy the additional requirement that the union of the &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; be the whole &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, or (in more general cases, when the notion of union does not make sense) that the canonical homomorphism from the direct limit of the &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism. Whether this requirement is assumed or not usually depends on the author of the text and is often explicitly stated. This article does ''not'' impose this requirement.

There is also the notion of a '''descending filtration''', which is required to satisfy &lt;math&gt;S_i \supseteq S_j&lt;/math&gt; in lieu of &lt;math&gt;S_i \subseteq S_j&lt;/math&gt; (and, occasionally, &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in I} S_i=0&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} S_i=S&lt;/math&gt;). Again, it depends on the context how exactly the word "filtration" is to be understood. Descending filtrations are not to be confused with cofiltrations (which consist of [[quotient object|quotient objects]] rather than subobjects).

The concept [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to a filtration is called a ''cofiltration''.

Filtrations are widely used in [[abstract algebra]], [[homological algebra]] (where they are related in an important way to [[spectral sequence]]s), and in [[measure theory]] and [[probability theory]] for nested sequences of [[sigma algebra|σ-algebras]]. In [[functional analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]], other terminology is usually used, such as [[scale of spaces]] or [[nested spaces]].

==Examples==

===Algebra===
{{See also|Filtered algebra}}

====Groups====
{{See also|Length function}}

In algebra, filtrations are ordinarily indexed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of natural numbers. A ''filtration'' of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, is then a nested sequence &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt; of [[normal subgroup]]s of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (that is, for any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;G_{n+1}\subset G_n&lt;/math&gt;). Note that this use of the word "filtration" corresponds to our "descending filtration".

Given a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a filtration &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural way to define a topology on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, said to be ''associated'' to the filtration. A basis for this topology is the set of all translates of subgroups appearing in the filtration, that is, a subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be open if it is a union of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;aG_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number.

The topology associated to a filtration on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; makes &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into a [[topological group]].

The topology associated to a filtration &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt; on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;\bigcap G_n=\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If two filtrations &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G'_n&lt;/math&gt; are defined on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then the identity map from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where the first copy of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given the &lt;math&gt;G_n&lt;/math&gt;-topology and the second the &lt;math&gt;G'_n&lt;/math&gt;-topology, is continuous if and only if for any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there is an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G_m\subset G'_n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if and only if the identity map is continuous at 1. In particular, the two filtrations define the same topology if and only if for any subgroup appearing in one there is a smaller or equal one appearing in the other.

====Rings and modules: descending filtrations====

Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, a ''descending filtration'' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a decreasing sequence of submodules &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is therefore a special case of the notion for groups, with the additional condition that the subgroups be submodules. The associated topology is defined as for groups.

An important special case is known as the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology (or &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;-adic, etc.). Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a commutative ring, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; an ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Given an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence &lt;math&gt;I^n M&lt;/math&gt; of submodules of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; forms a filtration of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The ''&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology'' on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is then the topology associated to this filtration. If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is just the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; itself, we have defined the ''&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology'' on &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is given the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[topological ring]]. If an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is then given the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology, it becomes a [[topological module|topological &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module]], relative to the topology given on &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

====Rings and modules: ascending filtrations====

Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, an ''ascending filtration'' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an increasing sequence of submodules &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field, then an ascending filtration of the &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-vector space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an increasing sequence of vector subspaces of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. [[Flag (linear algebra)|Flags]] are one important class of such filtrations.

====Sets====
A maximal filtration of a set is equivalent to an ordering (a [[permutation]]) of the set. For instance, the filtration &lt;math&gt;\{0\} \subset \{0,1\} \subset \{0,1,2\}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the ordering &lt;math&gt;(0,1,2)&lt;/math&gt;. From the point of view of the [[field with one element]], an ordering on a set corresponds to a maximal [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]] (a filtration on a vector space), considering a set to be a vector space over the field with one element.

===Measure theory===
{{main article|Filtration (probability theory)}}
In [[measure theory]], in particular in [[martingale theory]] and the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a filtration is an increasing [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] of [[sigma algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras]] on a [[measurable space]]. That is, given a measurable space &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;, a filtration is a sequence of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathcal{F}_{t} \}_{t \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{t} \subseteq \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative real number and

:&lt;math&gt;t_{1} \leq t_{2} \implies \mathcal{F}_{t_{1}} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{t_{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact range of the "times" ''&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;'' will usually depend on context: the set of values for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; might be [[discrete set|discrete]] or continuous, [[bounded set|bounded]] or unbounded. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;t \in \{ 0, 1, \dots, N \}, \mathbb{N}_{0}, [0, T] \mbox{ or } [0, + \infty).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a '''filtered probability space''' (also known as a '''stochastic basis''') &lt;math&gt;\left(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \left\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\right\}_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[probability space]] equipped with the filtration &lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{F}_t\right\}_{t\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; of its &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. A filtered probability space is said to satisfy the ''usual conditions'' if it is [[complete measure|complete]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_0&lt;/math&gt; contains all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;-[[null set]]s) and [[right-continuous]] (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_t = \mathcal{F}_{t+} := \bigcap_{s &gt; t} \mathcal{F}_s&lt;/math&gt; for all times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stochastic Processes: A very simple introduction|author=Péter Medvegyev|date=January 2009|url=http://medvegyev.uni-corvinus.hu/St1.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Probabilities and Potential|author=Claude Dellacherie|publisher=Elsevier|year=1979|isbn=9780720407013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filtrations and Adapted Processes|author=George Lowther|url=http://almostsure.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/filtrations-and-adapted-processes/|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also useful (in the case of an unbounded index set) to define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra generated by the infinite union of the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{t}&lt;/math&gt;'s, which is contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\infty} = \sigma\left(\bigcup_{t \geq 0} \mathcal{F}_{t}\right) \subseteq \mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt;

A ''σ''-algebra defines the set of events that can be measured, which in a [[probability]] context is equivalent to events that can be discriminated, or "questions that can be answered at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;". Therefore, a filtration is often used to represent the change in the set of events that can be measured, through gain or loss of [[information]]. A typical example is in [[mathematical finance]], where a filtration represents the information available up to and including each time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and is more and more precise (the set of measurable events is staying the same or increasing) as more information from the evolution of the stock price becomes available.

====Relation to stopping times: stopping time sigma-algebras====
{{main article|Σ-Algebra of τ-past}}
Let &lt;math&gt;\left(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \left\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\right\}_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be a filtered probability space. A random variable &lt;math&gt;\tau : \Omega \rightarrow [0, \infty]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[stopping time]] with respect to the [[#Measure theory|filtration]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\right\}_{t\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\{\tau \leq t\} \in \mathcal{F}_t&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. 
The ''stopping time'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is now defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau} := \left\{A\in\mathcal{F}:A\cap\{\tau \leq t\}\in\mathcal{F}_t, \ \forall t\geq 0\right\} &lt;/math&gt;.

It is not difficult to show that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a [[sigma-algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]].
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; encodes information up to the ''random'' time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that, if the filtered probability space is interpreted as a random experiment, the maximum information that can be found out about it from arbitrarily often repeating the experiment until the random time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2013)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Tom|title=On simple representations of stopping times and stopping time sigma-algebras|journal=Statistics and Probability Letters|year=2013|volume=83|issue=1|pages=345–349|doi=10.1016/j.spl.2012.09.024|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spl.2012.09.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, if the underlying probability space is finite (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is finite), the minimal sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; (with respect to set inclusion) are given by the union over all &lt;math&gt;t\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; of the sets of minimal sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{t}&lt;/math&gt; that lie in &lt;math&gt;\{\tau = t\} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2013)"/&gt;

It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;-measurable. However, simple examples&lt;ref name="Fischer (2013)"/&gt; show that, in general, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\tau) \neq \mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\tau_ 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_ 2&lt;/math&gt; are [[stopping time]]s on &lt;math&gt;\left(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \left\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\right\}_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_1 \leq \tau_2&lt;/math&gt; [[almost surely]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau_1} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{\tau_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1656">In mathematics, a [[family of sets|family]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] is of '''finite character''' provided it has the following properties:
#For each &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, every [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.
#If every finite subset of a given set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
A family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of sets of finite character enjoys the following properties:

#For each &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, every (finite or infinite) [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[Tukey's lemma]]: In &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, [[partial order|partially ordered]] by inclusion, the [[Union_(set_theory)|union]] of every [[Total_order#Chains|chain]] of elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; also belong to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore, by [[Zorn_Lemma|Zorn's lemma]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one maximal element.

==Example==
Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]], and let ''F'' be the family of [[linearly independent]] subsets of ''V''.   Then ''F'' is a family of finite character (because a subset ''X'' &amp;sube; ''V'' is linearly dependent iff ''X'' has a finite subset which is linearly dependent). 
Therefore, in every [[vector space]], there exists a maximal family of linearly independent elements. As a maximal family is a [[vector basis]], every vector space has a (possibly infinite) vector basis.

'''GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library''' ('''GMP''') is a [[free software|free]] library for [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], operating on signed [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, and [[floating point]] numbers.&lt;ref name=what&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://gmplib.org/#WHAT
| title=What is GMP?
| accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no practical limits to the precision except the ones implied by the available [[virtual memory|memory]] in the machine GMP runs on (operand dimension limit is 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;-1 bits on 32-bit machines and 2&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; bits on 64-bit machines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| date=2009-07-06
| accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface. The basic interface is for [[C (programming language)|C]] but wrappers exist for other languages including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[.NET]], [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and the [[Wolfram Language]]. In the past, [[Kaffe]], a [[Java virtual machine]], used GMP to support Java built-in arbitrary precision arithmetic. This feature has been removed from recent releases, causing protests from people who claim that they used Kaffe solely for the speed benefits afforded by GMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.kaffe.org/pipermail/kaffe/2008-February/191039.html
| title=Removed GMP math?

| first=Andrew John
| date=2008-02-28
| accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, GMP support has been added to [[GNU Classpath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/announce/20090205.html

The main target applications of GMP are [[cryptography]] applications and research, Internet security applications, and [[computer algebra system]]s.

GMP aims to be faster than any other [[bignum]] library for all operand sizes. Some important factors in doing this are:
* Using full [[word (data type)|words]] as the basic arithmetic type.
* Using different [[algorithm]]s for different [[operand]] sizes; algorithms that are faster for very big numbers are usually slower for small numbers.
* Highly [[optimization (computer science)|optimized]] [[assembly language]] code for the most important [[inner loop]]s, specialized for different [[central processing unit|processors]].

The first GMP release was made in 1991. It is constantly developed and maintained.&lt;ref name=main&gt;{{cite web
 | url=https://gmplib.org/
 | title=GNU MP Bignum Library
 | accessdate=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMP is part of the [[GNU]] project (although its website being off gnu.org may cause confusion), and is distributed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL).

GMP is used for integer arithmetic in many [[computer algebra system]]s such as [[Mathematica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Conferences/7518/Macalester_talk.txt
| title=The Mathematica Kernel: Issues in the Design and Implementation
| date=October 2006
| accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maple (software)|Maple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/AddOns/view.aspx?path=GMP
| title= The GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) Library
| publisher=[[Maplesoft]]
| accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in the [[Computational Geometry Algorithms Library]] (CGAL) because geometry algorithms tend to 'explode' when using ordinary floating point CPU math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.cgal.org/Manual/
| title=CGAL Manuals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMP is needed to build the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC).&lt;ref&gt;GCC uses the [[MPFR]] library, which in turn relies on GMP. {{cite web

== Examples ==

Here is an example of C code showing the use of the GMP library to multiply and print large numbers:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;gmp.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 mpz_t x,y,result;

 mpz_init_set_str(x, "7612058254738945", 10);
 mpz_init_set_str(y, "9263591128439081", 10);
 mpz_init(result);

 mpz_mul(result, x, y);
 gmp_printf("    %Zd\n"
            "*\n"
            "    %Zd\n"
            "--------------------\n"
            "%Zd\n", x, y, result);

 /* free used memory */
 mpz_clear(x);
 mpz_clear(y);
 mpz_clear(result);

 return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code calculates the value of 7612058254738945 × 9263591128439081.

Compiling and running this program gives this result. (The -lgmp flag is used if compiling on Unix-type systems.)

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
    7612058254738945
*
    9263591128439081
--------------------
70514995317761165008628990709545
&lt;/source&gt;

For comparison, one can write instead the following equivalent C++ program. (The -lgmpxx -lgmp flags are used if compiling on Unix-type systems.)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;gmpxx.h&gt;

int main() {
  mpz_class x("7612058254738945");
  mpz_class y("9263591128439081");

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "    " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "\n"
            &lt;&lt; "*\n"
            &lt;&lt; "    " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; "\n"
            &lt;&lt; "--------------------\n"
            &lt;&lt; x * y &lt;&lt; "\n";

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Gerald James Toomer''' (born 23 November 1934) is a [[historian]] of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] who has written numerous books and papers on ancient Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy.  In particular, he translated [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' into English.

Formerly a fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford |Corpus Christi College]], [[Cambridge University]], he moved to [[Brown University]] as a [[Matriculation#Special student|special student]] in 1959 to study "the history of mathematics in antiquity and the transmission of these systems through Arabic into medieval Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Mitchell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2335">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be '''hemicompact''' if it has a sequence of [[compact space|compact]] subsets such that every compact subset of the space lies inside some compact set in the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|2004|loc=Problem set in section 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, this forces the union of the sequence to be the whole space, because every point is compact and hence must lie in one of the compact sets.

==Examples==
* Every [[compact space]] is hemicompact.
* The [[real line]] is hemicompact.
* Every locally compact [[Lindelöf space]] is hemicompact.

==Properties==
Every hemicompact space is [[σ-compact space|σ-compact]] and if in addition it is [[first-countable space|first countable]] then it is [[locally compact space|locally compact]].

==Examples==
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a hemicompact space, then the space &lt;math&gt;C(X, M)&lt;/math&gt; of all continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f : X \to M&lt;/math&gt; to a [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;(M, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; with the [[compact-open topology]] is [[Metrization theorem|metrizable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990|loc=Example IV.2.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see this, take a sequence &lt;math&gt;K_1,K_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; of compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that every compact subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; lies inside some compact set in this sequence (the existence of such a sequence follows from the hemicompactness of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;). Define [[pseudometric space|psedometrics]]

:&lt;math&gt;d_n (f,g) = \sup_{x \in K_n} \left|(f(x) - g(x))\right|, \quad f,g \in C(X,M), n \in \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;d(f,g) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} \cdot \frac{d_n (f,g)}{1+d_n (f,g)}&lt;/math&gt;

defines a metric on &lt;math&gt;C(X,M)&lt;/math&gt; which induces the compact-open topology.

Numeral systems have progressed from the use of [[tally mark]]s, more than 40,000 years ago, through to the use of sets of [[glyphs]] to efficiently represent any conceivable number.

==Pre-history==
{{main|Prehistoric numerals|Tally stick}}
The first method of counting has been argued to be counting on fingers.&lt;ref&gt;The Earliest Calculating – The Hand, Ifrah (2000), pages 47–61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source |date=August 2016}} This evolved into sign language for the hand-to-eye-to-elbow communication of numbers which, while not writing, gave way to written numbers.

[[Tally marks|Tallies]] made by carving notches in wood, bone, and stone were used for at least forty thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Tally Sticks, Ifrah (2000), pages 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshack, A., ''The Roots of Civilisation; Cognitive Beginnings of Man’s First Art, Symbol and Notation'', (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London: 1972), 81ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.

[[Lebombo bone]] is a baboon [[fibula]] with incised markings discovered in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] located between South Africa and Swaziland. The bone is between 44,230 and 43,000 years old, according to two dozen radiocarbon datings. According to ''[[The Universal Book of Mathematics]]'' the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest "it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar." But the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches can only be a minimum number.  Furthermore, in the many more notched bones since found there is no consistent notch tally, many being in the 1–10 range.

[[Ishango bone]] is an artifact with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a [[tally stick]], as it has a series of what has been interpreted as [[tally marks]] carved in three columns running the length of the tool. But some scientists have suggested that the groupings of notches indicate a mathematical understanding that goes beyond counting. It has also been suggested that the scratches might have been to create a better grip on the handle or for some other non-mathematical reason. It is believed that the bone is more than 20,000 years old.&lt;ref name=Marshack&gt;Marshack, Alexander (1991): ''The Roots of Civilization'', Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks,  A.S. and Smith, C.C. (1987): "Ishango revisited: new age determinations and cultural interpretations", ''The African Archaeological Review'', 5 : 65–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clay token==
[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uruk period]]: globular envelope with a cluster of accountancy tokens, from Susa. [[Louvre Museum]]]]
The earliest known writing for record keeping evolved from a system of counting using small clay tokens. The earliest tokens now known are those from two sites in the Zagros region of Iran: [[Tepe Asiab]] and [[Ganj Dareh|Ganj-i-Dareh Tepe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.finaly.org/index.php/Two_precursors_of_writing:_plain_and_complex_tokens&lt;/ref&gt;

To create a record that represented "two sheep", they selected two round clay tokens each having a + sign baked into it.  Each token represented one sheep.  Representing a hundred sheep with a hundred tokens would be impractical, so they invented different clay tokens to represent different numbers of each specific commodity, and by 4000 BC strung the tokens like beads on a string.&lt;ref&gt;How Writing Came About, Strings of Tokens and Envelopes, Besserat (1996) pages 39–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a token for one sheep, a different token for ten sheep, a different token for ten goats, etc.  Thirty-two sheep would be represented by three ten-sheep tokens followed on the string by two one-sheep tokens.

To ensure that nobody could alter the number and type of tokens, they invented a clay envelope shaped like a hollow ball into which the tokens on a string were placed, sealed, and baked.  If anybody disputed the number, they could break open the clay envelope and do a recount.  To avoid unnecessary damage to the record, they pressed archaic number signs and witness seals on the outside of the envelope before it was baked, each sign similar in shape to the tokens they represented.  Since there was seldom any need to break open the envelope, the signs on the outside became the first written language for writing numbers in clay.  An alternative method was to seal the knot in each string of tokens with a solid oblong bulla of clay having impressed symbols, while the string of tokens dangled outside of the bulla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.finaly.org/index.php/Two_precursors_of_writing:_plain_and_complex_tokens String of tokens sealed with a bulla of clay]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning about 3500 BC the tokens and envelopes were replaced by numerals impressed with a round stylus at different angles in flat clay tablets which were then baked.&lt;ref&gt;Impressed Tablets, Besserat (1996) pages 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt; A sharp stylus was used to carve pictographs representing various tokens.  Each sign represented both the commodity being counted and the quantity or volume of that commodity.

Abstract numerals, dissociated from the thing being counted, were invented about 3100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Tokens, Their Role in Prehistory, Besserat (1996) pages 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; The things being counted were indicated by pictographs carved with a sharp stylus next to round-stylus numerals.

The [[Sumer]]ians had a complex assortment of incompatible number systems, and each city had its own local way of writing numerals.  For instance, at about 3100 BC in the city of [[Uruk]], there were more than a dozen different numeric systems.&lt;ref&gt;Archaic Numerical Sign Systems, Nissen (1993) pages 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In this city, there were separate number systems for counting discrete objects (such as animals, tools, and containers), cheese and grain products, volumes of grain (including fractions), beer ingredients, weights, land areas, and time and calendar units.  Furthermore, these systems changed over time; for instance, numbers for counting volumes of grain changed when the size of the baskets changed.

The Sumerians invented arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;The Development of Arithmetic, Nissen (1993) pages 125–127.&lt;/ref&gt; People who added and subtracted volumes of grain every day used their arithmetic skills to count other things that were unrelated to volume measurements. Multiplication and division were done with multiplication tables baked in clay tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Picture of a multiplication table, Nissen (1993) pages 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion of archaic numbers to cuneiform==
[[Image:CunEnv.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Middle Babylonian legal tablet from [[Alalakh|Alalah]] in its envelope]]
Between 2700 BC and 2000 BC, the round stylus was gradually replaced by a reed stylus that had been used to press wedge shaped cuneiform signs in clay.  To represent numbers that previously had been pressed with a round stylus, these cuneiform number signs were pressed in a circular pattern and they retained the additive [[sign-value notation]] that originated with tokens on a string.  Cuneiform numerals and archaic numerals were ambiguous because they represented various numeric systems that differed depending on what was being counted.  About 2100 BC in Sumer, these proto-sexagesimal sign-value systems gradually converged on a common sexagesimal number system that was a [[place-value]] system consisting of only two impressed marks, the vertical wedge and the chevron, which could also represent fractions.&lt;ref&gt;Sexagesimal Place Value System, Nissen (1993) pages 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[sexagesimal]] number system was fully developed at the beginning of the [[Old Babylonian period]] (about 1950 BC) and became standard in Babylonia.

Sexagesimal numerals were a [[mixed radix]] system that retained the alternating base 10 and base 6 in a sequence of cuneiform vertical wedges and chevrons.  Sexagesimal numerals became widely used in commerce, but were also used in astronomical and other calculations. This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every [[Mediterranean]] nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Syrians. In [[Arabic numerals]], we still use sexagesimal to count time (minutes per hour), and angles (degrees).

==Roman numerals==
[[Roman numerals]] evolved from this primitive system of cutting notches.&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of Roman Numerals, Ifrah (2000), pages 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt; It was once believed that they came from alphabetic symbols or from pictographs, but these theories have been disproved.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Keyser, "The origin of the Latin numerals 1 to 1000 , ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''92''' (1988), pp. 529–546.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Chrisomalis, Numerical Notation: A Comparative History (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spherical cone lines.png|right|frame|[[Stereographic projection]] of a spherical cone's generating lines (red), [[Parallel (geometry)|parallels]] (green) and hypermeridians (blue).
Due to  [[conformal map|conformal]] property of Stereographic Projection,
the curves intersect each other orthogonally (in the yellow points) as in 4D.
All curves are circles or straight lines. The generatrices and parallels generates
a 3D dual cone. The hypermeridians generates a set of concentric spheres. ]]

In [[geometry]], a '''hypercone''' (or '''spherical cone''') is the figure in the 4-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] represented by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - w^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is a [[quadric]] surface, and is one of the possible 3-[[manifold]]s which are 4-dimensional equivalents of the [[conical surface]] in 3 dimensions. It is also named '''spherical cone''' because its intersections with [[hyperplane]]s perpendicular to the ''w''-axis are [[sphere]]s. A four-dimensional '''right spherical hypercone''' can be thought of as a sphere which expands with time, starting its expansion from a single point source, such that the center of the expanding sphere remains fixed.  An '''oblique spherical hypercone''' would be a sphere which expands with time, again starting its expansion from a point source, but such that the center of the expanding sphere moves with a uniform velocity.

==Parametric form==
A right spherical hypercone can be described by the function
:&lt;math&gt; \vec \sigma (\phi, \theta, t) = (t s \cos \theta \cos \phi, t s \cos \theta \sin \phi, t s \sin \theta, t) &lt;/math&gt;
with vertex at the origin and expansion speed ''s''.

An oblique spherical hypercone could then be described by the function
:&lt;math&gt; \vec \sigma (\phi, \theta, t) = (v_x t + t s \cos \theta \cos \phi, v_y t + t s \cos \theta \sin \phi, v_z t + t s \sin \theta, t) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; (v_x, v_y, v_z) &lt;/math&gt; is the 3-velocity of the center of the expanding sphere.
An example of such a cone would be an expanding [[sound wave]] as seen from the point of view of a moving reference frame: e.g. the sound wave of a [[jet aircraft]] as seen from the jet's own reference frame.

Note that the 3D-surfaces above enclose [[Four-dimensional space|4D-hypervolumes]], which are the 4-cones proper.

==Geometrical interpretation==
The spherical cone consists of two unbounded ''nappes'', which meet at the origin and are the analogues of the nappes of the 3-dimensional conical surface. The ''upper nappe'' corresponds with the half with positive ''w''-coordinates, and the ''lower nappe'' corresponds with the half with negative ''w''-coordinates.

If it is restricted between the hyperplanes ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r'' for some nonzero ''r'', then it may be closed by a [[ball (mathematics)|3-ball]] of radius ''r'', centered at (0,0,0,''r''), so that it bounds a finite 4-dimensional volume. This volume is given by the formula {{sfrac|1|3}}{{pi}}''r''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and is the 4-dimensional equivalent of the [[cone (geometry)|solid cone]]. The ball may be thought of as the 'lid' at the base of the 4-dimensional cone's nappe, and the origin becomes its 'apex'.

This shape may be [[graphical projection|projected]] into 3-dimensional space in various ways. If projected onto the ''xyz'' [[hyperplane]], its image is a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]. If projected onto the ''xyw'', ''xzw'', or ''yzw'' hyperplanes, its image is a [[cone (geometry)|solid cone]]. If projected onto an oblique hyperplane, its image is either an [[ellipsoid]] or a solid cone with an ellipsoidal base (resembling an [[ice cream cone]]). These images are the analogues of the possible images of the solid cone projected to 2 dimensions.

===Construction===
The (half) hypercone may be constructed in a manner analogous to the construction of a 3D cone. A 3D cone may be thought of as the result of stacking progressively smaller discs on top of each other until they taper to a point. Alternatively, a 3D cone may be regarded as the volume swept out by an upright [[isosceles triangle]] as it rotates about its base.

A 4D hypercone may be constructed analogously: by stacking progressively smaller balls on top of each other in the 4th direction until they taper to a point, or taking the hypervolume swept out by a tetrahedron standing upright in the 4th direction as it rotates freely about its base in the 3D hyperplane on which it rests.

==Temporal interpretation==
{{main|Minkowski space}}
If the ''w''-coordinate of the equation of the spherical cone is interpreted as the distance ''ct'', where ''t'' is [[coordinate time]] and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] (a constant), then it is the shape of the [[light cone]] in [[special relativity]]. In this case, the equation is usually written as:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is also the equation for [[Spherical wave|spherical wave fronts]] of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=3000 Solved Problems in Physics|series=Schaum Series|author=A. Halpern|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=1988|isbn=978-0-07-025734-4|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper nappe is then the ''future light cone'' and the lower nappe is the ''past light cone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Physics|edition=2nd|author=R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg|publisher=VHC publishers|year=1991|isbn=0-89573-752-3|page=1054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4068">In [[mathematics]], an '''infinite expression''' is an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]] in which some operators take an infinite number of arguments, or in which the nesting of the operators continues to an infinite depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helmer |first1=Olaf |authorlink1=Olaf Helmer |date=January 1938 |title=The syntax of a language with infinite expressions |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=33–34 |type=Abstract |issn=0002-9904 |oclc=5797393 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1938-06672-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A generic concept for infinite expression can lead to ill-defined or self-inconsistent constructions (much like a [[universal set|set of all sets]]), but there are several instances of infinite expressions that are well defined.

Examples of well-defined infinite expressions include&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[infinite sum]]s, whether expressed using [[summation]] notation or as an [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], such as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots \,;&lt;/math&gt;

[[infinite product]]s, whether expressed using product notation or expanded, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n=0}^\infty b_n = b_0 \times b_1 \times b_2 \times \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

[[Nested radical#Infinitely nested radicals|infinite nested radical]]s, such as

: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+2\sqrt{1+3 \sqrt{1+\cdots}}} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Tetration#Extension_to_infinite_heights|infinite power towers]], such as 

: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

and [[continued fraction|infinite continued fraction]]s, whether expressed using [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s [[generalized continued fraction|Kettenbruch]] notation or expanded, such as

:&lt;math&gt;c_0 + \operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{c_n} = c_0 + \cfrac{1}{c_1 + \cfrac{1}{c_2 + \cfrac{1}{c_3 + \cfrac{1}{c_4 + \ddots}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[infinitary logic]], one can use infinite conjunctions and infinite disjunctions.

Even for well-defined infinite expressions, the ''value'' of the infinite expression may be ambiguous or not well defined; for instance, there are multiple summation rules available for assigning values to series, and the same series may have different values according to different summation rules if the series is not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].

==From the hyperreal viewpoint==
From the point of view of the hyperreals, such an infinite expression &lt;math&gt;E_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is obtained in every case from the sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle E_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of finite expressions, by evaluating the sequence at a [[hypernatural]] value &lt;math&gt;n=H&lt;/math&gt; of the index ''n'', and applying the [[standard part]], so that &lt;math&gt;E_\infty=\operatorname{st}(E_H)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Ingrid Daubechies''' ({{IPAc-en|d|oʊ|b|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː}} {{respell|doh|bə|SHEE}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBlVKNYmcdM Ingrid Daubechies - 2016 – ICTP Math]&lt;!--at 0:09--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|dobʃi|lang}}; born 17 August 1954) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]]. Between 2004 and 2011 she was the [[William R. Kenan, Jr.]] Professor in the mathematics and applied mathematics departments at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/dof/faculty/professorships/ |title=Endowed Professorships and Other Designated Chairs |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught at Princeton for 16 years.  In January 2011 she moved to [[Duke University]] as a [[James B. Duke Professor]] of mathematics. 

Daubechies was the first woman to be president of the [[International Mathematical Union]] (2011–2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2016/08/math-professor-ingrid-daubechies-awarded-1-5-million-grant|title=Math professor Ingrid Daubechies awarded $1.5 million grant|work=The Chronicle|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for her work with [[wavelet]]s in [[image compression]].

==Early life and education==
Daubechies was born in [[Houthalen-Helchteren|Houthalen]], Belgium, as the daughter of Marcel Daubechies (a civil mining engineer) and Simonne Duran (then a homemaker, later a criminologist)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20120815_00258845 Diamant voor Simonne en Marcel in nieuwsblad.be]&lt;/ref&gt;. She remembers that when she was a little girl and could not sleep, she did not count numbers, as you would expect from a child, but started to multiply numbers by two from memory. Thus, as a child, she already familiarized herself with the properties of [[exponential growth]]. Her parents found out that mathematical conceptions, like [[cone]] and [[tetrahedron]], were familiar to her before she reached the age of 6. She excelled at the primary school, moved up a class after only 3 months. After completing the [[Lyceum]] in [[Hasselt]]&lt;ref&gt;Daubechies herself, quoted in ''Flanders Today'' #15, October 2014, available [http://www.flanderstoday.eu/innovation/flemish-professor-how-maths-can-change-world here]. Retrieved August 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; she entered the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] at 17.&lt;ref name=Canvas-Avdw&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Alles voor de wetenschap: Aflevering 5: Ingrid Daubechies |trans-title=Everything for the science: Episode 5: Ingrid Daubechies |medium=Television production |language=Dutch |url=http://www.canvas.be/programmas/alles-voor-de-wetenschap/server1-12e79af5%3A12dbd4474d6%3A-6fc8 |date=2011-02-27 |time=21:40 |publisher=[[Canvas (Belgium)|Canvas]] |location=Belgium |accessdate=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302091400/http://www.canvas.be/programmas/alles-voor-de-wetenschap/server1-12e79af5:12dbd4474d6:-6fc8 |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Daubechies completed her undergraduate studies in physics at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] in 1975. During the next few years, she visited the CNRS Center for Theoretical Physics in [[Marseille]] several times, where she collaborated with [[Alex Grossmann]]; this work was the basis for her [[doctorate]] in [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Canvas-Avdw" /&gt; She obtained her Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1980.{{cn|date=February 2018}} 

==Career==
Daubechies continued her research career at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel until 1987, rising through the ranks to positions roughly equivalent with research assistant-professor in 1981 and research associate-professor 1985, funded by a fellowship from the NFWO (Nationaal Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Daubechies spent most of 1986 as a guest-researcher at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]. At Courant she made her best-known discovery: based on [[quadrature mirror filter]]-technology she constructed compactly supported continuous [[wavelet]]s that would require only a finite amount of processing, in this way enabling wavelet theory to enter the realm of [[digital signal processing]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In July 1987, Daubechies joined the Murray Hill [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories']] [[New Jersey]] facility. In 1988 she published the result in [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]].&lt;ref name=Canvas-Avdw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Daubechies, [http://www.math.duke.edu/~ingrid/publications/cpam41-1988.pdf ''Orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets''], Comm. Pure &amp; Appl. Math., 41 (7), pp. 909-996, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 2010, Daubechies was a professor at [[Princeton University]], where she was active within the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics. She was the first female full professor of mathematics at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2015/09/art-detective-work-did-rembrandt-really-paint-that.html|title=Art detective work: did Rembrandt really paint that? - The University of Auckland|website=www.auckland.ac.nz|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011 she moved to Duke University to serve as a professor of mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">In [[mathematics]], '''Kōmura's theorem''' is a result on the [[derivative|differentiability]] of [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] [[Banach space]]-valued functions, and is a substantial generalization of Lebesgue's theorem on the differentiability of the [[indefinite integral]], which is that Φ&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \varphi(s) \, \mathrm{d} s,&lt;/math&gt;

is differentiable at ''t'' for [[almost everywhere|almost every]] 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''T'' when ''φ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' lies in the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;''T''];&amp;nbsp;'''R''').

==Statement of the theorem==
Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||) be a [[reflexive space|reflexive]] Banach space and let ''φ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' be absolutely continuous. Then ''φ'' is (strongly) differentiable almost everywhere, the derivative ''φ''&amp;prime; lies in the [[Bochner space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;''T''];&amp;nbsp;''X''), and, for all 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''T'',

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = \varphi(0) + \int_{0}^{t} \varphi'(s) \, \mathrm{d} s.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lupanov's (''k'',&amp;nbsp;''s'')-representation''', named after [[Oleg Lupanov]], is a way of representing [[Boolean circuit]]s so as to show that the reciprocal of the [[Claude Shannon|Shannon effect]]. Shannon had showed that almost all [[Boolean functions]] of ''n'' variables need a [[circuit complexity|circuit]] of size at least&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The reciprocal is that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All Boolean functions of ''n'' variables can be computed with a circuit of at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;o(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) gates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition==

The idea is to represent the values of a boolean function ''&amp;fnof;'' in a table of 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; rows, representing the possible values of the ''k'' first variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; columns representing the values of the other variables.

Let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; be a partition of the rows of this table such that for ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p'', |''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s'' and &lt;math&gt;|A_p|=s'\leq s&lt;/math&gt;.
Let ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') [[iff]]&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Moreover, let &lt;math&gt;B_{i,w}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of the columns whose intersection with &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.

He is currently the Department Chair of the Mathematics Department at Rutgers University (2017-) and from (2006–2010) was director of the Mathematics Graduate Program at [[Rutgers University]]. Saks received his Ph.D from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1980 after completing his dissertation entitled ''Duality Properties of Finite Set Systems'' &lt;ref name="thesis"&gt;{{cite thesis |last1=Saks |first1=Michael Ezra |date=1980 |title=Duality Properties of Finite Set Systems |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |oclc=7447661}}&lt;/ref&gt; under his advisor [[Daniel J. Kleitman]].

A list of his publications and collaborations may be found at [[DBLP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DBLP |name=Michael E. Saks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he became a [[Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ACM Recognizes New Fellows|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|date=March 2017|volume=60|issue=3|page=23|doi=10.1145/3039921}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awards.acm.org/fellows/award-winners|title=Recipients|website=awards.acm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Saks research in [[computational complexity theory]], [[combinatorics]], and [[graph theory]] has contributed to the study of lower bounds in [[order theory]], [[randomized computation]], and [[space–time tradeoff]].

In Kahn and Saks (1984) it was shown there exist a tight information-theoretical lower bound for sorting under [[partially ordered]] information up to a multiplicative constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/800057.808694| chapter = Every poset has a good comparison| title = Proceedings of the sixteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing - STOC '84| pages = 299| year = 1984| last1 = Kahn | first1 = J. | last2 = Saks | first2 = M. | isbn = 0897911334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.114.5448&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf] the first super-linear lower bound for the [[noisy broadcast problem]] was proved. In a noisy broadcast model, &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; processors &lt;math&gt;P_0,P_1,\ldots,P_n&lt;/math&gt; are assigned a local input bit &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Each processor may perform a ''noisy broadcast'' to all other processors where the received bits may be independently flipped with a fixed probability. The problem is for processor &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; to determine &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; for some function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Saks et al. showed that an existing protocol by Gallager was indeed optimal by a reduction from a generalized noisy [[decision tree]] and produced a &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n\log(n))&lt;/math&gt; lower bound on the depth of the tree that learns the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.

In Beame et al. (2003) the first time–space lower bound trade-off for randomized computation of decision problems was proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/636865.636867| title = Time–space trade-off lower bounds for randomized computation of decision problems| journal = Journal of the ACM| volume = 50| issue = 2| pages = 154| year = 2003| last1 = Beame | first1 = P. | last2 = Saks | first2 = M. | last3 = Sun | first3 = X. | last4 = Vee | first4 = E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect-distinguish|Categorical theory|Category theory}}
In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], a [[theory (model theory)|theory]] is κ-'''categorical''' (or '''categorical in κ''') if it has exactly one model of [[cardinal number|cardinality]] κ [[up to]] [[isomorphism]].
'''Morley's categoricity theorem''' is a theorem of {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Michael D. Morley|first=Michael D. |last=Morley|year=1965}}, which states that if a [[first-order theory]] in a countable language is categorical in some [[uncountable]] [[cardinality]], then it is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.

{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Saharon Shelah|first=Saharon |last=Shelah|year=1974}} extended Morley's theorem to uncountable languages: if the language has cardinality κ and a theory is categorical in some uncountable cardinal greater than or equal to κ then it is categorical in all cardinalities greater than κ.

==History and motivation==
[[Oswald Veblen]] in 1904 defined a theory to be '''categorical''' if all of its models are isomorphic. It follows from the definition above and the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] that any [[first-order theory]] with a model of infinite [[cardinal number|cardinality]] cannot be categorical. One is then immediately led to the more subtle notion of κ-categoricity, which asks: for which cardinals κ is there exactly one model of cardinality κ of the given theory ''T'' up to isomorphism?  This is a deep question and significant progress was only made in 1954 when [[Jerzy &amp;#321;o&amp;#347;]] noticed that, at least for [[complete theory|complete theories]] ''T'' over countable [[formal language|languages]] with at least one infinite model, he could only find three ways for ''T'' to be κ-categorical at some κ:

*''T'' is '''totally categorical''', ''i.e.'' ''T'' is κ-categorical for all infinite [[cardinal number|cardinal]]s κ.
*''T'' is '''uncountably categorical''', ''i.e.'' ''T'' is κ-categorical if and only if κ is an [[countable|uncountable]] cardinal.
*''T'' is '''countably categorical''', ''i.e.'' ''T'' is κ-categorical if and only if κ is a countable cardinal.

In other words, he observed that, in all the cases he could think of, κ-categoricity at any one uncountable cardinal implied κ-categoricity at all other uncountable cardinals. This observation spurred a great amount of research into the 1960s, eventually culminating in [[Michael D. Morley|Michael Morley]]'s famous result that these are in fact the only possibilities.  The theory was subsequently extended and refined by [[Saharon Shelah]] in the 1970s and beyond, leading to [[Stability (model theory)|stability theory]] and Shelah's more general programme of [[spectrum of a theory|classification theory]].

==Examples==
There are not many natural examples of theories that are categorical in some uncountable cardinal. The known examples include:
* Pure identity theory (with no functions, constants, predicates other than "=", or axioms).
* The classic example is the theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of a given characteristic. Categoricity does ''not'' say that all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 as large as the [[complex numbers]] '''C''' are the same as '''C'''; it only asserts that they are isomorphic ''as fields'' to '''C'''. It follows that although the completed [[p-adic]] closures '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; are all isomorphic as fields to '''C''', they may (and in fact do) have completely different topological and analytic properties. The theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic is '''not''' categorical in ω (the countable infinite cardinal); there are models of transcendence degree 0, 1, 2, ..., ω.
* [[Vector space]]s over a given countable field. This includes [[abelian group]]s of given prime exponent (essentially the same as vector spaces over a finite field) and divisible torsion-free abelian groups (essentially the same as vector spaces over the rationals).
* The theory of the set of [[natural number]]s with a successor function.

There are also examples of theories that are categorical in ω but not categorical in uncountable cardinals. 
The simplest example is the theory of an equivalence relation with exactly two equivalence classes both of which are infinite. Another example is the theory of dense linear orders with no endpoints; Cantor proved that any such countable linear order is isomorphic to the rational numbers.

Any theory ''T'' categorical in some infinite cardinal κ is very close to being complete. More precisely, the [[Łoś–Vaught test]] states that if a satisfiable theory  has no finite models and is categorical in some infinite cardinal κ at least equal to the cardinality of its language, then the theory is complete.  The reason is that all infinite models are equivalent to some model of cardinal κ by the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], and so are all equivalent as the theory is categorical in κ. Therefore, the theory is complete as all models are equivalent.  The assumption that the theory have no finite models is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7565">In [[mathematics]], '''Mostow's rigidity theorem''', or  '''strong rigidity theorem''', or '''Mostow&amp;ndash;Prasad rigidity theorem''', essentially states that the geometry of a complete, finite-volume [[hyperbolic manifold]] of dimension greater than two is determined by the [[fundamental group]] and hence unique. The theorem was proven for [[closed manifold]]s by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=George Mostow|last=Mostow|year= 1968}} and extended to  finite volume manifolds by {{harvtxt|Marden|1974}} in 3 dimensions, and by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gopal Prasad|last=Prasad|year=1973}} in all dimensions at least 3.  {{harvtxt|Gromov|1981}} gave an alternate proof using the [[Gromov norm]].

While the theorem shows that the deformation space of (complete) hyperbolic structures on a finite volume hyperbolic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold (for&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) is a point, for a hyperbolic surface of [[genus]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 there is a [[moduli space]] of dimension 6''g''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;6 that parameterizes all metrics of constant curvature (up to [[diffeomorphism]]), a fact essential for [[Teichmüller theory]]. There is also a rich theory of deformation spaces of hyperbolic structures on ''infinite'' volume manifolds in three dimensions.

==The theorem==
The theorem can be given in a geometric formulation (pertaining to finite-volume, complete manifolds), and in an algebraic formulation (pertaining to lattices in Lie groups).

===Geometric form===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^n&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]]. A complete hyperbolic manifold can be defined as a quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^n&lt;/math&gt; by a group of isometries acting freely and [[Group action#Types of action|properly discontinuously]] (it is equivalent to define it as a [[hyperbolic manifold|Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature -1]] which is [[Riemannian manifold#Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces|complete]]). It is of finite volume if its [[Volume form|volume]] is finite (for example if it is compact). The Mostow rigidity theorem may be stated as:

:''Suppose &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are complete finite-volume hyperbolic manifolds of dimension &lt;math&gt;n \ge 3&lt;/math&gt;.  If there exists an [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f : \pi_1(M) \to \pi_1(N)&lt;/math&gt; then it is induced by a unique isometry from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.''

Here &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fundamental group]] of a manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an hyperbolic manifold obtained as the quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^n&lt;/math&gt; by a group &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X) \cong \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent statement is that any [[homotopy equivalence]] from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be homotoped to a unique isometry.  The proof actually shows that if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; has greater dimension than &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; then there can be no homotopy equivalence between them.

===Algebraic form===
The group of isometries of hyperbolic space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^n&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with the Lie group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PO}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; (the [[projective orthogonal group]] of a [[Quadratic form#Real quadratic forms|quadratic form of signature]] &lt;math&gt;(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following statement is equivalent to the one above.

:''Let &lt;math&gt; n \ge 3 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; be two [[Lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PO}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; and suppose that there is a group isomorphism &lt;math&gt;f: \Gamma \to \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; are conjugated in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PO}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, there exists a &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathrm{PO}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \Lambda = g \Gamma g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. ''

=== In greater generality ===

Mostow rigidity holds (in its geometric formulation) more generally for fundamental groups of all complete, finite volume [[locally symmetric space]]s of dimension at least 3, or in its algebraic formulation for all lattices in [[simple Lie group]]s not locally isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==

It follows from the Mostow rigidity theorem that the group of isometries of a finite-volume hyperbolic ''n''-manifold ''M'' (for ''n''&gt;2) is finite and isomorphic to Out(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')).

Mostow rigidity was also used by Thurston to prove the uniqueness of [[circle packing theorem|circle packing representations]] of [[planar graph|triangulated planar graphs]]{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

A consequence of Mostow rigidity of interest in [[geometric group theory]] is that there exist [[hyperbolic group]]s which are [[Quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] but not [[Commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] to each other.

In [[mathematics]], a '''''P''-multimagic cube''' is a [[magic cube]] that remains magic even if all its numbers are replaced by their ''k''-th power for 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''P''. Thus, a [[magic cube]] is '''bimagic''' when it is 2-multimagic, and '''trimagic''' when it is 3-multimagic, '''tetramagic''' when it is 4-multimagic.&lt;ref name=Multi&gt;{{MathWorld|id=MultimagicCube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''P''-multimagic cube is said to be '''semi-perfect''' if the ''k''-th power cubes are [[perfect magic cube|perfect]] for 1 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''P'', and the ''P''-th power cube is [[semiperfect magic cube|semiperfect]].  If all ''P'' of the power cubes are perfect, the multimagic cube is said to be perfect.  

The first known example of a bimagic cube was given by [[John Hendricks]] in 2000; it is a [[semiperfect magic cube|semiperfect]] cube of order 25 and [[magic constant]] 195325. In 2003, C. Bower discovered two semi-perfect bimagic cubes of order 16, and a perfect bimagic cube of order 32.&lt;ref name=Bi&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Bimagic Cube|id=BimagicCube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[MathWorld]] reports that only two trimagic cubes are known, discovered by C. Bower in 2003; a semiperfect cube of order 64 and a perfect cube of order 256.&lt;ref name=Tri&gt;{{MathWorld|id=TriMagic|title=Trimagic Cube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also reports that he discovered the only two known tetramagic cubes, a semiperfect cube of order 1024, and perfect cube of order 8192.&lt;ref name=Tetra&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Tetramagic Cube|id=TetramagicCube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">In mathematical physics, '''nonlinear realization''' of a [[Lie group]] ''G''  possessing a [[Cartan subgroup]]  ''H'' is a particular [[induced representation]] of ''G''. In fact, it is a representation of a [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' in a neighborhood of its origin.
A nonlinear realization, when restricted to the subgroup ''H'' reduces to a linear representation.

A nonlinear realization technique is part and parcel of many [[Field theory (physics)|field theories]] with [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], e.g., [[chiral model]]s, [[chiral symmetry breaking]], [[Goldstone boson]] theory,  [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field theory]], [[gauge gravitation theory]] and [[supergravity]].

Let ''G'' be a Lie group and  ''H''  its Cartan subgroup which admits a linear representation in a vector space ''V''. A Lie
algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' splits into the sum &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g=\mathfrak h \oplus \mathfrak f&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Cartan subalgebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;  of ''H'' and its supplement &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak f&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt; [\mathfrak f,\mathfrak f]\subset \mathfrak h, \qquad [\mathfrak f,\mathfrak h
]\subset \mathfrak f. &lt;/math&gt; 
(In physics, for instance, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;  amount to vector generators and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak f&lt;/math&gt; to axial ones.)

There exists an open neighborhood  ''U'' of the unit of ''G''  such
that any element &lt;math&gt; g\in U&lt;/math&gt;  is uniquely brought into the form
:&lt;math&gt; g=\exp(F)\exp(I), \qquad F\in\mathfrak f, \qquad I\in\mathfrak h. &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;U_G&lt;/math&gt; be an open neighborhood of the unit of  ''G''  such that
&lt;math&gt;U_G^2\subset U&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; be an open neighborhood of the
''H''-invariant center &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; of the quotient ''G/H''  which consists of elements
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=g\sigma_0=\exp(F)\sigma_0, \qquad g\in U_G. &lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a local section &lt;math&gt;s(g\sigma_0)=\exp(F) &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G\to G/H&lt;/math&gt;
over &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;. 

With this local section, one can define the [[induced representation]], called the '''nonlinear realization''', of elements &lt;math&gt;g\in U_G\subset G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;U_0\times V&lt;/math&gt; given by the expressions
:&lt;math&gt; g\exp(F)=\exp(F')\exp(I'), \qquad g:(\exp(F)\sigma_0,v)\to (\exp(F')\sigma_0,\exp(I')v). &lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding nonlinear realization of a Lie algebra
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' takes the following form.

Let &lt;math&gt;\{F_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{I_a\}&lt;/math&gt; be the bases for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, together with the commutation relations
:&lt;math&gt; [I_a,I_b]= c^d_{ab}I_d, \qquad [F_\alpha,F_\beta]= c^d_{\alpha\beta}I_d,
\qquad [F_\alpha,I_b]= c^\beta_{\alpha b}F_\beta. &lt;/math&gt;

Then a desired nonlinear realization of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak f\times V&lt;/math&gt;  reads
:&lt;math&gt;F_\alpha: (\sigma^\gamma F_\gamma,v)\to (F_\alpha(\sigma^\gamma)F_\gamma, 
F_\alpha(v)), \qquad  I_a: (\sigma^\gamma F_\gamma,v)\to  (I_a(\sigma^\gamma)F_\gamma,I_av), &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;F_\alpha(\sigma^\gamma)=
\delta^\gamma_\alpha +
\frac{1}{12}(c^\beta_{\alpha\mu}c^\gamma_{\beta\nu} - 3 c^b_{\alpha\mu}c^\gamma_{\nu
b})\sigma^\mu\sigma^\nu, \qquad I_a(\sigma^\gamma)=c^\gamma_{a\nu}\sigma^\nu, &lt;/math&gt;
up to the second order in  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. 

In physical models, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\sigma^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are treated as [[Goldstone boson|Goldstone fields]]. Similarly, nonlinear realizations of [[Lie superalgebra]]s  are considered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1205">A '''non-transitive game''' is a game for which the various strategies produce one or more "loops" of preferences.  In a non-[[transitive relation|transitive]] game in which strategy A is preferred over strategy B, and strategy B is preferred over strategy C, strategy A is ''not'' necessarily preferred over strategy C.

A prototypical example non-transitive game is the game [[rock, paper, scissors]] which is explicitly constructed as a non-transitive game.  In [[probability|probabilistic]] games like [[Penney's game]], the violation of transitivity results in a more subtle way, and is often presented as a probability [[paradox]].

The '''Open Energy Modelling Initiative''' ('''openmod''') is a [[Grassroots|grass roots]] community of [[energy system]] modellers from universities and research institutes across Europe and elsewhere.  The initiative promotes the use of [[open-source software]] and [[open data]] in [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|modelling]] for research and policy advice.  The Open Energy Modelling Initiative documents a variety of open-source energy models and addresses practical and conceptual issues regarding their development and application.  The initiative runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]], an [[internet forum]], and a [[wiki]] and hosts occasional academic workshops.  A statement of aims is available.&lt;ref name="openmod-manifesto"/&gt;

== Context ==

The application of [[open-source software development|open-source development]] to energy modelling dates back to around 2010.  This section provides some background for the growing interest in open methods.

=== Growth in open energy modelling ===

Just two active open energy modelling projects were cited in a 2011 paper: OSeMOSYS and TEMOA.&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  Balmorel was also open at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
NEMO was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}
{{as of|November 2016}}, the openmod wiki lists 24 such undertakings.&lt;ref name="openmod-models-page"/&gt;

=== Academic literature ===

An innovative 2012 paper presents the case for using "open, publicly accessible software and data as well as [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools".&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  The paper claims that these techniques can produce high-quality results and are particularly relevant for developing countries.

There is an increasing call for the energy models and [[dataset]]s used for [[energy policy]] analysis and advice to be made public in the interests of transparency and quality.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;  A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010b"/&gt;  One 2012 study argues that the [[source code]] and datasets used in such models should be placed under publicly accessible [[version control]] to enable third-parties to run and check specific models.&lt;ref name="DeCarolisEtal2012"/&gt;  Another 2014 study argues that the public trust needed to underpin a rapid transition in energy systems can only be built through the use of transparent open-source energy models.&lt;ref name="wiese-etal-2014"/&gt;  The UK TIMES project (UKTM) is open source, according to a 2014 presentation, because "energy modelling must be replicable and verifiable to be considered part of the scientific process" and because this fits with the "drive towards clarity and quality assurance in the provision of policy insights".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  In 2016, the [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) is seeking to improve its modelling methodologies, a key motivation being "the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility."&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"/&gt;{{rp|S27}}  A 2016 paper argues that model-based energy scenario studies, wishing to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a checklist of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors note however that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  An editorial from 2016 opines that closed energy models providing public policy support "are inconsistent with the open access movement [and] {{sic|public|ally|expected=publicly}} funded research".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;  Moreover:

{{quote|Given the importance of rapid global coordinated action on climate mitigation and the clear benefits of shared research efforts and transparently reproducible policy analysis, openness in energy research should not be for the sake of having some code or data available on a website, but as an initial step towards fundamentally better ways to both conduct our research and engage decision-makers with [our] models and the assumptions embedded within them.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}}}

A one-page opinion piece in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature News]]'' from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for scrutiny, currently only ''[[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]]'' makes this practice mandatory within the energy domain.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

=== Copyright and open energy data ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  Most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources, for example, [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  The doctrine of open data requires that these datasets be available under [[Copyright#Free licenses|free licenses]] (such as [[Creative Commons license|{{nowrap|CC BY 4.0}}]]) or be in the [[public domain]].  But most published energy datasets carry proprietary licenses, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped because the associated information is normally licensed to preclude downstream usage.  Recent transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"/&gt; and a 2016 amendment to the German Energy Industry Act{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="enwg-111d-2016"/&gt; to establish a nation energy information platform, slated to launch on 1{{nbsp}}July 2017.  Energy databases are protected under general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the copyright status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;

In December 2017, participants from the Open Energy Modelling Initiative and allied research communities made a written submission to the [[European Commission]] on the {{nowrap|re-use}} of [[public sector information]].&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"/&gt;  The document provides a comprehensive account of the data issues faced by researchers engaged in open energy system modeling and energy market analysis and quoted extensively from a German legal opinion.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;

=== Public policy support ===

In May 2016 the [[European Union]] announced that "all scientific articles in Europe must be freely accessible as of 2020".&lt;ref name="hendrikx-2016"/&gt;  This is a step in the right direction, but the new policy makes no mention of open software and its importance to the scientific process.&lt;ref name="albers-2016"/&gt;  In August 2016, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] announced a new federal [[source code]] policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as [[open-source software]] (OSS).&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] (DOE) is participating in the program.  The project is hosted on a dedicated website and subject to a three-year pilot.&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="code-gov-website"/&gt;  Open-source campaigners are using the initiative to advocate that European governments adopt similar practices.&lt;ref name="new-2016"/&gt;  In 2017 the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) issued a [[position paper]] calling for free software and open standards to be central to European science funding, including the flagship [[European Union|EU]] program [[Horizon 2020|Horizon{{nbsp}}2020]].  The position paper focuses on open data and open data processing and the question of open modeling is not traversed per{{nbsp}}se.&lt;ref name="gkotsopoulou-etal-2017"/&gt;

'''Pointwise mutual information''' ('''PMI'''),&lt;ref name="Church1990"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/J90-1003|author=Kenneth Ward Church and Patrick Hanks|title=Word association norms, mutual information, and lexicography|journal=Comput. Linguist.|volume=16|issue=1|date=March 1990|pages=22–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''point mutual information''', is a measure of [[Association (statistics)|association]] used in [[information theory]] and [[statistics]]. In contrast to [[mutual information]] (MI) which builds upon PMI, it refers to single events, whereas MI refers to the average of all possible events.

==Definition==
The PMI of a pair of [[probability space|outcomes]] ''x'' and ''y'' belonging to [[discrete random variable]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' quantifies the discrepancy between the probability of their coincidence given their [[joint distribution]] and their individual distributions, assuming [[statistical independence|independence]].  Mathematically:

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{pmi}(x;y) \equiv \log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} = \log\frac{p(x|y)}{p(x)} = \log\frac{p(y|x)}{p(y)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[mutual information]] (MI) of the random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' is the expected value of the PMI over all possible outcomes (with respect to the joint distribution &lt;math&gt;p(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;).

The measure is symmetric (&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pmi}(x;y)=\operatorname{pmi}(y;x)&lt;/math&gt;).  It can take positive or negative values, but is zero if ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[statistical independence|independent]].  Note that even though PMI may be negative or positive, its expected outcome over all joint events (MI) is positive. PMI maximizes when ''X'' and ''Y'' are perfectly associated (i.e. &lt;math&gt;p(x|y)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p(y|x)=1&lt;/math&gt;), yielding the following bounds:

:&lt;math&gt;
-\infty \leq \operatorname{pmi}(x;y) \leq \min\left[ -\log p(x), -\log p(y) \right] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pmi}(x;y)&lt;/math&gt; will increase if &lt;math&gt;p(x|y)&lt;/math&gt; is fixed but &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; decreases.

Here is an example to illustrate:
{| border="1" cellpadding="2" class="wikitable"
!''x''!!''y''!!''p''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')
|-
|0||0||0.1
|-
|0||1||0.7
|-
|1||0||0.15
|-
|1||1||0.05
|}
Using this table we can [[marginalization (probability)|marginalize]] to get the following additional table for the individual distributions:
{| border="1" cellpadding="2" class="wikitable"
! !!''p''(''x'')!!''p''(''y'')
|-
|0||0.8||0.25
|-
|1||0.2||0.75
|}
With this example, we can compute four values for &lt;math&gt;pmi(x;y)&lt;/math&gt;.  Using base-2 logarithms:
{| cellpadding="2"
|-
|pmi(x=0;y=0)||=||&amp;minus;1
|-
|pmi(x=0;y=1)||=||0.222392
|-
|pmi(x=1;y=0)||=||1.584963
|-
|pmi(x=1;y=1)||=||-1.584963
|-
|}

(For reference, the [[mutual information]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y)&lt;/math&gt; would then be 0.2141709)

==Similarities to mutual information==
Pointwise Mutual Information has many of the same relationships as the mutual information.  In particular,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{pmi}(x;y) &amp;=&amp; h(x) + h(y) - h(x,y) \\ 
 &amp;=&amp; h(x) - h(x|y) \\ 
 &amp;=&amp; h(y) - h(y|x)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[self-information]], or &lt;math&gt;-\log_2 p(X=x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Normalized pointwise mutual information (npmi)==
Pointwise mutual information can be normalized between [-1,+1] resulting in -1 (in the limit) for never occurring together, 0 for independence, and +1 for complete [[co-occurrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Normalized (Pointwise) Mutual Information in Collocation Extraction|url=https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/gerlof/pub/www/Docs/npmi-pfd.pdf|last1=Bouma|first1=Gerlof|year=2009|publisher=Proceedings of the Biennial GSCL Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

\operatorname{npmi}(x;y) = \frac{\operatorname{pmi}(x;y)}{h(x, y) }

&lt;/math&gt;

==PMI variants==

In addition to the above-mentioned npmi, PMI has many other interesting variants. A comparative study of these variants can be found in &lt;ref&gt;Francois Role, Moahmed Nadif. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282359004_HANDLING_THE_IMPACT_OF_LOW_FREQUENCY_EVENTS_ON_CO-OCCURRENCE_BASED_MEASURES_OF_WORD_SIMILARITY_KDIR_2011__KDIR-_International_Conference_on_Knowledge_Discovery_and_Information_Retrieval_226-231_Paris_October_26-29_2011._102011 Handling the Impact of Low frequency Events on Co-occurrence-based Measures of Word Similarity:A Case Study of Pointwise Mutual Information.] Proceedings of KDIR 2011 : KDIR- International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval, Paris, October 26-29 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-rule for pmi==
Like [[mutual information]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=INFORMATION DYNAMICS: ITS THEORY AND APPLICATION TO EMBODIED COGNITIVE SYSTEMS|author=Paul L. Williams|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Williams18/publication/266725181_Information_Dynamics_Its_Theory_and_Application_to_Embodied_Cognitive_Systems/links/5437ffac0cf24a6ddb917785.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; point mutual information follows the [[Chain rule (probability)|chain rule]], that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pmi}(x;yz) = \operatorname{pmi}(x;y) + \operatorname{pmi}(x;z|y)&lt;/math&gt;

This is easily proven by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{pmi}(x;y) + \operatorname{pmi}(x;z|y) &amp; {} = \log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} + \log\frac{p(x,z|y)}{p(x|y)p(z|y)} \\ 
&amp; {} = \log \left[ \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} \frac{p(x,z|y)}{p(x|y)p(z|y)} \right] \\ 
&amp; {} = \log \frac{p(x|y)p(y)p(x,z|y)}{p(x)p(y)p(x|y)p(z|y)} \\
&amp; {} = \log \frac{p(x,yz)}{p(x)p(yz)} \\
&amp; {} = \operatorname{pmi}(x;yz)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
In [[computational linguistics]], PMI has been used for finding [[collocation]]s and associations between words. For instance, [[word count|countings]] of occurrences and [[co-occurrence]]s of words in a [[text corpus]] can be used to approximate the probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The following table shows counts of pairs of words getting the most and the least PMI scores in the first 50 millions of words in Wikipedia (dump of October 2015) filtering by 1,000 or more co-occurrences. The frequency of each count can be obtained by dividing its value by 50,000,952. (Note: natural log is used to calculate the PMI values in this example, instead of log base 2)

|}

Good collocation pairs have high PMI because the probability of co-occurrence is only slightly lower than the probabilities of occurrence of each word. Conversely, a pair of words whose probabilities of occurrence are considerably higher than their probability of co-occurrence gets a small PMI score.

'''Raymond Clare Archibald''' (7 October 1875 – 26 July 1955) was a prominent Canadian-American mathematician.  He is known for his work as a historian of mathematics, his editorships of mathematical journals and his contributions to the teaching of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stahlman|first=William D.|title=Raymond Claire Archibald (1875--1955)|journal=Isis|year=1956|volume=47|issue=3|pages=244––246|doi=10.1086/348505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Raymond Clare Archibald was born in South Branch, Stewiacke, [[Nova Scotia]] on 7 October 1875. He was the son of Abram Newcomb Archibald (1849—1883) and Mary Mellish Archibald (1849—1901).  He was the fourth cousin twice removed of the famous Canadian-American astronomer and mathematician [[Simon Newcomb]] (1835—1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tatersall|first=James|author2=Shawnee McMurran |title=Raymond Clare Archibald: His Life and Work|journal=Proc. Can. Soc. Hist. Phil. Math.|year=2004|volume=17|pages=241–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald graduated in 1894 from [[Mount Allison University|Mount Allison College]] with B.A. degree in mathematics and teacher's certificate in violin.  After teaching mathematics and violin for a year at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College he went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he received a B.A. 1896 and a M.A. in 1897.  He then traveled to Europe where he attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during 1898 and received a Ph.D.cum laude from the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]] in 1900.  His advisor was Karl Theodor Reye and title of his dissertation was The [[Cardioid]]e and Some of its Related Curves.

He returned to [[Canada]] in 1900 and taught mathematics and violin at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College until 1907.  After a one-year appointment at Acadia University he accepted an invitation of join the mathematics department at [[Brown University]].  He stayed at Brown for the rest of his career becoming a Professor Emeritus in 1943.  While at Brown he created one of the finest mathematical libraries in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0430|work=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald returned to Mount Allison in 1954 to curate the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library, the library he had founded in 1905 to honor his mother.  At his death the library contained 23,000 volumes, 2,700 records, and 70,000 songs in American and English poetry and drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|url=http://www.mta.ca/libraryhistory/r_c_archibald.html|work=Pages Through The Ages|publisher=Mount Allison University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Clare Archibald was a world-renowned historian of mathematics with a lifelong concern for the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools.  At the presentation of his portrait to Brown University the head of the mathematics department, Professor [[Clarence Raymond Adams]] (1898–1965) said of him:

"The instincts of the bibliophile were also his from early years.  Possessing a passion for accurate detail, systematic by nature and blessed with a memory that was the marvel of his friends, he gradually acquired a knowledge of mathematical books and their values which has scarcely been equalled.  This knowledge and an untiring energy he dedicated to the upbuilding of the mathematical library at [[Brown University]].  From modest beginnings he has developed this essential equipment of the mathematical investigator to a point where it has no superior, in completeness and in convenience for the user."

==Honors==
Archibald received honorary degrees from the [[University of Padua]] (LL.D., 1922), [[Mount Allison University]] (LL.D., 1923) and from [[Brown University]] (M.A. ad eundem, 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarton|first=George|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|journal=Osiris|year=1956|volume=12|pages=4–34|doi=10.1086/368594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">In [[mathematical logic]], '''[[proof compression]] by splitting''' is an [[algorithm]] that operates as a post-process on [[resolution (logic)|resolution]] proofs.  It was proposed by Scott Cotton in his paper "Two Techniques for Minimizing Resolution Proof".&lt;ref name=Cotton&gt;Cotton, Scott. "Two Techniques for Minimizing Resolution Proofs". 13th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Splitting algorithm is based on the following observation:

Given a proof of unsatisfiability &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, it is easy to re-arrange (split) the proof in a proof of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a proof of &lt;math&gt;\neg x &lt;/math&gt; and the recombination of these two proofs (by an additional resolution step) may result in a proof smaller than the original.

Note that applying Splitting in a proof &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; using a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not invalidates a latter application of the algorithm using a differente variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Actually, the method proposed by Cotton&lt;ref name=Cotton /&gt; generates a sequence of proofs &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 \pi_2 \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, where each proof &lt;math&gt;\pi_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the result of applying Splitting to &lt;math&gt;\pi_i&lt;/math&gt;. During the construction of the sequence, if a proof &lt;math&gt;\pi_j&lt;/math&gt; happens to be too large, &lt;math&gt;\pi_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; is set to be the smallest proof in &lt;math&gt;\{\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_j\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For achieving a better compression/time ratio, a heuristic for variable selection is desirable. For this purpose, Cotton&lt;ref name=Cotton /&gt; defines the "additivity" of a resolution step (with antecedents &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and resolvent &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;):

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{add}(r) := \max(|r|-\max(|p|, |n|), 0) &lt;/math&gt;

Then, for each variable &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, a score is calculated summing the additivity of all the resolution steps in &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; with pivot &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; together with the number of these resolution steps. Denoting each score calculated this way by &lt;math&gt;add(v, \pi)&lt;/math&gt;, each variable is selected with a probability proportional to its score:

: &lt;math&gt;p(v) = \frac{\operatorname{add}(v, \pi_i)}{\sum_x{\operatorname{add}(x, \pi_i)}}&lt;/math&gt;

To split a proof of unsatisfiability &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; in a proof &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a proof &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\neg x}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\neg x&lt;/math&gt;, Cotton &lt;ref name=Cotton /&gt; proposes the following:

Let &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; denote a literal and &lt;math&gt;p \oplus _x n&lt;/math&gt; denote the resolvent of clauses &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x \in p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg x \in n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, define the map &lt;math&gt;\pi_l&lt;/math&gt; on nodes in the resolution dag of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_l(c) := \begin{cases}
  c, &amp; \text{if } c \text{ is an input}  \\
  \pi_l(p),  &amp; \text{if } c = p \oplus_x n \text{ and } (l = x \text{ or } x \notin \pi_l(p)) \\ 
  \pi_l(n),  &amp; \text{if } c = p \oplus_x n \text{ and } (l = \neg x \mbox{ or } \neg x \notin \pi_l(n)) \\
  \pi_l(p) \oplus_x \pi_l(p),  &amp; \text{if } x \in \pi_l(p) \text{ and } \neg x \in \pi_l(n)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Also, let &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; be the empty clause in &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\neg x}&lt;/math&gt; are obtained by computing &lt;math&gt;\pi_x(o)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\neg x}(o)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22057">In [[mathematics]], '''restriction''' is a fundamental construction in [[group representation theory|representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. Restriction forms a representation of a [[subgroup]] from a representation of the whole group. Often the restricted representation is simpler to understand. Rules for decomposing the restriction of an [[irreducible representation]] into irreducible representations of the subgroup are called branching rules, and have important applications in [[physics]]. For example, in case of [[explicit symmetry breaking]], the [[symmetry group]] of the problem is reduced from the whole group to one of its subgroups. In [[quantum mechanics]], this reduction in symmetry appears as a splitting of [[degenerate energy levels]] into [[multiplet]]s, as in the [[Stark effect|Stark]] or [[Zeeman effect]].

The [[induced representation]] is a related operation that forms a representation of the whole group from a representation of a subgroup.  The relation between restriction and induction is described by [[Frobenius reciprocity]] and the Mackey theorem.  Restriction to a [[normal subgroup]] behaves particularly well and is often called [[Clifford theory]] after the theorem of A. H. Clifford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946|pp=159–160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Restriction can be generalized to other [[group homomorphism]]s and to other [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].

For any group ''G'', its [[subgroup]] ''H'', and a [[linear representation]] ''ρ'' of ''G'', the restriction of ''ρ'' to ''H'', denoted

: &lt;math&gt; \rho \, \Big|_H &lt;/math&gt; 

is a representation of ''H'' on the same [[vector space]] by the same operators:

: &lt;math&gt; \rho\,\Big|_H(h) = \rho(h). &lt;/math&gt;

== Classical branching rules ==
'''Classical branching rules''' describe the restriction of an irreducible representation ({{pi}},&amp;nbsp;''V'') of a [[classical group]] ''G'' to a classical subgroup ''H'', i.e. the multiplicity with which an irreducible representation (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''W'') of ''H'' occurs in&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}. By Frobenius reciprocity for [[compact group]]s, this is equivalent to finding the multiplicity of {{pi}} in the [[induced representations|unitary representation induced]] from σ. Branching rules for the classical groups were determined by
* {{harvtxt|Weyl|1946}} between successive [[unitary group]]s;
* {{harvtxt|Murnaghan|1938}} between successive [[special orthogonal group]]s and [[unitary symplectic group]]s;
* {{harvtxt|Littlewood|1950}} from the unitary groups to the unitary symplectic groups and special orthogonal groups.

The results are usually expressed graphically using [[Young diagram]]s to encode the signatures used classically to label irreducible representations, familiar from [[invariant theory|classical invariant theory]]. [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Richard Brauer]] discovered a systematic method for determining the branching rule when the groups ''G'' and ''H'' share a common [[maximal torus]]: in this case the [[Weyl group]] of ''H'' is a subgroup of that of ''G'', so that the rule can be deduced from the [[Weyl character formula]].&lt;ref name="Weyl"&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Želobenko|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic modern interpretation has been given by {{harvtxt|Howe|1995}} in the context of his theory of [[Reductive dual pair|dual pair]]s. The special case where σ is the trivial representation of ''H'' was first used extensively by [[Hua Loo-keng|Hua]] in his work on the [[reproducing kernel|Szegő kernels]] of [[hermitian symmetric space|bounded symmetric domain]]s in [[several complex variables]], where the [[Shilov boundary]] has the form ''G''/''H''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hua|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally the [[Zonal spherical function#Cartan–Helgason theorem|Cartan-Helgason theorem]] gives the decomposition when ''G''/''H'' is a compact symmetric space, in which case all multiplicities are one;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|pp=534–543}}&lt;/ref&gt; a generalization to arbitrary σ has since been obtained by {{harvtxt|Kostant|2004}}. Similar geometric considerations have also been used by {{harvtxt|Knapp|2005}} to rederive Littlewood's rules, which involve the celebrated [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]]s for tensoring irreducible representations of the unitary groups.
{{harvtxt|Littelmann|1995}} has found generalizations of these rules to arbitrary compact semisimple Lie groups, using his [[Littelmann path model|path model]], an approach to representation theory close in spirit to the theory of [[crystal basis|crystal bases]] of [[Lusztig]] and [[Kashiwara]]. His methods yield branching rules for restrictions to subgroups containing a maximal torus. The study of branching rules is important in classical invariant theory and its modern counterpart, [[algebraic combinatorics]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Wallach|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonald"&gt;{{harvnb|Macdonald|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example'''. The unitary group ''U''(''N'') has irreducible representations labelled by signatures

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} \,\colon \,f_1\ge f_2\ge \cdots \ge f_N&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are integers. In fact if a unitary matrix ''U'' has eigenvalues ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then the character of the corresponding irreducible representation {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr} \pi_{\mathbf{f}}(U) = {\det z_j^{f_i +N -i}\over \prod_{i&lt;j} (z_i-z_j)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The branching rule from ''U''(''N'') to ''U''(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) states that

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathbf{f}}|_{U(N-1)}= \bigoplus_{f_1\ge g_1 \ge f_2\ge g_2\ge \cdots \ge f_{N-1}\ge g_{N-1}\ge f_N} \pi_{\mathbf{g}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

'''Example'''. The unitary symplectic group or [[quaternionic unitary group]], denoted Sp(''N'') or  ''U''(''N'', '''H'''), is the group of all transformations of
'''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; which commute with right multiplication by the [[quaternions]] '''H''' and preserve the '''H'''-valued hermitian inner product

:&lt;math&gt; (q_1,\ldots,q_N)\cdot (r_1,\ldots,r_N) = \sum r_i^*q_i&lt;/math&gt;

on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''q''* denotes the quaternion conjugate to ''q''. Realizing quaternions as 2 x 2 complex matrices, the group Sp(''N'') is just the group of [[block matrix|block matrices]] (''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) in SU(2''N'') with

:&lt;math&gt;q_{ij}=\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_{ij}&amp;\beta_{ij}\\
-\overline{\beta}_{ij}&amp;\overline{\alpha}_{ij}
\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''β''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[complex number]]s.

Each matrix ''U'' in Sp(''N'') is conjugate to a block diagonal matrix with entries

:&lt;math&gt;q_i=\begin{pmatrix}
z_i&amp;0\\
0&amp;\overline{z}_i
\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where |''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;| = 1. Thus the eigenvalues of ''U'' are (''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;±1&lt;/sup&gt;). The irreducible representations of Sp(''N'') are labelled by signatures

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} \,\colon \,f_1\ge f_2\ge \cdots \ge f_N\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are integers. The character of the corresponding irreducible representation ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr} \sigma_{\mathbf{f}}(U) = {\det z_j^{f_i +N -i +1 } - z_j^{-f_i - N +i -1}\over \prod (z_i-z_i^{-1})\cdot \prod_{i&lt;j} (z_i +z_i^{-1} - z_j - z_j^{-1})}.&lt;/math&gt;

The branching rule from Sp(''N'') to Sp(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) states that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Wallach|1998|pp=351–352,365–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathbf{f}}|_{\mathrm{Sp}(N-1)}= \bigoplus_{f_i \ge g_i\ge f_{i+2}} m(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}) \sigma_{\mathbf{g}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''N'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and the [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] ''m''('''f''', '''g''') is given by

:&lt;math&gt; m(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g})=\prod_{i=1}^N (a_i - b_i +1)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; a_1\ge b_1 \ge a_2 \ge b_2 \ge \cdots \ge a_N \ge b_N=0&lt;/math&gt;

is the non-increasing rearrangement of the 2''N'' non-negative integers (''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) and 0.

'''Example'''. The branching from U(2''N'') to Sp(''N'') relies on two identities of [[Dudley E. Littlewood|Littlewood]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littlewood|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946|pp=216–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koike|Terada|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macdonald|1979|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \sum_{f_1\ge f_2\ge f_N\ge 0} \operatorname{Tr}\Pi_{\mathbf{f},0}(z_1,z_1^{-1},\ldots, z_N,z_N^{-1}) \cdot \operatorname{Tr}\pi_{\mathbf{f}}(t_1,\ldots,t_N) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \sum_{f_1\ge f_2\ge f_N\ge 0} \operatorname{Tr}\sigma_{\mathbf{f}}(z_1,\ldots, z_N) \cdot \operatorname{Tr}\pi_{\mathbf{f}}(t_1,\ldots,t_N)\cdot \prod_{i&lt;j} (1-z_iz_j)^{-1},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;'''f''',0&lt;/sub&gt; is the irreducible representation of ''U''(2''N'') with signature ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ··· ≥ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 ≥ ··· ≥ 0.

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i&lt;j} (1-z_iz_j)^{-1} =  \sum_{f_{2i-1}=f_{2i}} \operatorname{Tr} \pi_{f}(z_1,\ldots,z_N),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0.

The branching rule from U(2''N'') to Sp(''N'') is given by

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{\mathbf{f},0}|_{\mathrm{Sp}(N)}= \bigoplus_{\mathbf{h}, \,\,\mathbf{g},\,\, g_{2i-1}=g_{2i}} M(\mathbf{g}, \mathbf{h};\mathbf{f}) \sigma_{\mathbf{h}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where all the signature are non-negative and the coefficient ''M'' ('''g''', '''h'''; '''k''') is the multiplicity of the irreducible representation {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''U''(''N'') in the tensor product {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;'''g'''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is given combinatorially by the Littlewood–Richardson rule, the number of lattice permutations of the [[Skew tableau#Skew tableaux|skew diagram]] '''k'''/'''h''' of weight '''g'''.&lt;ref name="Macdonald" /&gt;

There is an extension of Littelwood's branching rule to arbitrary signatures due to {{harvtxt|Sundaram|1990|p=203}}. The Littlewood–Richardson coefficients  ''M'' ('''g''', '''h'''; '''f''') are extended to allow the signature '''f''' to have 2''N'' parts but restricting '''g''' to have even column-lengths (''g''&lt;sub&gt;2''i'' – 1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2''i''&lt;/sub&gt;). In this case the formula reads

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{\mathbf{f}}|_{\operatorname{Sp}(N)}= \bigoplus_{\mathbf{h}, \,\,\mathbf{g},\,\, g_{2i-1}=g_{2i}} M_N(\mathbf{g}, \mathbf{h};\mathbf{f}) \sigma_{\mathbf{h}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ('''g''', '''h'''; '''f''') counts the number of lattice permutations of '''f'''/'''h''' of weight '''g''' are counted for which 2''j'' + 1 appears no lower than row ''N'' + ''j'' of '''f''' for 1 ≤ ''j'' ≤ |''g''|/2.

'''Example'''. The special orthogonal group SO(''N'') has irreducible ordinary and [[spin representation]]s labelled by signatures&lt;ref name="Weyl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littelwood|1950|pp=223–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murnaghan|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; f_1\ge f_2 \ge \cdots \ge f_{n-1}\ge|f_n|&lt;/math&gt; for ''N'' = 2''n'';
*&lt;math&gt; f_1 \ge f_2 \ge \cdots \ge f_n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for ''N'' = 2''n''+1.

The ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are taken in '''Z''' for ordinary representations and in ½ + '''Z''' for spin representations. In fact if an orthogonal matrix ''U'' has eigenvalues ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;±1&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'', then the character of the corresponding irreducible representation {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr} \, \pi_{\mathbf{f}}(U) = {\det (z_j^{f_i +n -i} + z_j^{-f_i-n +i}) \over \prod_{i&lt;j} (z_i +z_i^{-1}-z_j-z_j^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''N'' = 2''n'' and by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr} \pi_{\mathbf{f}}(U) = {\det (z_j^{f_i +1/2 +n -i} - z_j^{-f_i -1/2-n +i})\over \prod_{i&lt;j} (z_i +z_i^{-1}-z_j-z_j^{-1}) \cdot\prod_k(z_k^{1/2} -z_k^{-1/2})}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''N'' = 2''n''+1.

The branching rules from SO(''N'') to  SO(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) state that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Wallach|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathbf{f}}|_{SO(2n)}= \bigoplus_{f_1\ge g_1 \ge f_2\ge g_2\ge \cdots \ge f_{n-1}\ge g_{n-1}\ge f_n \ge |g_n|} \pi_{\mathbf{g}}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''N'' = 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and

|}

for ''N'' = 2''n'', where the differences ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must be integers.

==Gelfand–Tsetlin basis==&lt;!-- Linked from [[Gelfand–Tsetlin integrable system]] --&gt;
{{see also|Gelfand–Tsetlin integrable system}}
Since the branching rules from ''U''(''N'') to U(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) or SO(''N'') to SO(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) have multiplicity one, the irreducible summands corresponding to smaller and smaller ''N'' will eventually terminate in one-dimensional subspaces. In this way [[I. M. Gelfand|Gelfand]] and Tsetlin were able to obtain a basis of any irreducible representation of  U(''N'') or SO(''N'') labelled by a chain of interleaved signatures, called a '''Gelfand–Tsetlin pattern'''.
Explicit formulas for the action of the Lie algebra on the '''Gelfand–Tsetlin basis''' are given in {{harvtxt|Želobenko|1973}}.

For the remaining classical group Sp(''N''), the branching is no longer multiplicity free, so that if ''V'' and ''W'' are irreducible representation of Sp(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) and Sp(''N'') the space of intertwiners Hom&lt;sub&gt;Sp(''N''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'',''W'') can have dimension greater than one. It turns out that the [[Yangian]] ''Y''(&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a [[Hopf algebra]] introduced by [[Ludwig Faddeev]] and [[LOMI|collaborators]], acts irreducibly on this  multiplicity space, a fact which enabled {{harvtxt|Molev|2006}} to extend the construction of Gelfand–Tsetlin bases to Sp(''N'').&lt;ref&gt;G. I. Olshanski had shown that the twisted Yangian &lt;math&gt;Y^-(\mathfrak{gl}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, a sub-Hopf algebra of &lt;math&gt;Y(\mathfrak{gl}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, acts naturally on the space of intertwiners. Its natural irreducible representations correspond to tensor products of the composition of point evaluations with irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These extend to the Yangian &lt;math&gt;Y(\mathfrak{gl})&lt;/math&gt; and give a representation theoretic explanation of the product form of the branching coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clifford's theorem ==
{{main|Clifford theory}}
In 1937 [[Alfred H. Clifford]] proved the following result on the restriction of finite-dimensional irreducible representations from a group ''G'' to a normal subgroup ''N'' of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946|pp=159–160, 311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''. Let {{pi}}: ''G'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; GL(''n'',''K'') be an irreducible representation with ''K'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then 
the restriction of {{pi}} to ''N'' breaks up into a direct sum of inequivalent irreducible representations of ''N'' of equal dimensions. These irreducible representations of ''N'' lie in one orbit for the action of ''G'' by conjugation on the equivalence classes of irreducible representations of ''N''. In particular the number of distinct summands is no greater than the index of ''N'' in&amp;nbsp;''G''.

Twenty years later [[George Mackey]] found a more precise version of this result for the restriction of irreducible [[unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s to closed normal subgroups in what has become known as the "Mackey machine" or "Mackey normal subgroup analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=George W.|last=Mackey|authorlink=George Mackey|title=The theory of unitary group representations|series=Chicago Lectures in Mathematics|year=1976|isbn=0-226-50052-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstract algebraic setting ==
{{Main|Frobenius reciprocity}}
From the point of view of [[category theory]], restriction is an instance of a [[forgetful functor]]. This functor is [[exact functor|exact]], and its [[adjoint functor|left adjoint functor]] is called ''induction''. The relation between restriction and induction in various contexts is called the Frobenius reciprocity. Taken together, the operations of induction and restriction form a powerful set of tools for analyzing representations. This is especially true whenever the representations have the property of [[completely reducible|complete reducibility]], for example, in [[representation theory of finite groups]] over a [[field (algebra)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]].

== Generalizations ==
This rather evident construction may be extended in numerous and significant ways. For instance we may take any group homomorphism φ from ''H'' to ''G'', instead of the [[inclusion map]], and define the restricted representation of ''H'' by the composition

: &lt;math&gt; \rho\circ\varphi \, &lt;/math&gt;

We may also apply the idea to other categories in [[abstract algebra]]: [[associative algebra]]s, rings, [[Lie algebra]]s, [[Lie superalgebra]]s, Hopf algebras to name some. Representations or [[module (mathematics)|module]]s ''restrict'' to subobjects, or via homomorphisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10533">In [[symbolic computation]] (or computer algebra), at the intersection of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''Risch algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[Indefinite integral|indefinite integration]]. It is used in some [[computer algebra system]]s to find [[antiderivative]]s. It is named after the American [[mathematician]] [[Robert Henry Risch]], a specialist in computer algebra who developed it in 1968.

The algorithm transforms the problem of [[integration (calculus)|integration]] into a problem in [[differential algebra|algebra]]. It is based on the form of the function being integrated and on methods for integrating [[rational function]]s, [[Nth root|radical]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[exponential function]]s. Risch called it a [[decision procedure]], because it is a method for deciding whether a function has an [[elementary function]] as an indefinite integral, and if it does, for determining that indefinite integral.

The complete description of the Risch algorithm takes over 100 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|Czapor|Labahn|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Risch–Norman algorithm''' is a simpler, faster, but less powerful variant that was developed in 1976 by A. C. Norman.

==Description==
The Risch algorithm is used to integrate [[elementary function]]s. These are functions obtained by composing exponentials, logarithms, radicals, trigonometric functions, and the four arithmetic operations ({{nowrap|+ − × ÷}}). [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] solved this problem for the case of [[rational functions]], as he showed that the indefinite integral of a rational function is a rational function and a finite number of constant multiples of logarithms of rational functions. The algorithm suggested by Laplace is usually described in calculus textbooks; as a computer program, it was finally implemented in the 1960s.

[[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] formulated the problem that is solved by the Risch algorithm. Liouville proved by analytical means that if there is an elementary solution {{math|''g''}} to the equation {{math|1=''g''′ = ''f''}} then there exist constants {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and functions {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''v''}} in the field generated by {{math|''f''}} such that the solution is of the form

:&lt;math&gt; g = v + \sum_{i&lt;n} \alpha_i \ln (u_i) &lt;/math&gt;

Risch developed a method that allows one to consider only a finite set of functions of Liouville's form.

The intuition for the Risch algorithm comes from the behavior of the exponential and logarithm functions under differentiation. For the function {{math|''f'' ''e&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, where {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are [[differentiable function]]s, we have

: &lt;math&gt; \left(f \cdot e^g\right)^\prime = \left(f^\prime + f\cdot g^\prime\right) \cdot e^g, \, &lt;/math&gt;

so if {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;''}} were in the result of an indefinite integration, it should be expected to be inside the integral. Also, as

: &lt;math&gt; \left(f \cdot(\ln g)^n\right)^\prime =  f^\prime \left(\ln g\right)^n + n f  \frac{g^\prime}{g} \left(\ln g\right)^{n - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

then if {{math|(ln ''g'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} were in the result of an integration, then only a few powers of the logarithm should be expected.

==Problem examples==
Finding an elementary antiderivative is very sensitive to details. For instance, the following algebraic function has an elementary antiderivative:&lt;ref&gt;This example was posted by Manuel Bronstein to the [[Usenet]] forum ''comp.soft-sys.math.maple'' on 24 November 2000.[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.soft-sys.math.maple/5CcPIR9Ft-Y/xYfGiyJauuoJ]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^4 + 10 x^2 - 96 x - 71}},&lt;/math&gt;

namely:

: &lt;math&gt;F(x) = - \tfrac{1}{8}\ln \left( \left(x^6+15 x^4-80 x^3+27 x^2-528 x+781\right) \sqrt{ x^4+10 x^2-96 x-71} - \left(x^8 + 20 x^6 - 128 x^5 + 54 x^4 - 1408 x^3 + 3124 x^2 + 10001\right) \right) + C.&lt;/math&gt;

But if the constant term 71 is changed to 72, it is not possible to represent the antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. Some [[computer algebra system]]s may here return an antiderivative in terms of ''non-elementary'' functions (i.e. [[elliptic integral]]s), which however are outside the scope of the Risch algorithm.

The following is a more complex example that involves both algebraic and transcendental functions:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronstein|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x^2+2x+1+ (3x+1)\sqrt{x+\ln x}}{x\,\sqrt{x+\ln x}\left(x+\sqrt{x+\ln x}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the antiderivative of this function has a fairly short form:

: &lt;math&gt;F(x) = 2 \left(\sqrt{x+\ln x} + \ln\left(x+\sqrt{x+\ln x}\right)\right) + C.&lt;/math&gt;

==Implementation==
Transforming Risch's theoretical algorithm into an algorithm that can be effectively executed by a computer was a complex task which took a long time.

The case of the purely transcendental functions (which do not involve roots of polynomials) is relatively easy and was implemented early in most [[computer algebra system]]s. The first implementation was done by [[Joel Moses]] in [[Macsyma]] soon after the publication of Risch's paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moses|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of purely algebraic functions was solved and implemented in [[Reduce (computer algebra system)|Reduce]] by [[James H. Davenport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davenport|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general case was solved and implemented in Scratchpad, a precursor of [[Axiom (computer algebra system)|Axiom]], by Manuel Bronstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronstein|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decidability==
The Risch algorithm applied to general elementary functions is not an algorithm but a [[RE (complexity)|semi-algorithm]] because it needs to check, as a part of its operation, if certain expressions are equivalent to zero ([[constant problem]]), in particular in the constant field. For expressions that involve only functions commonly taken to be [[elementary function|elementary]] it is not known whether an algorithm performing such a check exists or not (current [[computer algebra system]]s use heuristics); moreover, if one adds the [[absolute value|absolute value function]] to the list of elementary functions, it is known that no such algorithm exists; see [[Richardson's theorem]].

Note that this issue also arises in the [[polynomial division algorithm]]; this algorithm will fail if it cannot correctly determine whether coefficients vanish identically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= Mathematica 7 Documentation: PolynomialQuotient| url= http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/PolynomialQuotient.html| work= Section: Possible Issues| accessdate= 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually every non-trivial algorithm relating to polynomials uses the polynomial division algorithm, the Risch algorithm included.  If the constant field is [[computable]], i.e., for elements not dependent on {{math|''x''}}, the problem of zero-equivalence is decidable, then the Risch algorithm is a complete algorithm. Examples of computable constant fields are {{math|'''Q'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''(''y'')}}, i.e., rational numbers and rational functions in {{mvar|''y''}} with rational number coefficients, respectively, where {{math|''y''}} is an indeterminate that does not depend on {{math|''x''}}.

This is also an issue in the [[Gaussian elimination]] matrix algorithm (or any algorithm that can compute the nullspace of a matrix), which is also necessary for many parts of the Risch algorithm.  Gaussian elimination will produce incorrect results if it cannot correctly determine if a pivot is identically zero{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

==History==
It is based at Woolgate Exchange near [[Moorgate tube station]] in London and was established in 1996. The chief executive is Kirsten Bodley. The STEMNET offices are housed within the [[Engineering Council]].

==Function==
Its chief aim is to interest children in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Primary school children can start to have an interest in these subjects, leading secondary school pupils to choose science A levels, which will lead to a science career. It supports the After School Science and Engineering Clubs at schools. There are also nine regional Science Learning Centres.&lt;ref name="nfer11"/&gt;

==Funding==
STEMNET used to receive funding from the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]. Since June 2007, it receives funding from the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] and [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6445053.stm|title=After-school science clubs boost: Young teenagers are being encouraged to take more interest in science and engineering with support announced for after-school clubs|work=[[BBC News]]|date=13 March 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since STEMNET sits on the chronological dividing point (age 16) of both of the new departments.

In [[quantum field theory]], '''Seiberg duality''', conjectured by [[Nathan Seiberg]], is an [[S-duality]] relating two different [[super QCD|supersymmetric QCDs]]. The two theories are not identical, but they agree at low energies.  More precisely under a [[renormalization]] group flow they flow to the same [[IR fixed point]], and so are in the same [[universality class]].

It was first presented in Seiberg's 1994 article [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9411149 Electric-Magnetic Duality in Supersymmetric Non-Abelian Gauge Theories].  It is an extension to [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] with N=1 supersymmetry of [[Montonen–Olive duality]] in N=4 theories and [[electromagnetic duality]] in [[abelian group|abelian]] theories.

==The statement of Seiberg duality==

Seiberg duality is an equivalence of the [[IR fixed point]]s in an ''N''=1 theory with SU(N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) as the [[gauge group]] and N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; [[flavor (physics)|flavors]] of [[fundamental representation|fundamental]] [[chiral superfield|chiral multiplet]]s and N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; flavors of [[antifundamental]] chiral multiplets in the [[chiral limit]] (no [[bare mass]]es) and an  N=1 chiral QCD with N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; colors and N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; flavors, where N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers satisfying

::&lt;math&gt;N_f&gt;N_c+1&lt;/math&gt;.

A stronger version of the duality relates not only the chiral limit but also the full deformation space of the theory.  In the special case in which

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over 3}N_f &lt; N_c &lt; {2\over 3}N_f&lt;/math&gt;

the IR fixed point is a nontrivial interacting [[superconformal algebra|superconformal field theory]]. For a superconformal field theory, the [[anomalous scaling dimension]] of a chiral superfield &lt;math&gt;D=\frac{3}{2} R&lt;/math&gt; where R is the R-charge. This is an exact result.

The dual theory contains a fundamental "meson" chiral superfield M which is color neutral but transforms as a bifundamental under the flavor symmetries.

|-

|}

The dual theory contains the [[superpotential]] &lt;math&gt;W=\alpha M \tilde{Q^c}\tilde{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relations between the original and dual theories==

Being an S-duality, Seiberg duality relates the [[strong coupling regime]] with the [[weak coupling regime]], and interchanges [[chromoelectric field]]s ([[gluon]]s) with [[chromomagnetic field]]s (gluons of the dual gauge group), and chromoelectric charges ([[quark]]s) with nonabelian [['t Hooft–Polyakov monopole]]s. In particular, the [[Higgs phase]] is dual to the [[colour confinement|confinement]] phase as in the [[dual superconducting model]].

The [[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s are preserved by the duality.  However in the electric theory the meson is a quark bilinear (&lt;math&gt;M \equiv Q^c Q&lt;/math&gt;), while in the magnetic theory it is a fundamental field.  In both theories the baryons are constructed from quarks, but the number of quarks in one baryon is the rank of the gauge group, which differs in the two dual theories.

The [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] of the theories do not agree, which is not problematic as the gauge symmetry is a feature of the formulation and not of the fundamental physics.  The [[global symmetry|global symmetries]] relate distinct physical configurations and so they need to agree in any dual description.

==Evidence for Seiberg duality==

The [[moduli space]]s of the dual theories are identical.

The global symmetries agree, as do the charges of the mesons and baryons.

In certain cases it reduces to ordinary electromagnetic duality.

It may be embedded in [[string theory]] via [[Hanany-Witten brane cartoon]]s consisting of intersecting [[D-brane]]s.  There it is realized as the motion of an [[NS5-brane]] which is conjectured to preserve the universality class.

Six nontrivial anomalies may be computed on both sides of the duality, and they agree as they must in accordance with [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s [[anomaly matching condition]]s. The role of the additional fundamental meson superfield M in the dual theory is very crucial in matching the anomalies. The global gravitational anomalies also match up as the parity of the number of chiral fields is the same in both theories. The R-charge of the Weyl fermion in a chiral superfield is one less than the R-charge of the superfield. The R-charge of a gaugino is +1.

| &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Another evidence for Seiberg duality comes from identifying the superconformal index, which is a generalization of the [[Witten index]], for the electric and the magnetic phase. The identification gives rise to complicated integral identities which have been studied in the mathematical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan et al., Applications of the Superconformal Index for Protected Operators and q-Hypergeometric Identities to N=1 Dual Theories, Nucl.Phys. B818 (2009) 137-178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

Seiberg duality has been generalized in many directions.  One generalization applies to [[quiver diagram|quiver gauge theories]], in which the [[flavor symmetry|flavor symmetries]] are also gauged.  The simplest of these is a super QCD with the flavor group gauged and an additional term in the [[superpotential]].  It leads to a series of Seiberg dualities known as a [[duality cascade]].  It was introduced by [[Matthew Strassler]] and [[Igor Klebanov]] in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0007191 Supergravity and a Confining Gauge Theory: Duality Cascades and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;SB-Resolution of Naked Singularities].

It is not known whether Seiberg duality exists in 3-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories with only 4 supercharges, although a conjecture has appeared in [https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4924 Fractional M2-branes] in some special cases with [[Chern–Simons theory|Chern–Simons]] terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1429">'''Soundness''' is a property of [[interactive proof system]]s that requires that no prover can make the verifier accept for a wrong statement &lt;math&gt;y \not\in L&lt;/math&gt; except with some small probability. The upper bound of this probability is referred to as the soundness error of a proof system.

More formally, for every prover &lt;math&gt;(\tilde{\mathcal{P}})&lt;/math&gt;, and every &lt;math&gt;y \not\in L&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\Pr[(\perp,(\text{accept}))\gets (\tilde{\mathcal{P}})(y) \leftrightarrow (\mathcal{V})(y)] &lt; \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
As long as the soundness error is bounded by a polynomial fraction of the potential running time of the verifier (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\leq1/\mathrm{poly}(|y|)&lt;/math&gt;), it is always possible to amplify soundness until the soundness error becomes [[negligible|negligible function]] relative to the running time of the verifier. This is achieved by repeating the proof and accepting only if all proofs verify. After &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; repetitions, a soundness error &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; will be reduced to &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^\ell&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Oded|last=Goldreich|authorlink=Oded Goldreich|title=Zero-Knowledge twenty years after its invention|year=2002|id={{ECCC|2002|02|063}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ==CDF method== will do this later --&gt;
In [[probability theory]], it is possible to approximate the [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of a function ''f'' of a [[random variable]] ''X'' using [[Taylor expansion]]s, provided that ''f'' is sufficiently differentiable and that the moments of ''X'' are finite.  
&lt;!--
::{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = \operatorname{E}\left[X\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt; = \operatorname{var}\left[X\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}--&gt;

==First moment==
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}\left[f(X)\right] &amp; {} = \operatorname{E}\left[f\left(\mu_X + \left(X - \mu_X\right)\right)\right] \\
&amp; {} \approx \operatorname{E}\left[f(\mu_X) + f'(\mu_X)\left(X-\mu_X\right) + \frac{1}{2}f''(\mu_X) \left(X - \mu_X\right)^2 \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;E[X-\mu_X]=0,&lt;/math&gt; the second term disappears. Also &lt;math&gt;E[(X-\mu_X)^2]&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X^2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left[f(X)\right]\approx f(\mu_X) +\frac{f''(\mu_X)}{2}\sigma_X^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_X&lt;/math&gt; are the mean and variance of X respectively.&lt;ref name="Benaroya"&gt;Haym Benaroya, Seon Mi Han, and Mark Nagurka. ''Probability Models in Engineering and Science''. CRC Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to generalize this to functions of more than one variable using [[Taylor expansion#Taylor series in several variables|multivariate Taylor expansions]]. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left[\frac{X}{Y}\right]\approx\frac{\operatorname{E}\left[X\right]}{\operatorname{E}\left[Y\right]} -\frac{\operatorname{cov}\left[X,Y\right]}{\operatorname{E}\left[Y\right]^2}+\frac{\operatorname{E}\left[X\right]}{\operatorname{E}\left[Y\right]^3}\operatorname{var}\left[Y\right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Second moment==
Similarly,&lt;ref name="Benaroya" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}\left[f(X)\right]\approx \left(f'(\operatorname{E}\left[X\right])\right)^2\operatorname{var}\left[X\right] = \left(f'(\mu_X)\right)^2\sigma^2_X&lt;/math&gt;

The above is using a first order approximation unlike for the method used in estimating the first moment. It will be a poor approximation in cases where &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is highly non-linear. This is a special case of the [[delta method]]. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}\left[\frac{X}{Y}\right]\approx\frac{\operatorname{var}\left[X\right]}{\operatorname{E}\left[Y\right]^2}-\frac{2\operatorname{E}\left[X\right]}{\operatorname{E}\left[Y\right]^3}\operatorname{cov}\left[X,Y\right]+\frac{\operatorname{E}\left[X\right]^2}{\operatorname{E}\left[Y\right]^4}\operatorname{var}\left[Y\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The second order approximation is&lt;ref name="HendebyGustafsson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendeby|first1=Gustaf|last2=Gustafsson|first2=Fredrik|title=ON NONLINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS OF GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS|url=http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/fredrik/reports/07SSPut.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}\left[f(X)\right]\approx \left(f'(\operatorname{E}\left[X\right])\right)^2\operatorname{var}\left[X\right] - \frac{\left(f''(\operatorname{E}\left[X\right])\right)^2}{4}\left(\operatorname{var}\left[X\right]\right)^2 = \left(f'(\mu_X)\right)^2\sigma^2_X - \frac{1}{4}\left(f''(\mu_X)\right)^2\sigma_X^4&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computer programming]], a '''variable''' or '''scalar''' is a storage location (identified by a [[Memory address|memory address]]) paired with an associated [[symbol|symbolic name]] (an ''[[Identifier (computer programming)|identifier]]''), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a ''[[value (computer science)|value]]''. The variable name is the usual way to [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer [[source code]] can be [[Name binding|bound]] to a [[Value (computer science)|value]] during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of [[Execution (computing)|program execution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=[[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]] | pages=26-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald |date=1997 |title=The Art of Computer Programming |volume=1 |edition=3rd |location=Reading, Massachusetts |publisher=Addison-Wesley |page=3-4 |isbn=0-201-89683-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables in mathematics]]. The latter is [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]], having no reference to a physical object such as storage location. The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an [[equation]] or [[formula]] as in mathematics. Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.

A variable's storage location may be referred by several different identifiers, a situation known as [[Aliasing_(computing)|aliasing]]. Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through the other identifiers.

[[compiler (computing)|Compilers]] have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be changed during program execution.

==Actions on a variable==
In [[imperative programming|imperative]] [[programming language]]s, values can generally be [[Dereference|accessed]] or [[Assignment (computer science)|changed]] at any time. In [[Pure function|pure]] [[functional programming|functional]] and [[logic programming|logic language]]s, variables are [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] to expressions and keep a single value during their entire [[Scope (programming)|lifetime]] due to the requirements of [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. In imperative languages, the same behavior is exhibited by (named) [[constant (programming)|constant]]s (symbolic constants), which are typically contrasted with (normal) variables.

Depending on the [[type system]] of a programming language, variables may only be able to store a specified [[datatype]] (e.g. [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] or [[string (computer science)|string]]). Alternatively, a datatype may be associated only with the current value, allowing a single variable to store anything supported by the programming language.

Variables and scope:-
(A)	Automatic variables: - Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called, and disappears when the function is exited. Such variables are known as automatic variables. 
(B)	External variables: - These are variables that are external to a function on and can be accessed by name by any function. These variables remain in existence permanently; rather that appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned.

==Identifiers referencing a variable==

An identifier referencing a variable can be used to access the variable in order to read out the value, or alter the value, or edit other [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of the variable, such as access permission, [[Lock (computer science)|locks]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], etc.

For instance, a variable might be referenced by the identifier "&lt;code&gt;totalcows&lt;/code&gt;" and the variable can contain the number 1956.  If the same variable is referenced by the identifier "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;" as well, and if using this identifier "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;", the value of the variable is altered to 2009, then reading the value using the identifier "&lt;code&gt;total_count&lt;/code&gt;" will yield a result of 2009 and not 1956.

If a variable is only referenced by a single identifier that can simply be called ''the name of the variable''. Otherwise, we can speak of ''one of the names of the variable''.  For instance, in the previous example, the "&lt;code&gt;total cows&lt;/code&gt;" is a name of the variable in question, and "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;" is another name of the same variable.

== {{Anchor|Scope and extent|SCOPE-AND-EXTENT}}Scope and extent ==
{{See also|Free variables and bound variables}}

The ''[[scope (programming)|scope]]'' of a variable describes where in a program's text the variable may be used, while the ''extent'' (or ''lifetime'') describes when in a program's execution a variable has a (meaningful) value. The scope of a variable is actually a property of the name of the variable, and the extent is a property of the variable itself. These should not be confused with ''context'' (also called ''environment''), which is a property of the program, and varies by point in the source code or execution – see [[Scope (computer science)#Overview|scope: overview]]. Further, [[object lifetime]] may coincide with variable lifetime, but in many cases is not tied to variable lifetime.

A variable name's ''scope'' affects its ''extent''.

''Scope'' is an important part of the [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] of a variable. Most languages define a specific ''scope'' for each variable (as well as any other named entity), which may differ within a given program. The scope of a variable is the portion of the program code for which the variable's name has meaning and for which the variable is said to be "visible". Entrance into that scope typically begins a variable's lifetime (as it comes into context) and exit from that scope typically ends its lifetime (as it goes out of context). For instance, a variable with "[[lexical scope]]" is meaningful only within a certain function/[[subroutine]], or more finely within a block of expressions/statements (accordingly with [[function scope]] or [[block scope]]); this is static resolution, performable at parse-time or compile-time. Alternatively, a variable with [[dynamic scope]] is resolved at run-time, based on a global binding stack that depends on the specific control flow. Variables only accessible within a certain functions are termed "[[local variable]]s". A "[[global variable]]", or one with indefinite scope, may be referred to anywhere in the program.

''Extent'', on the other hand, is a runtime ([[Dynamic variable scoping#Dynamic scoping|dynamic]]) aspect of a variable. Each [[name binding|binding]] of a variable to a value can have its own ''extent'' at runtime. The extent of the binding is the portion of the program's execution time during which the variable continues to refer to the same value or memory location. A running program may enter and leave a given extent many times, as in the case of a [[closure (computer science)|closure]].

Unless the programming language features [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], a variable whose extent permanently outlasts its scope can result in a [[memory leak]], whereby the memory allocated for the variable can never be freed since the variable which would be used to reference it for deallocation purposes is no longer accessible. However, it can be permissible for a variable binding to extend beyond its scope, as occurs in Lisp [[closure (computer science)|closures]] and C [[static local variable]]s; when execution passes back into the variable's scope, the variable may once again be used. A variable whose scope begins before its extent does is said to be ''[[uninitialized variable|uninitialized]]'' and often has an undefined, arbitrary value if accessed (see [[wild pointer]]), since it has yet to be explicitly given a particular value. A variable whose extent ends before its scope may become a [[dangling pointer]] and deemed uninitialized once more since its value has been destroyed. Variables described by the previous two cases may be said to be ''out of extent'' or ''unbound''. In many languages, it is an error to try to use the value of a variable when it is out of extent. In other languages, doing so may yield [[undefined behavior|unpredictable results]]. Such a variable may, however, be assigned a new value, which gives it a new extent.

For space efficiency, a memory space needed for a variable may be allocated only when the variable is first used and freed when it is no longer needed. A variable is only needed when it is in scope, thus beginning each variable's lifetime when it enters scope may give space to unused variables. To avoid wasting such space, compilers often warn programmers if a variable is declared but not used.

It is considered good programming practice to make the scope of variables as narrow as feasible so that different parts of a program do not accidentally interact with each other by modifying each other's variables. Doing so also prevents [[action at distance (computer science)|action at a distance]].  Common techniques for doing so are to have different sections of a program use different [[namespace (programming)|name space]]s, or to make individual variables "private" through either [[Dynamic variable scoping#Dynamic scoping|dynamic variable scoping]] or [[Lexical variable scoping#Static scoping|lexical variable scoping]].

Many programming languages employ a reserved value (often named ''[[null pointer|null]]'' or ''nil'') to indicate an invalid or uninitialized variable.

==Typing==
{{Main|Type system}}
{{See also|Datatype}}
In [[static typing|statically typed]] languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[ML programming language|ML]], a variable also has a ''type'', meaning that only certain kinds of values can be stored in it. For example, a variable of type "[[integer (computer science)|integer]]" is prohibited from storing text values.

In [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], it is values, not variables, which carry type. In [[Common Lisp]], both situations exist simultaneously: A variable is given a type (if undeclared, it is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, the universal [[Subtype|supertype]]) which exists at compile time. Values also have types, which can be checked and queried at runtime.

Typing of variables also allows [[type polymorphism|polymorphisms]] to be resolved at compile time. However, this is different from the polymorphism used in object-oriented function calls (referred to as ''[[virtual functions]]'' in [[C++]]) which resolves the call based on the value type as opposed to the supertypes the variable is allowed to have.

Variables often store simple data, like integers and literal strings, but some programming languages allow a variable to store values of other [[datatype]]s as well. Such languages may also enable functions to be [[Parametric polymorphism#Parametric polymorphism|parametric polymorphic]]. These functions operate like variables to represent data of multiple types. For example, a function named &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; may determine the length of a list. Such a &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; function may be parametric polymorphic by including a type variable in its [[type signature]], since the amount of elements in the list is independent of the elements' types.

==Parameters==
The ''formal parameters'' (or ''formal arguments'') of functions are also referred to as variables. For instance, in this [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code segment,

&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def addtwo(x):
...     return x + 2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; addtwo(5)
7
&lt;/source&gt;

the variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a ''[[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]'' because it is given a value when the function is called.  The integer 5 is the ''argument'' which gives &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; its value. In most languages, function parameters have local scope. This specific variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; can only be referred to within the &lt;code&gt;addtwo&lt;/code&gt; function (though of course other functions can also have variables called &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;).

==Memory allocation==
The specifics of variable allocation and the representation of their values vary widely, both among programming languages and among implementations of a given language. Many language implementations allocate space for ''[[local variable]]s'', whose extent lasts for a single function call on the ''[[call stack]]'', and whose memory is automatically reclaimed when the function returns. More generally, in ''[[name binding]]'', the name of a variable is bound to the address of some particular block (contiguous sequence) of bytes in memory, and operations on the variable manipulate that block. [[reference (computer science)|Referencing]] is more common for variables whose values have large or unknown sizes when the code is compiled. Such variables reference the location of the value instead of storing the value itself, which is allocated from a pool of memory called the ''[[Dynamic memory allocation#Heap-based memory allocation|heap]]''.

Bound variables have values. A value, however, is an abstraction, an idea; in implementation, a value is represented by some ''[[Object (computer science)|data object]]'', which is stored somewhere in computer memory. The program, or the [[runtime environment]], must set aside memory for each data object and, since memory is finite, ensure that this memory is yielded for reuse when the object is no longer needed to represent some variable's value.

Objects allocated from the heap must be reclaimed&amp;mdash;especially when the objects are no longer needed. In a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] language (such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Python, Golang and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]), the runtime environment automatically reclaims objects when extant variables can no longer refer to them. In non-garbage-collected languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], the program (and the programmer) must explicitly [[malloc|allocate]] memory, and then later free it, to reclaim its memory. Failure to do so leads to [[memory leak]]s, in which the heap is depleted as the program runs, risks eventual failure from exhausting available memory.

When a variable refers to a [[data structure]] created dynamically, some of its components may be only indirectly accessed through the variable. In such circumstances, garbage collectors (or analogous program features in languages that lack garbage collectors) must deal with a case where only a portion of the memory reachable from the variable needs to be reclaimed.

==Naming conventions==
{{Main|Naming conventions (programming)}}
{{See also|Identifier|Namespace}}

Unlike their mathematical counterparts, programming variables and constants commonly take multiple-character names, e.g. &lt;code&gt;COST&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;. Single-character names are most commonly used only for auxiliary variables; for instance, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; for [[array index]] variables.

Some naming conventions are enforced at the language level as part of the language syntax which involves the format of valid identifiers. In almost all languages, variable names cannot start with a digit (0–9) and cannot contain whitespace characters. Whether or not punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the [[underscore]] ("_") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]]s (symbols or punctuation) are affixed to variable identifiers to indicate the variable's datatype or scope.

[[Case-sensitivity]] of variable names also varies between languages and some languages require the use of a certain case in naming certain entities;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] requires that names of types start with a capital letter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern languages are case-sensitive; some older languages are not. Some languages reserve certain forms of variable names for their own internal use; in many languages, names beginning with two underscores ("__") often fall under this category.

However, beyond the basic restrictions imposed by a language, the naming of variables is largely a matter of style. At the [[machine code]] level, variable names are not used, so the exact names chosen do not matter to the computer. Thus names of variables identify them, for the rest they are just a tool for programmers to make programs easier to write and understand. Using poorly chosen variable names can make code more difficult to review than non-descriptive names, so names which are clear are often encouraged.&lt;ref name="Choosing good variable names"&gt;[http://www.dotcadot.ca/articles/how-not-pick-variables How Not To Pick Variables], Retrieved July 11, 2012 [DEAD LINK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EWD1044"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Edsger Dijkstra]] | title = To hell with “meaningful identifiers”! | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1044.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers often create and adhere to code style guidelines which offer guidance on naming variables or impose a precise naming scheme. Shorter names are faster to type but are less descriptive; longer names often make programs easier to read and the purpose of variables easier to understand. However, extreme verbosity in variable names can also lead to less comprehensible code.

==Variable types(based on lifetime)==
In terms of the classifications of variables, we can classify variables based on the lifetime of them. The different types of variables are static, stack-dynamic, explicit heap-dynamic, and implicit heap-dynamic. A static variable is also known as global variable, it is bound to a memory cell before execution begins and remains to the same memory cell until termination. A typical example is the static variables in C and C++. A Stack-dynamic variable is known as local variable, which is bound when the declaration statement is executed, and it is deallocated when the procedure returns. The main examples are local variables in C subprograms and Java methods. Explicit Heap-Dynamic variables are nameless (abstract) memory cells that are allocated and deallocated by explicit run-time instructions specified by the programmer. The main examples are dynamic objects in C++ (via new and delete) and all objects in Java. Implicit Heap-Dynamic variables are bound to heap storage only when they are assigned values. Allocation and release occur when values are reassigned to variables. As a result, Implicit heap-dynamic variables have the highest degree of flexibility. The main examples are some variables in JavaScript, PHP and all variables in APL.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Virasoro algebra''' (named after the physicist [[Miguel Ángel Virasoro (physicist)|Miguel Angel Virasoro]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. A. Virasoro |year=1970 |title=Subsidiary conditions and ghosts in dual-resonance models |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=2933|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.1.2933|bibcode = 1970PhRvD...1.2933V }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a complex [[Lie algebra]], the unique [[Lie algebra extension#Central|central extension]] of the [[Witt algebra]]. It is widely used in [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] and in [[string theory]].

== Definition ==
The '''Virasoro algebra''' is [[linear span|spanned]] by '''generators''' {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{math|''n'' ∈ ℤ}} and the '''[[central charge]]''' {{mvar|c}}.
These generators satisfy &lt;math&gt;[c,L_n]=0&lt;/math&gt; and 
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt;[L_m,L_n]=(m-n)L_{m+n}+\frac{c}{12}(m^3-m)\delta_{m+n,0}&lt;/math&gt; .

The factor of   {{Fraction|1|12}}  is merely a matter of convention. For a derivation of the algebra as the unique central extension of the [[Witt algebra]], see [[Lie algebra extension#Virasoro algebra|derivation of the Virasoro algebra]].

==Representation theory==

===Lowest weight representations===
A '''lowest weight representation''' of the Virasoro algebra is a representation generated by a '''primary state''': a vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt; L_{n&gt;0} v = 0 \quad , \quad  L_0 v = hv \ ,&lt;/math&gt; 
where the number {{mvar|h}} called the '''conformal dimension''' or '''conformal weight''' of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

A lowest weight representation is spanned by eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;. The eigenvalues take the form &lt;math&gt;h+N&lt;/math&gt;, where the integer &lt;math&gt;N\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''level''' of the corresponding eigenstate. 

More precisely, a lowest weight representation is spanned by &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;-eigenstates of the type &lt;math&gt;L_{-n_1}L_{-n_2}\cdots L_{-n_k}v&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;n_1\leq n_2\leq \cdots n_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, whose levels are &lt;math&gt;N=\sum_{i=1}^k n_i&lt;/math&gt;. Any state whose level is not zero is called a '''descendant state''' of {{mvar|v}}.

For any pair of complex numbers {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}}, the [[Verma module]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V_{c,h}&lt;/math&gt; is 
the largest possible lowest weight representation. (The same letter, {{mvar|c}}, is used for both the element {{mvar|c}} of the Virasoro algebra and its eigenvalue in a representation.) 

The states &lt;math&gt;L_{-n_1}L_{-n_2}\cdots L_{-n_k}v&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;n_1\leq n_2\leq \cdots n_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of the Verma module. The Verma module is indecomposable, and for generic values of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}} it is also irreducible. When it is reducible, there exist other lowest weight representations with these values of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}}, called '''degenerate representations''', which are cosets of the Verma module. In particular,
the unique irreducible lowest weight representation with these values of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}} is the quotient of the Verma module by its maximal submodule.

A Verma module is irreducible if and only if it has no singular vectors.

===Singular vectors===
A '''singular vector''' or '''null vector''' of a lowest weight representation is a state that is both descendent and primary. 

A sufficient condition for the Verma module &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V_{c,h}&lt;/math&gt; to have a singular vector at the level {{mvar|N}} is &lt;math&gt;h=h_{r,s}(c)&lt;/math&gt; for some positive integers {{math|''r,s''}} such that {{mvar|N}}={{math|''rs''}}, with
:&lt;math&gt; h_{r,s}(c) = \frac14\Big((b+b^{-1})^2 - (br + b^{-1}s)^2\Big)\ ,\quad \text{where} \quad c=1+6(b+b^{-1})^2\ . &lt;/math&gt;
In particular, &lt;math&gt; h_{1,1}(c) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the reducible Verma module &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V_{c,0}&lt;/math&gt; has a singular vector &lt;math&gt; L_{-1}v &lt;/math&gt; at the level {{mvar|N}}=1. Then &lt;math&gt; h_{2,1}(c) = -\frac12 - \frac34 b^2 &lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding reducible Verma module has a singular vector &lt;math&gt; (L_{-1}^2 + b^2 L_{-2})v &lt;/math&gt; at the level {{mvar|N}}=2.

===Hermitian form and unitarity===
A lowest weight representation with a real value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; has a unique [[Hermitian form]] such that the adjoint of &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L_{-n}&lt;/math&gt;, and the norm of the primary state is one.
The representation is called '''unitary''' if that Hermitian form is positive definite. 
Since any singular vector has zero norm, all unitary lowest weight representations are irreducible. 

The [[Gram determinant]] of a basis of the level &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is given by the '''Kac determinant formula''', 
:&lt;math&gt;  A_N\prod_{1\le r,s\le N}(h-h_{r,s}(c))^{p(N-rs)} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the function ''p''(''N'') is the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]], and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is some constant. 
The Kac determinant formula was stated by [[V. Kac]] (1978), and its first published proof was given by Feigin and Fuks (1984).

The irreducible lowest weight representation with values  {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}} is unitary  if and only if either {{mvar|c}} ≥1 and  {{mvar|h}}≥0, or {{mvar|c}} is one of the values
:&lt;math&gt; c = 1-{6\over m(m+1)} = 0,\quad 1/2,\quad 7/10,\quad 4/5,\quad 6/7,\quad 25/28, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
for ''m'' = 2, 3, 4, ...,  and ''h'' is one of the values 
:&lt;math&gt; h = h_{r,s}(c) = {((m+1)r-ms)^2-1 \over 4m(m+1)}&lt;/math&gt;
for ''r'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., ''m''&amp;minus;1 and ''s''= 1, 2, 3, ..., ''r''.

[[Daniel Friedan]], Zongan Qiu, and [[Stephen Shenker]] (1984) showed that these conditions are necessary, and [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], Adrian Kent, and [[David Olive]] (1986) used the [[coset construction]] or [[GKO construction]] (identifying unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra within tensor products of unitary representations of affine [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s) to show that they are sufficient.

==Applications==

===Conformal field theory===
In two dimensions, the algebra of local [[conformal map|conformal transformations]] is made of two copies of the [[Witt algebra]].
It follows that the symmetry algebra of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] is the Virasoro algebra. Technically, the [[conformal bootstrap]] approach to two-dimensional CFT relies on [[Virasoro conformal block|Virasoro conformal blocks]], special functions that include and generalize the characters of representations of the Virasoro algebra.

===String theory===
Since the Virasoro algebra comprises the generators of the conformal group of the [[worldsheet]], the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress tensor]] in [[string theory]] obeys the commutation relations of (two copies of) the Virasoro algebra.  This is because the conformal group decomposes into separate diffeomorphisms of the forward and back lightcones.  Diffeomorphism invariance of the worldsheet implies additionally that the stress tensor vanishes.  This is known as the [[Virasoro constraint]], and in the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], cannot be applied to all the states in the theory, but rather only on the physical states (compare [[Gupta–Bleuler formalism]]).

==Generalizations==
{{see also|Super Virasoro algebra}}
There are two [[Lie superalgebra|supersymmetric N=1 extensions]] of the Virasoro algebra, called the [[Neveu-Schwarz algebra]] and the [[Ramond algebra]]. Their theory is similar to that of the Virasoro algebra, now involving [[Grassmann number]]s. There are further extensions of these algebras with more supersymmetry, such as the [[N = 2 superconformal algebra]].

The Virasoro algebra is a central extension of the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields on a genus 0 Riemann surface that are holomorphic except at two fixed points. 
I V  Krichever and S P Novikov (1987) found a central extension of the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields on a higher genus compact Riemann surface  that are holomorphic except at two fixed points, and their analysis has been extended to supermanifolds by J Rabin (1995).

The Virasoro algebra also has [[Vertex Operator Algebra|vertex algebraic]] and [[Lie conformal algebra|conformal algebraic]] counterparts, which basically come from arranging all the basis elements into generating series and working with single objects. Unsurprisingly these are called the vertex Virasoro and conformal Virasoro algebras respectively.

The Virasoro algebra may also be specified as a [[Presentation of a group|presentation]].  This is to say that all of its generators may be determined recursively ("generated") out of merely '''two''' judiciously chosen generators (e.g. {{mvar|L}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and {{mvar|L}}&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;), and six equations (constraint conditions) among them, by systematic use of the [[Jacobi identity]].  (D Fairlie, J Nuyts, and C Zachos, 1988. Shortly thereafter, J Uretsky discovered the original 8 conditions could be pared down to six.)

Correspondingly, for the [[super Virasoro algebra]] extension, the Ramond algebra follows from two generating generators and five conditions; and the Neveu-Schwarz algebra out of two such and nine conditions.

==History&lt;!--'Virasoro operator' and 'Virasoro operators' redirect here--&gt;==
The Witt algebra (the Virasoro algebra without the central extension) was discovered by [[É. Cartan]] (1909). Its analogues over finite fields were studied by [[E. Witt]] in about the 1930s. The central extension of the Witt algebra that gives the Virasoro algebra was first found (in characteristic ''p''&amp;gt;0) by [[R. E. Block]] (1966, page 381) and independently rediscovered (in characteristic 0) by [[I. M. Gelfand]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Fuchs{{!}}D. B. Fuchs|de|3=Dmitry Borisovich Fuchs}} (1968). Virasoro (1970) wrote down some operators generating the Virasoso algebra (later known as the '''Virasoro operators'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) while studying [[dual resonance model]]s, though  he did not find the central extension.  The central extension giving the Virasoro algebra was rediscovered in physics shortly after by J. H. Weis, according to Brower and Thorn (1971, footnote on page 167).
