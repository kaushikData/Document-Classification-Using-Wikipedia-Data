'''Attribution of recent climate change''' is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent [[climate change]]s on [[Earth]], commonly known as '[[global warming]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html|title=NASA - What's in a Name? Global Warming vs. Climate Change|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of [[instrumental temperature record]], particularly in the last 50 years. This is the period when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the [[troposphere|atmosphere above the surface]] have become available. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), it is "extremely likely"&lt;ref&gt;The IPCC defines "extremely likely" as indicating a probability of 95 to 100%, based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence. {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}, Section: [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf Summary for Policymakers (finalized version)], page 4, footnote 2.
&lt;/ref&gt; that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}, Section: [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf Summary for Policymakers (finalized version)], Chapter: D.3 Detection and Attribution of Climate Change, page 17.  &lt;/ref&gt; The best estimate is that observed warming since 1951 has been entirely human caused.&lt;ref&gt;"The likely range of the human contribution to the global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2010 is 1.1° to 1.4°F (0.6° to 0.8°C), and the central estimate of the observed warming of 1.2°F (0.65°C) lies within this range (high confidence). This translates to a likely human contribution of 93%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 change." [https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/3/ Chapter 3: Detection and Attribution of Climate Change], ''Climate Science Special Report '', U.S. Global Change Research Program. &lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, chapter "[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-7.html 9.7  Combining Evidence of Anthropogenic Climate Change]"&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] concentrations of [[greenhouse gas]]es
* global changes to land surface, such as [[deforestation]]
* increasing atmospheric concentrations of [[aerosol]]s.
In addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause [[climate change]], including for example, [[climate oscillation]]s, changes in [[Solar activity and climate|solar activity]], and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Multiple lines of evidence support attribution of recent climate change to human activities:&lt;ref name="epa endangerment fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100BVZS.txt|title=EPA's Endangerment Finding Climate Change Facts|last=&lt;!--not specified--&gt;|first=|date=2009|website=National Service Center for Environmental Publications (NSCEP)|at=|format=|id=Report ID: 430F09086|access-date=22 December 2017}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* A basic [[physics|physical]] understanding of the [[climate]] system: greenhouse gas concentrations have increased and their warming properties are well-established.
* Historical estimates of past climate changes suggest that the recent changes in global surface temperature are unusual.
* Computer-based [[climate model]]s are unable to replicate the observed warming unless human greenhouse gas emissions are included.
* Natural forces alone (such as solar and volcanic activity) cannot explain the observed warming.

The IPCC's attribution of recent global warming to human activities is a view shared by the scientific community,&lt;ref name=nrc2001&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|7|date=November 2012}} A forcing is something that is imposed externally on the climate system. External forcings include natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun's output.&lt;ref&gt;Le Treut ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1.html Chapter 1: Historical Overview of Climate Change Science], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-1-1.html FAQ 1.1, What Factors Determine Earth's Climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of how various factors alter the [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Forster ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2.html Chapter 2: Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and Radiative Forcing], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1.html FAQ 2.1, How do Human Activities Contribute to Climate Change and How do They Compare with Natural Influences?] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A positive radiative forcing will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] ([[chemical formula]]: {{CO2}}) led to a positive radiative forcing, averaged over the Earth's [[surface area]], of about 1.66 [[watt]]s per square metre (abbreviated W&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="ipcc radiative forcing"&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spm.html Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change], Figure SPM.2, in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate feedbacks can either amplify or dampen the response of the climate to a given forcing.&lt;ref name=nrc2008/&gt;{{Rp|7|date=November 2012}}
There are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify (a [[positive feedback]]) or diminish (a [[negative feedback]]) the effects of a change in climate forcing.

The climate system will vary in response to changes in forcings.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The climate system will show internal variability both in the presence and absence of forcings imposed on it, (see images opposite). This internal variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the atmosphere and [[ocean]] (see also the later section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Internal climate variability and global warming|Internal climate variability and global warming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Albritton ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/010.htm Technical Summary], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/011.htm#box1 Box 1: What drives changes in climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of internal variability is the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].

==Detection vs. attribution==
[[File:Detection and attribution of climate change (NOAA NCDC).png|thumb |right |425px|alt=Refer to caption and adjacent text|In detection and attribution, the natural factors considered usually include changes in the [[insolation|Sun's output]] and [[volcanic]] eruptions, as well as natural modes of variability such as [[ENSO|El Niño]] and La Niña.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/439.htm Chapter 12: Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211 Section 12.1.1: The Meaning of Detection and Attribution], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of a climate signal does not always imply significant attribution. The IPCC's [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] says "it is ''extremely likely'' that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750," where "extremely likely" indicates a probability greater than 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, chapter "[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-6.html TS.6 Robust Findings and Key Uncertainties]"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Detection'' of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is [[Statistical significance|statistically significantly]] different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.

''Attribution'' requires demonstrating that a signal is:
* unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;
* consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing
* not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-accuracy measurements of atmospheric {{CO2}} concentration, initiated by [[Charles David Keeling]] in 1958, constitute the master time series documenting the changing composition of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="le treut 2007 co2 fingerprint"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These data have iconic status in climate change science as evidence of the effect of human activities on the chemical composition of the global atmosphere.&lt;ref name="le treut 2007 co2 fingerprint"/&gt;

Along with {{CO2}}, [[methane]] and to a lesser extent [[nitrous oxide]] are also major forcing contributors to the [[greenhouse effect]]. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] lists these together with [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFCs), [[Fluorocarbon|perfluorocarbons]] (PFCs), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;{{Cite web

====Water vapor====
[[File:Greenhouse Gas by Sector.png|thumb|350px|alt=Refer to adjacent text|Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 3.2, fast track 2000 project]]

Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and is the largest contributor to the natural greenhouse effect, despite having a short atmospheric lifetime&lt;ref name="epa role of greenhouse gases"/&gt; (about 10 days).&lt;ref name="rc_wv"&gt;{{Cite web
|url = http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=142

|last = Schmidt | first = Gavin A. | authorlink = Gavin Schmidt
|date = 6 April 2005 |work =
|publisher = [[RealClimate]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some human activities can influence local water vapor levels. However, on a global scale, the concentration of water vapor is controlled by temperature, which influences overall rates of [[evaporation]] and [[precipitation]].&lt;ref name="epa role of greenhouse gases"/&gt; Therefore, the global concentration of water vapor is not substantially affected by direct human emissions.&lt;ref name="epa role of greenhouse gases"/&gt;

===Land use===
Climate change is attributed to [[land use]] for two main reasons. Between 1750 and 2007, about two-thirds of anthropogenic [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions were produced from burning fossil fuels, and about one-third of emissions from changes in land use,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through [[slash and burn|biomass burning]] that frequently accompanies it.

A second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the [[albedo|terrestrial albedo]] is often altered by use, which leads to [[radiative forcing]]. This effect is more significant locally than globally.&lt;ref name="Technical Summary"/&gt;

====Livestock and land use====

[[File:Climate Change Attribution.png|250px |thumb |alt=Refer to caption |One [[global climate model]]'s reconstruction of temperature change during the 20th century as the result of five studied forcing factors and the amount of temperature change attributed to each.]]
Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This has led to increases in mean global temperature, or [[global warming]]. Other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate [[aerosol]]s are believed to have a cooling effect. Natural factors also contribute. According to the [[historical temperature record]] of the last century, the Earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 [[Plus-minus sign|±]] 0.18&amp;nbsp;°Celsius (1.3 ± 0.32&amp;nbsp;°Fahrenheit).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.ucar.edu/climate/faq/how-much-has-global-temperature-risen-last-100-years UCAR FAQ: How much has global temp. risen over the past 100 years?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] causes during the period of [[instrumental temperature record|instrumental record]]. In the 1995 [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]] (SAR), the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] made the widely quoted statement that "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate". The phrase "balance of evidence" suggested the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt". In 2001 the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] (TAR) refined this, saying "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities".&lt;ref name="WG1-2001-SPM"/&gt; The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) strengthened this finding:
* "Anthropogenic warming of the climate system is widespread and can be detected in temperature observations taken at the surface, in the free atmosphere and in the oceans. Evidence of the effect of external influences, both anthropogenic and natural, on the climate system has continued to accumulate since the TAR."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ts.html Technical Summary], [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf p. ?].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other findings of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report include:
*"It is ''extremely unlikely'' (&lt;5%)&lt;ref name="ar4 uncertainty"&gt;
In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the following scale is used to quantify uncertainty: "virtually certain" &gt;99%; "extremely likely" &gt;95%; "very likely" &gt;90%; "likely" &gt;66%; "more likely than not" &gt;50%; "about as likely as not" 33 to 66%; "unlikely" &lt;33%; "very unlikely" &lt;10%; "extremely unlikely" &lt;5%; "exceptionally unlikely" &lt;1%. {{citation

Over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65&amp;nbsp;°C (1.17&amp;nbsp;°F) at the Earth's surface (see [[historical temperature record]]). Among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. Current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably {{CO2}}, is mostly responsible for the observed warming. Evidence for this conclusion includes:
* Estimates of internal variability from climate models, and reconstructions of past temperatures, indicate that the warming is unlikely to be entirely natural.
* Climate models forced by natural factors ''and'' increased greenhouse gases and aerosols reproduce the observed global temperature changes; those forced by natural factors alone do not.&lt;ref name="WG1-2001-SPM"&gt;IPCC, [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm Summary for Policymakers].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Older data are insufficient to provide reliable hemispheric temperature estimates.&lt;ref name="noaa nh temp for last 1300 years"/&gt;]]
Recent scientific assessments find that most of the warming of the Earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Scientific literature and opinion|scientific literature and opinion]]). This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. Like the warming "signal" that has gradually emerged from the "noise" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. No single study is a "[[smoking gun]]." Nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.&lt;!-- Most of the preceding paragraph drawn from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like [[tree ring]]s and [[coral]]s) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier [[isotope]]s of [[oxygen]] in [[ice core]]s), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a [[current sea level rise|rise]] in global sea level, retreat of [[sea ice]] and [[snow]] cover, cooling of the [[stratosphere]], an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure patterns]]. These and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Those that only include natural influences (blue line, based on many models) show a slight cooling, which has not occurred.&lt;ref name="lindsey 20th century gmt simulations"/&gt; The ability of models to generate reasonable histories of global temperature is verified by their response to four 20th-century volcanic eruptions: each eruption caused brief cooling that appeared in observed as well as modeled records.&lt;ref name="lindsey 20th century gmt simulations"/&gt;]]

Finally, there is extensive [[statistical]] evidence from so-called "fingerprint" studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These projections have been confirmed by observations (shown above).&lt;ref name="schneider fingerprint"/&gt;}}
For example, when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Solar activity|solar activity]]). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]], which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, [[drought]], surface pressure, and the [[surface runoff|runoff]] from major [[river basin]]s.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies published after the appearance of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric [[moisture]] (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of [[Arctic sea ice]] extent, and in the patterns of changes in [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] surface temperatures.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in [[snowpack]], maximum and minimum ([[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]]) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over [[mountain]]ous regions of the [[western United States]]. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in [[hurricane]] formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. In the [[tropics]], all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the [[satellite]] and [[weather balloon]] data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Natural influences on temperature—El Niño, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols—have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C (0.4&amp;nbsp;°F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8&amp;nbsp;°C (1&amp;nbsp;°F) of warming since 1889.&lt;ref name="riebeek 20th century contributions"/&gt;]]

This does not mean, however, that all remaining differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hansen ''et al.'' (2012),&lt;ref name="climate dice"/&gt; the distribution of anomalies has shifted to the right as a consequence of global warming, meaning that unusually hot summers have become more common. This is analogous to the rolling of a dice: cool summers now cover only half of one side of a six-sided die, white covers one side, red covers four sides, and an extremely hot (red-brown) anomaly covers half of one side.&lt;ref name="climate dice"/&gt;]]

&lt;/ref&gt; stated that attributing individual extreme weather events to human activities was challenging. They were, however, more confident over attributing changes in long-term trends of extreme weather. For example, Seneviratne ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that human activities had likely led to a warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale.

Another way of viewing the problem is to consider the effects of human-induced climate change on the probability of future extreme weather events. Stott ''et al.'' (2003),&lt;ref name="stott 2003 european heat wave"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that human activities have greatly increased the risk of summertime heat waves. According to their analysis, the land area of the Earth affected by very hot summer temperature anomalies has greatly increased over time (refer to graphs on the left).

{{Main article|Scientific opinion on climate change}}

There are a number of examples of published and informal support for the consensus view. As mentioned earlier, the IPCC has concluded that most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is "very likely" due to human activities.&lt;ref name="ipcc 2007 attribution"&gt;

===Detection and attribution studies===
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007), concluded that attribution was possible for a number of observed changes in the climate (see [[effects of global warming]]). However, attribution was found to be more difficult when assessing changes over smaller regions (less than continental scale) and over short time periods (less than 50 years).&lt;ref name="hegerl 2007 executive summary"&gt;Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in
{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over larger regions, averaging reduces natural variability of the climate, making detection and attribution easier.

* In 1996, in a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled "A search for human influences on the thermal structure of the atmosphere", [[Benjamin D. Santer]] et al. wrote: "The observed spatial patterns of temperature change in the free atmosphere from 1963 to 1987 are similar to those predicted by state-of-the-art climate models incorporating various combinations of changes in carbon dioxide, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and stratospheric ozone concentrations. The degree of pattern similarity between models and observations increases through this period. It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities, although many uncertainties remain, particularly relating to estimates of natural variability."
* A 2002 paper in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' says "Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Tett SFB |authorlink1=Simon Tett |title=Estimation of natural and anthropogenic contributions to twentieth century temperature change |journal=J.

Thus, the recent research supports and strengthens the IPCC Third Assessment Report conclusion that 'most of the global warming over the past 50 years is likely due to the increase in greenhouse gases.'"
* Barnett and colleagues (2005) say that the observed warming of the oceans "cannot be explained by natural internal climate variability or solar and volcanic forcing, but is well simulated by two [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]ally forced climate models," concluding that "it is of human origin, a conclusion robust to observational sampling and model differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Barnett TP, Pierce DW, Achutarao KM |title=Penetration of human-induced warming into the world's oceans |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5732 |pages=284–7 |date=July 2005|pmid=15933161 | doi = 10.1126/science.1112418|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..284B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The 489 survey respondents—representing nearly half of all those eligible according to the survey's specific standards – work in academia, government, and industry, and are members of prominent professional organizations.&lt;ref name="Structure of Scientific Opinion on Climate Change"/&gt; The study found that 97% of the 489 scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century.&lt;ref name="Structure of Scientific Opinion on Climate Change"/&gt; Moreover, 84% agreed that "human-induced greenhouse warming" is now occurring."&lt;ref name="Structure of Scientific Opinion on Climate Change"/&gt; Only 5% disagreed with the idea that human activity is a significant cause of global warming.&lt;ref name="Structure of Scientific Opinion on Climate Change"/&gt;

As described above, a small minority of scientists do disagree with the consensus: see [[list of scientists opposing global warming consensus]]. For example, [[Willie Soon]] and [[Richard Lindzen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lindzen RS |title=Can increasing carbon dioxide cause climate change? |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=16 |pages=8335–42 |date=August 1997|pmid=11607742 |pmc=33750 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11607742 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8335|bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.8335L }}&lt;/ref&gt; say that there is insufficient proof for anthropogenic attribution.

==Solar activity==
[[File:Global surface temperature (top, blue) and the Sun's energy received at the top of Earth's atmosphere (red, bottom). Solar energy has been measured by satellites since 1978.gif|thumb|right|alt=Refer to caption|Solar radiation at the top of our atmosphere, and global temperature]]
[[File:Evidence of human-induced global warming - patterns of temperature change produced by various atmospheric factors, 1958-1999 (USGCRP).png|thumb|right|Modelled simulation of the effect of various factors (including GHGs, Solar irradiance) singly and in combination, showing in particular that solar activity produces a small and nearly uniform warming, unlike what is observed.]]
[[Solar sunspot maximum]] occurs when the magnetic field of the sun collapses and reverse as part of its average 11 year [[solar cycle]] (22 years for complete North to North restoration).

The role of the sun in recent climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. Since 1978, [[solar variation|output from the Sun]] has been measured by [[satellite]]s&lt;ref name=nrc2008/&gt;{{Rp|6|date=November 2012}} significantly more accurately than was previously possible from the surface. These measurements indicate that the Sun's total [[solar irradiance]] has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be directly attributed to an increase in total solar energy reaching the Earth (see graph above, left). In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and [[volcanic activity]] probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;Global Climate Change, in {{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in total solar irradiance and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. As has already been stated, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing had "very likely" caused most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. In making this conclusion, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in
{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of solar activity in climate change has also been calculated over [[paleoclimatology|longer time periods]] using "proxy" datasets, such as [[tree rings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Models indicate that solar and volcanic forcings can explain periods of relative warmth and cold between [[Anno Domini|A.D.]]&amp;nbsp;1000 and 1900, but human-induced forcings are needed to reproduce the late-20th century warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Models and observations (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming of the lower atmosphere at the surface (called the [[troposphere]]) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the [[stratosphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}. &lt;!-- Hegerl --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[ozone depletion|Depletion]] of the [[ozone layer]] by chemical [[refrigerant]]s has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming at the top of the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. [[Hadley cells]] are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Celeste M.

Than (2007) pointed to the view of [[Benny Peiser]], a [[social anthropologist]] at [[Liverpool John Moores University]] in the UK.&lt;ref name=than/&gt; In his [[newsletter]], Peiser had cited a [[blog]] that had commented on warming observed on several planetary bodies in the [[Solar system]].

In an e-mail interview with Than (2007), Peiser stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think it is an intriguing coincidence that warming trends have been observed on a number of very diverse planetary bodies in our solar system, (...) Perhaps this is just a fluke."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Than (2007) provided alternative explanations of why warming had occurred on Triton, Pluto, Jupiter and Mars.

&lt;/ref&gt; A number of commenters had argued that recent climate change could be attributed to changes in solar irradiance. According to the US EPA (2009), this attribution was not supported by the bulk of the [[scientific literature]]. Citing the work of the IPCC (2007), the US EPA pointed to the low contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Over this time period (1750 to 2005),&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spm.html Summary for Policymakers],
[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the estimated contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing was 5% the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (see graph opposite).

===Effect of cosmic rays===
[[Henrik Svensmark]] has suggested that the [[magnetic]] activity of the sun deflects [[cosmic ray]]s, and that this may influence the generation of [[cloud condensation nuclei]], and thereby have an effect on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The website [[ScienceDaily]] reported on a 2009 study that looked at how past changes in climate have been affected by the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/2006/090112183735.ojdq7esu.html|title=The earth's magnetic field impacts climate: Danish study |date=12 January 2009|publisher=SpaceDaily.com|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysicist Mads Faurschou Knudsen, who co-authored the study, stated that the study's results supported Svensmark's theory. The authors of the study also acknowledged that {{CO2}} plays an important role in climate change.

The view that cosmic rays could provide the mechanism by which changes in solar activity affect climate is not supported by the literature.&lt;ref name="epa cosmic rays"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; state:&lt;blockquote&gt;[..] the cosmic ray time series does not appear to correspond to global total cloud cover after 1991 or to global low-level cloud cover after 1994. Together with the lack of a proven physical mechanism and the plausibility of other causal factors affecting changes in cloud cover, this makes the association between galactic cosmic ray-induced changes in aerosol and cloud formation controversial&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; found no relation between warming in recent decades and cosmic rays. Pierce and Adams (2009)&lt;ref name="pierce adams 2009 cosmic rays"&gt;
Abstract, in {{harvnb|Pierce|Adams|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; used a model to simulate the effect of cosmic rays on cloud properties. They concluded that the hypothesized effect of cosmic rays was too small to explain recent climate change.&lt;ref name="pierce adams 2009 cosmic rays"/&gt; Pierce and Adams (2009)&lt;ref&gt;
paragraph 18, in: 6. Discussion, in {{harvnb|Pierce|Adams|2009|p=5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; noted that their findings did not rule out a possible connection between cosmic rays and climate change, and recommended further research.

Erlykin ''et al.'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Erlykin|others|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; found that the evidence showed that connections between solar variation and climate were more likely to be mediated by direct variation of insolation rather than cosmic rays, and concluded: "Hence within our assumptions, the effect of varying solar activity, either by direct solar irradiance or by varying cosmic ray rates, must be less than 0.07 °C since 1956, i.e. less than 14% of the observed global warming." Carslaw (2009)&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Carslaw|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Pittock (2009)&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pittock|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; review the recent and historical literature in this field and continue to find that the link between cosmic rays and climate is tenuous, though they encourage continued research. US EPA (2009)&lt;ref name="epa cosmic rays"/&gt; commented on research by Duplissy ''et al.'' (2009):&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Duplissy|others|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The CLOUD experiments at [[CERN]] are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment. We find that the Svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A round molding can also be referred to as a [[torus]].&lt;/ref&gt; in [[architecture]] it refers to a round or [[cornice]]d [[molding (decorative)|molding]] below the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] in a [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] or Roman [[Classical order#Doric order|Doric]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]; the word is a variant of boltel, which is probably the diminutive of bolt, the shaft of an [[arrow]] or [[javelin throw|javelin]]. A roving bowtell is one which passes up the side of a bench end and round a [[finial]], the term roving being applied to that which follows the line of a curve.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bowtell|volume=4|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox californium}}
'''Californium''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cf''' and [[atomic number]] 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding [[curium]] with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium-4]] [[ion]]s). It is an [[actinide]] element, the sixth [[transuranium element]] to be [[synthetic element|synthesized]], and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]] (after [[einsteinium]]). The element was named after the university and the state of [[California]].

Two [[Crystal structure|crystalline forms]] exist for californium under normal pressure: one above and one below {{convert|900|C|-1}}. A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. [[Compounds of californium]] are dominated by the +3 [[oxidation state]]. The most stable of californium's twenty known [[isotope]]s is californium-251, which has a [[half-life]] of 898&amp;nbsp;years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.{{efn|name=age of earth}} Californium-252, with a half-life of about 2.64&amp;nbsp;years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the United States and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in Russia.

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain [[isotopes of californium]] to emit [[neutron]]s. For example, californium can be used to help start up [[nuclear reactor]]s, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using [[neutron diffraction]] and [[neutron spectroscopy]].  Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; [[oganesson]] (element&amp;nbsp;118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with [[calcium-48]] ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of [[red blood cell]]s by [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulating]] in skeletal tissue.

== Characteristics ==

=== Physical properties ===
Californium is a silvery white [[actinide]] metal{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} with a [[melting point]] of {{convert|900|±|30|C|-1}} and an estimated [[boiling point]] of {{convert|1745|K|-1}}.{{sfn|Haire|2006|pp=1522–1523}} The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above {{convert|300|C|-1}} when exposed to a vacuum.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}} Below {{convert|51|K|C F|0|abbr=on}}&lt;!-- KEEP KELVIN --&gt; californium metal is either [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66&amp;nbsp;K it is [[antiferromagnetic]] (an intermediate state), and above {{convert|160|K|C F}}&lt;!-- KEEP IN KELVIN (−110&amp;nbsp;°C) --&gt; it is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1525}} It forms [[alloy]]s with [[lanthanide]] metals but little is known about them.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}}

The element has two [[Crystal structure|crystalline forms]] under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure: a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close-packed]] form dubbed alpha (α) and a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] form designated beta (β).{{efn|A double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) [[unit cell]] consists of two hexagonal close-packed structures that share a common hexagonal plane, giving dhcp an ABACABAC sequence.{{sfn|Szwacki|2010|p=80}} }} The α form exists below 600–800&amp;nbsp;°C with a density of 15.10&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the β form exists above 600–800&amp;nbsp;°C with a density of 8.74&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} At 48&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]] of pressure the β form changes into an [[orthorhombic crystal system]] due to delocalization of the atom's [[Electron shell|5f electrons]], which frees them to bond.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}{{efn|The three lower-mass transplutonium elements—[[americium]], [[curium]], and [[berkelium]]—require much less pressure to delocalize their 5f electrons.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}} }}

The [[bulk modulus]] of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is {{val|50|5|u=GPa}}, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70&amp;nbsp;GPa).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}

Californium exhibits oxidation states of 4, 3, or 2.  It typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements{{sfn|Seaborg|2004}} and the element [[dysprosium]], which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table.{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} Californium reacts when heated with [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], or a [[chalcogen]] (oxygen family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous [[mineral acid]]s are rapid.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} &lt;!-- EXPLAIN Only californium-249 is suitable for chemical study.&lt;ref name="Emeleus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emeleus|first=H. J.|title=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|page=33|year=1987|publisher=Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-023631-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; /EXPLAIN --&gt;

Californium is only [[aqueous solution|water-soluble]] as the californium(III) [[cation]].  Attempts to [[redox|reduce or oxidize]] the +3 ion in solution have failed.{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} The element forms a water-soluble [[chloride]], [[nitrate]], [[perchlorate]], and [[sulfate]] and is precipitated as a [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]], or [[hydroxide]].{{sfn|Seaborg|2004}} Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unusual structure, bonding and properties in a californium borate|journal = Nature Chemistry|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1755-4330|pages = 387–392|volume = 6|issue = 5|doi = 10.1038/nchem.1896|language = en|first = Matthew J.|last = Polinski|first2 = Edward B.

=== Isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of californium}}
Twenty [[radioisotope]]s of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium-251 with a [[half-life]] of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years.&lt;ref name="NNDC2008" /&gt; All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="NNDC2008" /&gt; The isotopes of californium range in [[mass number]] from 237 to 256.&lt;ref name="NNDC2008" /&gt;

Californium-249 is formed from the [[beta decay]] of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a [[nuclear reactor]].{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high [[neutron capture]]) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high [[neutron cross-section]]).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1504}}

Californium-252 is a very strong [[neutron]] emitter, which makes it extremely [[radioactive]] and harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Hicks, D.

Californium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], by the physics researchers [[Stanley Gerald Thompson|Stanley G. Thompson]], [[Kenneth Street, Jr.]], [[Albert Ghiorso]], and [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] on or about February 9, 1950.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}} It was the sixth [[transuranium element]] to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson |first1=S.

To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of curium-242 ({{nuclide|curium|242}}) was bombarded with 35&amp;nbsp;MeV-[[alpha particle]]s ({{nuclide|helium|4}}) in the {{convert|60|in|m|2|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[cyclotron]] at Berkeley, which produced californium-245 ({{nuclide|californium|245}}) plus one [[free neutron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}).{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}
&lt;!-- Weeks &amp; Leichester 1968 p. 849 gives product as 98-244 --&gt;
:{{nuclide|curium|242}} + {{nuclide|helium|4}} → {{nuclide|californium|245}} + {{su|b=0|p=1}}{{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}
Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment,{{sfn|Seaborg|1996|p=82}} and these atoms had a half-life of 44&amp;nbsp;minutes.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}

The discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.{{sfn|Weeks|Leichester|1968|p=849}}{{efn|[[Europium]], in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named [[americium]]. Element 96 was named [[curium]] for [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as an analog to the naming of [[gadolinium]], which was named for the scientist and engineer [[Johan Gadolin]]. [[Terbium]] was named for the village it was discovered in, so element 97 was named [[berkelium]].{{sfn|Weeks|Leichester|1968|p=848}} }} However, the element directly above element&amp;nbsp;98 in the periodic table, [[dysprosium]], has a name that simply means "hard to get at" so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=347}} They added that "the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California."{{sfn|Weeks|Leichester|1968|p=848}}

Weighable quantities of californium were first produced by the&lt;!-- long duration -HOW LONG? --&gt; irradiation of plutonium targets at the [[Materials Testing Reactor]] at the [[Idaho National Laboratory|National Reactor Testing Station]] in [[eastern Idaho]]; and these findings were reported in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1083|date=1954|author=Diamond, H|title=Identification of Californium Isotopes 249, 250, 251, and 252 from Pile-Irradiated Plutonium|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.94.1083|bibcode = 1954PhRv...94.1083D|last2=Magnusson|first2=L.|last3=Mech|first3=J.|last4=Stevens|first4=C.|last5=Friedman|first5=A.|last6=Studier|first6=M.|last7=Fields|first7=P.|last8=Huizenga|first8=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}} The isotopes californium-249 to californium-252 were isolated that same year from a sample of [[plutonium-239]] that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years.{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}}  Two years later, in 1960, [[Burris Cunningham]] and [[James Wallman]] of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds—californium trichloride, [[californium oxychloride]], and californium oxide—by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Science News Letter|volume = 78|issue = 26|date=December 1960|title = Element 98 Prepared }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR) at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ornl.gov/sci/rrd/pages/hfir.html|title=The High Flux Isotope Reactor|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527164346/http://web.ornl.gov/sci/rrd/pages/hfir.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, the HFIR nominally produced {{convert|500|mg|oz}} of californium annually.{{sfn|Osborne-Lee|1995|p=11}} Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]] was used for californium production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213032416/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B31B4EF0-A584-4CC6-9B14-B5E89E6848F8/0/plutoniumandaldermaston.pdf|format=PDF |archivedate=2006-12-13 |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B31B4EF0-A584-4CC6-9B14-B5E89E6848F8/0/plutoniumandaldermaston.pdf |title=Plutonium and Aldermaston – an Historical Account |publisher=UK Ministry of Defence |date=4 September 2001 |accessdate=15 March 2007|page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] sold californium-252 to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $10 per microgram&lt;ref name="osti" /&gt; and an average of {{convert|150|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of californium-252 were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990.{{sfn|Osborne-Lee|1995|p=6}}{{efn|The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] replaced the Atomic Energy Commission when the [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] was implemented.

Traces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=90}} The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.&lt;ref name="ANL2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evs.anl.gov/pub/doc/Californium.pdf |title=Human Health Fact Sheet: Californium |date=August 2005 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |author=ANL contributors |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032736/http://www.evs.anl.gov/pub/doc/Californium.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
{{see also|Nuclear fuel cycle}}
Californium is produced in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s.{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 ({{nuclide|Bk|249}}) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 ({{nuclide|Bk|250}}) via [[neutron capture]] (n,γ)  which, in turn, quickly [[beta decay]]s (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to californium-250 ({{nuclide|Cf|250}}) in the following reaction:{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}}
:{{nuclide|Bk|249}}(n,γ){{nuclide|Bk|250}} → {{nuclide|Cf|250}} + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}}

Prolonged irradiation of [[americium]], curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=105}} As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1503}}

Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Only two sites produce californium-252: the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]]. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25&amp;nbsp;grams and 0.025&amp;nbsp;grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}}

Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by [[uranium-238]] without [[nuclear fission]] or alpha decay occurring during the process.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}} Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several [[isotopes of plutonium]], [[isotopes of americium|americium]], [[isotopes of curium|curium]], [[isotopes of berkelium|berkelium]], and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).

== Precautions ==
Californium that [[bioaccumulate]]s in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=106}} The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=90}}

Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.&lt;ref name="ANL2005" /&gt;&lt;!-- for the whole paragraph --&gt;

The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through [[gamma ray]] emission. [[Ionizing radiation]] emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.&lt;ref name="ANL2005" /&gt;&lt;!-- for the whole paragraph --&gt;

'''Catatumbo lightning''' ({{lang-es|Relámpago del Catatumbo}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fogonazos.es/2007/06/catatumbo-everlasting-storm.html |title=Fogonazos: Catatumbo, the everlasting storm |publisher=Fogonazos.blogspot.com |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an atmospheric phenomenon in [[Venezuela]]. It occurs only{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} over the mouth of the [[Catatumbo River]] where it empties into [[Lake Maracaibo]].

It originates from a mass of [[storm]] clouds at a height of more than 1&amp;nbsp;km, and occurs during 140 to 160 nights a year, 10 hours per day and up to 280 times per hour. It occurs over and around Lake Maracaibo, typically over the [[bog]] area formed where the Catatumbo River flows into the lake.&lt;ref name="realtravel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realtravel.com/e-150098-congo_entry-catatumbo_lightning |title=Catatumbo Lightning – Congo |publisher=Real Travel |accessdate=2010-07-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114954/http://realtravel.com/e-150098-congo_entry-catatumbo_lightning|archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catatumbo lightning changes its frequency throughout the year, and it is different from year to year. For example, it ceased from January to March 2010, apparently due to [[drought]], temporarily raising fears that it might have been extinguished permanently.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/VEN/Zulia/Catatumbo.htm|title=Catatumbo Lightning|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_drought&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=Drought extinguishes Venezuela's lightning phenomenon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/05/venezuela-lightning-el-nino|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite web|last=Guttman|first=Matt|title=Venezuela's Mysterious Catatumbo Lightning Phenomenon Vanishes for Months, Then Reappears|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/venezuelas-mysterious-catatumbo-lightning-phenomenon-vanishes-months-reappears/story?id=14120203#.UOYHp3e_E_w|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=3 January 2013|author2=Robert Rudman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have misunderstood an early reference to the lightning in [[Lope de Vega]]'s description in his epic ''[[La Dragontea]]'' of an incident during the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|attack against San Juan de Puerto Rico]] by the English [[Corsair (pirate)|corsair]] [[Francis Drake]].&lt;ref name="Dislates"&gt;[https://cmcint.atavist.com/dislates-y-disparates-relampagos-catatumbo#chapter-1278423 Dislates y Disparates sobre el Relámpago del Catatumbo:  La expedición de Drake, de 1595], [[Ángel Vicente Muñoz García]], [[Centro de Modelado Científico]], Maracaibo, agosto 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prussia]]n naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] once described it.&lt;ref name="Humboldt"&gt;''La distancia de más de 40 leguas a que se distingue la luz ha hecho creer que podría ser el efecto de una tempestad o de explosiones eléctricas que tuviesen lugar diariamente en una garganta de montañas y aun se asegura que se oye el ruido del trueno cuando se aproxima uno al farol.''
:Alexander von Humboldt and [[Aimé Bonpland]], ''[[Viage a las Regiones Equinocciales del Nuevo Continente]], volume 2, book V, chapter XVI, page 390, note, Casa de Rosa, Paris, 1826; Ediciones del Ministerio de Educación, 2a. ed., Caracas, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Italy|Italian]] geographer [[Agustin Codazzi]] described it: "like a continuous lightning, and its position such that, located almost on the meridian of the mouth of the lake, it directs the navigators as a lighthouse."&lt;ref name="Codazzi"&gt;''Es como un relámpago continuado y su posición tal que, situado casi en el meridiano de la boca del lago de Maracaibo, dirige a los navegantes como un faro.''
:Codazzi Agustín, ''[[Resumen de la Geografía de Venezuela]]'', Fournier, Paris, 1841, pp. 20, 464 y 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon became so celebrated that it was depicted in [[flag of Zulia|the flag]] and [[coat of arms of Zulia|coat of arms]] of the state of [[Zulia]], which contains Lake Maracaibo, and mentioned in [[Anthem of Zulia|the state's anthem]]. This phenomenon has been popularly known for centuries as the '''Lighthouse of Maracaibo''', since it is visible for miles around Lake Maracaibo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2010/02/lightning-up.html |title=Lightning Up, 4 Feb 2010 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040050 |publisher=Blogs.ngm.com |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2013-02-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129014235/http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2010/02/lightning-up.html |archivedate=2012-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and mechanism ==
[[File:Lake Maracaibo map.png|thumb|right|Catatumbo lightning occurs over and around Lake Maracaibo]]
Catatumbo lightning usually develops between the coordinates {{coord|8|30|N|71|0|W|type:waterbody|name=Approximate outer limit}} and {{coord|9|45|N|73|0|W|type:waterbody|name=Approximate outer limit}}. The storms (and associated lightning) are likely the result of the winds blowing across the Maracaibo Lake and surrounding swampy plains. These air masses inevitably meet the high mountain ridges of the [[Andes]], the [[Perijá Mountains]] (3,750&amp;nbsp;m), and [[Cordillera de Mérida|Mérida's Cordillera]], enclosing the plain from three sides. The heat and moisture collected across the plains create electrical charges and, as the air masses are destabilized by the mountain ridges, result in thunderstorm activity.&lt;ref name=wondermondo /&gt; The phenomenon is characterized by almost continuous lightning, mostly within the clouds, which is produced in a large vertical development of clouds.

The lightning produces a great quantity of [[ozone]] though its instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the [[ozonosphere]].&lt;ref name="Zulia"&gt;[http://www.agenciadenoticias.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4965&amp;Itemid=151 ¿Relámpagos del Catatumbo regeneran la capa de ozono?]. Agencia de noticias de la [[Universidad del Zulia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Previous studies ==
Among the major modern studies there is the one done by Melchor Centeno, which attributes the origin of the thunderstorms to closed wind circulation in the region. Between 1966 and 1970, Andrew Zavrostky investigated the area three times, with assistance from the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela|University of the Andes]]. He concluded that the lightning has several epicenters in the marshes of Juan Manuel de Aguas National Park, Claras Aguas Negras, and west Lake Maracaibo. In 1991 he suggested that the phenomenon occurred due to cold and warm air currents meeting around the area. The study also speculated that an isolated cause for the lightning might be the presence of [[uranium]] in the bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saber.ula.ve/bitstream/123456789/27668/1/articulo12.pdf|title=Una vida consagrada a los números}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1997 and 2000 Nelson Falcón and collaborators conducted four studies, and proposed a microphysics model of Catatumbo lightning. He identified  the [[methane]] produced by the swamps and the [[Oil reserves in Venezuela|oil deposits]] in the area as a major cause of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2010/02/lightning-up.html |title=Phenomena – A science salon hosted by National Geographic Magazine |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040050 |publisher=Blogs.ngm.com |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2013-02-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129014235/http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2010/02/lightning-up.html |archivedate=2012-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The methane model is based on symmetry properties of the methane.

The study also shows that the forecast accuracy is significantly higher when an index based on a combination of winds and [[convective available potential energy]] is used. The index seems to capture well the compound effect of multiple climate drivers.

In order to calibrate physical and statistical models to make their forecasts, the team has been acquiring data with [[tethered balloon]]s and micro-weather stations tied to the balloon's line.

[[File:Torque Converter Centrifugal Pendulum Absorber.png|thumb|right|[[Schaeffler Group|Schaeffler]] torque converter with centrifugal pendulum absorber]]

A '''centrifugal pendulum absorber''' is a type of [[Tuned mass damper]]. It reduces the amplitude of a [[Torsional vibration]] in drive trains that use a combustion engine.

== History ==
The centrifugal pendulum absorber was first patented in 1937 by R. Sarazin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarazin|title=US Patent 2,079,226 - Means adapted to reduce the torsional oscillations of crankshafts|date=4 May 1937|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/2079226|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a different version by R. Chilton in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chilton|first=Roland|title=US Patent 2,112,984 - Pendulum counterweight|date=5 April 1938|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/2112984|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, both Sarazin and Chilton are credited with the invention. Sarazin's work was used during [[World War II]] by Pratt &amp; Whitney for aircraft engines with increased power output. The power increase caused an increase in torsional vibrations which threatened the durability. This resulted in the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp|Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 engine]] that used pendulum weights attached to the crank shaft.

The use of centrifugal pendulum absorbers in land vehicles did not start until later. Although internal combustion engines had always caused torsional vibrations in the drive train, the vibration amplitude was generally not high enough to affect durability or driver comfort. One application existed in tuned racing engines where torsional crank shaft vibrations could cause damage to the cam shaft or valves. In this application, a centrifugal pendulum absorber, the Rattler® absorber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rattler® Absorber|url=http://www.tciauto.com/tc/engine-products/engine-balancers/rattler-absorbershtml|work=www.tciauto.com|last=TCI|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is directly attached to the crank shaft. Although the design differs from that of Sarazin or Chilton, the Rattler® still follows the same physical principle.

In 2010, centrifugal pendulum absorbers following the patents of Sarazin and Chilton were introduced in a [[BMW 320D]]. The reason for it was again the increase in torsional vibrations from higher power engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kroll|author2=Koy|author3=Seebacher|title=Land in sight? Torsional vibration damping for future engines|year=2010|publisher=Schaeffler|page=3|url=http://www.schaeffler.com/remotemedien/media/_shared_media/08_media_library/01_publications/schaeffler_2/symposia_1/downloads_11/Schaeffler_Kolloquium_2010_02_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the 4-cylinder diesel engine [[BMW N47]]. Unlike the previous designs, the centrifugal pendulum absorber was not attached to the combustion engine but attached to a [[dual mass flywheel]].

== Function ==
The function of a centrifugal pendulum absorber is as with any [[tuned mass damper|tuned mass absorbers]] based on an absorption principle rather than a damping principle. The distinction is significant since dampers reduce the vibration amplitude by converting the vibration energy into heat. Absorbers store the energy and return it to the vibration system at the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCutcheon|first=Kimble|title=No Short Days: The struggle to Develop the R-2800 "Double Wasp" Crankshaft|url=http://www.enginehistory.org/NoShortDays/Development%20of%20the%20R-2800%20Crankshaft.pdf|work=enginehistory.org|accessdate=16 October 2013|pages=3–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centrifugal pendulum absorbers like tuned mass absorbers are not part of the force/torque flow.

The centrifugal pendulum absorber differs from the tuned mass absorber in the absorption range. It is effective for an entire order instead of a narrow frequency range.

== Modern Applications ==
[[Internal combustion engine]]s follow a development trend towards a reduction in the number of cylinders, increased energy output per cylinder and driving at lower engine speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 Emerging Trends in Automotive Engineering|url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/automotive/3-emerging-trends-automotive-engineering|work=www.asme.org|last=Crawford|first=Mark|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to an increased engine efficiency but causes the engine's torsional vibrations to increase. The vibrations lead to durability concerns as well as a comfort reduction for the passengers and have to be avoided through the use of [[torsion damper]]s and absorbers. This situation moves the balance between the cost of the centrifugal pendulum absorber technology and the benefit for the drive train efficiency.

'''Condensed matter physics''' is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter. In particular it is concerned with the "condensed" phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the electromagnetic forces between atoms. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using [[physical law]]s. In particular, they include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

The most familiar condensed phases are [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s while more exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice]]s of atoms, and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] found in [[ultracold atom]]ic systems. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of [[theoretical physics]] to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.

The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all [[People of the United States|American]] physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141400/http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-date= 2009-03-27 |website=Physics Today Jobs|title= Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics| access-date= 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref name=aps-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Condensed Matter Physics|url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field overlaps with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[nanotechnology]], and relates closely to [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]]. The [[theoretical physics]] of condensed matter shares important concepts and methods with that of [[particle physics]] and [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Marvin L.|title=Essay: Fifty Years of Condensed Matter Physics|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2008|volume=101|issue=25|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.250001|url=http://prl.aps.org/edannounce/PhysRevLett.101.250001|access-date=31 March 2012|bibcode= 2008PhRvL.101y0001C|pmid=19113681|page=250001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of topics in physics such as [[crystallography]], [[metallurgy]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[magnetism]], etc., were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s, when they were grouped together as ''[[solid state physics]]''. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of [[liquid]]s was added to this list, forming the basis for the new, related specialty of condensed matter physics.&lt;ref name=rmp /&gt; According to physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson]], the term was coined by him and [[Volker Heine]], when they changed the name of their group at the [[Cavendish Laboratories]], [[Cambridge]] from ''Solid state theory'' to ''Theory of Condensed Matter'' in 1967,&lt;ref name=pwa-princeton&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Anderson|url=http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&amp;display=faculty|website=Department of Physics|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids, [[nuclear matter]], and so on.&lt;ref name=wsn&gt;{{cite journal|title=More and Different|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/newsletter/newsletter/nov11n33p02.shtml|journal=World Scientific Newsletter|date=November 2011|volume=33 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name "condensed matter", it had been present in Europe for some years, most prominently in the form of a journal published in English, French, and German by Springer-Verlag titled ''Physics of Condensed Matter'', which was launched in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTsgAAAAIAAJ|title=''Physics of Condensed Matter''|volume=1|access-date=20 April 2015|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name "condensed matter physics", which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter, over "solid state physics", which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors.&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

References to "condensed" state can be traced to earlier sources. For example, in the introduction to his 1947 book ''Kinetic Theory of Liquids'',&lt;ref name=Frenkel&gt;{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=J.|title=Kinetic Theory of Liquids|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakov Frenkel]] proposed that "The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies. As a matter of fact, it would be more correct to unify them under the title of 'condensed bodies'".

===Classical physics===
[[File:Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Johannes Diderik van der Waals.jpg|thumb|right|[[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] and [[Johannes van der Waals]] with the [[helium]] ''liquefactor'' at Leiden in 1908]]
One of the first studies of condensed states of matter was by [[People of England|English]] [[chemist]] [[Humphry Davy]], in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty [[chemical element]]s known at the time, twenty-six had [[metal]]lic properties such as [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[ductility]] and high electrical and thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodstein|first=David|author1-link=David Goodstein|last2=Goodstein|first2=Judith|author2-link=Judith R. Goodstein |title=Richard Feynman and the History of Superconductivity|journal=Physics in Perspective|year=2000|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://web.njit.edu/~tyson/supercon_papers/Feynman_Superconductivity_History.pdf|access-date=7 April 2012|doi=10.1007/s000160050035|pages=30|bibcode= 2000PhP.....2...30G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicated that the atoms in [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] were not indivisible as Dalton claimed, but had inner structure. Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then behave as metals.&lt;ref name=davy-1839&gt;{{cite book|last=Davy|first=John (ed.)|title=The collected works of Sir Humphry Davy: Vol. II|year=1839|publisher=Smith Elder &amp; Co., Cornhill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WNKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Both hydrogen and nitrogen have since been liquified, however ordinary liquid nitrogen and hydrogen do not possess metallic properties.

In 1823, [[Michael Faraday]], then an assistant in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied [[chlorine]] and went on to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt; Shortly after, in 1869, [[People of Ireland|Irish]] chemist [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] studied the [[phase transition]] from a liquid to a gas and coined the term [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases,&lt;ref name=thomasandrews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowlinson|first=J.

[[Paul Drude]] in 1900 proposed the first theoretical model for a [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[electron]] moving through a metallic solid.&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008 /&gt; Drude's model described properties of metals in terms of a gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]].&lt;ref name="Kittel 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kittel|first=Charles|title=Introduction to Solid State Physics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-11181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoddeson|first=Lillian|title=Out of the Crystal Maze: Chapters from The History of Solid State Physics|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505329-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCpPPHhMdRcC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–29}} However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the [[specific heat]] and magnetic properties of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kragh2002&gt;{{cite book |last= Kragh |first= Helge |title= Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century |publisher= Princeton University Press |edition= Reprint |date= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-691-09552-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|366–368}}

In 1911, three years after helium was first liquefied, Onnes working at [[University of Leiden]] discovered [[superconductivity]] in [[mercury (element)|mercury]], when he observed the electrical resistivity of mercury to vanish at temperatures below a certain value.&lt;ref name=vanDelft2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Delft|first=Dirk|author2=Kes, Peter |title=The discovery of superconductivity|journal=Physics Today|date=September 2010|volume=63|issue=9|doi=10.1063/1.3490499|url=http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/cold/DelftKes_HKO_PT.pdf|access-date=7 April 2012|bibcode= 2010PhT....63i..38V|pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon completely surprised the best theoretical physicists of the time, and it remained unexplained for several decades.&lt;ref name=Slichter-AIP-supercond&gt;{{cite web|last=Slichter|first=Charles|title=Introduction to the History of Superconductivity|url=http://www.aip.org/history/mod/superconductivity/01.html|website=Moments of Discovery|publisher=American Institute of Physics|access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]], in 1922, said regarding contemporary theories of superconductivity that "with our far-reaching ignorance of the quantum mechanics of composite systems we are very far from being able to compose a theory out of these vague ideas."&lt;ref name=Schmalian-2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmalian|first=Joerg|title=Failed theories of superconductivity|year=2010|arxiv=1008.0447|bibcode= 2010MPLB...24.2679S |doi= 10.1142/S0217984910025280|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=24|issue=27|pages=2679–2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advent of quantum mechanics===
Drude's classical model was augmented by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], [[Felix Bloch]] and other physicists.  Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].  Using this idea, he developed the theory of [[paramagnetism]] in 1926.  Shortly after, Sommerfeld incorporated the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] into the free electron model and made it better able to explain the heat capacity.  Two years later, Bloch used [[quantum mechanics]] to describe the motion of a quantum electron in a periodic lattice.&lt;ref name=Kragh2002/&gt;{{rp|366–368}} The mathematics of crystal structures developed by [[Auguste Bravais]], [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] and others was used to classify crystals by their [[symmetry group]], and tables of crystal structures were the basis for the series ''International Tables of Crystallography'', first published in 1935.&lt;ref name=Aroyo-2006&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aroyo|first=Mois, I. |author2=Müller, Ulrich |author3=Wondratschek, Hans |title=Historical introduction|year=2006|volume=A|pages=2–5|doi=10.1107/97809553602060000537|series=International Tables for Crystallography|isbn=978-1-4020-2355-2|url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.4170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Band theory|Band structure calculations]] was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]] and [[William Shockley]] developed the first [[semiconductor]]-based [[transistor]], heralding a revolution in electronics.&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008 /&gt;

[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|left|A replica of the first [[point-contact transistor]] in [[Bell labs]]]]
In 1879, [[Edwin Herbert Hall]] working at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] discovered a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents|author=Hall, Edwin|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|volume=2|year=1879|pages=287–92|url=http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|access-date=2008-02-28|doi=10.2307/2369245|issue=3|jstor=2369245|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208040346/http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|archivedate=2007-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon arising due to the nature of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the [[Hall effect]], but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, [[Lev Landau]] in 1930 developed the theory of [[Landau quantization]] and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the [[quantum Hall effect]] discovered half a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=L. D.|last1=Landau|first2=E.

Magnetism as a property of matter has been known in China since 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=mattis-magnetism-2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattis|first=Daniel|title=The Theory of Magnetism Made Simple|year=2006|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-238-671-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}} However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started with the development of [[electrodynamics]] by Faraday, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as [[ferromagnetic]], [[paramagnetic]] and [[diamagnetic]] based on their response to magnetization.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee-2004-ferromagnetism&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Sabyasachi|title=Heisenberg and Ferromagnetism|journal=Resonance|date=August 2004|volume=9|issue=8|doi=10.1007/BF02837578|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/009/08/0057-0066|access-date=13 June 2012|pages=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Curie]] studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the [[Curie point]] phase transition in ferromagnetic materials.&lt;ref name=mattis-magnetism-2006 /&gt; In 1906, [[Pierre Weiss]] introduced the concept of [[magnetic domain]]s to explain the main properties of ferromagnets.&lt;ref name=Visintin-domains&gt;{{cite book|last=Visintin|first=Augusto|title=Differential Models of Hysteresis|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-54793-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZrTIDmNOlgC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by [[Wilhelm Lenz]] and [[Ernst Ising]] through the [[Ising model]] that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of [[Spin (physics)|spins]] that collectively acquired magnetization.&lt;ref name=mattis-magnetism-2006/&gt; The Ising model was solved exactly to show that [[spontaneous magnetization]] cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on [[spin wave]]s and [[Néel]] on [[antiferromagnetism]] led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to [[magnetic storage]] devices.&lt;ref name=mattis-magnetism-2006/&gt;{{rp|36–38,48}}

The Sommerfeld model and spin models for ferromagnetism illustrated the successful application of quantum mechanics to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of [[superconductivity]] and the [[Kondo effect]].&lt;ref name=Coleman-2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Piers|title=Many-Body Physics: Unfinished Revolution|journal=Annales Henri Poincaré|year=2003|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s00023-003-0943-9|arxiv=cond-mat/0307004|bibcode= 2003AnHP....4..559C|pages=559–580|citeseerx=10.1.1.242.6214}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of [[collective excitation]] modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist [[Lev Landau]] used the idea for the [[Fermi liquid theory]] wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles.&lt;ref name=Coleman-2003/&gt; Landau also developed a [[mean field theory]] for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of symmetry]]. The theory also introduced the notion of an [[order parameter]] to distinguish between ordered phases.&lt;ref name=Kadanoff-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Kadanoff|first=Leo, P.|title=Phases of Matter and Phase Transitions; From Mean Field Theory to Critical Phenomena|year=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago|url=http://jfi.uchicago.edu/~leop/RejectedPapers/ExtraV1.2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually in 1965, [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]] and [[John Schrieffer]] developed the so-called [[BCS theory]] of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a [[Cooper pair]].&lt;ref name=coleman /&gt;

The study of phase transition and the critical behavior of observables, termed [[critical phenomena]], was a major field of interest in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Fisher-rmp-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Michael E.|title=Renormalization group theory: Its basis and formulation in statistical physics|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=1998|volume=70|issue=2|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.70.653|url=http://rmp.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v70/i2/p653_1|access-date=14 June 2012|bibcode= 1998RvMP...70..653F|pages=653–681|citeseerx=10.1.1.129.3194}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Kadanoff]], [[Benjamin Widom]] and [[Michael Fisher]] developed the ideas of [[critical exponent]]s and [[widom scaling]]. These ideas were unified by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] in 1972, under the formalism of the [[renormalization group]] in the context of quantum field theory.&lt;ref name=Fisher-rmp-1998/&gt;

The [[quantum Hall effect]] was discovered by [[Klaus von Klitzing]] in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductance to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant &lt;math&gt;e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;.(see figure) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as system size and impurities.&lt;ref name="von Klitzing"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1985/klitzing-lecture.pdf |title= The Quantized Hall Effect |last= von Klitzing |first= Klaus |date= 9 Dec 1985 |website= Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981, theorist [[Robert Laughlin]] proposed a theory explaining the unanticipated precision of the integral plateau.

A major revolution came in the field of [[crystallography]] with the discovery of [[quasicrystal]]s by [[Daniel Shechtman]]. In 1982 Shechtman observed that certain metallic [[alloy]]s produce unusual diffractograms that indicated that their crystalline structures are ordered, but lack [[translational symmetry]]. The discovery led the [[International Union of Crystallography]] to change its definition of a crystal to account for aperiodic structures.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/technion-s-shechtman-wins-chemistry-nobel-for-discovery-of-quasicrystals.html|title=Tecnion's Shechtman Wins Nobel in Chemistry for Quasicrystals Discovery|author=Gerlin, Andrea |date= 5 October 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half of the twentieth century was also important for the development of [[soft condensed matter]], in particular the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of several soft-matter systems such as polymers and liquid crystals due to [[Paul Flory|Flory]], [[Pierre de Gennes|de Gennes]] and others.&lt;ref name=Cates-2004-soft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cates|first=M.

In 1986, [[Karl Alexander Müller|Karl Müller]] and [[Johannes Bednorz]] discovered the first [[high temperature superconductor]], a material which was superconducting at temperatures as high as 50 [[kelvin]]s.

In 2009, [[David Field (astrophysicist)|David Field]] and researchers at [[Aarhus University]] discovered spontaneous electric fields when creating [[prosaic film]]s{{clarify|date=April 2016}} of various gases. This has more recently expanded to form the research area of [[spontelectrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=David|author2=Plekan, O. |author3=Cassidy, A. |author4=Balog, R. |author5= Jones, N.C. and Dunger, J. |title=Spontaneous electric fields in solid films: spontelectrics|journal=Int.Rev.Phys.Chem.|date=12 Mar 2013|doi=10.1080/0144235X.2013.767109|volume=32|issue=3|pages=345–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical==
Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the [[Drude model]], the [[Band structure]] and the [[density functional theory]]. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of [[phase transition]]s, such as the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], [[critical exponent]]s and the use of mathematical methods of [[quantum field theory]] and the [[renormalization group]]. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of [[numerical computation]] of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as [[high-temperature superconductivity]], [[topological phase]]s, and [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]].

===Emergence===
{{main|Emergence}}
Theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics is closely related to the notion of [[emergence]], wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents.&lt;ref name=coleman&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman |first=Piers |title=Introduction to Many Body Physics |year=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86488-6|url=

===Electronic theory of solids===
{{main|Electronic band structure}}
The metallic state has historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids.&lt;ref name="AshcroftMermin1976"/&gt; The first theoretical description of metals was given by [[Paul Drude]] in 1900 with the [[Drude model]], which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an [[ideal gas]] of then-newly discovered [[electron]]s.  He was able to derive the empirical [[Wiedemann-Franz law]] and get results in close agreement with the experiments.&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992/&gt;{{rp|90–91}}  This classical model was then improved by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] who incorporated the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] of electrons and was able to explain the anomalous behavior of the [[specific heat]] of metals in the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]].&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992/&gt;{{rp|101–103}}  In 1912, The structure of crystalline solids was studied by [[Max von Laue]] and Paul Knipping, when they observed the [[X-ray diffraction]] pattern of crystals, and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic [[lattice model (physics)|lattices]] of atoms.&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eckert|first=Michael|title=Disputed discovery: the beginnings of X-ray diffraction in crystals in 1912 and its repercussions|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|year=2011|volume=68|issue=1|doi=10.1107/S0108767311039985|pmid=22186281|url=http://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2012/01/00/wx0005/index.html|bibcode= 2012AcCrA..68...30E|pages=30–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, Swiss physicist [[Felix Bloch]] provided a wave function solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]] with a [[Periodic function|periodic]] potential, called the [[Bloch wave]].&lt;ref name=han-2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Han|first=Jung Hoon|title=Solid State Physics|year=2010|publisher=Sung Kyun Kwan University|url=http://manybody.skku.edu/Lecture%20notes/Solid%20State%20Physics.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520224858/http://manybody.skku.edu/Lecture%20notes/Solid%20State%20Physics.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating electronic properties of metals by solving the many-body wavefunction is often computationally hard, and hence, approximation methods are needed to obtain meaningful predictions.&lt;ref name=perdew-2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perdew|first=John P.|author2=Ruzsinszky, Adrienn |title=Fourteen Easy Lessons in Density Functional Theory|journal=International Journal of Quantum Chemistry|year=2010|volume=110|pages=2801–2807|url=http://www.if.pwr.wroc.pl/~scharoch/Abinitio/14lessons.pdf|access-date=13 May 2012|doi=10.1002/qua.22829|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas–Fermi theory]], developed in the 1920s, was used to estimate system energy and electronic density by treating the local electron density as a [[Variational method|variational parameter]]. Later in the 1930s, [[Douglas Hartree]], [[Vladimir Fock]] and [[John C. Slater|John Slater]] developed the so-called [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock wavefunction]] as an improvement over the Thomas–Fermi model. The Hartree–Fock method accounted for [[Exchange symmetry|exchange statistics]] of single particle electron wavefunctions.  In general, it's very difficult to solve the Hartree–Fock equation.  Only the free electron gas case can be solved exactly.&lt;ref name="AshcroftMermin1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil W. Ashcroft|author2=N. David Mermin|title=Solid state physics|year=1976|publisher=Saunders College|isbn=978-0-03-049346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|330–337}} Finally in 1964–65, [[Walter Kohn]], [[Pierre Hohenberg]] and [[Lu Jeu Sham]] proposed the [[density functional theory]] which gave realistic descriptions for bulk and surface properties of metals. The density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used since the 1970s for band structure calculations of variety of solids.&lt;ref name=perdew-2010 /&gt;

===Symmetry breaking===
{{main|Symmetry breaking}}
Some states of matter exhibit symmetry breaking, where the relevant laws of physics possess some [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous [[translational symmetry]]. Other examples include magnetized [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], which break [[rotational symmetry]], and more exotic states such as the ground state of a [[BCS theory|BCS]] [[superconductor]], that breaks [[U(1)]] phase rotational symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/nambu-lecture.html |title= Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Particle Physics: a Case of Cross Fertilization |last= Nambu |first= Yoichiro |date= 8 December 2008 |website= Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiter |first=Martin |arxiv=cond-mat/0503400 |title=Is electromagnetic gauge invariance spontaneously violated in superconductors? |date=16 March 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2005.03.008 |volume=319 |issue=2005 |journal=Annals of Physics |pages=217–249|bibcode=2005AnPhy.319..217G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goldstone's theorem]] in [[quantum field theory]] states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone [[boson]]s. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to [[phonon]]s, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.&lt;ref name=goldstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leutwyler|first=H.|title=Phonons as Goldstone bosons|journal= Helv.phys.acta )|volume=70|issue=1997|year=1996|arxiv=hep-ph/9609466|bibcode= 1996hep.ph....9466L|pages=275–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase transition===
{{main|Phase transition}}
Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as [[temperature]].  Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed.  For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed.  In [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to absolute zero, and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix|Hamiltonian]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.&lt;ref name=Vojta2003/&gt;

Two classes of phase transitions occur: first-order transitions and continuous transitions.  For the later, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called critical point.  Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]] diverge exponentially.&lt;ref name=Vojta2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vojta |first=Matthia |arxiv= cond-mat/0309604|title=Quantum phase transitions |year=2069 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/12/R01 |volume=66 |issue=12 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |pages=2069–2110|bibcode=2003RPPh...66.2069V |citeseerx=10.1.1.305.3880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These critical phenomena possess serious challenges to physicists because normal macroscopic laws are no longer valid in the region and novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.&lt;ref name=NRC1986&gt;{{cite book |title=Condensed-Matter Physics, Physics Through the 1990s|publisher=National Research Council|year=1986|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/626/an-overview-physics-through-the-1990s|isbn=978-0-309-03577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75ff}}

The simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]].  However, it can only roughly explain continuous phase transition for ferroelectrics and type I superconductors which involves long range microscopic interactions.  For other types of systems that involves short range interactions near the critical point, a better theory is needed.&lt;ref name="University1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm F. Collins Professor of Physics McMaster University|title=Magnetic Critical Scattering|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-536440-8|date=1989-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–11}}

Near the critical point, the fluctuations happen over broad range of size scales while the feature of the whole system is scale invariant.  [[Renormalization group]] methods successively average out the shortest wavelength fluctuations in stages while retaining their effects into the next stage.  Thus, the changes of a physical system as viewed at different size scales can be investigated systematically.  The methods, together with powerful computer simulation, contribute greatly to the explanation of the critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transition.&lt;ref name=NRC1986/&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Experimental==
Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of electric and [[magnetic field]]s, measuring [[response function]]s, [[transport theory (statistical physics)|transport properties]] and [[thermometry]].&lt;ref name=exptcm&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Robert C.|title=Experimental methods in Condensed Matter Physics at Low Temperatures|year=1988|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-15002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly used experimental methods include [[spectroscopy]], with probes such as [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-rays]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared light]] and [[inelastic neutron scattering]]; study of thermal response, such as [[specific heat]] and measuring transport via thermal and heat [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].
[[File:Lysozym diffraction.png|thumb|upright|Image of X-ray diffraction pattern from a [[protein]] crystal.]]

===Scattering===
{{Further|Scattering}}
Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe, such as [[X-ray]], optical [[photon]]s, [[neutron]]s, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest. [[Visible light]] has energy on the scale of 1 [[electron volt]] (eV) and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as [[dielectric constant]] and [[refractive index]]. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 [[electron volt|keV]] and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.&lt;ref name=chaikin-lubensky&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaikin|first=P.

[[Neutron]]s can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron [[Spin (physics)|spins]] and magnetization (as neutrons have spin but no charge). Coulomb and [[Mott scattering]] measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes.&lt;ref name=chaikin-lubensky/&gt;{{rp|33–34}}&lt;ref name="Zhang2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentao Zhang|title=Photoemission Spectroscopy on High Temperature Superconductor: A Study of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission|date=22 August 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-32472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–43}}  Similarly, [[positron]] annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density.&lt;ref name=siegel-1980&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=R.

===External magnetic fields===
In experimental condensed matter physics, external [[magnetic field]]s act as [[thermodynamic variable]]s that control the state, phase transitions and properties of material systems.&lt;ref name=iupap-report&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Facilities for Condensed Matter Physics|title=Report of the IUPAP working group on Facilities for Condensed Matter Physics : High Magnetic Fields|url=http://archive.iupap.org/wg/wg3/hmff/file_50963.pdf|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|year= 2004|quote=The magnetic field is not simply a spectroscopic tool but is a thermodynamic variable which, along with temperature and pressure, controls the state, the phase transitions and the properties of materials.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is a method by which external magnetic fields are used to find resonance modes of individual electrons, thus giving information about the atomic, molecular, and bond structure of their neighborhood.

[[Ultracold atom]] trapping in optical lattices is an experimental tool commonly used in condensed matter physics, and in [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]. The method involves using optical lasers to form an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], which acts as a ''lattice'', in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as ''quantum simulators'', that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as [[Geometrical frustration|frustrated magnets]].&lt;ref name=buluta-science2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buluta|first=Iulia|author2=Nori, Franco |title=Quantum Simulators|journal=Science|year=2009|volume=326|issue=5949|doi=10.1126/science.1177838|bibcode= 2009Sci...326..108B|pages=108–11|pmid=19797653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they are used to engineer one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices for a [[Hubbard model]] with pre-specified parameters, and to study phase transitions for [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] and [[spin liquid]] ordering.&lt;ref name=greiner-nature2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiner |first=Markus |author2=Fölling, Simon |title=Condensed-matter physics: Optical lattices |journal=Nature|year=2008|volume=453|pages=736–738|doi=10.1038/453736a|bibcode= 2008Natur.453..736G|issue=7196|pmid=18528388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jaksch-aop2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaksch|first=D.|author2=Zoller, P. |title=The cold atom Hubbard toolbox|journal=Annals of Physics|year=2005|volume=315|issue=1|pages=52–79|doi=10.1016/j.aop.2004.09.010|arxiv= cond-mat/0410614 |bibcode= 2005AnPhy.315...52J|citeseerx=10.1.1.305.9031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum computation]], information is represented by quantum bits, or [[qubit]]s.  The qubits may [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] quickly before useful computation is completed.  This serious problem must be solved before quantum computing may be realized.  To solve this problem, several promising approaches are proposed in condensed matter physics, including [[Josephson junction]] qubits, [[spintronic]] qubits using the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] orientation of magnetic materials, or the topological non-Abelian [[anyon]]s from [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] states.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective /&gt;

Condensed matter physics also has important uses for [[biophysics]], for example, the experimental method of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], which is widely used in medical diagnosis.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4540">The '''conductance quantum''', denoted by the symbol {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the quantized unit of [[electrical conductance]]. It is defined by the [[elementary charge]] ''e'' and [[Planck constant]] ''h'' as:

&lt;math&gt;G_0 = \frac{2 e^2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;= {{val|7.7480917310|(18)|e=-5|u=[[Siemens (unit)|S]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Barry N. Taylor |author2=Peter J. Mohr |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?conqu2e2sh |title=CODATA Value: Conductance Quantum |year=2014 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears when measuring the conductance of a [[quantum point contact]], and, more generally, is a key component of the [[Landauer formula]], which relates the electrical conductance of a quantum conductor to its quantum properties.  It is twice the reciprocal of the [[von Klitzing constant]] (2/''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;).

Note that the conductance quantum does not mean that the conductance of any system must be an integer multiple of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Instead, it describes the conductance of two quantum channels (one channel for spin up and one channel for spin down) if the probability for transmitting an electron that enters the channel is unity, i.e. if transport through the channel is [[ballistic transport|ballistic]]. If the transmission probability is less than unity, then the conductance of the channel is less than ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The total conductance of a system is equal to the sum of the conductances of all the parallel quantum channels that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;S. Datta, ''Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-59943-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
In a 1D wire, connecting two reservoirs of potential &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; adiabatically:

The density of states is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d} \epsilon} = \frac{2}{hv}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where the factor 2 comes from electron spin degeneracy, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the electron velocity.

The voltage is:
:&lt;math&gt;V = -\frac{(u_1 - u_2)}{e}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron charge.

The 1D current going across is the current density:

:&lt;math&gt;j = -ev(u_1-u_2) \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d} \epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;.

This results in a quantized conductance:
:&lt;math&gt;G_0 = \frac{I}{V}  = \frac{j}{V} = \frac{2e^2}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Quantized conductance occurs in wires that are ballistic conductors,  when &lt;math&gt;\lambda \gg L &lt;/math&gt;. B. J. van Wees et al. first observed the effect in a point contact in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Quantized Conductance of Point Contacts in a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas|last = B.J. van Wees|date = 1988|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 60|issue = 9|pages=848–850|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.848|pmid = 10038668|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 1988PhRvL..60..848V |hdl = 1887/3316}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon nanotubes have quantized conductance independent of diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Carbon Nanotube Quantum Resistors|author1=S.

==Motivation from the uncertainty principle==

A simple, intuitive motivation of the conductance quantum can be made using the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which states that the minimum energy-time uncertainty is ''ΔEΔt'' ~ ''h'', where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. The current ''I'' in a quantum channel can be expressed as ''e/τ'', where ''τ'' is transit time and the ''e'' is [[electron charge]]. Applying a voltage ''V'' results in an energy ''E = eV''. If we assume that the energy uncertainty is of order E and the time uncertainty is of order ''τ'', we can write ''ΔEΔt'' ~ ''(eV)(e/I)'' ~ ''h''. Using the fact that the electrical conductance ''G = I/V'', this becomes ''G'' ~ ''e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h''.

==History==
This power plant works only for 76 hours in reality.
At the beginning of the 1970s [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], then President of Romania, decided to build a large [[thermal power plant|thermal power station]] in [[Caraş-Severin County]] to exploit the large oil shale deposits located in the area.&lt;ref name="anina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apropo.ro/news/util/orasul-frigului-2224837|title=Oraşul frigului|date=2001|work=apropo.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the power station was intended to be built in Ticvaniu Mic [[Communes of Romania|commune]], now part of the [[Ticvaniu Mare]] commune, near [[Oraviţa]] but the chosen site had a very small water supply that was not sufficient for the power station.&lt;ref name="anina"/&gt; In 1976 a new location was found at Crivina, located in the mountains near [[Anina]]. In 1983 the construction of the power station was complete and the first 330 MW electric power generation unit was put online. The turbine could not reach its highest potential capacity due to the low quality of the [[oil shale]] deposits.&lt;ref name="anina"/&gt; The communist regime also built a town that was used to house the power station's workers. It was intended to have 10,000 inhabitants, and a part of Anina had to move to this new location to make way for oil shale [[surface mining|surface mines]].&lt;ref name="anina"/&gt;

The first of the three power generation units was completed in 1983, and in 1984 generated its first electricity from burning oil shale.&lt;ref name="unit"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;  The unit functioned only around 2000 hours per year between 1984 and 1988 until it was shut down, its main generator having broken down and was sent to Bucharest for repairs, only for it to be sent to Rovinari in 1990. Eventually between 2003 and 2009, most of the power station was demolished and slowly sold for scrap.&lt;ref name="unit"/&gt;  The station also had a {{convert|220|m|ft}} tall [[flue gas stack]] that was at the time Romania's second tallest.&lt;ref name="unit"/&gt;

[[Image:BLEgerton3028Fol30rStonehengeCropped.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest known depiction of Stonehenge, a giant helps [[Merlin]] build Stonehenge. From a manuscript of the ''[[Roman de Brut|Brut]]'' by [[Wace]] in the [[British Library]] (Egerton 3028), 2nd quarter of the 14th Century AD. Belief in, and depiction of, Arthurian legend was common in this period.]]
The Prehistoric landmark of '''[[Stonehenge]]''' is distinctive and famous enough to have become frequently referenced in popular culture. The landmark has become a symbol of British culture and history, owing to its distinctiveness and its long history of being portrayed in art, literature and advertising campaigns, as well as modern media formats, such as television, film and computer games.  This is in part because the arrangement of standing stones topped with lintels is unique, not just in the British Isles, but in the world.

==Art and mythology==
[[File:Stonehenge Stukley Oxford 03543.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|"Druids sacrificing to the Sun in their temple called Stonehenge", a 1722 engraving of the site as imagined by [[William Stukeley]]]]
The interest in 'ancient' Britain can be traced back to the sixteenth and seventeenth century, following the pioneering work of the likes of [[William Camden]], [[John Aubrey]] and [[John Evelyn]].  The rediscovery of Britain's past was also tied up in the nation's emerging sense of importance as an international power.  [[Antiquarians]] and [[archaeologists]], notably [[William Stukeley]], were conducting excavations of megalithic sites, including Stonehenge and the nearby [[Avebury]].  Their findings caused considerable debate on the history and meaning of such sites, and the earliest depictions reflected a search for a mystical explanation.

Earlier explanations, including the view proposed by [[Inigo Jones]] in 1630, that Stonehenge was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] such was its sophistication and beauty, were disproved in the late seventeenth century.  It was proven that Stonehenge was the work of indigenous neolithic peoples.  From this period onwards artists made images of [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, [[standing stone]]s and excavated objects which increasingly drew on highly imaginative ideas about the prehistoric people that created them.  These helped to create the image of Britain that a broadening audience was becoming aware of through illustrated books, prints and maps.  Poets and other writers deepened the impact of this visual material by imagining ancient pasts and mythologising the distant roots of the growing [[British Empire]].  Debates about British ancestry and national identity saw a growing conviction that the British were an ancient people, and that the newly named '[[United Kingdom]]', might find greater harmony through searching for a common past.  For the English, this past was to be found in the West, starting around Stonehenge and stretching into the ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] regions of [[Wales]] and [[Cornwall]].
[[Image:John Constable Stonehenge.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[John Constable|Constable]]'s portrayal of Stonehenge]]
[[Image:Stonehenge Turner.JPG|thumb|left|275px|[[JMW Turner|Turner]]'s depiction of the monument (1825-28)]]
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|280px|The Arcadian or Pastoral State, second painting in The Course of Empire by [[Thomas Cole]] (1836), depicts a stonehenge like structure in a distance.]]
During the early nineteenth century it was artists such as [[John Constable]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]] who helped to make the megalithic sites a part of the popular imagination and understanding of Britain's past.  The philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] proposed the idea of the 'sublime' sense as being evoked by 'feelings of danger and terror, obscurity and power, in art as well as life'.  This was already a feature of artistic and literary works of the period, and provided the theoretical basis for a growing appreciation of desolate landscapes and ancient ruins.  For these reasons Stonehenge became of particular interest for artists.  Burke himself wrote &lt;blockquote&gt;"Stonehenge, neither for disposition nor ornament, has anything admirable; but those huge rude masses of stone, set end on end, and piled high on each other, turn the mind on the immense force necessary for such a work."&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The very nature of the barren [[Wiltshire]] landscape, and [[Salisbury Plain]] became particularly notable for the apparently miraculous powers that created Stonehenge.  [[William Wordsworth]] wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pile of Stone-henge!  So proud to hint yet keep&lt;br&gt;Thy secrets, thou lov'st to stand and hear&lt;br&gt;The plain resounding to the whirlwind's sweep&lt;br&gt;Inmate of lonesome Nature's endless year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:HMS Stonehenge.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[British S class submarine (1931)|S Class submarine]] [[HMS Stonehenge (P232)|HMS ''Stonehenge'']]]] 
Turner and Constables' paintings were arranged for a [[romanticism|romantic]] effect and deviated from the actual state of the stones.  Turner particularly added stones that were not there in reality, and those that were, were incorrect in their dimensions.  Throughout the nineteenth century, a new motive emerged in the depictions of Stonehenge, that of an anti-pagan approach, with paintings by the likes of [[William Overend Geller]], with his painting ''The Druid's Sacrifice'' in 1832.  In the novel "[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]" by [[Thomas Hardy]], the main character, Tess, is captured by the police at Stonehenge, the 'heathen' nature of the setting being used to highlight the character's temperament.

The image of Stonehenge became adapted in the twentieth century by those wishing to advertise using a monument viewed as a symbol of Britain.  The [[Royal Navy]] exploited this sense of identification by naming an [[S-class destroyer (1917)|S class destroyer]] and one of their [[British S class submarine (1931)|S Class submarines]] ''[[HMS Stonehenge]]''.  The [[Shell Oil Company]] commissioned the artist [[Edward McKnight Kauffer]] to paint a series of posters during the interwar period, to be used to encourage tourism by car owners.  Stonehenge was one of those depicted.

==In contemporary popular culture==
[[Image:Stonehenge84.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 1984 Stonehenge Free Festival]]
By now a powerful and instantly recognisable symbol, the monument was featured in a wide number of ways.  [[The Beatles]] are seen performing on Salisbury Plain with Stonehenge visible in the background in their 1965 film ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]''.  The site has also been used for concerts, starting with the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in 1972.  [[Hawkwind]] regularly performed at the festival and their 1976 "Atomhenge" tour featured a stage set that replicated the monument.&lt;ref name=pagans&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gcXoBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|title=Pop Pagans: Paganism and Popular Music|page=31|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black Sabbath]]'s 1983 album ''Born Again'' featured an instrumental called "Stonehenge", which led manager [[Don Arden]] to suggest a stage set based upon the stones. The plans were mistakenly labelled in metres not feet, so that when the stage set was erected it was three times the desired size - dwarfing the band. The set was only used once, and the incident was famously parodied in the 1984 [[mockumentary]] film ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'' which featured the titular fictional rock band performing a song named "Stonehenge" on stage. In one of the many embarrassing events on their comeback tour, confusion about abbreviating inches and feet results in a Stonehenge replica so small that it was in danger of being trod upon by the [[Dwarfism|Little People]] hired to dance around it.&lt;ref name=pagans /&gt;

The monument continues to be featured in film, television and radio, either to question the origin or history of Stonehenge, or to play upon its position as an instantly recognisable structure and symbol of Britain.  In books by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[S. M. Stirling]] amongst others, alternative theories are suggested and explored as part of the larger plot.  The monument has also become popular in [[computer games]], where alternative uses are often posited for Stonehenge, or its iconic nature is explored.

Stonehenge features prominently in [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s novel ''[[Hawksmoor (novel)|Hawksmoor]]'' (1985).

[[Ylvis]]' song "Stonehenge" is a [[paean]] to the monument. The lyrics question the motivation and methods of the builders, asking "What's the purpose of Stonehenge? A giant granite birthday cake or a prison far too easy to escape?"&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|mbyzgeee2mg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stonehenge plays a big role in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" and "[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]".

The final scenes of Roman Polanski's film ''Tess''(1979) based on the novel ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles'' by Thomas Hardy, takes place at Stonehenge.  The title character is apprehended by police at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tess (1979 film)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the BBC comedy show ''[[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen at Large]]'' a sketch shows Dave Allen at the stones, and bored with the tourist guide lecturing rests and lights up a cigarette and leaning against one of the rocks, sending them toppling over.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The villain of the 1982 science fiction-horror film ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' steals Stonehenge and puts pieces of it into masks which have the ability to turn people's heads into bugs and snakes.

In the cult horror movie ''[[Troll 2]]'', a piece of Stonehenge gave the vegetarian antagonists nefarious power until the young hero eats a "double-decker" baloney sandwich to destroy it.

In the 1957 cult horror classic ''[[Curse of the Demon]]'', the lead character, played by Dana Andrews, transcribes runes along Stonehenge, which is also mentioned in ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' song "Science-Fiction", with the lyrics stating: "Dana Andrews said 'Prunes!' gave him the runes."

In a scene from the 1985 comedy film ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'', Clark Griswold backs a hired [[Austin Maxi]] into one of the stones, creating a domino effect on all the upright stones.

In the 2002 animated film [[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]], the main characters pass by Stonehenge during their journey. Manny, a woolly mammoth, dismisses Stonehenge as mere "modern architecture",  commenting "it'll never last".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268380/quotes|website=IMDB|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the venues in the 2006 rhythm game ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' takes place at Stonehenge, echoing the above ''Spinal Tap'' example.

In an episode of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' called ''Spongehenge'' SpongeBob creates a large monument of stone sponges similar to Stonehenge in order to distract jellyfish.

Stonehenge Base in the game ''[[EarthBound]]'' is a direct reference to Stonehenge.
{{commonscat|Stonehenge in art}}

There is an episode of ''[[Uchu Sentai Kyuranger]]'' where the great heroes must facing a Stonehenge Themed Monster.

In ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'', Stonehenge was the center point of [[Unicron|Unicron's]] six horns, during the [[Pangaea]] era, where the horns were in a circular formation.

In his song "[[Elvis Is Everywhere]]", [[Mojo Nixon]] begs the question "Who built Stonehenge?", which the chorus emphatically answers "[[Elvis]]!"

In [[electromagnetism]], '''current density''' is the [[electric current]] per unit area of cross section. The '''current density vector''' is defined as a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] whose magnitude is the [[electric current]] per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its direction being that of the motion of the charges at this point. In [[SI unit]]s, the electric current density is measured in [[ampere]]s per [[square metre]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Assume that ''A'' (SI unit: [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a small surface centred at a given point ''M'' and orthogonal to the motion of the charges at ''M''. If ''I''{{sub|''A''}} (SI unit: [[ampere|A]]) is the [[electric current]] flowing through ''A'', then '''electric current density''' ''J'' at ''M'' is given by the [[limit of a function|limit]]:&lt;ref&gt;Essential Principles of Physics, P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, {{ISBN|0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J = \lim\limits_{A \rightarrow 0}\frac{I_A}{A},&lt;/math&gt;

with surface ''A'' remaining centred at ''M'' and orthogonal to the motion of the charges during the limit process.

The '''current density vector''' '''J''' is the vector whose magnitude is the electric current density, and whose direction is the same as the motion of the charges at ''M''.

At a given time ''t'', if '''v''' is the speed of the charges at ''M'', and ''dA'' is an infinitesimal surface centred at ''M'' and orthogonal to '''v''', then during an amount of time ''dt'', only the charge contained in the volume formed by ''dA'' and {{nowrap|1='''l''' = '''v''' ''dt''}} will flow through ''dA''. This charge is equal to {{nowrap|''ρ'' {{!!}}''v''{{!!}} d''t'' d''A''}}, where ''ρ'' is the charge density at ''M'', and the electric current at ''M'' is {{nowrap|1=''I'' = ''ρ'' {{!!}}''v''{{!!}} ''dA''}}. It follows that the current density vector can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;J = \rho \mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[surface integral]] of '''J''' over a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] ''S'', followed by an integral over the time duration ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, gives the total amount of charge flowing through the surface in that time ({{nowrap|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}):

:&lt;math&gt;q=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\iint_S \mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\,{\rm d}A{\rm d}t. &lt;/math&gt;

More concisely, this is the integral of the [[flux]] of '''J''' across ''S'' between ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[area]] required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. For example, for charge carriers passing through an [[electrical conductor]], the area is the cross-section of the conductor, at the section considered.

The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the charge carriers pass, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the current density '''J''' passes through the area at an angle ''θ'' to the area normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}= J\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

where '''⋅''' is the [[dot product]] of the unit vectors. That is, the component of current density passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is {{nowrap|''J'' cos ''θ''}}, while the component of current density passing tangential to the area is {{nowrap|''J'' sin ''θ''}}, but there is ''no'' current density actually passing ''through'' the area in the tangential direction. The ''only'' component of current density passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

==Importance==
Current density is important to the design of electrical and [[electronics|electronic]] systems.

Circuit performance depends strongly upon the designed current level, and the current density then is determined by the dimensions of the conducting elements. For example, as [[integrated circuit]]s are reduced in size, despite the lower current demanded by smaller [[semiconductor devices|devices]], there is a trend toward higher current densities to achieve higher device numbers in ever smaller [[semiconductor chip|chip]] areas. See [[Moore's law]].

At high frequencies, the conducting region in a wire becomes confined near its surface which increases the current density in this region. This is known as the [[skin effect]].  

High current densities have undesirable consequences. Most electrical conductors have a finite, positive [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], making them dissipate [[Power (physics)|power]] in the form of heat.  The current density must be kept sufficiently low to prevent the conductor from melting or burning up, the [[electrical insulator|insulating material]] failing, or the desired electrical properties changing. At high current densities the material forming the interconnections actually moves, a phenomenon called ''[[electromigration]]''.  In [[superconductivity|superconductors]] excessive current density may generate a strong enough magnetic field to cause spontaneous loss of the superconductive property.

The analysis and observation of current density also is used to probe the physics underlying the nature of solids, including not only metals, but also semiconductors and insulators. An elaborate theoretical formalism has developed to explain many fundamental observations.&lt;ref name= Martin&gt;{{cite book |title=Electronic Structure:Basic theory and practical methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmRTFLpSGNsC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=isbn=0-521-78285-6#PPA369,M1 |author=Richard P Martin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-78285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Altland&gt;{{cite book |title=Condensed Matter Field Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KMkfAMe3JkC&amp;pg=RA4-PA557&amp;dq=isbn=978-0-521-84508-3#PRA2-PA378,M1  |author=Alexander Altland &amp; Ben Simons |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-84508-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current density is an important parameter in [[Ampère's circuital law]] (one of [[Maxwell's equations]]), which relates current density to [[magnetic field]].

In [[special relativity]] theory, charge and current are combined into a [[4-vector]].

==Calculation of current densities in matter==

===Free currents===
Charge carriers which are free to move constitute a [[free current]] density, which are given by expressions such as those in this section.

Electric current is a coarse, average quantity that tells what is happening in an entire wire. At position '''r''' at time ''t'', the ''distribution'' of [[electric charge|charge]] flowing is described by the current density:&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas, G. Woan, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \rho(\mathbf{r},t) \; \mathbf{v}_\text{d} (\mathbf{r},t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J'''('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the current density vector, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the particles' average [[drift velocity]] (SI unit: [[metre|m]]∙[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)= qn(\mathbf{r},t) &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[charge density]] (SI unit: coulombs per [[cubic metre]]), in which ''n''('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the number of particles per unit volume ("number density") (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ''q'' is the charge of the individual particles with density ''n'' (SI unit: [[coulomb]]s).

A common approximation to the current density assumes the current simply is proportional to the electric field, as expressed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and ''σ'' is the [[electrical conductivity]].

Conductivity ''σ'' is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] ([[invertible matrix|inverse]]) of electrical [[resistivity]] and has the SI units of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per [[metre]] (S⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and '''E''' has the [[SI]] units of [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[coulomb]] (N⋅C&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) or, equivalently, [[volt]]s per [[metre]] (V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

A more fundamental approach to calculation of current density is based upon:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}, t) =  \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}t' \int \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r}' \; \sigma(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}', t-t') \; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}',\ t') \, &lt;/math&gt;

indicating the lag in response by the time dependence of ''σ'', and the non-local nature of response to the field by the spatial dependence of ''σ'', both calculated in principle from an underlying microscopic analysis, for example, in the case of small enough fields, the [[linear response function]] for the conductive behaviour in the material. See, for example, Giuliani or Rammer.&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid |author=Gabriele Giuliani, Giovanni Vignale |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&amp;pg=PA538&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance#PPA111,M1 |isbn=0-521-82112-6 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rammer&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Field Theory of Non-equilibrium States |author=Jørgen Rammer |page=158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7TbrAm5Wq0C&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance#PPA158,M1 |isbn=0-521-87499-8 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time.

The above conductivity and its associated current density reflect the fundamental mechanisms underlying charge transport in the medium, both in time and over distance.

A [[Fourier transform]] in space and time then results in:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} (\mathbf{k}, \omega) = \sigma(\mathbf{k}, \omega) \; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{k}, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ''('''k''',&amp;thinsp;''ω'') is now a [[Complex function#Complex functions|complex function]].

In many materials, for example, in crystalline materials, the conductivity is a [[tensor]], and the current is not necessarily in the same direction as the applied field. Aside from the material properties themselves, the application of magnetic fields can alter conductive behaviour.

===Polarization and magnetization currents===
Currents arise in materials when there is a non-uniform distribution of charge.&lt;ref name="Electromagnetism 2008"&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[dielectric]] materials, there is a current density corresponding to the net movement of [[electric dipole moment]]s per unit volume, i.e. the [[polarization density|polarization]] '''P''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{P}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly with [[magnetic materials]], circulations of the [[magnetic dipole moment]]s per unit volume, i.e. the [[magnetization]] '''M,''' lead to [[magnetization current]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herczynski|first=Andrzej|date=2013|year=|title=Bound charges and currents|url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/physics/pdf/herczynski/AJP-81-202.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physics|publisher=the American Association of Physics Teachers|publication-date=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1119/1.4773441|bibcode=2013AmJPh..81..202H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{M}=\nabla\times\mathbf{M} &lt;/math&gt;

Together, these terms add up to form the [[bound current]] density in the material (resultant current due to movements of electric and magnetic dipole moments per unit volume):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{b}=\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{P}+\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{M} &lt;/math&gt;

===Total current in materials===

The total current is simply the sum of the free and bound currents:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}_\mathrm{f}+\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{b} &lt;/math&gt;

===Displacement current===
There is also a [[displacement current]] corresponding to the time-varying [[electric displacement field]] '''D''':&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, {{ISBN|81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Physics for Scientists and Engineers - with Modern Physics (6th Edition), P. A. Tipler, G. Mosca, Freeman, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7167-8964-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{D}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

which is an important term in [[Ampere's circuital law]], one of Maxwell's equations, since absence of this term would not predict [[electromagnetic waves]] to propagate, or the time evolution of [[electric field]]s in general.

== Continuity equation ==
{{main|Continuity equation}}
Since charge is conserved, current density must satisfy a [[continuity equation]]. Here is a derivation from first principles.&lt;ref name="Electromagnetism 2008"/&gt;

The net flow out of some volume ''V'' (which can have an arbitrary shape but fixed for the calculation) must equal the net change in charge held inside the volume:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S{ \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int_V{\rho \; \mathrm{d}V} = - \int_V{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\;\mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the [[charge density]], and ''d'''A''''' is a [[surface integral|surface element]] of the surface ''S'' enclosing the volume ''V''. The surface integral on the left expresses the current ''outflow'' from the volume, and the negatively signed [[volume integral]] on the right expresses the ''decrease'' in the total charge inside the volume. From the [[divergence theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S{ \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}} = \int_V{\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{J}\;  \mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V{\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{J}\; \mathrm{d}V}\ = - \int_V{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \;\mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

This relation is valid for any volume, independent of size or location, which implies that:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = - \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

and this relation is called the [[continuity equation]].&lt;ref name=Chow&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory: A modern perspective |author = Tai L Chow |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=isbn=0-7637-3827-1#PPA204,M1 |isbn=0-7637-3827-1 |year=2006 |pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book |author= Griffiths, D.J. |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |page=213 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |year=1999 |isbn=0-13-805326-X |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In practice ==
In [[electrical wiring]], the maximum current density can vary from 4&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for a wire with no air circulation around it,  to 6&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for a wire in free air. Regulations for [[building wiring]] list the maximum allowed current of each size of cable in differing conditions. For compact designs, such as windings of [[Switched-mode power supply|SMPS transformers]], the value might be as low as 2&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A. Pressman |display-authors=etal |title=Switching power supply design |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-148272-1 |year=2009 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the wire is carrying high frequency currents, the [[skin effect]] may affect the distribution of the current across the section by concentrating the current on the surface of the [[electrical conductor|conductor]]. In [[transformer]]s designed for high frequencies, loss is reduced if [[Litz wire]] is used for the windings. This is made of multiple isolated wires in parallel with a diameter twice the [[skin depth]]. The isolated strands are twisted together to increase the total skin area and to reduce the [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] due to skin effects.

For the top and bottom layers of [[printed circuit boards]],  the maximum current density can be as high as 35&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a copper thickness of 35&amp;nbsp;μm. Inner layers cannot dissipate as much heat as outer layers; designers of circuit  boards avoid putting high-current traces on inner layers.

In the [[semiconductors]] field, the maximum current densities for different elements are given by the manufacturer. Exceeding those limits raises the following problems:
* The [[Joule heating|joule effect]] which increases the temperature of the component.
* The [[electromigration|electromigration effect]] which will erode the interconnection and eventually cause an open circuit.
* The slow [[diffusion|diffusion effect]] which, if exposed to high temperatures continuously, will move metallic ions and [[Doping_(semiconductor)|dopants]] away from where they should be. This effect is also synonym to ageing.

The following table gives an idea of the maximum current density for various materials.

Even if manufacturers add some margin to their numbers, it is recommended to, at least, double the calculated section to improve the reliability, especially for high quality electronics. One can also notice the importance to keep electronic devices cool to avoid them to be exposed to [[electromigration]] and slow [[diffusion]].

In [[biological organism]]s, [[ion channel]]s regulate the flow of [[ion]]s (for example, [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]]) across the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] in all [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Current density is measured in pA⋅pF&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Metric prefix|pico]][[ampere]]s per [[Metric prefix|pico]][[farad]]), that is, current divided by [[capacitance]], a de facto measure of membrane area.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

In [[gas discharge lamp]]s, such as [[flashlamp]]s, current density plays an important role in the output [[spectroscopy|spectrum]] produced. Low current densities produce [[spectral line]] [[emission spectrum|emission]] and tend to favour longer [[wavelength]]s. High current densities produce continuum emission and tend to favour shorter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/5654/1/V71N06_343.pdf Xenon lamp photocathodes]&lt;/ref&gt; Low current densities for flash lamps are generally around 10&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. High current densities can be more than 40&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''A diffuser-augmented wind turbine (DAWT)''' is a wind turbine modified with a cone-shaped wind diffuser that is used to increase the efficiency of converting wind power to electrical power. The increased efficiency is possible due to the increased wind speeds the diffuser can provide. In traditional bare turbines, the rotor blades are vertically mounted at the top of a support tower or shaft. In a DAWT, the rotor blades are mounted within the diffuser, which is then placed on the top of the support tower. Additional modifications can be made to the diffuser in order to further increase efficiency.  &lt;!-- longer intro and better worded definition? --&gt;&lt;!-- pictures --&gt;&lt;!-- Overall, I think you should go more in depth about the benefits of this new turban design. Add some visuals to make it easier to visualize and understand. Especially when talking about equations and relationships. More wikilinks to other pages. More sources. --&gt;

== Mechanics &lt;!-- kind of sounds like an advertisement here? maybe try to say "benefits of new design" or something more neutral --&gt; ==
Wind power measures how much energy is available in the wind, and it can be represented by the following equation &lt;math&gt;w=(1/2)rAv^3&lt;/math&gt; where r is air density, A is rotor area, and V is wind velocity.&lt;ref name='iowa'&gt;[http://www.iowaenergycenter.org/wind-energy-manual/wind-and-wind-power/wind-speed-and-power/ "Wind Speed and Power."] Iowa Energy Center. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the amount of energy available in the wind is directly proportional to the wind speed cubed.&lt;ref name='ohya'/&gt; For example, assuming that all other variables are held constant, doubling the wind speed would increase the available energy in the wind by 8 times.&lt;ref name='iowa'/&gt; A slight increase in wind speed results in dramatic increases in wind power. Unfortunately, this means that if the wind speeds were to slow down even slightly, it would drastically reduce wind power.

== Designs ==
Most designs include a cone-shaped diffuser with the purpose of increasing the velocity of the air as it travels through the turbine. In order for this to be possible, the exit hole of the diffuser must be larger than the entrance hole to properly diffuse the air. As wind flows through the diffuser, it travels along the walls, which causes the exiting wind to form vortices of wind when exiting. These vortices cause most of the air to be diffused away from the center of the exit, which creates a low pressure segment of air behind the turbine. The pressure difference accelerates the high pressure air in the front towards the low pressure air in the back, causing a significant increase in speed.&lt;ref name='ohya'/&gt; If the diffuser were to instead have an exit hole smaller than its entrance, then the opposite effects would be achieved. A high-pressure area would be formed at the exit, severely restricting airflow through the diffuser. Additional designs take the basic diffuser and make additional modifications to further increase power generation.

=== Wind lens ===
A design by Yuji Ohya, a professor at Kyushu University, further modified the diffuser by adding a broad ring around the exit hole and an inlet shroud at the entrance—a "[[wind lens]]". This design amplifies the positive effects of a normal diffuser shroud to result in a more efficient diffuser. The brimmed exit hole creates stronger vortices than a regular diffuser, which means that the pressure difference is greater than it would be with a normal diffuser.&lt;ref name='ohya'/&gt; As a result, wind is able to reach higher speeds. In addition, the inlet shroud at the entrance makes it easier for air to enter, so air will not be slowed down as much going in.&lt;ref name="ohya" /&gt;

=== Multi-rotor design ===
Other designs are very similar to a diffuser but consist of multiple rotors within it to capture as much electrical energy form the wind. One way to generate more energy would be to increase the rotor area, which can be done in two ways. One way is to increase the diameter of a single rotor, however, this causes unfavorable gains in mass. Another way is to increase the number of rotors per turbine, which does not cause undesirable increases in weight. Systems with up to 45 rotors in one turbine have been tested, and no negative interference has been found between the rotors.&lt;ref name="iop"&gt;Göltenbott, U., et al. [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/753/2/022038/pdf "Flow interaction of diffuser augmented wind turbines."] Journal of Physics: Conference Series, vol. 753, 2016. IOPscience, doi:10.1088/1742-6596/753/2/022038. Accessed 17 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
Turbines equipped with a diffuser-shaped shroud and a broad exit ring generate 2–5 times more power than bare wind turbines for any given wind speed or turbine diameter.&lt;ref name="ohya"&gt;Ohya, Yuji, and Takashi Karasudani. [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/3/4/634/htm "A Shrouded Wind Turbine Generating High Output Power with Wind-lens Technology."] Energies, vol. 3, no. 4, 21 March 2010, pp. 634–49. Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, doi:10.3390/en3040634. Accessed 10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis concludes that the Betz's limit can be exceed if the wind turbine were to be equipped with a diffuser. For multi-rotor turbines equipped with a diffuser, the power augmentation is smaller, but still favorable at around 5%–9% increase.&lt;ref name='iop' /&gt;

== Limitations of traditional turbines &lt;!-- limitations of the old design --&gt; ==
Bare wind turbines have several limitations that decrease their efficiency in generating electricity. These limitations play a big role when it comes to mass production of energy. &lt;!-- maybe change it to be more active voice? "however, bare wind turbines have several limitations the decrease their efficiency in producing electricity." --&gt;

=== Manufacturing &lt;!-- pictures of old open blade turbines and how they work? --&gt; ===
The amount of energy that a bare wind turbine can generate is largely dependent on how big the rotor is, which implies that the bigger a turbine is, the more energy it will produce. However, using large turbines results in heavy overall weights and high manufacturing costs. Heavier turbines are also prone to higher malfunction rates which results in higher maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="iop" /&gt;  In addition, the bigger the turbine is, the more resources that will have to be invested in transporting the massive parts from the factory to where they will be deployed. This is very rarely a viable option since it defeats the whole purpose of affordable alternative energy. &lt;!-- good rationalization and logic through this whole paragraph  --&gt;

=== Betz's law ===
In addition to manufacturing limitations, there exist limits within the laws of physics that govern how much energy can be generated. Traditional open turbine designs are also limited by [[Betz's law]], which states that for a bare turbine in open wind, no more than 16/27 of the total wind kinetic energy can be converted to electrical energy.&lt;ref name="hansen"&gt;Hansen, M. O. L., et al. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/we.37/epdf "Effect of Placing a Diffuser around a Wind Turbine."] Wind Energy, vol. 3, no. 4, October/December 2000, pp. 207–13. Wiley Online Library, DOI:10.1002/we.37. Accessed 10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 59% is not the most efficient rate, so several designs have been made in order to get around this limitation. Designs include the addition of a "Wind-Lens" or using multiple rotors within the diffuser.

The '''Einstein solid''' is a model of a solid based on two assumptions:
* Each atom in the lattice is an independent 3D [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]
* All atoms oscillate with the same frequency (contrast with the [[Debye model]])

While the assumption that a solid has independent oscillations is very accurate, these oscillations are sound waves or [[phonons]], collective modes involving many atoms. In the Einstein model, however, each atom oscillates independently. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Mandl|first=F.|title=Statistical Physics|edition=2nd|year=1988|orig-year=1971|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; sons]]|location=Chichester·New York·Brisbane·Toronto·Singapore|isbn=978-0471915331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical impact ==
The original theory proposed by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1907 has great historical relevance. The [[heat capacity]] of [[solid]]s as predicted by the empirical [[Dulong–Petit law]] was required by [[classical mechanics]], the specific heat of solids should be independent of temperature. But experiments at low temperatures showed that the heat capacity changes, going to zero at absolute zero. As the temperature goes up, the specific heat goes up until it approaches the Dulong and Petit prediction at high temperature.

By employing Planck's [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] assumption, Einstein's theory accounted for the observed experimental trend for the first time. Together with the [[photoelectric effect]], this became one of the most important pieces of evidence for the need of quantization. Einstein used the levels of the quantum mechanical oscillator many years before the advent of modern [[quantum mechanics]].

== Einstein's theory of specific heats ==

In Einstein's model, the specific heat approaches zero exponentially fast at low temperatures. This is because all the oscillations have one common frequency. The correct behavior is found by quantizing the [[normal modes]] of the solid in the same way that Einstein suggested. Then the frequencies of the waves are not all the same, and the specific heat goes to zero as a &lt;math&gt;T^3&lt;/math&gt; power law, which matches experiment. This modification is called the [[Debye model]], which appeared in 1912.

When [[Walther Nernst]] learned of Einstein's 1906 paper on specific heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Einstein|journal=Annalen der Physik|series=4|volume=22|pages=180&amp;ndash;190, 800|title=Theorie der Strahlung und die Theorie der Spezifischen Wärme|trans-title=Planck's theory of radiation and the theory of specific heat|year=1906|url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/228|access-date=2016-03-18|bibcode = 1906AnP...327..180E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19063270110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was so excited that he traveled all the way from Berlin to Zürich to meet with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian|last=Stone|first=A. D.|year=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-13968-5|pages=146|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10068.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat capacity (microcanonical ensemble)==
[[File:Escv.png|thumb|Heat capacity of an '''Einstein solid''' as a function of temperature. Experimental value of 3''Nk'' is recovered at high temperatures.|right|300px]]
The [[heat capacity]] of an object at constant volume ''V'' is defined through the [[internal energy]] ''U'' as

:&lt;math&gt;C_V = \left({\partial U\over\partial T}\right)_V.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the temperature of the system, can be found from the [[entropy]]

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over T} = {\partial S\over\partial U}.&lt;/math&gt;

To find the entropy consider a solid made of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; atoms, each of which has 3 degrees of freedom. So there are &lt;math&gt;3N&lt;/math&gt; [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s (hereafter SHOs for "Simple Harmonic Oscillators").

:&lt;math&gt;N^{\prime} = 3N&lt;/math&gt;

Possible energies of an SHO are given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n+{1\over2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or, in other words, the energy levels are evenly spaced and one can define a ''quantum'' of energy

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt;

which is the smallest and only amount by which the energy of an SHO is increased.  Next, we must compute the multiplicity of the system.  That is, compute the number of ways to distribute &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; quanta of energy among &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; SHOs.  This task becomes simpler if one thinks of distributing &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; pebbles over &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; boxes

::[[File:Einstein solids 1.svg]]

or separating stacks of pebbles with &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}-1&lt;/math&gt; partitions

::[[File:Einstein solids 2.svg]]

or arranging &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; pebbles and &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}-1&lt;/math&gt; partitions

:::[[File:Einstein solids 3.svg]]

The last picture is the most telling.  The number of arrangements of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;objects is &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;.  So the number of possible arrangements of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; pebbles and &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}-1&lt;/math&gt; partitions is &lt;math&gt;\left(q+N^{\prime}-1\right)!&lt;/math&gt;.  However, if partition #3 and partition #5 trade places, no one would notice.  The same argument goes for quanta.  To obtain the number of possible ''distinguishable'' arrangements one has to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ''indistinguishable'' arrangements.  There are &lt;math&gt;q!&lt;/math&gt; identical quanta arrangements, and &lt;math&gt;(N^{\prime}-1)!&lt;/math&gt; identical partition arrangements.  Therefore, multiplicity of the system is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = {\left(q+N^{\prime}-1\right)!\over q! (N^{\prime}-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;

which, as mentioned before, is the number of ways to deposit &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; quanta of energy into &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; oscillators.  [[Entropy]] of the system has the form

:&lt;math&gt;S/k = \ln\Omega = \ln{\left(q+N^{\prime}-1\right)!\over q! (N^{\prime}-1)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is a huge number&amp;mdash;subtracting one from it has no overall effect whatsoever:

:&lt;math&gt;S/k \approx \ln{\left(q+N^{\prime}\right)!\over q! N^{\prime}!}&lt;/math&gt;

With the help of [[Stirling's approximation]], entropy can be simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;S/k \approx \left(q+N^{\prime}\right)\ln\left(q+N^{\prime}\right)-N^{\prime}\ln N^{\prime}-q\ln q.&lt;/math&gt;

Total energy of the solid is given by

:&lt;math&gt;U = {N^{\prime}\varepsilon\over2} + q\varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;

since there are q energy quanta in total in the system in addition to the ground state energy of each oscillator. Some authors, such as Schroeder, omit this ground state energy in their definition of the total energy of an Einstein solid.

We are now ready to compute the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over T} = {\partial S\over\partial U} = {\partial S\over\partial q}{dq\over dU} = {1\over\varepsilon}{\partial S\over\partial q} = {k\over\varepsilon} \ln\left(1+N^{\prime}/q\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Elimination of q between the two preceding formulas gives for U:

:&lt;math&gt;U = {N^{\prime}\varepsilon\over2} + {N^{\prime}\varepsilon\over e^{\varepsilon/kT}-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is associated with zero point energy and does not contribute to specific heat. It will therefore be lost in the next step.

Differentiating with respect to temperature to find &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;C_V = {\partial U\over\partial T} = {N^{\prime}\varepsilon^2\over k T^2}{e^{\varepsilon/kT}\over \left(e^{\varepsilon/kT}-1\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_V = 3Nk\left({\varepsilon\over k T}\right)^2{e^{\varepsilon/kT}\over \left(e^{\varepsilon/kT}-1\right)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the Einstein model of the solid predicts the heat capacity accurately at high temperatures, it noticeably deviates from experimental values at low temperatures.  See [[Debye model]] for how to calculate accurate low-temperature heat capacities.

==Heat capacity (canonical ensemble)==
Heat capacity is obtained through the use of the [[canonical partition function]] of a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO).

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-E_n/kT}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;E_n = \varepsilon\left(n+{1\over2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

substituting this into the partition function formula yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-\varepsilon\left(n+1/2\right)/kT} = e^{-\varepsilon/2kT} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-n\varepsilon/kT}=e^{-\varepsilon/2kT} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(e^{-\varepsilon/kT}\right)^n \\
= {e^{-\varepsilon/2kT}\over 1-e^{-\varepsilon/kT}} = {1\over e^{\varepsilon/2kT}-e^{-\varepsilon/2kT}} = {1\over 2 \sinh\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the partition function of ''one'' SHO.  Because, statistically, heat capacity, energy, and entropy of the solid are equally distributed among its atoms (SHOs), we can work with this partition function to obtain those quantities and then simply multiply them by &lt;math&gt;N^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; to get the total.  Next, let's compute the average energy of each oscillator

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E\rangle = U = -{1\over Z}\partial_{\beta}Z&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = {1\over kT}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;U = -2 \sinh\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right){-\cosh\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right)\over 2 \sinh^2\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right)}{\varepsilon\over2} = {\varepsilon\over2}\coth\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Heat capacity of ''one'' oscillator is then

:&lt;math&gt;c_V = {\partial U\over\partial T} = -{\varepsilon\over2} {1\over \sinh^2\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right)}\left(-{\varepsilon\over 2kT^2}\right) = k \left({\varepsilon\over 2 k T}\right)^2 {1\over \sinh^2\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Up to now, we calculated the heat capacity of a unique degree of freedom, which has been modeled as an SHO. The heat capacity of the entire solid is then given by &lt;math&gt;C_V = 3Nc_V&lt;/math&gt;, where the total number of degree of freedom of the solid is three (for the three directional degree of freedom) times &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of atoms in the solid. One thus obtains

&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_V = 3Nk\left({\varepsilon\over 2 k T}\right)^2 {1\over \sinh^2\left({\varepsilon\over 2kT}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which is algebraically identical to the formula derived in the previous section.

The quantity &lt;math&gt;T_E=\varepsilon / k&lt;/math&gt; has the dimensions of temperature and is a characteristic property of a crystal. It is known as the '''Einstein temperature'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, the [[Debye model#Debye versus Einstein|Debye model]] predicts a universal function of the ratio &lt;math&gt;T/T_D&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[solid-state physics]], the '''electronic band structure''' (or simply '''band structure''') of a [[solid]] describes the range of [[energies]] that an [[electron]] within the solid may have (called ''energy bands'', ''allowed bands'', or simply ''bands'') and ranges of energy that it may not have (called ''[[band gap]]s'' or ''forbidden bands'').

'''Band theory''' derives these bands and band gaps by examining the allowed quantum mechanical [[wave function]]s for an electron in a large, periodic lattice of atoms or molecules. Band theory has been successfully used to explain many physical properties of solids, such as [[electrical resistivity]] and [[optical absorption]], and forms the foundation of the understanding of all [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state devices]] (transistors, solar cells, etc.).

==Why bands and band gaps occur==
[[File:Solid state electronic band structure.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Showing how electronic band structure comes about by the hypothetical example of a large number of carbon atoms being brought together to form a diamond crystal.  The graph ''(right)'' shows the energy levels as a function of the spacing between atoms. When the atoms are far apart ''(right side of graph)'' each atom has valence atomic orbitals p and s which have the same energy. However when the atoms come closer together their orbitals begin to overlap. Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle each atomic orbital splits into ''N'' molecular orbitals each with a different energy, where ''N'' is the number of atoms in the crystal. Since ''N'' is such a large number, adjacent orbitals are extremely close together in energy  so the orbitals can be considered a continuous energy band. ''a'' is the atomic spacing in an actual crystal of diamond.  At that spacing the orbitals form two bands, called the valence and conduction bands, with a 5.5&amp;nbsp;eV band gap between them.]]

The electrons of a single, isolated atom occupy [[atomic orbital]]s each of which has a discrete [[energy level]].  When two or more atoms join together to form into a [[molecule]], their atomic orbitals overlap.&lt;ref name="Holgate"&gt;{{cite book

So if two identical atoms combine to form a [[diatomic molecule]], each atomic orbital splits into two [[molecular orbital]]s of different energy, allowing the electrons in the former atomic orbitals to occupy the new orbital structure without any having the same energy.

Similarly if a large number ''N'' of identical atoms come together to form a solid, such as a [[crystal lattice]], the atoms' atomic orbitals overlap.&lt;ref name="Holgate" /&gt;  Since the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that no two electrons in the solid have the same quantum numbers, each atomic orbital splits into ''N'' discrete molecular orbitals, each with a different energy.  Since the number of atoms in a macroscopic piece of solid is a very large number (N~10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) the number of orbitals is very large and thus they are very closely spaced in energy (of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV).  The energy of adjacent levels is so close together that they can be considered as a continuum, an energy band.

This formation of bands is mostly a feature of the outermost electrons ([[valence electron]]s) in the atom, which are the ones involved in chemical bonding and [[electrical conductivity]].  The inner electron orbitals do not overlap to a significant degree, so their bands are very narrow.

[[Band gap]]s are essentially leftover ranges of energy not covered by any band, a result of the finite widths of the energy bands. The bands have different widths, with the widths depending upon the degree of overlap in the [[atomic orbital]]s from which they arise. Two adjacent bands may simply not be wide enough to fully cover the range of energy. For example, the bands associated with core orbitals (such as [[1s electron]]s) are extremely narrow due to the small overlap between adjacent atoms. As a result, there tend to be large band gaps between the core bands. Higher bands involve comparatively larger orbitals with more overlap, becoming progressively wider at higher energies so that there are no band gaps at higher energies.

==Basic concepts==

===Assumptions and limits of band structure theory===
Band theory is only an approximation to the quantum state of a solid, which applies to solids consisting of many identical atoms or molecules bonded together. These are the assumptions necessary for band theory to be valid: 

* ''Infinite-size system'': For the bands to be continuous, the piece of material must consist of a large number of atoms.  Since a macroscopic piece of material contains on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; atoms, this is not a serious restriction; band theory even applies to microscopic-sized [[transistor]]s in [[integrated circuit]]s.    With modifications, the concept of band structure can also be extended to systems which are only "large" along some dimensions, such as [[2DEG|two-dimensional electron system]]s.
* ''Homogeneous system'': Band structure is an intrinsic property of a material, which assumes that the material is homogeneous. Practically, this means that the chemical makeup of the material must be uniform throughout the piece.
* ''Non-interactivity'': The band structure describes "single electron states". The existence of these states assumes that the electrons travel in a static potential without dynamically interacting with [[lattice vibration]]s, other electrons, [[photon]]s, etc.

The above assumptions are broken in a number of important practical situations, and the use of band structure requires one to keep a close check on the limitations of band theory:
* Inhomogeneities and interfaces: Near surfaces, junctions, and other inhomogeneities, the bulk band structure is disrupted. Not only are there local small-scale disruptions (e.g., [[surface states]] or [[dopant]] states inside the band gap), but also local charge imbalances. These charge imbalances have electrostatic effects that extend deeply into semiconductors, insulators, and the vacuum (see [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]], [[band bending]]).
* Along the same lines, most electronic effects ([[capacitance]], [[electrical conductance]], [[electric-field screening]]) involve the physics of electrons passing through surfaces and/or near interfaces. The full description of these effects, in a band structure picture, requires at least a rudimentary model of electron-electron interactions (see [[space charge]], [[band bending]]).
* Small systems: For systems which are small along every dimension (e.g., a small [[molecule]] or a [[quantum dot]]), there is no continuous band structure. The crossover between small and large dimensions is the realm of [[mesoscopic physics]].
* [[Strongly correlated material]]s (for example, [[Mott insulator]]s) simply cannot be understood in terms of single-electron states. The electronic band structures of these materials are poorly defined (or at least, not uniquely defined) and may not provide useful information about their physical state.

===Crystalline symmetry and wavevectors===
[[Image:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|Fig 1. [[Brillouin zone]] of a [[face-centered cubic lattice]] showing labels for special symmetry points.]]
[[Image:Bulkbandstructure.gif|thumb|300 px|Fig 2. Band structure plot for [[silicon|Si]], [[germanium|Ge]], [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]] and [[indium arsenide|InAs]] generated with tight binding model. Note that Si and Ge are indirect band gap materials, while GaAs and InAs are direct.]]

{{main article|Bloch wave|Brillouin zone}}
{{See also|Symmetry in physics|Crystallographic point group|Space group}}
Band structure calculations take advantage of the periodic nature of a crystal lattice, exploiting its symmetry. The single-electron [[Schrödinger equation]] is solved for an electron in a lattice-periodic potential, giving [[Bloch wave]]s as solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})=e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}u_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;,

where '''k''' is called the wavevector. For each value of '''k''', there are multiple solutions to the Schrödinger equation labelled by ''n'', the band index, which simply numbers the energy bands.
Each of these energy levels evolves smoothly with changes in '''k''', forming a smooth band of states. For each band we can define a function ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''k'''), which is the [[dispersion relation]] for electrons in that band.

The wavevector takes on any value inside the [[Brillouin zone]], which is a polyhedron in wavevector space that is related to the crystal's lattice.
Wavevectors outside the Brillouin zone simply correspond to states that are physically identical to those states within the Brillouin zone.
Special high symmetry points/lines in the Brillouin zone are assigned labels like Γ, Δ, Λ, Σ (see Fig 1).

It is difficult to visualize the shape of a band as a function of wavevector, as it would require a plot in four-dimensional space, ''E'' vs. ''k&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''. In scientific literature it is common to see '''band structure plots''' which show the values of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''k''') for values of '''k''' along straight lines connecting symmetry points, often labelled Δ, Λ, Σ, or [[Miller index|[100], [111], and [110]]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioffe.ru/SVA/NSM/Semicond/AlGaAs/bandstr.html Band structure and carrier concentration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpringerBandStructure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Band Structure|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642007095-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-898341-p173918216|website=www.springer.com|publisher=Springer|accessdate=10 November 2016|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method for visualizing band structure is to plot a constant-energy [[isosurface]] in wavevector space, showing all of the states with energy equal to a particular value. The isosurface of states with energy equal to the [[Fermi level]] is known as the [[Fermi surface]].

Energy band gaps can be classified using the wavevectors of the states surrounding the band gap:
* [[Direct band gap]]: the lowest-energy state above the band gap has the same '''k''' as the highest-energy state beneath the band gap.
* [[Indirect band gap]]: the closest states above and beneath the band gap do not have the same '''k''' value.

====Asymmetry: Band structures in non-crystalline solids====

Although electronic band structures are usually associated with [[crystal]]line materials, [[quasi-crystal]]line and [[amorphous solid]]s may also exhibit band structures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These are somewhat more difficult to study theoretically since they lack the simple symmetry of a crystal, and it is not usually possible to determine a precise dispersion relation. As a result, virtually all of the existing theoretical work on the electronic band structure of solids has focused on crystalline materials.

===Density of states===

{{main article|Density of states}}

The density of states function ''g''(''E'') is defined as the number of electronic states per unit volume, per unit energy, for electron energies near ''E''.

The density of states function is important for calculations of effects based on band theory.
In [[Fermi's golden rule|Fermi's Golden Rule]], a calculation for the rate of [[optical absorption]], it provides both the number of excitable electrons and the number of final states for an electron. It appears in calculations of [[electrical conductivity]] where it provides the number of mobile states, and in computing electron scattering rates where it provides the number of final states after scattering.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

For energies inside a band gap, ''g''(''E'') = 0.

===Filling of bands===

{{main article|Fermi level|Fermi–Dirac statistics}}
{{Band structure filling diagram}}

At [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the likelihood of a state of energy ''E'' being filled with an electron is given by the [[Fermi–Dirac distribution]], a thermodynamic distribution that takes into account the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(E) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{{(E-\mu)}/{k_{\rm B} T}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is the product of [[Boltzmann's constant]] and [[temperature]], and
*''µ'' is the [[total chemical potential]] of electrons, or ''Fermi level'' (in [[semiconductor physics]], this quantity is more often denoted ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;). The Fermi level of a solid is directly related to the voltage on that solid, as measured with a voltmeter. Conventionally, in band structure plots the Fermi level is taken to be the zero of energy (an arbitrary choice).

The density of electrons in the material is simply the integral of the Fermi–Dirac distribution times the density of states:
:&lt;math&gt;N/V = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(E) f(E)\, dE&lt;/math&gt;

Although there are an infinite number of bands and thus an infinite number of states, there are only a finite number of electrons to place in these bands.
The preferred value for the number of electrons is a consequence of electrostatics: even though the surface of a material can be charged, the internal bulk of a material prefers to be charge neutral.
The condition of charge neutrality means that ''N''/''V'' must match the density of protons in the material. For this to occur, the material electrostatically adjusts itself, shifting its band structure up or down in energy (thereby shifting ''g''(''E'')), until it is at the correct equilibrium with respect to the Fermi level.

====Names of bands near the Fermi level (conduction band, valence band)====

A solid has an infinite number of allowed bands, just as an atom has infinitely many energy levels. However, most of the bands simply have too high energy, and are usually disregarded under ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;High-energy bands are important for [[electron diffraction]] physics, where the electrons can be injected into a material at high energies, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = R. | last2 = Perry | first2 = J. | last3 = Boudreaux | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.41.275 | title = Low-Energy Electron-Diffraction Dispersion Surfaces and Band Structure in Three-Dimensional Mixed Laue and Bragg Reflections | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 275 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1969RvMP...41..275S }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, there are very low energy bands associated with the core orbitals (such as [[1s electron]]s). These low-energy ''core band''s are also usually disregarded since they remain filled with electrons at all times, and are therefore inert.&lt;ref&gt;Low-energy bands are however important in the [[Auger effect]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, materials have several band gaps throughout their band structure.

The most important bands and band gaps—those relevant for electronics and optoelectronics—are those with energies near the Fermi level.
The bands and band gaps near the Fermi level are given special names, depending on the material:
* In a [[semiconductor]] or [[Insulator (electricity)|band insulator]], the Fermi level is surrounded by a band gap, referred to as ''the'' band gap (to distinguish it from the other band gaps in the band structure). The closest band above the band gap is called ''the [[conduction band]]'', and the closest band beneath the band gap is called ''the [[valence band]]''. The name "valence band" was coined by analogy to chemistry, since in semiconductors (and insulators) the valence band is built out of the [[valence orbital]]s.
* In a metal or [[semimetal]], the Fermi level is inside of one or more allowed bands. In semimetals the bands are usually referred to as "conduction band" or "valence band" depending on whether the charge transport is more electron-like or hole-like, by analogy to semiconductors. In many metals, however, the bands are neither electron-like nor hole-like, and often just called "valence band" as they are made of valence orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;In copper, for example, the effective mass is a [[tensor]] and also changes sign depending on the wave vector, as can be seen in the [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]]; see http://www.phys.ufl.edu/fermisurface/&lt;/ref&gt; The band gaps in a metal's band structure are not important for low energy physics, since they are too far from the Fermi level.

==Theory of band structures in crystals==

The [[ansatz]] is the special case of electron waves in a periodic crystal lattice using [[Bloch waves]] as treated generally in the [[dynamical theory of diffraction]]. Every crystal is a periodic structure which can be characterized by a [[Bravais lattice]], and for each [[Bravais lattice]] we can determine the [[reciprocal lattice]], which encapsulates the periodicity in a set of three reciprocal lattice vectors ('''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Now, any periodic potential V('''r''') which shares the same periodicity as the direct lattice can be expanded out as a [[Fourier series]] whose only non-vanishing components are those associated with the reciprocal lattice vectors. So the expansion can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{\mathbf{K}}{V_{\mathbf{K}}e^{i \mathbf{K}\cdot\mathbf{r}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''K''' = m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' + m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' + m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' for any set of integers (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

From this theory, an attempt can be made to predict the band structure of a particular material, however most ab initio methods for electronic structure calculations fail to predict the observed band gap.

===Nearly free electron approximation===
{{Main article|Nearly free electron model|Free electron model|pseudopotential}}
In the nearly free electron approximation, interactions between electrons are completely ignored. This approximation allows use of [[Bloch's Theorem]] which states that electrons in a periodic potential have [[wavefunction]]s and energies which are periodic in wavevector up to a constant phase shift between neighboring [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors. The consequences of periodicity are described mathematically by the Bloch wavefunction:

:&lt;math&gt;{\Psi}_{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) = e^{i \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} u_n(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the function &lt;math&gt;u_n(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is periodic over the crystal lattice, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;u_n(\mathbf{r}) = u_n(\mathbf{r-R}) &lt;/math&gt;.

Here index ''n'' refers to the ''n-th'' energy band, wavevector '''k''' is related to the direction of motion of the electron, '''r''' is the position in the crystal, and '''R''' is the location of an atomic site.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;Kittel, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFE model works particularly well in materials like metals where distances between neighbouring atoms are small. In such materials
the overlap of [[atomic orbital]]s and potentials on neighbouring [[atom]]s is relatively large. In that case the [[wave function]] of the electron can be approximated by a (modified) plane wave. The band structure of a metal like [[aluminium]] even gets close to the [[empty lattice approximation]].

===Tight binding model===
{{Main article|Tight binding}}
The opposite extreme to the nearly free electron approximation assumes the electrons in the crystal behave much like an assembly of constituent atoms. This [[tight binding model]] assumes the solution to the time-independent single electron [[Schrödinger equation]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is well approximated by a [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|linear combination]] of [[atomic orbitals]] &lt;math&gt;\psi_n(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Kittel1&gt;Kittel, pp. 245-248&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{n,\mathbf{R}} b_{n,\mathbf{R}} \psi_n(\mathbf{r-R})&lt;/math&gt;,

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt; b_{n,\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt; are selected to give the best approximate solution of this form. Index ''n'' refers to an atomic energy level and '''R''' refers to an atomic site. A more accurate approach using this idea employs [[Wannier functions]], defined by:&lt;ref name=Kittel2&gt;Kittel, Eq. 42 p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mattis&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;u_{n\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the periodic part of the Bloch wave and the integral is over the [[Brillouin zone]]. Here index ''n'' refers to the ''n''-th energy band in the crystal. The Wannier functions are localized near atomic sites, like atomic orbitals, but being defined in terms of Bloch functions they are accurately related to solutions based upon the crystal potential. Wannier functions on different atomic sites '''R''' are orthogonal. The Wannier functions can be used to form the Schrödinger solution for the ''n''-th energy band as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{\mathbf{R}} e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot(\mathbf{R-r})}a_n(\mathbf{r-R})&lt;/math&gt;.

The TB model works well in materials with limited overlap between [[atomic orbital]]s and potentials on neighbouring atoms. Band structures of materials like [[Silicon|Si]], [[GaAs]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[diamond]] for instance are well described by TB-Hamiltonians on the basis of atomic sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals. In [[transition metals]] a mixed TB-NFE model is used to describe the broad NFE [[conduction band]] and the narrow embedded TB d-bands. The radial functions of

of the Wannier functions are most easily calculated by the use of [[pseudopotential]] methods. NFE, TB or combined NFE-TB band structure

sometimes extended with wave function approximations based on pseudopotential methods, are often used as an economic starting point for further calculations.

===KKR model===
{{Main article|Muffin-tin approximation}}
The simplest form of this approximation centers non-overlapping spheres (referred to as ''muffin tins'') on the atomic positions. Within these regions, the potential experienced by an electron is approximated to be spherically symmetric about the given nucleus. In the remaining interstitial region, the [[Screening effect|screened potential]] is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom-centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced.

A variational implementation was suggested by Korringa and by [[Walter Kohn|Kohn]] and Rostocker, and is often referred to as the ''[[Coherent Potential Approximation|KKR model]]''.&lt;ref name=Galsin&gt;{{cite book |title=Impurity Scattering in Metal Alloys |author=Joginder Singh Galsin |page=Appendix C |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmcLT63iX_EC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=KKR+method+band+structure |isbn=0-306-46574-4 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohtaka&gt;{{cite book |title=Photonic Crystals |author=Kuon Inoue, Kazuo Ohtaka |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIa3HRgPYhAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=KKR+method+band+structure |isbn=3-540-20559-4 |year=2004 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Density-functional theory===
{{Main article|Density functional theory}}
{{See also|Kohn–Sham equations}}
In recent physics literature, a large majority of the electronic structures and band plots are calculated using [[density-functional theory]] (DFT), which is not a model but rather a theory, i.e., a microscopic first-principles theory of [[condensed matter physics]] that tries to cope with the electron-electron many-body problem via the introduction of an [[exchange-correlation]] term in the functional of the [[electronic density]]. DFT-calculated bands are in many cases found to be in agreement with experimentally measured bands, for example by [[angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES). In particular, the band shape is typically well reproduced by DFT. But there are also systematic errors in DFT bands when compared to experiment results. In particular, DFT seems to systematically underestimate by about 30-40% the band gap in insulators and semiconductors.

It is commonly believed that DFT is a theory to predict [[ground state]] properties of a system only (e.g. the [[total energy]], the [[atomic structure]], etc.), and that [[excited state]] properties cannot be determined by DFT. This is a misconception.  In principle, DFT can determine any property (ground state or excited state) of a system given a functional that maps the ground state density to that property.  This is the essence of the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hohenberg|first=P|author2=Kohn, W.|title=Inhomogeneous Electron Gas|journal=Phys. Rev.|date=Nov 1964|volume=136|issue=3B|pages=B864--B871|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.136.B864|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.136.B864|bibcode = 1964PhRv..136..864H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, no known functional exists that maps the ground state density to excitation energies of electrons within a material.  Thus, what in the literature is quoted as a DFT band plot is a representation of the DFT [[Kohn–Sham equations|Kohn–Sham energies]], i.e., the energies of a fictive non-interacting system, the Kohn–Sham system, which has no physical interpretation at all. The Kohn–Sham electronic structure must not be confused with the real, [[quasiparticle]] electronic structure of a system, and there is no [[Koopman's theorem]] holding for Kohn–Sham energies, as there is for Hartree–Fock energies, which can be truly considered as an approximation for [[quasiparticle energies]]. Hence, in principle, Kohn–Sham based DFT is not a band theory, i.e., not a theory suitable for calculating bands and band-plots. In principle [[Time-dependent density functional theory|time-dependent DFT]] can be used to calculate the true band structure although in practice this is often difficult. A popular approach is the use of [[hybrid functional]]s, which incorporate a portion of Hartree–Fock exact exchange; this produces a substantial improvement in predicted bandgaps of semiconductors, but is less reliable for metals and wide-bandgap materials.&lt;ref name=Paier&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Paier | first1 = J. | last2 = Marsman | first2 = M. | last3 = Hummer | first3 = K. | last4 = Kresse | first4 = G. | last5 = Gerber | first5 = IC. | last6 = Angyán | first6 = JG. | title = Screened hybrid density functionals applied to solids. | journal = J Chem Phys | volume = 124 | issue = 15 | pages = 154709 |date=Apr 2006 | doi = 10.1063/1.2187006 | PMID = 16674253 |bibcode = 2006JChPh.124o4709P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green's function methods and the ''ab initio'' GW approximation===
{{Main article|Green's function (many-body theory)|Green–Kubo relations}}
To calculate the bands including electron-electron interaction [[Many-body problem|many-body effects]], one can resort to so-called [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green's function]] methods. Indeed, knowledge of the Green's function of a system provides both ground (the total energy) and also excited state observables of the system. The [[poles]] of the Green's function are the quasiparticle energies, the bands of a solid. The Green's function can be calculated by solving the [[Dyson equation]] once the [[self-energy]] of the system is known. For real systems like solids, the self-energy is a very complex quantity and usually approximations are needed to solve the problem. One such approximation is the [[GW approximation]], so called from the mathematical form the self-energy takes as the product Σ = ''GW'' of the Green's function ''G'' and the dynamically screened interaction ''W''. This approach is more pertinent when addressing the calculation of band plots (and also quantities beyond, such as the spectral function) and can also be formulated in a completely ''ab initio'' way. The GW approximation seems to provide band gaps of insulators and semiconductors in agreement with experiment, and hence to correct the systematic DFT underestimation.

===Mott insulators===
{{Main article|Mott insulator}}
Although the nearly free electron approximation is able to describe many properties of electron band structures, one consequence of this theory is that it predicts the same number of electrons in each unit cell. If the number of electrons is odd, we would then expect that there is an unpaired electron in each unit cell, and thus that the valence band is not fully occupied, making the material a conductor. However, materials such as [[Cobalt(II) oxide|CoO]] that have an odd number of electrons per unit cell are insulators, in direct conflict with this result. This kind of material is known as a [[Mott insulator]], and requires inclusion of detailed electron-electron interactions (treated only as an averaged effect on the crystal potential in band theory) to explain the discrepancy. The [[Hubbard model]] is an approximate theory that can include these interactions. It can be treated non-perturbatively within the so-called [[dynamical mean field theory]], which attempts to bridge the gap between the nearly free electron approximation and the atomic limit. Formally, however, the states are not non-interacting in this case and the concept of a band structure is not adequate to describe these cases.

===Others===
Calculating band structures is an important topic in theoretical [[solid state physics]]. In addition to the models mentioned above, other models include the following:

*[[Empty lattice approximation]]: the "band structure" of a region of free space that has been divided into a lattice.
*[[k·p perturbation theory]] is a technique that allows a band structure to be approximately described in terms of just a few parameters. The technique is commonly used for [[semiconductors]], and the parameters in the model are often determined by experiment.
*The [[Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential)#Kronig–Penney model|Kronig-Penney Model]], a one-dimensional rectangular well model useful for illustration of band formation. While simple, it predicts many important phenomena, but is not quantitative.
*[[Hubbard model]]

The band structure has been generalised to wavevectors that are [[complex number]]s, resulting in what is called a ''complex band structure'', which is of interest at surfaces and interfaces.

Each model describes some types of solids very well, and others poorly. The nearly free electron model works well for metals, but poorly for non-metals. The tight binding model is extremely accurate for ionic insulators, such as [[metal halide]] salts (e.g. [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]).

==Band diagrams==

To understand how band structure changes relative to the Fermi level in real space, a band structure plot is often first simplified in the form of a [[band diagram]]. In a band diagram the vertical axis is energy while the horizontal axis represents real space. Horizontal lines represent energy levels, while blocks represent energy bands. When the horizontal lines in these diagram are slanted then the energy of the level or band changes with distance. Diagrammatically, this depicts the presence of an electric field within the crystal system. Band diagrams are useful in relating the general band structure properties of different materials to one another when placed in contact with each other.

[[Image:watervapor cup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aerosol]] of microscopic water droplets suspended in the air above a hot tea cup after that water vapor has sufficiently cooled and condensed. [[Gaseous water|Water vapor]] is an invisible [[gas]], but the [[cloud]]s of condensed water droplets refract and disperse the sun light and so are visible.]]

'''Evaporation''' is a type of [[vaporization]] that occurs on the [[Interface (chemistry)|surface]] of a [[liquid]] as it changes into the gas phase when it reaches its boiling point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/evaporate|title=the definition of evaporate|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding gas must not be saturated with the evaporating substance. When the molecules of the liquid collide, they transfer energy to each other based on how they collide. When a molecule near the surface absorbs enough energy to overcome the [[vapor pressure]], it will "escape" and enter the surrounding air as a gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_Student's_Reference_Work/Evaporation|title=The New Student's Reference Work (1914)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1914|isbn=|location=|pages=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; When evaporation occurs, the energy removed from the vaporized liquid will reduce the temperature of the liquid, resulting in evaporative cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chilling-science-evaporative-cooling-with-liquids/|title=Chilling Science: Evaporative Cooling with Liquids|last=Lohner|first=Science Buddies,Svenja|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, only a fraction of the molecules in a liquid have enough heat energy to escape from the liquid. The evaporation will continue until an equilibrium is reached when the evaporation of the liquid is the equal to its condensation. In an enclosed environment, a liquid will evaporate until the surrounding air is saturated.

Evaporation is an essential part of the [[water cycle]]. The sun (solar energy) drives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, [[soil moisture|moisture]] in the soil, and other sources of water. In [[hydrology]], evaporation and [[transpiration]] (which involves evaporation within plant [[stomata]]) are collectively termed [[evapotranspiration]]. Evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid is exposed, allowing molecules to escape and form water vapor; this vapor can then rise up and form clouds. With sufficient energy, the liquid will turn into vapor.

== Theory ==
{{See also|Kinetic theory of gases}}

For [[molecule]]s of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient [[kinetic energy]] to overcome liquid-phase [[intermolecular force]]s.&lt;ref name="Silberberg"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin A. |last=Silberberg |title=Chemistry |edition=4th |pages=431–434 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-296439-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When only a small proportion of the molecules meet these criteria, the rate of evaporation is low. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called [[evaporative cooling]]. This is why evaporating [[sweat]] cools the human body.
Evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher [[vapor pressure]]. For example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly on a windy day than on a still day. Three key parts to evaporation are heat, [[atmospheric pressure]] (determines the percent humidity), and air movement.

On a molecular level, there is no strict boundary between the liquid state and the vapor state. Instead, there is a [[Knudsen layer]], where the phase is undetermined. Because this layer is only a few molecules thick, at a macroscopic scale a clear phase transition interface cannot be seen. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Liquids that do not evaporate visibly at a given temperature in a given gas (e.g., cooking oil at room [[temperature]]) have molecules that do not tend to transfer energy to each other in a pattern sufficient to frequently give a molecule the heat energy necessary to turn into vapor. However, these liquids ''are'' evaporating. It is just that the process is much slower and thus significantly less visible.

=== Evaporative equilibrium ===

[[Image:Water vapor pressure graph.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Vapor pressure of water vs. temperature. 760&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].]]

If evaporation takes place in an enclosed area, the escaping molecules accumulate as a [[vapor]] above the liquid. Many of the [[molecules]] return to the liquid, with returning molecules becoming more frequent as the [[density]] and [[pressure]] of the vapor increases. When the process of escape and return reaches an [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]],&lt;ref name="Silberberg" /&gt; the vapor is said to be "saturated", and no further change in either [[vapor pressure]] and density or liquid temperature will occur. For a system consisting of vapor and liquid of a pure substance, this equilibrium state is directly related to the vapor pressure of the substance, as given by the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\ln \left( \frac{ P_2 }{ P_1 } \right) = - \frac{ \Delta H_{ vap } }{ R } \left( \frac{ 1 }{ T_2 } - \frac{ 1 }{ T_1 }  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Original Equation ## ## DO NOT DELETE UNLESS THE ABOVE EQUATION IS VERIFIED TO BE CORRECT ## [[Natural logarithm|ln]] P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −[[standard enthalpy change of vaporization|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;vap&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[Universal gas constant|R]]((1/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-(1/T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)) --&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the vapor pressures at temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;vap&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[enthalpy of vaporization]], and ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]]. The rate of evaporation in an open system is related to the vapor pressure found in a closed system. If a liquid is heated, when the vapor pressure reaches the ambient pressure the liquid will [[boiling|boil]].

The ability for a molecule of a liquid to evaporate is based largely on the amount of [[kinetic energy]] an individual particle may possess. Even at lower temperatures, individual molecules of a liquid can evaporate if they have more than the minimum amount of kinetic energy required for vaporization.

== Factors influencing the rate of evaporation ==
Note: Air used here is a common example; however, the vapor phase can be other gases.

;[[Concentration]] of the substance evaporating in the air: If the air already has a high concentration of the substance evaporating, then the given substance will evaporate more slowly.
;Concentration of other substances in the air: If the air is already saturated with other substances, it can have a lower capacity for the substance evaporating.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
;Flow rate of air: This is in part related to the concentration points above. If "fresh" air (i.e., air which is neither already saturated with the substance nor with other substances) is moving over the substance all the time, then the concentration of the substance in the air is less likely to go up with time, thus encouraging faster evaporation. This is the result of the [[boundary layer]] at the evaporation surface decreasing with flow velocity, decreasing the diffusion distance in the stagnant layer.
;The amount of minerals dissolved in the liquid
;Inter-molecular forces: The stronger the forces keeping the molecules together in the liquid state, the more energy one must get to escape.  This is characterized by the [[enthalpy of vaporization]].
;[[Pressure]]: Evaporation happens faster if there is less exertion on the surface keeping the molecules from launching themselves.
;[[Surface area]]: A substance that has a larger surface area will evaporate faster, as there are more surface molecules per unit of volume that are potentially able to escape.
;[[Temperature]] of the substance: the higher the temperature of the substance the greater the kinetic energy of the molecules at its surface and therefore the faster the rate of their evaporation.

In the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized "pan" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map. The measurements range from under 30 to over {{convert|120|in|mm}} per year.

==Thermodynamics==

Evaporation is an [[endothermic process]], in that heat is absorbed during evaporation.

== Applications ==
* Industrial applications include many [[printing]] and [[coating]] processes; recovering salts from solutions; and drying a variety of materials such as lumber, paper, cloth and chemicals.
* The use of evaporation to dry or concentrate samples is a common preparatory step for many laboratory analyses such as [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]]. Systems used for this purpose include [[rotary evaporator]]s and [[centrifugal evaporator]]s.
* When clothes are hung on a laundry line, even though the ambient temperature is below the boiling point of water, water evaporates. This is accelerated by factors such as low [[humidity]], heat (from the sun), and wind. In a [[clothes dryer]], hot air is blown through the clothes, allowing water to evaporate very rapidly.
* The [[Matki (earthen pot)|Matki/Matka]], a traditional Indian porous clay container used for storing and cooling water and other liquids.
* The [[botijo]], a traditional Spanish porous clay container designed to cool the contained water by evaporation.
* [[Evaporative cooler]]s, which can significantly cool a building by simply blowing dry air over a filter saturated with water.

=== Combustion vaporization ===

Fuel [[droplet]]s vaporize as they receive heat by mixing with the hot gases in the combustion chamber. Heat (energy) can also be received by radiation from any hot refractory wall of the combustion chamber.

=== Pre-combustion vaporization ===

Internal combustion engines rely upon the vaporization of the fuel in the cylinders to form a fuel/air mixture in order to burn well.
The chemically correct air/fuel mixture for total burning of gasoline has been determined to be 15 parts air to one part gasoline or 15/1 by weight. Changing this to a volume ratio yields 8000 parts air to one part gasoline or 8,000/1 by volume.

=== Film deposition ===
{{Main|Evaporation (deposition)}}

[[Thin film]]s may be [[Thin-film deposition|deposited]] by evaporating a substance and condensing it onto a substrate, or by dissolving the substance in a solvent, spreading the resulting solution thinly over a substrate, and evaporating the solvent. The [[Hertz–Knudsen equation]] is often used to estimate the rate of evaporation in these instances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">The '''German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Kernreaktor-Versicherungsgemeinschaft — DKVG}}) is an association of [[Germany|German]] [[insurer]]s of the [[nuclear industry]] located in [[Cologne]]. The German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association also is involved in the [[reinsurance]] industry.

== History ==
The first associations of insurers of the nuclear industry in [[Europe]] were founded in [[Sweden]] and [[England]] in 1955. The German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association was founded shortly thereafter in 1957. Throughout the association's history, it has only once had to pay a claim; the claim amounted to approximately €10,000 to €15,000.

== Functions and tasks ==
Despite the slight probability of losses resulting from an insured event in the nuclear industry, in the event of an insured event does occur the possibilities for damages are considerable. As such a single [[insurance company]] is unable to bear such risk alone. Under [[German law]], the transfer of a nuclear risk of an insurer to a reinsurer is prohibited. In 1998 the Atomic Energy Act established the maximum insurance liability of nuclear insurer at about €2.5 billion; for damages above that cap the Federal Government is liable  according to § 34 of the Atomic Energy Act. If the total damage exceeds the stipulated maximum sum of €2.55 billion, the German Federal Government pays the German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association for the excess losses. The insurance payments include the cost of evacuating people.

== DKVG and Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant ==
[[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] was insured for some tens of millions of euros with German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association. Under the terms of the insurance policy, the policyholder was not insured for damage caused by earthquakes, [[tsunami]]s, and volcanic eruptions. Therefore the German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association had no resulting liability to [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]], the owner of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, because of [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211028/http://www.insuranceday.com/insday/viewArticle.htm?id=264196&amp;rss=true Insurance policies which cover damage to reactors and buildings exclude the effects of earthquakes and tsunamis]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gutter oil''' ({{zh|c=地沟油|p=dìgōu yóu}}, or {{zh|c=餿水油|p=sōushuǐ yóu|labels=no}}) is a term used in [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]] to describe illicit [[cooking oil]] which has been recycled from [[waste oil]] collected from sources such as restaurant [[Deep fryer|fryer]]s, [[grease trap]]s, [[slaughterhouse waste]] and [[sewage]] from [[sewerage|sewer drains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://o.canada.com/health-2/gutter-oil-is-even-more-disgusting-than-it-sounds|title=Chinese ‘gutter oil’ is even more disgusting than it sounds|first=Ishmael N.|last=Daro|date=29 October 2013|website=canada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/28/you-may-never-eat-street-food-in-china-again-after-watching-this-video/|title=You may never eat street food in China again after watching this video|author=Max Fisher|date=28 October 2013|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Reprocessing of used cooking oil is often very rudimentary; techniques include [[filtration]], boiling, refining, and the removal of some adulterants.&lt;ref&gt;Qian Ye, Xiaofang Pei [http://www.aocs.org/Membership/FreeCover.cfm?itemnumber=18028 Methods for differentiating recycled cooking oil needed in China] AOCS&lt;/ref&gt; It is then packaged and resold as a cheaper alternative to normal cooking oil. Another version of gutter oil uses discarded animal parts, animal fat and skins, internal organs, and expired or otherwise low-quality meat, which is then cooked in large vats in order to extract the oil. Used kitchen oil can be purchased for between $859 and $937 per ton, while the cleaned and refined product can sell for $1,560 per tonne.&lt;ref name="In the Tank, Not on the Table"&gt;Li Li [http://www.bjreview.com.cn/nation/txt/2011-11/14/content_405509.htm In the Tank, Not on the Table] ''The Beijing Review'' 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is great economic incentive to produce and sell gutter oil. 

It is estimated that up to one in every ten lower-market restaurant meals consumed in China is prepared with gutter oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21534812|title=In the gutter|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high prevalence is due to what Feng Ping of the China Meat Research Center has made clear: "The illegal oil shows no difference in appearance and indicators after refining and purification because the law breakers are skillful at coping with the established standards."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Shen [http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-18/news/30292607_1_cooking-oil-waste-oil-yuan "China's Ministry of Health Just Inadvertently Green Lighted The Gutter Oil Industry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511043221/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-18/news/30292607_1_cooking-oil-waste-oil-yuan |date=11 May 2013 }}. ''Business Insider'' 18 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first documented case of gutter oil in Taiwan was reported in 1985. In a subsequent investigation, 22 people were arrested for involvement in a recycling oil ring over 10 years based in Taipei. The worst offender was sentenced to 7 years in prison.&lt;ref name=UDN&gt;[http://udn.com/NEWS/BREAKINGNEWS/BREAKINGNEWS1/8915972.shtml], UDN, September 2014.{{dead link|date=June 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a report of an earlier incident in Taiwan in the 1960s, where "trench oil" was imported from Japan to Taiwan and then used in food processing.&lt;ref name="Waste Management World"&gt;[http://www.wastemanagementworld.com/japanese-tactics-to-solve-the-trench-oil/ "Japanese Tactics To Solve The Trench Oil"], ''Waste Management World'', December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}

The first documented case of gutter oil in mainland China was reported in 2000, when a [[street vendor]] was found to be selling oil obtained from restaurant [[garbage disposals]].&lt;ref name=newschina&gt;He Jiangyong and Liu Ziqian, [http://www.newschinamag.com/magazine/sick-slick "Sick Slick"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908225412/http://www.newschinamag.com/magazine/sick-slick |date=8 September 2014 }}, ''NewsChina Magazine'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, an ongoing investigation into the suspected use of gutter oil as a raw material in the [[Chinese pharmaceutical industry]] was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19462349 |title=China probes 'gutter oil in medicine' claims |publisher=BBC News |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2014 Taiwan food scandal|A scandal]] involving 240 tons of gutter oil in Taiwan affecting hundreds of companies and thousands of eateries, some of which may have been exported overseas, broke in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1586065/taiwans-premier-bans-sale-235-food-companies-products-gutter-oil-scandal "Taiwan's Premier Bans Sale 235 Food Companies Products Gutter Oil Scandal"]. ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and distribution==
The collected [[waste oil]] is sold to local workshops or small factories for cleaning and packaging. When sold to workshops it is often transported on the back of bicycles by peddlers who are paid a monthly wage; afterwards, the oil is held in 200-liter barrels at the workshops until it is processed.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Alexa Olesen [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/20/gutter-oil-china-sounds-a_n_652398.html "Gutter Oil: China Sounds Alarm Over Filthy Cooking Oil"]. ''Huffington Post'', 20 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions the oil goes to industrial cooking oil refineries for further processing before it finally reaches its end purpose. The industrial oil refineries are usually legitimate producers that sell the processed oil for use in the chemical or energy industries. Gutter oil is perfectly suitable as a raw ingredient for producing soap, rubber, [[bio-fuel]], and cosmetics.&lt;ref name="In the Tank, Not on the Table"/&gt; However, the refiners can also have other intentions as the prices attained by selling it as cooking oil are much higher than if it is sold to the chemical or energy industries. 

There are few formal rules or protocols in place to prevent purchases from or sales to entities intending to use the oil for human consumption,{{cn|date=April 2017}} so it is very easy for individuals or wholesalers to purchase oil from these industrial refineries and then resell the oil to restaurants or to end consumers. There have been some cases where the industrial oil refiner packaged the oil under a unique brand name and sold it as legitimate oil in retail outlets as opposed to just selling directly to restaurants.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Some lower-market restaurants have long-term purchase agreements with oil recyclers for selling their used oil.&lt;ref&gt;David Barboza [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/world/asia/01shanghai.html?_r=1 Recycled Cooking Oil Found to Be Latest Hazard in China] ''The New York Times'', 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cao Yin and Luo Wangshu, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/04/content_14975475.htm "Rotting meat used to make illegal oil"], ''China Daily'', 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-end restaurants and street vendors are the biggest end users of gutter oil, as they operate with lower profit margins than bigger restaurants. Oil is one of the largest kitchen supply costs for restaurants,{{cn|date=April 2017}} so obtaining cheaper oil can allow a marginal restaurant to reduce its overall expenses. Chinese food is generally heavily dependent on oil due to most foods being fried, so cheaper meal prices for many price-sensitive consumers are possible if gutter oil is used instead of virgin oil.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;Xinhua News Agency, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2011-09/14/c_131138019.htm Our kitchens must be freed from gutter oil], 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation becomes more serious because it is hard to distinguish reprocessed gutter oil from legitimate oil. [[Bleach]] is used to transform gutter oil's dark color into a more natural-looking one, and [[alkali]] additives are used to neutralize the abnormal [[pH]] caused by high concentrations of [[animal fats]].&lt;ref name=newschina/&gt;

==Health effects==
Gutter oil has been shown to be quite toxic, and can cause [[diarrhea]] and abdominal pain. There are also reports that long-term consumption of the oil can lead to stomach and liver cancer as well as [[developmental disabilities]] in newborns and children.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;Austin Ramzy, [http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2011/09/13/china-cracks-down-on-gutter-oil-a-substance-even-worse-than-its-name/ China Cracks Down on "Gutter Oil," a Substance Even Worse Than its Name], ''Time'', 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Testing of some samples of gutter oil has revealed traces of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH), dangerous organic pollutants capable of causing cancer with long-term consumption. There is also potential for gutter oil to contain [[aflatoxin]]s, highly carcinogenic compounds produced by certain molds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; Zeng Jing of the Guangdong Armed Police Hospital said of gutter oil: "Animal and vegetable fat in refined waste oil will undergo rancidity, oxidation and decomposition after contamination. It will cause indigestion, [[insomnia]], liver discomfort and other symptoms."&lt;ref name="In the Tank, Not on the Table"/&gt;

==Regulations and law enforcement==
Chinese law states that industrial animal fat is not allowed for use in food products because it does not meet basic hygiene standards and contains high levels of potentially toxic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Ankush Chibber [http://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Policy/Edible-oil-or-industrial-oil-in-China "Edible oil or industrial oil in China"]. ''Food Navigator Asia'', 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The national and local governments are researching ways to test and identify gutter oil but {{as of|2012|lc=y}} there were no nationwide standards in place to help with this process. The government is looking into methods that rely on technical equipment as well as on-site instant tests to screen suspect oil. There are five proposed tests for gutter oil but each has failed to accurately detect it.

In August and September 2011, the Beijing city government passed two new sets of regulations. The first was "On Accelerating the City's Food Waste and Waste Oil Recycling Program". Its goals are to increase daily food waste processing to 2,200 tons by 2012 and to 2,900 tons by 2015. Additionally, the intent of the regulations is to create a system that "should be a unified, standardized, and orderly processing of waste oil collection and improvement of the transportation system".&lt;ref&gt;Tian Peng, Sun Lichao [http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/2011/1114/215679.shtml "Cooking Oil's Final Destination"]. ''The Economic Observer'' 14 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The second set of regulations by the city of Beijing, called the "Beijing Municipal Solid Waste Regulations", was passed in September 2011. The regulations specifically target the two sources of gutter oil: food waste and used oil. The central government intends for these two sets of regulations to serve as national examples, yet wants every municipality nationally to find their own solutions to the food waste and gutter oil problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2012-05/24/content_25462528.htm 'Proposals pouring in for testing gutter oil'], ''China Daily'', 24 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A nationwide campaign was set in motion in August 2011 to crack down on the widespread production and selling of gutter oil.  The law enforcement campaign uncovered 100 gutter oil manufacturers and arrested more than 800 people allegedly involved in the production and sale of gutter oil. In April 2012 another crackdown occurred with an additional 100 arrests made and 13 illegal workshops closed down across four provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Astley [http://www.foodqualitynews.com/Public-Concerns/Chinese-officials-arrest-more-than-100-in-rotten-meat-based-gutter-oil-crackdown Chinese officials arrest more than 100 in rotten meat-based 'gutter oil' crackdown] ''Food Quality News'', 5 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to a notice released jointly by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security, the [[Capital punishment in China|death penalty]] will now be an option when prosecuting more serious cases of gutter oil manufacturing in the country. More severe punishments will also be given out to government and public officials who fail to properly address matters related to gutter oil. The State Council said inspectors would target edible oil trade fairs and wholesale markets and called for inspections of oil being used at restaurants, school cafeterias, work canteens and kitchens at construction sites. The State Council also stated that businesses that use recycled oil would be forced to close temporarily or lose their business license while peddlers who sell the oil could be criminally prosecuted.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua News Agency [http://www.china.org.cn/china/2012-02/24/content_24718208.htm Death penalties considered for 'gutter oil' crimes] 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Burkitt, [https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/04/03/chinese-gutter-oil-attains-new-level-of-gross/ Chinese Gutter Oil Attains New Level of Gross], ''The Wall Street Journal'', China Real Time Report, 3 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013,  a man from eastern China's Jiangsu Province was sentenced to life imprisonment for profiting heavily from making and selling gutter oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-10/09/c_132783008.htm|title=Chinese gutter oil producer jailed for life|date=9 October 2013|newspaper=Xinhau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HSMG''' (High Strength Metallurgical Graphene) – polycrystalline [[graphene]], grown from a liquid phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The growth of a polycrystalline graphene from a liquid phase|url = http://www.nsti.org/procs/Nanotech2013v1/2/W2.312|website = www.nsti.org|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process, in comparison to other methods based on using solid substrates, allows to manufacture defect-free graphene structures. HSMG is formed on a perfectly flat surface - [[liquid]] metal. While growing graphene on solid substrates is difficult due to surface irregularities and defects. Growing graphene on a liquid metal matrix enables the rotation of graphene grains, resulting in forming a continuous graphene sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Single and Multilayer Growth of Graphene from the Liquid Phase|url = http://www.scientific.net/AMM.510.8|website = www.scientific.net|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of that, the grain disorientation angle is close to zero. Large-area graphene sheets formed with this method have high mechanical durability, close to graphene's theoretical values. This production method has been developed and patented by a team of scientists from the Institute of Materials Science of [[Lodz University of Technology]], under the direction of Prof. Piotr Kula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polish scientists find way to make super-strong graphene sheets {{!}} Graphene-Info|url = http://www.graphene-info.com/polish-scientists-find-way-make-super-strong-graphene-sheets|website = www.graphene-info.com|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSMG graphene's commercialisation and applications are being handled by a spin-off institution - Advanced Graphene Products sp. z o.o.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Engineering graphene : Compute Scotland|url = http://www.computescotland.com/engineering-graphene-7894.php|website = www.computescotland.com|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Electricity pylon with line traps and optical fiber cable.jpg|thumb|right|Electricity pylon with line traps]]
A '''line trap''' (high-frequency stopper) is a maintenance-free parallel resonant circuit, mounted inline on high-voltage (HV) [[Alternating current|AC]] transmission [[power line]]s to prevent the transmission of [[high frequency]] (40&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1000&amp;nbsp;kHz) carrier signals of [[power line communication]] to unwanted destinations. Line traps are cylinder-like structures connected in series with HV transmission lines. A line trap is also called a ''wave trap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Wave Trap|url=http://www.allinterview.com/showanswers/111073/what-is-wave-trap-and-its-function-detail-where-it-is-used.html|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line trap acts as a barrier or filter to prevent signal losses. The [[inductive reactance]] of the line trap presents a high reactance to high-frequency signals but a low reactance to mains frequency. This prevents carrier signals from being dissipated in the substation or in a tap line or branch of the main transmission path and grounds in the case of anything happening outside of the carrier transmission path. The line trap is also used to attenuate the shunting effects of high-voltage lines.

==Design==

The trap consists of three major components: the main coil, the tuning device, and the protective device (also known as a surge arrester). The protective and tuning devices are mounted inside the main coil. A line trap may be covered with a bird barrier, in which case there are four components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot221.nsf/veritydisplay/81cce1c2216fe141c1256ce50052c95d/$file/DLTC_2011_Lowres.pdf |title=Utility Communications |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date= | website=www.abb.com |publisher=ABB | accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main coil is the outer part of the line trap which is made from stranded aluminum cable. The reactor coil, depending on the device, can be made up of several aluminum wires, allowing equal distribution amongst the parallel wires. The stranded aluminum coil is wound in one layer. However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a cooling duct between them to avoid overheating. The cooling duct is created with spacer bars made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides a low impedance path for the electricity flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POWER LINE CARRIER CHANNEL &amp; APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRANSMISSION LINE RELAYING|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a line trap must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a line trap unit is inserted between the busbar and connection of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and high impedance to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.&lt;ref name="harlow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harlow|first1=James H.|title=Electric Power Transformer Engineering|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439856291|pages=693|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major component is the tuning device. This device is securely installed inside the main coil. It adjusts blocking frequency or bandwidth, and consists of coils, capacitors, and resistors. This smaller coil is attached to both ends of the main coil. Its purpose is to create a blocking circuit which provides high impedance. There are three types of tuning devices: wideband tuning, single frequency tuning, and double frequency tuning. The tuned circuit is usually a dual-circuit broadband type. If the traps are self tuned, they do not require the use of any tuning devices. With the use of a tuning device, a line trap can be tuned to a frequency of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="harlow" /&gt;

The last main component is the protective device, which is parallel with the main coil and the tuning device. It protects the main coil and the tuning device by lowering the over-voltage levels. The bandwidth of a line trap is the frequency range over which the line trap can provide a certain specified minimum blocking impedance or resistance.

Line traps are connected in series with power line and thus their coils are rated to carry the full line current. The [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of a line trap is very low at the power frequency and will not cause any significant voltage drop.{{sfn|Natarajan|2005|p=239–240}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steel-sa.com/bzzz/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ARTECHE_CT_trfLT_EN.pdf LINE TRAPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[Power line carrier communication]] (PLCC) technology has been frequently used since 1950 by the grid stations to transmit information at high speed. Transmitting information along high-voltage lines, at high frequency, has been one of the main means of communication in electric power for over fifty years. This technology is finding wide use in building and home automation, as it avoids the need for extra wiring. The data collected from different sensors is transmitted on power lines thereby reducing the maintenance cost of the additional wiring. In some countries, this technology is also used to provide Internet connection. In order to communicate, high-frequency line traps are used as they allow substations to communicate with each other through the power lines at the same time as they transmit electrical power. In order to separate power from messages being sent, different frequencies are used. Electrical power has a frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz in most places, and the communication waves use frequencies such as 150&amp;nbsp;kHz and 200&amp;nbsp;kHz. Line traps consist of filter circuits that allow only power frequency waves to travel to that of electrical equipment. They also stop communication waves from traveling to equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trenchgroup.com/en/Products-Solutions/Coil-Products/Line-Traps/node_670 |title=Line Traps |author=Trench Group&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.trenchgroup.com |publisher=Trench Group |accessdate=2014-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication is crucial for substations.

== Limitations ==
High frequency line traps have a temperature limit of 115&amp;nbsp;°C-180&amp;nbsp;°C depending on construction and manufacture.

The '''January 2015 North American blizzard''' was a powerful and severe [[blizzard]] that dumped up to {{convert|3|ft|mm}} of snowfall in parts of [[New England]]. Originating from a disturbance just off the coast of the [[Northwestern United States]] on January 23, it initially produced a light swath of snow as it traveled southeastwards into the Midwest as an [[Alberta clipper]] on January 24–25. It gradually weakened as it moved eastwards towards the Atlantic Ocean, however, a new dominant low formed off the [[East Coast of the United States]] late on January 26, and rapidly deepened as it moved northeastwards towards southeastern New England, producing pronounced blizzard conditions. The nor’easter then gradually weakened as it moved away into Canada. The storm was also given unofficial names, such as ''Blizzard of 2015'', and ''Winter Storm Juno''.

The nor'easter disrupted transportation, with [[snow emergency|snow emergencies]] declared in six states and travel bans enacted in four of these states – [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Rhode Island]] – as well as in [[New York City]]. Most [[passenger rail]] service was suspended, and thousands of flights were cancelled.&lt;ref name=aol /&gt;&lt;ref name=weathernyc1 /&gt; Schools and activities saw [[weather-related cancellation]]s for one or more days.

Before the blizzard struck, meteorologists had been anticipating that the impending storm would be "historic" and "record-breaking", with predictions of snowfall accumulations in major metropolitan areas such as [[New York City]] of up to {{convert|2–3|ft|in}}. However, the predictions fell significantly short of what was anticipated, mainly due to a shift of the storm’s track, which cut down on the amount of snowfall. In the aftermath of the storm, citizens criticised the local government for shutting down the subway system in New York City for the storm.

==Meteorological history==

On 21 August 1986, a [[limnic eruption]] at [[Lake Nyos]] in northwestern [[Cameroon]] killed 1,746 people and 3,500 livestock.

The eruption triggered the sudden release of about 100,000–300,000 [[ton]]s (1.6m tons, according to some sources) of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}).&lt;ref name=SCIAM&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v293/n1/full/scientificamerican0705-49.html|title=Can We Bury Global Warming?

A degassing system has since been installed at the lake, with the aim of reducing the concentration of {{CO2}} in deep waters and therefore the risk of further eruptions.

== Eruption and gas cloud ==
It is not known what triggered the catastrophic [[outgassing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cotel|first1=Aline J|title=A Trigger Mechanism for the Lake Nyos Disaster|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=March 1999|volume=88|issue=4|pages=343–347|doi=10.1016/s0377-0273(99)00017-7|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0377-0273(99)00017-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rouwet|first1=Dmitri|last2=Tanyileke|first2=Greg|last3=Costa|first3=Antonio|title=Cameroon's Lake Nyos Gas Burst: 30 Years Later|journal=Eos|date=July 12, 2016|volume=97|doi=10.1029/2016eo055627|url=https://doi.org/10.1029/2016eo055627}}{{oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Most geologists suspect a landslide, but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=A|title=Rollover in Volcanic Crater Lakes: A Possible Cause for Lake Nyos Type Disasters|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=April 2000|volume=97|issue=1-4|pages=233–239|doi=10.1016/s0377-0273(99)00179-1|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0377-0273(99)00179-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aka|first1=FestusTongwa|title=Volcanic Lakes|date=2015|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642368325|pages=467–488|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-36833-2_21|language=English|chapter-url= https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36833-2_21|chapter=Depth of Melt Segregation Below the Nyos Maar-Diatreme Volcano (Cameroon, West Africa): Major-Trace Element Evidence and Their Bearing on the Origin of CO2 in Lake Nyos}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn. Others still believe there was a small earthquake, but as witnesses did not report feeling any tremors on the morning of the disaster, this hypothesis is unlikely. Whatever the cause, the event resulted in the supersaturated deep water rapidly mixing with the upper layers of the lake, where the reduced pressure allowed the stored CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[effervescence (chemistry)|effervesce]] out of solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kusakabe|first1=Minoru|last2=Ohsumi|first2=Takashi|last3=Aramaki|first3=Shigeo|title=The Lake Nyos Gas Disaster: Chemical and Isotopic Evidence in Waters and Dissolved Gases from Three Cameroonian Crater Lakes, Nyos, Monoun and Wum|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=November 1989|volume=39|issue=2-3|pages=167–185|doi=10.1016/0377-0273(89)90056-5|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(89)90056-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that about {{convert|1.2|km3}} of gas was released.&lt;ref name="neatorama"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Strangest Disaster of the 20th Century|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/5/21/the-strangest-disaster-of-the-20th-century/|publisher=Neatorama|accessdate=June 20, 2010|date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing, due to [[iron]]-rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being [[oxidise]]d by the air. The level of the lake dropped by about a meter and trees near the lake were knocked down.

Scientists concluded from evidence that a {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} column of water and foam formed at the surface of the lake, spawning a wave of at least {{convert|25|m}} that swept the shore on one side.&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000201&amp;slug=4002291|title=Scientists hope to quiet Cameroon's killer lakes|author=David Brown|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=February 1, 2000|accessdate=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide, being about 1.5 times as dense as air, caused the cloud to "hug" the ground and move down the valleys, where there were various villages. The mass was about {{convert|50|meters|ft}} thick, and travelled downward at {{convert|20|-|50|km/h}}. For roughly {{convert|23|km}}, the gas cloud was concentrated enough to suffocate many people in their sleep in the villages of Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Subum.&lt;ref name=SDSU/&gt; About 4,000 inhabitants fled the area, and many of these developed respiratory problems, [[lesion]]s, and [[paralysis]] as a result of the gas cloud.&lt;ref&gt;Lake Nyos disaster, Cameroon, 1986: the medical effects of large scale emission of carbon dioxide?, BMJ, Volume 298, May 27, 1989, [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1836556]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on survivors ==
[[Image:Cow killed by Lake Nyos gasses.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cattle]] suffocated by carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos]]
One survivor, Joseph Nkwain from Subum, described himself when he awoke after the gases had struck:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I could not speak. I became unconscious. I could not open my mouth because then I smelled something terrible ... I heard my daughter snoring in a terrible way, very abnormal ... When crossing to my daughter's bed ... I collapsed and fell. I was there till nine o'clock in the (Friday) morning ... until a friend of mine came and knocked at my door ... I was surprised to see that my trousers were red, had some stains like honey. I saw some ... starchy mess on my body. My arms had some wounds ... I didn't really know how I got these wounds ... I opened the door ... I wanted to speak, my breath would not come out ... My daughter was already dead ... I went into my daughter's bed, thinking that she was still sleeping. I slept till it was 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon ... on Friday. (Then) I managed to go over to my neighbors' houses. They were all dead ... I decided to leave ... (because) most of my family was in [[Wum]] ... I got my motorcycle ... A friend whose father had died left with me (for) Wum ... As I rode ... through Nyos I didn't see any sign of any living thing ... (When I got to Wum), I was unable to walk, even to talk ... my body was completely weak."&lt;ref name=SDSU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Scarth. [[USGS]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the eruption, many survivors were treated at the main hospital in [[Yaoundé]], the country's capital. It was believed that many of the victims had been poisoned by a mixture of gases that included [[hydrogen]] and [[sulfur]]. Poisoning by these gases would lead to burning pains in the eyes and nose, coughing and signs of asphyxiation similar to being strangled.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/21/newsid_3380000/3380803.stm|title=21 August: 1986: Hundreds gassed in Cameroon lake disaster|publisher=BBC|author=BBC contributors|accessdate=December 19, 2008 | date=August 21, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from 1995, feasibility studies were successfully conducted, and the first permanent degassing tube was installed at Lake Nyos in 2001.

Following the Lake Nyos disaster, scientists investigated other African lakes to see if a similar phenomenon could happen elsewhere. [[Lake Kivu]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], 2,000 times larger than Lake Nyos, was also found to be supersaturated, and geologists found evidence that outgassing events around the lake happened about every thousand years.

==In popular culture==
A Greek novel by Basileios Drolias focusing on the lake Nyos disaster and the degassing of the lake was published in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lenya National Park''' is a national park located in the [[Tenasserim Hills]], [[Burma]] in the border area with [[Thailand]],&lt;ref name="short"&gt;[http://protectedplanet.net/sites/Lenya_National_Park Protected Planet UNEP-WCMC]&lt;/ref&gt; limiting with the [[Namtok Huai Yang National Park]]. The park consists of 176,638 hectares of [[tropical evergreen forest|lowland tropical forest]].&lt;ref name="short" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://birdlifeindochina.org/birdlife/report_pdfs/pr_gurney%27s_pitta_news_release_28_nov_eng.pdf Lenya: Myanmar’s Hidden Treasure - Birdlife Intl.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of the national park is the maintenance of [[natural resource]]s. The demarcation is in course. It is governed by the Burma Forest Department and the level of protection is partial, for [[logging]] and forest plantations are allowed. The altitudes within the park range from 10 to 855 m. The endangered [[Gurney's pitta]], endemic to Thailand and Myanmar, is found within the park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banca-env.org/ebook.pdf Myanmar Protected Areas - Context, Current Status and Challenges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417063155/http://www.banca-env.org/ebook.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''level of support for evolution''' among scientists, the public and other groups is a topic that frequently arises in the [[creation-evolution controversy]] and touches on educational, religious, philosophical, scientific and political issues. The subject is especially contentious in countries where significant levels of non-acceptance of evolution by general society exist although [[evolution]] is taught at school and university.

Nearly all (around 97%) of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |title=Finding evolution in medicine |journal=NIH Record |volume=58 |issue=15 |accessdate=2007-10-22 |date=2006-07-28 |format=hmtl |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific associations have strongly rebutted and refuted the challenges to evolution proposed by [[intelligent design]] proponents.&lt;ref name="dover_pg83"&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

Aguillard]]'', to reject a [[Louisiana]] state law requiring that where evolutionary science was taught in public schools, creation science must also be taught. The brief also stated that the term "creation science" as used by the law embodied religious dogma, and that "teaching religious ideas mislabeled as science is detrimental to scientific education".&lt;ref name=amicus&gt;Amicus Curiae brief in {{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

There are many scientific and scholarly organizations from around the world that have issued statements in support of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/science List of numerous US scientific societies that support evolution and their statements about evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsu.org/Gestion/img/ICSU_DOC_DOWNLOAD/1017_DD_FILE_IAP_Evolution.pdf List of 68 international scientific societies on the Interacademy Panel (IAP) that endorse a resolution supporting evolution and a multibillion year old earth, June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/1999/nsb99149/nsb99149.txt National Science Board letter in support of evolution 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298 ''Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design'', 11 Apr 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the world's largest general scientific society with more than 130,000 members and over 262 affiliated societies and academies of science including over 10 million individuals, has made several statements and issued several press releases in support of evolution.&lt;ref name="AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws"/&gt; The prestigious [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], which provides science advice to the nation, has published several books supporting evolution and criticising creationism and intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/ ''Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition'', National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071117073919/http://orsted.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5787&amp;page=R1 ''Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science (1998)'', National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a notable difference between the opinion of scientists and that of the general public in the United States. A 2009 poll by [[Pew Research Center]] found that "Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time – 87% say evolution is due to natural processes, such as natural selection. The dominant position among scientists – that living things have evolved due to natural processes – is shared by only about a third (32%) of the public."&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[[Pew Research Center]]: "[http://people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/ Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media]" July 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Votes, resolutions and statements of scientists before 1985===
One of the earliest resolutions in support of evolution was issued by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1922, and readopted in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.aaas.org/docs/resolutions.php?doc_id=450 ''AAAS Resolution: Present Scientific Status of the Theory of Evolution''], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Adopted by the AAAS Council, December 26, 1922. AAAS Executive Committee readopts this resolution on April 21, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm ''The Imminent Demise of Evolution: The Longest Running Falsehood in Creationism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207173612/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm |date=2009-02-07 }}, G. R. Morton, Copyright 2002 G.R. Morton&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early effort to express support for evolution by scientists was organized by Nobel Prize–winning American biologist [[Hermann J. Muller]] in 1966. Muller circulated a petition entitled "Is Biological Evolution a Principle of Nature that has been well established by Science?" in May 1966:

{{quotation|There are no hypotheses, alternative to the principle of evolution with its "tree of life," that any competent biologist of today takes seriously. Moreover, the principle is so important for an understanding of the world we live in and of ourselves that the public in general, including students taking biology in high school, should be made aware of it, and of the fact that it is firmly established, even as the rotundity of the earth is firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Bales, James D., ''Forty-Two Years on the Firing Line'', Lambert, Shreveport, LA, p.71-72, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This manifesto was signed by 177 of the leading American biologists, including [[George Gaylord Simpson|George G. Simpson]] of [[Harvard University]], Nobel Prize Winner [[Peter Agre]] of [[Duke University]], [[Carl Sagan]] of [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[John Tyler Bonner]] of [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Nobel Prize Winner [[George Beadle]], President of the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Donald Kennedy|Donald F. Kennedy]] of [[Stanford University]], formerly head of the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=DayScientistsVoted&gt;[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/1981 ''The Day the Scientists Voted'', Bert Thompson, Apologetics Press: Sensible Science, 2001, originally published in Reason &amp; Revelation, 2(3):9-11, March 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the passing of a resolution by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in the fall of 1972 that stated, in part, "the theory of creation ... is neither scientifically grounded nor capable of performing the rules required of science theories".&lt;ref name=ABT&gt;American Biology Teacher, January 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] also passed a similar resolution in the fall of 1972.&lt;ref name=ABT/&gt; A statement on evolution called "A Statement Affirming Evolution as a Principle of Science." was signed by Nobel Prize Winner [[Linus Pauling]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[George Gaylord Simpson|George G. Simpson]], Caltech Biology Professor [[Norman H. Horowitz]], [[Ernst Mayr]], and others, and published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''A Statement Affirming Evolution as a Principle of Science,'' The Humanist, January/February, 1977, p. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing board of the [[American Geological Institute]] issued a statement supporting resolution in November 1981.&lt;ref&gt;AAPG Explorer, January, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] passed another resolution supporting evolution and disparaging efforts to teach [[creationism]] in science classes.&lt;ref&gt;''"Creation-Science" Law Is Struck Down,'' Raloff, J., Science News, 121[2]:20, January 9, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, there are no scientifically peer-reviewed research articles that disclaim evolution listed in the scientific and medical journal search engine [[Pubmed]].&lt;ref name="pmid16670753"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Attie AD | title=Defending science education against intelligent design: a call to action | journal=J Clin Invest | date= 2006 | volume= 116 | issue= 5 | pages= 1134–8 | pmid=16670753 | doi=10.1172/JCI28449 | pmc=1451210 |name-list-format=vanc| author2=Sober E | author3=Numbers RL | author4=Amasino RM | author5=Cox B | author6=Berceau T | display-authors=6 | last7=Powell | first7=T | last8=Cox | first8=MM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Steve===
{{main|Project Steve}}
The [[Discovery Institute]] announced that over 700 scientists had expressed support for [[intelligent design]] as of February 8, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/few_biologists.html (''Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition'', Panda's Thumb, February 21, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213221402/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/few_biologists.html |date=December 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the [[National Center for Science Education]] to produce a "light-hearted" [[petition]] called "[[Project Steve]]" in support of [[evolution]]. Only scientists named "Steve" or some variation (such as Stephen, Stephanie, and Stefan) are eligible to sign the petition. It is intended to be a "tongue-in-cheek [[parody]]" of the lists of alleged "scientists" supposedly supporting [[creationist]] principles that creationist organizations produce.&lt;ref name=steve&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve National Center for Science Education "Project Steve"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/#presentsci List of living scientists who accept the biblical account of creation] from [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; The petition demonstrates that there are more scientists who accept evolution with a name like "Steve" alone (over 1370&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves The List of Steves]&lt;/ref&gt;) than there are in total who support intelligent design. This is, again, why the percentage of scientists who support evolution has been estimated by Brian Alters to be about 99.9 percent.&lt;ref name=nihrecord&gt;[http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm ''Finding the Evolution in Medicine''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |date=November 22, 2008 }}, Cynthia Delgado, NIH Record, July 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many creationists act as [[Evangelism|evangelists]] and their organizations are registered as tax-free religious organizations.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion about some controversy about this, see [[Kent Hovind]].&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists have claimed that they represent the interests of true Christians, and evolution is associated only with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, in his book [http://www.errantskeptics.org/Quotes_Regarding_Creation_Evolution.htm ''Systematic Theology''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224164219/http://www.errantskeptics.org/Quotes_Regarding_Creation_Evolution.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}, Charles Hodge, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co, 1975, vol. 2, p. 15, argues that "''First, it shocks the common sense of unsophisticated men to be told that the whale and the humming-bird, man and the mosquito, are derived from the same source... the system is thoroughly atheistic, and therefore cannot possibly stand.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/21soc03.htm#top ''Evolution and Christianity are opposites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021232820/http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/21soc03.htm |date=2006-10-21 }}, p. 36 of ''Evolution and Society'', Volume 2 of ''Scientific Facts Against Evolution-Origin of the Universe: 3 Volume Encyclopedia'' states, of evolution and Christianity, "''there can be no reconciliation between the two. One view stands for fighting, warfare against the supposed weaker ones, and atheism; the other is for peace, self-sacrifice for the good of others, and belief and trust in the Creator God...Even evolutionists and atheists have declared that their creeds are totally different than those of Christianity.''" Also in the article ''Evolution and the churches'' on pages 39-41 of the same volume, "''In spite of clear-cut statements by evolutionists that "evolution IS atheism," many denominations today accept one form or another of evolutionary theory.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all religious organizations find support for evolution incompatible with their religious faith. For example, 12 of the plaintiffs opposing the teaching of [[creation science]] in the influential ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' court case were clergy representing Methodist, Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal, Catholic, Southern Baptist, Reform Jewish, and Presbyterian groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2243 McLean v Arkansas, Encyclopedia of Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several religious organizations that have issued statements advocating the teaching of evolution in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion ''Defending the teaching of evolution in public education, Statements from Religious Organizations'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr. [[Rowan Williams]], issued statements in support of evolution in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/21/archbishop_backs_evolution/ ''Archbishop of Canterbury backs evolution: Well, he is a Primate,'' Chris Williams, The Register, Tuesday 21 March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]] is a signed statement by 12,808 (as of 28 May 2012) American Christian clergy of different denominations rejecting creationism organized in 2004. Molleen Matsumura of the [[National Center for Science Education]] found, of Americans in the twelve largest Christian denominations, at least 77% belong to churches that support evolution education (and that at one point, this figure was as high as 89.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1998|p=9}} notes that, "''Table 1 demonstrates that Americans in the 12 largest Christian denominations, 89.6% belong to churches that support evolution education! Indeed, many of the statements in ''Voices'' insist quite strongly that evolution must be included in science education and "creation science" must be excluded. Even if we subtract the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], which has changed its view of evolution since [[McLean v Arkansas]] and might take a different position now, the percentage those in denominations supporting evolution is still a substantial 77%. Furthermore, many other Christian and non-Christian denominations, including the [[United Church of Christ]] and the National Sikh Center, have shown some degree of support for evolution education (as defined by inclusion in 'Voices' or the "Joint Statement").''" Matsumura produced her table from a June, 1998 article titled ''Believers: Dynamic Dozen'' put out by Religion News Services which in turn cites the ''1998 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''. Matsurmura's calculations include the [[Southern Baptist Convention|SBC]] based on a brief they filed in [[McLean v. Arkansas]], where the SBC took a position it has since changed, according to Matsurmura. See also {{harvnb|NCSE|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These religious groups include the [[Catholic Church]], as well as various denominations of Protestantism, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention, USA]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[National Baptist Convention of America]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/schrock/docs/Eagle-25.pdf ''Christianity, Evolution Not in Conflict'', John Richard Schrock, Wichita Eagle May 17, 2005 page 17A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921030214/http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/schrock/docs/Eagle-25.pdf |date=September 21, 2006 }}&lt;!-- This editorial mischaracterizes the Matsurmura|1998 article--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1998|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figure closer to about 71% is presented by the analysis of Walter B.

[[Michael Shermer]] argued in Scientific American in October 2006 that evolution supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes and the rule of law. Shermer also suggests that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052848/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00068F43-E189-150E-A18983414B7F0000&amp;colID=13 ''Darwin on the Right: Why Christians and conservatives should accept evolution''], Michael Shermer, Scientific American, October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and Ahmadiyya===
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya views of evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement universally accepts evolution and actively promotes it. [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' that evolution did occur but only through [[God]] being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. The Ahmadis do not believe [[Adam]] was the first human on earth, but merely the first prophet to receive a [[revelation]] of God.

===Evolution and the Baha'i Faith===
{{main article|Bahá'í Faith and science#Evolution}}
A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The [[seed]] does not at once become a [[tree]]; the [[embryo]] does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}}

===Evolution and the Catholic Church===
The 1950 encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'' advocated scepticism towards evolution without explicitly rejecting it; this was substantially amended by Pope John-Paul II in 1996 in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in which he said, "Today, almost half a century after publication of the encyclical, new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, Speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, October 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2002 the [[International Theological Commission]] found that "Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html "Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621050711/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html |date=June 21, 2014 }}, [[International Theological Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was published by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on July 2004 by the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger (who became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) who was the president of the Commission at the time.

The [[Magisterium]] has not made an authoritative statement on intelligent design, and has permitted arguments on both sides of the issue. In 2005, Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]] of Vienna appeared to endorse intelligent design when he denounced philosophically materialist interpretations of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Heneghan. "Catholics and Evolution: Interview with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn", ''BeliefNet'', Jan. 5, 2006 [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/182/story_18220_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed in the [[New York Times]] he said "Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense - an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection - is not."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html] Finding Design in Nature by Christoph Schönborn&lt;/ref&gt; This common line of reasoning among fundamentalist theologians is flawed, as evolution by natural selection is not random at all; only mutations occur in a stochastic manner, while natural selection establishes genes which aid survival in a particular environment.

In the January 16&amp;ndash;17 2006 edition of the official [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', [[University of Bologna]] evolutionary biology Professor [[Fiorenzo Facchini]] wrote an article agreeing with the judge's ruling in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' and stating that [[intelligent design]] was unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2006/01/intelligent-design-criticized-vatican-newspaper-00975 ''"Intelligent design" criticized in Vatican newspaper''], [[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] article, January 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/sciencespecial2/19evolution.html?ex=1295326800&amp;en=62dc61ea5d27e73d&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss ''In "Design" vs. Darwinism, Darwin Wins Point in Rome''], Ian Fisher and Cornelia Dean, New York Times, January 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesuit]] Father [[George Coyne]], former director of the [[Vatican Observatory]], has also denounced intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18503 ''Intelligent Design belittles God, Vatican director says''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323080822/http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18503 |date=March 23, 2013 }}, Mark Lombard, 1/30/2006, Catholic Online&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and Hinduism===
{{Main article|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindus believe in the concept of evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msu.edu/~hernan94] Dave Hernandez - Michigan State University&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of [[Dashavatara]]&amp;mdash;different incarnations of God starting from simple organisms and progressively becoming complex beings&amp;mdash;and [[Religious views of evolution#Day and night of Brahma|Day and Night of Brahma]] are generally cited as instances of Hindu acceptance of evolution.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===US religious denominations that dispute evolution===
In the United States, many Protestant denominations promote creationism, preach against evolution, and sponsor lectures and debates on the subject. Denominations that explicitly advocate creationism instead of evolution or "Darwinism" include the [[Assemblies of God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GCAG|1977}}, General Council of the Assemblies of Godofficial assertion of creationism&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} the [[Free Methodist Church]], [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|2001|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} [[Pentecostal Churches]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]es,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Official Seventh-day Adventist belief statement advocating creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], [[Southern Baptist Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=967 Southern Baptist Convention Resolution on Creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oneness Pentecostal|Pentecostal Oneness churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.regis.edu/mghedott/evolut.htm Prof. Michael J.

==Support for evolution in medicine and industry==
A common complaint of [[creationist]]s is that evolution is of no value, has never been used for anything, and will never be of any use. According to many creationists, nothing would be lost by getting rid of evolution, and science and industry might even benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=252 | title = Evolution - Useful or Useless? | first = George | last = Lindsey | journal = Impact | volume = #148 |date=1985-10-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |format = asp | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/evolution.asp | title = Evolution and practical science | first = Carl | last = Wieland | journal = Creation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 |date=1999-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |format = asp | ref = harv |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104420/http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/evolution.asp |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/french.asp | title = French creation interview with French scientist Dr André Eggen | first = Ken | last = Ham | journal = Creation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 17–19 |date=1998-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 | format = asp | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, evolution is being put to practical use in industry and widely used on a daily basis by researchers in [[medicine]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], and [[genetics]] to both formulate hypotheses about biological systems for the purposes of experimental design, as well as to rationalise observed data and prepare applications.&lt;ref name=nihrecord/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, George |author2=Nesse, Randolph M. |title=Why we get sick: the new science of Darwinian medicine |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-679-74674-4 |oclc= |doi= |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=applications&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA215.html | title = Index to Creationist claims: Claim CA215 | work = [[TalkOrigins Archive]] | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |date=2005-10-04 | last = Isaak | first = Mark (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindell&gt;{{cite book |author=Mindell, David A. |title=The evolving world: evolution in everyday life |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |date=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-674-02191-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017 there are 487,558 scientific papers in [[PubMed]] that mention 'evolution'.&lt;ref name=pubmed&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=evolution | title = NCBI PubMed | work = [[PubMed]] | accessdate = 2012-06-25 | date = 2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical companies utilize biological evolution in their development of new products, and also use these medicines to combat evolving bacteria and viruses.&lt;ref name=applications/&gt;

Because of the perceived value of evolution in applications, there have been some expressions of support for evolution on the part of [[corporations]]. In [[Kansas]], there has been some widespread concern in the corporate and academic communities that a move to weaken the teaching of evolution in schools will hurt the state's ability to recruit the best talent, particularly in the [[biotech]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/265482/do_scientists_see_kansas_missouri_as_antiscience | title = Do Scientists See Kansas, Missouri As 'Anti-Science'? | first = Jason | last = Gertzen |author2=Stafford, Diane  | work = The Kansas City Star |date=2005-10-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117074042/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/265482/do_scientists_see_kansas_missouri_as_antiscience |archivedate = November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hanle of the [[Biotechnology Institute]] warned that the [[United States]] risks falling behind in the [[biotechnology]] race with other nations if it does not do a better job of teaching [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901628.html ''Waging War on Evolution,'' Paul A.

Furthermore, McCarter concluded that 47 of the last 50 Nobel Prizes in medicine or physiology depended on an understanding of evolutionary theory (according to McCarter's unspecified personal criteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ncse.com/rncse/25/3-4/evolution-is-winner-breakthroughs-prizes | format = asp | title = Evolution is a Winner - for Breakthroughs and Prizes | first = James | last = McCarter | work = National Center for Science Education | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}; originally published in the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], 2005-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other support for evolution==
There are also many educational organizations that have issued statements in support of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/education List of educational organizations that support evolution and their statements about evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, creationist beliefs (or a lack of support for evolutionary theory) are relatively widespread, even garnering a majority of public opinion. A study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' compared attitudes about evolution in the United States, 32 European countries (including Turkey) and [[Japan]]. The only country where acceptance of evolution was lower than in the United States was [[Turkey]] (25%). Public acceptance of evolution was most widespread (at over 80% of the population) in [[Iceland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=ScienceSurvey&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=11 August 2006 |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=765&amp;ndash;766 |title=Public Acceptance of Evolution |author1=Jon D.

=== India ===
Among those who had heard of Charles Darwin and knew something about the theory of evolution, 77% of people in India agree that enough scientific evidence exists to support Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.&lt;ref name="ncse India"&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/opinions-evolution-from-ten-countries-004885 Opinions on evolution from ten countries] July 2nd, 2009, [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2009/07/darwin-and-unnatural-disbelief.html Darwin and unnatural disbelief] July 1, 2009. Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 85% of God believing Indians who know about evolution agree that life on earth evolved over time as a result of natural selection.&lt;ref name="ncse India"/&gt;

In a survey carried among 10 major nations, the highest proportion that agreed that evolutionary theories alone should be taught in schools was in India, at 49%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/8322781.stm Darwin teaching 'divides opinion'] [[BBC News]]; Monday, 26 October 2009. The 10 nations among which the survey was carried out were: Argentina, China, Egypt, Great Britain, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Spain, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Highest acceptence was found in Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala (all above 78%) while the least was found to be in Haryana (41.3%). Males were marginally more likely to accept the evolution compared with females (72% vs. 69%), and non-religious people compared with religious people (74% vs. 67%). Surprisingly people who identified as ‘rightists’ accepted the evolution more than those who identified themselves as ‘leftists’ (66% vs. 61%) in political spectra. The study also identified teachers and students (over 73%) as most likely to accept evolution while employed adults (59%) least. While at the international level, the trend is quite clear that religiosity is inversely proportional to public acceptance of evolution, situation in India was strikingly opposite. Lead author, Dr. [[Felix Bast]] from [[Central University of Punjab]] conjectured possible reason for high public acceptance of evolution in India despite the fact of high religiosity is that Hinduism does not conflict Darwin’s theory of evolution to a large extent. According to [[2011 Census of India|2011 census]], Hindus encompass 80.3% of Indian population. Many concepts of Vedas and Hinduism support the scientific consensus of geology, climate science and evolution to a large extent. For example, according to Rigveda, the age of earth is 1.97 billion years, which is very old compared with that of creation myth propounded by Abrahamic religions (according to creationism-also called Intelligent Design, the age of earth is around 6000 years). Current scientific consensus of the age of earth is 4.543 billion years. A number of evolutionary biologists in the past as well were baffled about the surprising similarity between evolutionary theory and Hinduism. British evolutionary biologist JBS Haldane, for instance, suggested that Hindu concept of ''dashavatara''- the ten incarnations of lord Vishnu- is a rough idea of vertebrate evolution (fish-the vertebrate to tortoise-reptile to boar-mammal to man). Vedic concepts of ''pralaya'' and ''mahapralaya'' too surprisingly capture the cyclic nature of global climate (glacial-interglacial cycles).

A 2006 UK poll on the "origin and development of life" asked participants to choose between three different explanations for the origin of life: 22% chose (Young Earth) [[Young Earth creationism|creationism]], 17% opted for [[intelligent design]] ("certain features of living things are best explained by the intervention of a supernatural being, e.g. God"), 48% selected [[evolution]] theory (with a divine role explicitly excluded) and the rest did not know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4648598.stm Britons unconvinced on evolution] BBC 26 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/262/BBC-Survey-On-The-Origins-Of-Life.aspx BBC Survey On The Origins Of Life] IPSOS-Mori&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 poll found that only 38% of Britons believe God played no role in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/poll-darwin-survey-shows-international-consensus-on-acceptance-of-evolution.pdf|title=Project Darwin Omnibus - Great Britain|last=|first=|date=April 2009|website=Ipsos|access-date=24 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305194947/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/poll-darwin-survey-shows-international-consensus-on-acceptance-of-evolution.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 poll, 69% of Britons believe that humans evolved from less advanced life forms, while 17% believe that God created human beings in their present forms within the last 10,000 years.&lt;ref name="Angus Reid Polls"/&gt;

===United States===
US courts have ruled in favor of teaching evolution in science classrooms, and against teaching creationism, in numerous cases such as [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], [[Hendren v. Campbell]], [[McLean v. Arkansas]] and [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]].

A prominent organization in the United States behind the [[intelligent design movement]] is the  Discovery Institute, which, through its [[Center for Science and Culture]], conducts a number of [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|public relations and lobbying campaigns]] aimed at influencing the public and policy makers in order to advance its position in [[academia]]. The [[Discovery Institute]] claims that because there is a significant lack of [[Argumentum ad populum|public support]] for evolution, that [[creation and evolution in public education|public schools]] should, as their campaign states, "[[Teach the Controversy]]", although there is no controversy over the validity of evolution within the scientific community.

The US has one of the highest levels of public belief in biblical or other religious accounts of the origins of life on earth among industrialized countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116213944/http://www.galluppoll.com/content/?CI=14107 ''Third of Americans Say Evidence Has Supported Darwin's Evolution Theory Almost half of Americans believe God created humans 10,000 years ago'' Frank Newport ] Result of 2004 Gallup poll showing about 45% of the US public believe in the biblical creation account, and only 1/3 believe in Darwinian theory.&lt;/ref&gt; However according to the PEW research center, 62 percent of adults in the [[United States]] accept human evolution and while 34 percent of adults believe that humans have always existed in their present form. The poll involved over 35,000 adults in the [[United States]]. However acceptance of evolution varies per state. For example the State of [[Vermont]] has the highest acceptance of evolution of any other State in the [[United States]]. 79% people in [[Vermont]] accept human evolution. [[Mississippi]] has the lowest acceptance of evolution of any other State in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/12/30/publics-views-on-human-evolution/ | title=Public's Views on Human Evolution &amp;#124; Pew Research Center| date=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] creationism survey found that 38% of adults in the United States inclined to the view that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which was noted as being at the lowest level in 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx | title=In U.S., Belief in Creationist View of Humans at New Low}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19% believed that "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process", despite 49% of respondents indicating they believed in evolution.

A 2005 Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of evangelical Christians believed that living organisms have not changed since their creation, but only 31% of Catholics and 32% of mainline Protestants shared this opinion. A 2005 Harris Poll&lt;ref name=Harrispoll&gt;[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 ''Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217080148/http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |date=2005-12-17 }}, The Harris Poll #52, July 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that 63% of liberals and 37% of conservatives agreed that humans and other primates have a common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;

=== Uruguay ===
According to a 2014 poll produced by the Pew Research Center, 74% of people in Uruguay believe "humans and other living things evolved over time" while 20% believe they have "always existed in the present form."&lt;ref name="PewLatinAmerica" /&gt;

=== Venezuela ===
According to a 2014 poll by the Pew Research Center, 63% of people in Venezuela believe "humans and other living things evolved over time" while 33% believe they have "always existed in the present form."&lt;ref name="PewLatinAmerica" /&gt;

== Trends ==
The level of assent that evolution garners has changed with time. The trends in acceptance of evolution can be estimated.

===Early impact of Darwin's theory===
The level of support for evolution in different communities has varied with time. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory had convinced almost every naturalist within 20 years of its publication in 1858, and was making serious inroads with the public and the more liberal clergy. It had reached such extremes, that by 1880, one
American religious weekly publication estimated that "perhaps a quarter, perhaps a half of the educated ministers in our leading Evangelical denominations" felt "that the story of the creation and fall of man, told in Genesis, is no more the record of actual occurrences than is the parable of the Prodigal Son."&lt;ref name=Numbers&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070621033807/http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/NUMCRX_excerpt.pdf ''The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, expanded edition'', Ronald L. Numbers, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England, 2006] {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, many of the most conservative Christians accepted an ancient earth, and life on earth before Eden. [[Victorian Era]] Creationists were more akin to people who subscribe to [[theistic evolution]] today. Even fervent anti-evolutionist [[Scopes Trial]] prosecutor [[William Jennings Bryan]] interpreted the "days" of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as ages of the earth, and acknowledged that biochemical evolution took place, drawing the line only at the story of [[Adam and Eve]]'s creation. Prominent pre-World War II creationist [[Harry Rimmer]] allowed an [[Old Earth Creationist|Old Earth]] by slipping millions of years into putative gaps in the Genesis account, and claimed that the [[Noachian Flood]] was only a local phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

In the decades of the 20th century, [[George McCready Price]] and a tiny group of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] followers were among the very few believers in a [[Young Earth Creationism|Young Earth]] and a worldwide flood, which Price championed in his "new catastrophism" theories. It was not until the publication of [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]], and [[Henry M. Morris]]’s book ''Genesis Flood'' in 1961 that Price's idea was revived. In the last few decades, many creationists have adopted Price's beliefs, becoming progressively more strict [[biblical literalists]].&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2015}}

===Recent public beliefs===
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
In a 1991 Gallup poll, 47% of the US population, and 25% of college graduates agreed with the statement, "God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000 years."

Fourteen years
later, in 2005, Gallup found that 53% of Americans expressed the belief that "God created human beings in their present form exactly the way the Bible describes it." About 2/3 (65.5%) of those surveyed thought that creationism was definitely or probably true. In 2005 a [[Newsweek]] poll discovered that 80 percent of the American public thought that "God created the universe." and the Pew Research Center reported that "nearly two-thirds of Americans say that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in public schools." [[Ronald Numbers]] commented on that with "Most surprising of all was the discovery that large numbers of high-school biology teachers — from 30% in Illinois and 38% in Ohio to a whopping 69% in Kentucky — supported the teaching of creationism."&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

The [[National Center for Science Education]] reports that from 1985 to 2005, the number of Americans unsure about evolution increased from 7% to 21%, while the number rejecting evolution declined from 48% to 39%.&lt;ref name=ScienceSurvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9786 Why doesn't America believe in evolution?, Jeff Hecht, New Scientist, 20 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Miller of Michigan State University has found in his polls that the number of Americans who accept evolution has declined from 45% to 40% from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Science, vol 313, p 765&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these somewhat contradictory results, it is difficult to know for sure what is happening to public opinion on evolution in the US. It does not appear that either side is making unequivocal progress. It does appear that uncertainty about the issue is increasing, however.

Anecdotal evidence is that creationism is becoming more of an issue in the UK as well. One report in 2006 was that UK students are increasingly arriving ill-prepared to participate in medical studies or other advanced education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1714171,00.html ''Academics fight rise of creationism at universities: More students believe Darwin got it wrong, Royal Society challenges "insidious problem"''], Duncan Campbell, The Guardian, Tuesday February 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent scientific trends===
The level of support for [[creationism]] among relevant scientists is minimal. In 2007 the [[Discovery Institute]] reported that about 600 scientists signed their ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism|A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]'' list, up from 100 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2732 | title = Ranks of Scientists Doubting Darwin's Theory on the Rise | author = Staff, [[Discovery Institute]] | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] |date=2007-03-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual statement of the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism is a relatively mild one that expresses skepticism about the absoluteness of 'Darwinism' (and is in line with the [[falsifiability]] required of [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]) to explain all features of life, and does not in any way represent an absolute denial or rejection of evolution.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ncse.com/creationism/general/doubting-darwinism-creative-license | title = Doubting Darwinism through Creative License | last = Evans | first = Skip | authorlink = Skip Evans | publisher = [[National Center for Science Education]] |date=2001-11-29 | accessdate = 2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a tongue-in-cheek response known as [[Project Steve]], a list restricted to scientists named Steve, Stephanie etc. who agree that evolution is "a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences," has 1,382 signatories {{As of|2015|11|24|alt=as of November 24, 2015}}.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve |title=Project Steve  |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with these names make up approximately 1% of the total U.S. population.

The United States [[National Science Foundation]] statistics on US yearly science graduates demonstrate that from 1987 to 2001, the number of biological science graduates increased by 59% while the number of geological science graduates decreased by 20.5%. However, the number of geology graduates in 2001 was only 5.4% of the number of graduates in the biological sciences, while it was 10.7% of the number of biological science graduates in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf04311/pdf/tab42.pdf | title = NSF statistics on science graduates 1966&amp;ndash;2001 | publisher = National Science Foundation | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109070632/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf04311/pdf/tab42.pdf | archivedate = 2006-11-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Resources Statistics Division of the National Science Foundation estimated that in 1999, there were 955,300 biological scientists in the US (about 1/3 of who hold graduate degrees). There were also 152,800 earth scientists in the US as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://srsstats.sbe.nsf.gov/preformatted-tables/1999/tables/TableC1.pdf | title = 1999 SESTAT (Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data) Table C-1 | publisher = National Science Foundation/Science Resources Statistics Division | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929135233/http://srsstats.sbe.nsf.gov/preformatted-tables/1999/tables/TableC1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large fraction of the Darwin Dissenters have specialties unrelated to research on evolution; of the dissenters, three-quarters are not biologists.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title = Few Biologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition | first = Kenneth | last = Chang | publisher = The [[New York Times]] |date=2006-03-21 | format = php }}; text available without registering at {{cite web | url = http://www.ntskeptics.org/news/news2006-02-25.htm | title = Skeptical News }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, the dissenter list was expanded to include non-US scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/06/dissent_from_darwinism_goes_gl.html | last = Crowther | first = Robert | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] | title = Dissent From Darwinism 'Goes Global' as Over 600 Scientists Around the World Express Their Doubts About Darwinian Evolution | accessdate = 2007-10-30 |date=2006-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers are attempting to understand the factors that affect people's acceptance of evolution. Studies have yielded inconsistent results, explains associate professor of education at Ohio State University, David Haury. He recently performed a study that found people are likely to reject evolution if they have feelings of uncertainty, regardless of how well they understand evolutionary theory. Haury believes that teachers need to show students that their intuitive feelings may be misleading (for example, using the [[Wason selection task]]), and thus to exercise caution when relying on them as they judge the rational merits of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/tea.20449 | volume=49 | issue=1 | title=Feeling of certainty: Uncovering a missing link between knowledge and acceptance of evolution | year=2011 | journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching | pages=95–121 | last1 = Ha | first1 = Minsu| bibcode=2012JRScT..49...95H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/human/intuition-belief-evolution-120122.html Discovery News, "Belief in Evolution Boils Down to a Gut Feeling", Sun Jan 22, 2012 09:24 AM ET.

'''Mercury(II) iodide''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the molecular formula [[Mercury (element)|Hg]][[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is typically produced synthetically but can also be found in nature as the extremely rare mineral [[coccinite]]. Unlike the related [[mercury(II) chloride]] it is hardly soluble in water (&lt;100 ppm).

==Production==
Mercury(II) iodide is produced by adding an aqueous solution of [[potassium iodide]] to an aqueous solution of [[mercury(II) chloride]] with stirring; the precipitate is filtered off, washed and dried at 70&amp;nbsp;°C.

: HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 KI → HgI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + KCl

==Properties==
Mercury(II) iodide displays [[thermochromism]]; when heated above 126&amp;nbsp;°C (400°K) it undergoes a [[phase transition]], from the red alpha crystalline form to a pale yellow beta form. As the sample cools, it gradually reacquires its original colour. It has often used for [[thermochromism]] demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/JCESoft/CCA/CCA2/MAIN/THERMHG/CD2R1.HTM Thermochromism: Mercury(II) Iodide]. Jchemed.chem.wisc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; A third orange form is also known; this can be formed by recrystallisation and is also [[metastable]], eventually converting back to the red alpha form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SCHWARZENBACH|first1=D.|title=The crystal structure and one-dimensional disorder of the orange modification of HgI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Zeitschrift für Kristallographie - Crystalline Materials|date=1 January 1969|volume=128|issue=1-6|doi=10.1524/zkri.1969.128.16.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various forms can exist in a diverse range of crystal structures and as a result mercury(II) iodide possess a surprisingly complex [[phase diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hostettler|first1=Marc|last2=Schwarzenbach|first2=Dieter|title=Phase diagrams and structures of HgX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X = I, Br, Cl, F)|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|date=February 2005|volume=8|issue=2|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/j.crci.2004.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Mercury(II) iodide is used for preparation of [[Nessler's reagent]], used for detection of presence of [[ammonia]].

Mercury(II) iodide is a [[semiconductor material]], used in some [[x-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] detection and imaging devices operating at room temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Simage, Oy {{US patent|6509203}} Semiconductor imaging device and method for producing same, Issue date: Jan 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[veterinary medicine]], mercury(II) iodide is used in [[blister]] [[ointment]]s in [[exostosis|exostoses]], [[Bursa (anatomy)|bursal]] enlargement, etc. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}

It can appear as a precipitate in many reactions.

'''Mesa Power''' is a wind energy company owned by [[T. Boone Pickens]].  The company had plans to build large wind farms in the western Texas panhandle, the so-called [[Pampa Wind Project]], part of the [[Pickens Plan]].  However, on July 8, 2009 the wind farm project was delayed [http://www.businessweek.com/print/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2009/db2009078_354291.htm] for what were described as economic reasons. Pickens says he is fully committed to wind energy and to developing wind projects in the US and perhaps, Canada but that because of capital market setbacks he plans to be less aggressive with the Panhandle project [https://archive.is/20130128111052/http://mesapowergroup.com/]. The company remains committed to the delivery 667 wind turbines and is planning to find projects for them. The company also plans to continue development of the Pampa project, but not at the pace originally expected.

The '''Mongstad scandal''' was a crisis in the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[oil company]] [[Statoil]] in 1987-88.

The company exceeded the [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 8 billion budget by NOK 6 billion in upgrading the [[oil refinery]] at [[Mongstad]]. Retrospectively the reasons for the overexpenditure were attributed to bad planning, technical miscalculations and bad project management. The executives in Statoil were also accused of inability to act and for withholding information from the [[Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy]]. At the time the incident aroused considerable media attention.

The first warnings of a budget overspend came on 25 September 1987, when the over-expenditure was estimated at NOK 3,8 billion. On 20 November most of the [[board of directors]] had to resign.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/21/business/oil-scandal-in-norway.html?pagewanted=1 Oil Scandal in Norway, New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; The board was led by chairman [[Inge Johansen]] and deputy chairman [[Vidkunn Hveding]] since 1984. The other board members who also resigned were [[Thor Andreassen]] (member since 1978), [[Fredrik Thoresen]] (member since 1984), [[Guttorm Hansen]] (member since 1986) and [[Toril V. Lundestad]] (member since 1986). The only board members not to resign were the three employee representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Statoil-styret som går|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=20 November 1987|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later [[chief executive officer]] [[Arve Johnsen]] also resigned, at the time the only CEO in the history of the company to resign. In January 1988 reports of a possibility of the overexpenditure accumulating another billion NOK were presented. By April the anticipated overspend was believed to be in the order of NOK 8 billion, although the final sum came to NOK 6 billion.

The enormous shock effect of the Mongstad scandal should be understood in the light of the social and political situation of Norway in 1988. Statoil was at the time a [[aksjeselskap|limited company]] wholly owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, who managed the entire profit. After the company had started to make a profit around 1980 it had become the guarantor for welfare in the country in the minds of people. The company's transfers to government treasury coffers exceeded that of [[income tax]] at the time. CEO Arve Johnsen was the man who could do nothing wrong,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] man who controlled Statoil even during a [[Willoch's First Cabinet|conservative government]]. Prime Minister [[Kåre Willoch]]'s attempt to clip Statoil's wings a few years earlier had failed. And at the same time came the bankruptcy in the largest bank, [[Den norske Creditbank]] that had announced the start of the fall of the [[Yuppie|Yuppie age]].

The media attention on the Mongstad scandal in 1988 was enormous, and was front-page material almost daily. The [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers battles fiercely in trying to visualise the, at the time, almost unimaginable size of NOK 6 billion. The sum was creatively recalculated in [[kindergarten]] places, [[retirement home]] places, [[fighter jet]]s etc. Sometimes the coverage became absurd with parallels such as ''[[Dagbladet]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s example of 6 billion = enough to buy one [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|AG3]] [[assault rifle]] for each of the country's 4,5 million inhabitants. For years the term ''one mong'' was used as a [[synonym]] for the number 6 billion.

A '''pentaquark''' is a [[subatomic particle]] consisting of four [[quark]]s and one [[antiquark]] [[bound state|bound together]].

As quarks have a [[baryon number]] of +{{sfrac|1|3}}, and antiquarks of −{{sfrac|1|3}}, the pentaquark would have a total baryon number of 1, and thus would be a [[baryon]]. Further, because it has five quarks instead of the usual three found in regular baryons ({{a.k.a.}} 'triquarks'), it would be classified as an [[exotic baryon]]. The name pentaquark was coined by Claude Gignoux et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gignoux|first=C.|last2=Silvestre-Brac|first2=B.|last3=Richard|first3=J.

==Background==
{{main|Quark}}

A [[quark]] is a type of [[elementary particle]] that has [[mass]], [[electric charge]], and [[colour charge]], as well as an additional property called [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavour]], which describes what type of quark it is (up, down, strange, charm, top, or bottom). Due to an effect known as [[colour confinement]], quarks are never seen on their own. Instead, they form [[composite particles]] known as [[hadrons]] so that their colour charges cancel out. Hadrons made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]] are known as [[meson]]s, while those made of three quarks are known as [[baryon]]s. These 'regular' hadrons are well documented and characterized, however, there is nothing in theory to prevent quarks from forming [[exotic hadron|'exotic' hadrons]] such as [[tetraquark]]s with two quarks and two antiquarks, or pentaquarks with four quarks and one antiquark.&lt;ref name="NewScientist2003"/&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Pentaquark.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of the {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}}} type pentaquark possibly discovered in July 2015, showing the flavours of each quark and one possible colour configuration.|alt=five circles arranged clockwise: blue circle marked "c", yellow (antiblue) circle marked "c" with an overscore, green circle marked "u", blue circle marked "d", and red circle marked "u".]]

A wide variety of pentaquarks are possible, with different quark combinations producing different particles. To identify which quarks compose a given pentaquark, physicists use the notation ''qqqq{{overline|q}}'', where ''q'' and ''{{overline|q}}'' respectively refer to any of the six flavours of quarks and antiquarks. The symbols u, d, s, c, b, and t stand for the [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[bottom quark|bottom]], and [[top quark|top]] quarks respectively, with the symbols of {{overline|u}}, {{overline|d}}, {{overline|s}}, {{overline|c}}, {{overline|b}}, {{overline|t}} corresponding to the respective antiquarks. For instance a pentaquark made of two up quarks, one down quark, one charm quark, and one charm antiquark would be denoted uudc{{overline|c}}.

The quarks are bound together by the [[strong force]], which acts in such a way as to cancel the colour charges within the particle. In a meson, this means a quark is partnered with an antiquark with an opposite colour charge – blue and antiblue, for example – while in a baryon, the three quarks have between them all three colour charges – red, blue, and green.{{refn|group=nb|The colour charges do not correspond to physical visible colours. They are arbitrary labels used to help scientists describe and visualise the charges of quarks.}} In a pentaquark, the colours also need to cancel out, and the only feasible combination is to have one quark with one colour (e.g. red), one quark with a second colour (e.g. green), two quarks with the third colour (e.g. blue), and one antiquark to counteract the surplus colour (e.g. antiblue).&lt;ref name="HadronPhysics"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The binding mechanism for pentaquarks is not yet clear. They may consist of five quarks tightly bound together, but it is also possible that they are more loosely bound and consist of a three-quark baryon and a two-quark meson interacting relatively weakly with each other via [[nuclear force|pion exchange]] (the same force that binds [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]) in a "meson-baryon molecule".&lt;ref name="LHCb-public"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewScientist2015"&gt;

==History==

===Mid-2000s===
The requirement to include an antiquark means that many classes of pentaquark are hard to identify experimentally – if the flavour of the antiquark matches the flavour of any other quark in the quintuplet, it will cancel out and the particle will resemble its three-quark hadron cousin. For this reason, early pentaquark searches looked for particles where the antiquark did not cancel.&lt;ref name="HadronPhysics"/&gt; In the mid-2000s, several experiments claimed to reveal pentaquark states. In particular, a [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance]] with a [[mass]] of {{val|1540|ul=MeV/c2}} (4.6&amp;nbsp;[[standard deviation|&amp;sigma;]]) was reported by [[LEPS]] in 2003, the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}.&lt;ref name=PDG2006&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with a pentaquark state with a mass of {{val|1530|u=MeV/c2}} predicted in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;

The proposed state was composed of two [[up quark]]s, two [[down quark]]s, and one [[strange antiquark]] (uudd{{overline|s}}). Following this announcement, nine other independent experiments reported seeing [[resonance width|narrow peak]]s from {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|neutron}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Kaon+}} and  {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|proton}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Kaon0}}, with masses between {{val|1522|u=MeV/c2}} and {{val|1555|u=MeV/c2}}, all above 4&amp;nbsp;σ.&lt;ref name=PDG2006/&gt; While concerns existed about the validity of these states, the [[Particle Data Group]] gave the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}} a 3-star rating (out of 4) in the 2004 ''[[Review of Particle Physics]]''.&lt;ref name=PDG2006/&gt; Two other pentaquark states were reported albeit with low statistical significance—the {{SubatomicParticle|Phi--}} (ddss{{overline|u}}), with a mass of {{val|1860|u=MeV/c2}} and the {{SubatomicParticle|Charmed Theta0}} (uudd{{overline|c}}), with a mass of {{val|3099|u=MeV/c2}}. Both were later found to be statistical effects rather than true resonances.&lt;ref name=PDG2006/&gt;

Ten experiments then looked for the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}, but came out empty-handed.&lt;ref name=PDG2006/&gt; Two in particular (one at [[Belle experiment|BELLE]], and the other at [[CLAS detector|CLAS]]) had nearly the same conditions as other experiments which claimed to have detected the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}} ([[DIANA experiment|DIANA]] and [[SAPHIR experiment|SAPHIR]] respectively).&lt;ref name=PDG2006/&gt; The 2006 ''Review of Particle Physics'' concluded:&lt;ref name=PDG2006/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]here has not been a high-statistics confirmation of any of the original experiments that claimed to see the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}; there have been two high-statistics repeats from [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|Jefferson Lab]] that have clearly shown the original positive claims in those two cases to be wrong; there have been a number of other high-statistics experiments, none of which have found any evidence for the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}; and all attempts to confirm the two other claimed pentaquark states have led to negative results. The conclusion that pentaquarks in general, and the {{SubatomicParticle|Theta+}}, in particular, do not exist, appears compelling.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2008 ''Review of Particle Physics'' went even further:&lt;ref name=PDG2008/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two or three recent experiments that find weak evidence for signals near the nominal masses, but there is simply no point in tabulating them in view of the overwhelming evidence that the claimed pentaquarks do not exist... The whole story—the discoveries themselves, the tidal wave of papers by theorists and phenomenologists that followed, and the eventual "undiscovery"—is a curious episode in the history of science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite these [[null result]]s, LEPS results {{As of|2009|lc=on}} continue to show the existence of a narrow state  with a mass of {{val|1524|4|ul=MeV/c2}}, with a [[statistical significance]] of 5.1&amp;nbsp;σ.&lt;ref&gt;

===2015 LHCb results===
[[File:Pentaquark-Feynman.svg|thumb|right|[[Feynman diagram]] representing the decay of a lambda baryon {{nowrap|Λ{{su|p=0|b=b}}}} into a kaon {{nowrap|K{{su|p=−}}}} and a pentaquark {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}}}.]]
In July 2015, the [[LHCb|LHCb collaboration]] at [[CERN]] identified pentaquarks in the {{nowrap|Λ{{su|p=0|b=b}}→J/ψK{{su|p=−}}p}} channel, which represents the decay of the bottom lambda baryon {{nowrap|(Λ{{su|p=0|b=b}})}} into a [[J/ψ meson]] {{nowrap|(J/ψ)}}, a [[kaon]] {{nowrap|(K{{su|p=−}})}} and a [[proton]] (p). The results showed that sometimes, instead of decaying via intermediate [[lambda baryon|lambda]] states, the {{nowrap|Λ{{su|p=0|b=b}}}} decayed via intermediate pentaquark states. The two states, named {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}(4380)}} and {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}(4450)}}, had individual [[statistical significance]]s of 9&amp;nbsp;σ and 12&amp;nbsp;σ, respectively, and a combined significance of 15&amp;nbsp;σ — enough to claim a formal discovery. The analysis ruled out the possibility that the effect was caused by conventional particles.&lt;ref name="LHCb-public"/&gt; The two pentaquark states were both observed decaying strongly to {{nowrap|J/ψp}}, hence must have a valence quark content of two [[up quark]]s, a [[down quark]], a [[charm quark]], and an anti-charm quark ({{Subatomic particle|up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|down quark}}{{Subatomic particle|charm quark}}{{Subatomic particle|charm antiquark}}), making them [[charmonium]]-pentaquarks.&lt;ref name="LHCb2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The search for pentaquarks was not an objective of the LHCb experiment (which is primarily designed to investigate [[baryon asymmetry|matter-antimatter asymmetry]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/en/Physics/WhereIsAntimatter-en.html|title=Where has all the antimatter gone?|publisher=[[CERN]]/[[LHCb]]|year=2008|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the apparent discovery of pentaquarks was described as an "accident" and "something we’ve stumbled across" by the Physics Coordinator for the experiment.&lt;ref name="NewScientist2015"/&gt;

===Studies of pentaquarks in other experiments===
[[File:J-psi p pentaquark mass spectrum.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|A fit to the {{nowrap|J/ψp}} invariant mass spectrum for the {{nowrap|Λ{{su|p=0|b=b}}→J/ψK{{su|p=−}}p}} decay, with each fit component shown individually. The contribution of the pentaquarks are shown by hatched [[histograms]].]]
The production of pentaquarks from electroweak decays of {{nowrap|Λ{{su|p=0|b=b}}}} baryons has extremely small cross-section and yields very limited information about internal structure of pentaquarks. For this reason, there are several ongoing and proposed initiatives to study pentaquark production in other channels.

It is expected that pentaquarks will be studied in electron-proton collisions in Hall B [https://misportal.jlab.org/mis/physics/experiments/viewProposal.cfm?paperId=885 E2-16-007] and Hall C [https://misportal.jlab.org/mis/physics/experiments/viewProposal.cfm?paperId=931 E12-12-001A] experiments at JLAB.  The major challenge in these studies is a heavy mass of the pentaquark, which will be produced at the tail of photon-proton spectrum in JLAB kinematics. For this reason, the currently unknown branching fractions of pentaquark should be sufficiently large to allow pentaquark detection in JLAB kinematics. The proposed [[Electron-ion collider|Electron Ion Collider]] which has higher energies is much better suited for this problem. 

An interesting channel to study pentaquarks in proton-nuclear collisions was suggested in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Iván |last2=Siddikov |first2=Marat |title=Production of pentaquarks in pA-collisions |journal=Physical Review D |date=3 May 2016 |volume=93 |issue=9 |page=094005 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.93.094005|arxiv=1601.05621 |bibcode=2016PhRvD..93i4005S }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This process has a large cross-section due to lack of electroweak intermediaries and gives access to pentaquark wave function. In the fixed-target experiments pentaquarks will be produced with small rapidities in laboratory frame and will be easily detected.
Besides, if there are neutral pentaquarks, as suggested in several models based on flavour symmetry, these might be also produced in this mechanism. This process might be studied at future high-luminosity experiments like [http://after.in2p3.fr/after/index.php/Main_Page After@LHC]  and [http://nica.jinr.ru/ NICA].

The discovery of pentaquarks will allow physicists to study the [[strong force]] in greater detail and aid understanding of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. In addition, current theories suggest that some very large stars produce pentaquarks as they collapse. The study of pentaquarks might help shed light on the physics of [[neutron star]]s.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

The first system was sold to Google in 2011 for employee use at the Mountain View campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thibaut|first1=Kyle|title=Google Is Hooking Up Their Employees With Plugless Power For Their Electric Cars (Video)|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/22/google-is-trying-out-plugless-power-for-their-electric-cars-video/|website=techcrunch.com|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evatran began selling the Plugless L2 Wireless charging system to the public in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacque|first1=Peter|title=Evatran to begin shipping its Plugless electric vehicle charging system|url=http://www.richmond.com/business/national-international/article_e92e9d29-28f4-523f-b782-22f137b2a540.html|accessdate=January 10, 2015|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple terms, inductive charging works by separating the two halves of an electric [[transformer]] with an air gap – one half, the Plugless Power Vehicle Adapter, is installed on the vehicle and the other half, the Plugless Power Parking Pad, is installed on the floor of a garage or in a parking lot. When a car with an Adapter drives over a Pad, the two pieces are brought into close proximity, {{convert|70|-|130|mm|in|abbr=on}}, then [[electrical current|current]] from the [[electrical grid]] flows through the coils in the Power Pad to create magnetic fields and these fields induce current flow in the Vehicle Adapter's coils to charge the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].

[[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL) testing in 2013&lt;ref name="INL"&gt;{{cite web|title=PLUGLESS TM Level 2 EV Charging System (3.3 kW) by Evatran Group Inc., INL/MIS-13-29807|url=http://avt.inel.gov/pdf/evse/EvatranWirelessChargingFactsheetAug2013.pdf#page=2|work=Vehicle Technologies Program|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy [[Idaho National Laboratory]]|accessdate=13 March 2014|pages=2–3|format=PDF|date=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; found the system had a power delivery efficiency between 84%-90%, compared to 95%-99% for corded charging systems, depending on the alignment of the Adapter and Pad, the separation gap, and the rate of power transfer in use (kW).

In 2014, ''Popular Science'' included the Plugless L2 charging system as Best of What's New 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Paula|first1=Matthew|last2=Ransom|first2=Cliff|title=EVATRAN PLUGLESS L2 WIRELESS CHARGING FOR ELECTRIC CARS|url=http://bestofwhatsnew.popsci.com/evatran-plugless-l2|website=popsci.com|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chrysler CEO, [[Tom LaSorda]], joined Evatran as a strategic adviser in October 2014.  LaSorda joined the management board at Daimler in 2004, then served as CEO and president of Chrysler from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automotive Executive Tom LaSorda Joins Evatran|url=http://pluglesspower.com/pgls_press_release/automotive-executive-tom-lasorda-joins-evatran-help-extend-market-lead-plugless-wireless-ev-charging-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, the Plugless L2 was being sold for use with the Nissan LEAF, Chevrolet Volt, Cadillac ELR and Tesla Model S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2016/10/11/evatran-plugless-charging-systems-compatible-80-evs-2017/|title=Evatran: Plugless Charging Systems Compatible With 80% Of EVs By 2017|last=James|first=Ayre|date=11 October 2016|website=cleantechnica.com|publisher=Clean Technica|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">The '''Polytantric Circle''' was an organization that helped organize the yearly [[Summer solstice]] [[Midsummer|celebrations]] at [[Stonehenge]], [[England]]. These celebrations, called the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]], ran from 1972 to 1984. 

By the early 1980s, the festival had begun to attract a large following, and the people who helped to put the festival together year after year began to take on specific roles.  Willy X put together an annual festival list and had contact lists for bands, and the loose-knit Polytantric, an offshoot of the [[White Panther Party|White Panthers]], took the lead in organising the stage and pyramid roof. PA. Bands. [[Nik Turner]] of [[Hawkwind]] offered valuable experience in use of setting up of the pyramid, a free alternative space, a legendary stage, which had originally made its debut with Sphinx at the [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh festival]] Greenham, Sizewell, Stonehenge, Hyde Park. Brixton. From festival to campaign gigs to [[Legal issues of cannabis|legalise it]] to peace protest to benefit, the pyramid epitomised the ambitions of a radical and vibrant alternative popular youth counter culture. In the winter huge blocks of [[quartz crystal]]s were hung inside the pyramid to purify the energies.  

Stonehenge begun to grow rapidly: in 1980, 12,000 people had attended, but by '82 there were 35,000. However, coordination between [[English Heritage]], the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and the Polytantric Circle seemed to be breaking down.

In 1983 it was decided to move the stage to the field closer to the woods and further away from the Stones. [[Sid Rawle]] and Big Steve the polytantric stage manager wandered across the fields past the mounds clutching a [[dowsing rod]]; it twitched downwards in a circle of daisies, the spot that was to become the site for the stage for the pyramid stage at the Stonehenge free festival. Six days and six nights of live music followed.

In 1985 celebrations at Stonehenge were banned by [[England|English]] courts. This ban was lifted in 1999, and the campaign for a new free festival summer solstice celebration continues.

The group published "The Polytantric Newsletter"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1986&amp;volume=IT-Volume-86&amp;issue=1&amp;item=IT_1986-01-01_K-IT-Volume-86_Iss-1_002 Stonehenge Stands Still - IT 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; and were the first to organise what became [[The Stonehenge Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1986&amp;volume=IT-Volume-86&amp;issue=1&amp;item=IT_1986-01-01_K-IT-Volume-86_Iss-1_003 Campaign details - IT 1986] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007102909/http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1986&amp;volume=IT-Volume-86&amp;issue=1&amp;item=IT_1986-01-01_K-IT-Volume-86_Iss-1_003 |date=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29396">[[Image:Toutatis.jpg|thumb|250px|The asteroid [[4179 Toutatis|Toutatis]] is listed as a potentially hazardous [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth]] [[asteroid]], yet poses no immediate threat to Earth. ([[radar astronomy|Radar image]] taken by [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|GDSCC]] in 1996.)]]

A '''potentially hazardous object''' ('''PHO''') is a [[near-Earth object]] – either an [[asteroid]] or a [[comet]] – with an [[orbit]] that can make exceptionally close approaches to the [[Earth]] and large enough to cause significant regional damage in the [[Impact event|event of impact]].&lt;ref name="Task-Force-Report" /&gt;

Most of these objects are '''potentially hazardous asteroids''' ('''PHAs'''), defined as having a [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of less than {{convert|0.05|AU|LD|lk=on|sigfig=3|abbr=off}} and an [[absolute magnitude]] of 22 or brighter.&lt;ref name="CNEOS-Basics" /&gt; {{As of|2018|01}} there are 1,885 known PHAs (about 11% of the total near-Earth population), of which 157 are estimated to be larger than one kilometer in diameter ''(see list of [[#Largest PHAs|largest PHAs]] below)''.&lt;ref name="CNEOS-totals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-unusual-overview" /&gt;{{efn|name=note-diameter-estimates}} Most of the discovered PHAs are [[Apollo asteroids]] (1,601) and fewer belong to the group of [[Aten asteroid]]s (169).&lt;ref name="SBDB-query-all-PHA-Apollos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SBDB-query-all-PHA-Atens"/&gt;

A potentially hazardous object can be known not to be a threat to Earth for the next 100 years or more, if its orbit is reasonably well determined. Potentially hazardous asteroids with some threat of impacting Earth in the next 100 years are listed on the [[Sentry Risk Table]]. Potentially hazardous asteroids are normally only a hazard on a time scale of hundreds of years as the known orbit becomes more divergent. After several [[astronomical survey]]s, the number of known PHAs has increased tenfold since the end of the 1990s ''(see [[#Statistics|bar charts]] below)''.&lt;ref name="CNEOS-totals" /&gt; The [[Minor Planet Center]]'s website ''List of the Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'' also publishes detailed information for these objects.&lt;ref name="MPC-PHA-list" /&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Image:Potentially Hazardous Asteroids 2013.png|thumb|left|245px|Plot of orbits of known potentially hazardous asteroids, with sizes over {{convert|460|ft|m|order=flip}} and that pass within {{convert|4.7|e6mi|e6km|order=flip}} of Earth's orbit. [[Epoch (astronomy)|Epoch]] as of early 2013.]]

An object is considered a PHO if its [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) with respect to Earth is less than {{convert|0.05|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} – approximately 19.5&amp;nbsp;[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] – and its [[absolute magnitude]] is brighter than 22, approximately corresponding to a diameter of at least {{convert|140|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Task-Force-Report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNEOS-Basics" /&gt; This is big enough to cause regional devastation to human settlements unprecedented in human history in the case of a land impact, or a major [[tsunami]] in the case of an [[ocean]] impact. Such impact events occur on average around once per 10,000&amp;nbsp;years. [[NEOWISE]] data estimates that there are 4,700&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1,500 potentially hazardous asteroids with a diameter greater than 100 meters.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

=== Levels of hazard ===
{{main|Torino Scale|Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale}}

The two main scales used to categorize the impact hazards of asteroids are the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]] and the [[Torino Scale]].

=== Potentially hazardous comets ===

Short-period comets currently with an Earth-MOID less than 0.05&amp;nbsp;AU include: [[109P/Swift-Tuttle]], [[55P/Tempel–Tuttle]], [[15P/Finlay]], [[289P/Blanpain]], [[255P/Levy]], [[206P/Barnard–Boattini]], [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner]], and [[73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann]].

In 2012 [[NASA]] estimated 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;percent of these objects have been found.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt; During an asteroid's close approaches to planets or moons other than the [[Earth]], it will be subject to gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]], modifying its orbit, and potentially changing a previously non-threatening asteroid into a PHA or vice versa. This is a reflection of the dynamic character of the Solar System.

Several [[astronomical survey]] projects such as [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]], [[Catalina Sky Survey]] and [[Pan-STARRS]] continue to search for more PHOs. Each one found is studied by various means, including optical, [[Radar astronomy|radar]], and [[infrared]] to determine its characteristics, such as size, composition, rotation state, and to more accurately determine its orbit. Both professional and [[amateur astronomer]]s participate in such observation and tracking.

=== Size ===

Asteroids larger than approximately 35&amp;nbsp;meters across can pose a threat to a town or city.&lt;ref name="SA2013" /&gt; However the diameter of most small asteroids is not well determined, as it is usually only estimated based on their brightness and distance, rather than directly measured from e.g. radar observations. For this reason [[NASA]] and the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] use the more practical measure of [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] (''H''). Any asteroid with an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or brighter is assumed to be of the required size.&lt;ref name="CNEOS-Basics" /&gt;

Only a coarse estimation of size can be found from the object's magnitude because an assumption must be made for its [[albedo]] which is also not usually known for certain. The NASA [[near-Earth object]] program uses an assumed [[albedo]] of 0.14 for this purpose. In May 2016, the asteroid size estimates arising from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] and [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer#NEOWISE|NEOWISE]] missions have been questioned.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160523"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=How Big Are Those Killer Asteroids?

== Largest PHAs ==

With a mean-diameter of approximately 7 kilometers, the Apollo asteroid {{mpl|(53319) 1999 JM|8}} is likely the largest known potentially hazardous object, despite its fainter [[absolute magnitude]] of 15.2, compared to other listed objects in the table below ''(note: calculated mean-diameters in table are inferred from the objects brightness and its (assumed) albedo. They are only an approximation.)''. The lowest [[Minor planet designation|numbered]] PHA is [[1566&amp;nbsp;Icarus]].&lt;ref name="MPC-PHA-list" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1469">'''Random logic''' is a semiconductor circuit design technique that translates high-level logic descriptions directly into hardware features such as AND and OR gates. The name derives from the fact that few easily discernible patterns are evident in the arrangement of features on the chip and in the interconnects between them. In [[VLSI]] chips, random logic is often implemented with [[standard cell]]s and [[gate array]]s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Random logic accounts for a large part of the circuit design in modern [[microprocessor]]s. Compared to [[microcode]], another popular design technique, random logic offers faster execution of processor [[opcode]]s, provided that processor speeds are faster than memory speeds. A disadvantage is that it is difficult to design random logic circuitry for processors with large and complex instruction sets. The hard-wired instruction logic occupies a large percentage of the chip's area, and it becomes difficult to lay out the logic so that related circuits are close to one another.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book

In [[aeronautics]], the '''relative wind''' is the direction of movement of the atmosphere relative to an [[aircraft]] or an [[airfoil]].  It is opposite to the direction of movement of the aircraft or airfoil relative to the atmosphere. Close to any point on the surface of an aircraft or airfoil, the air is moving parallel to the surface; but at a great distance from the aircraft or airfoil the movement of the air can be represented by a single [[Euclidean vector|vector]].  This vector is the relative wind or the ''free stream velocity vector''.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.2, Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angle between the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord line]] of an airfoil and the relative wind defines the [[angle of attack]]. The relative wind is of great importance to pilots because exceeding the critical angle of attack will result in a [[stall (aviation)|stall]], regardless of [[airspeed]].

==In freefall==

Relative wind is also used to describe the airflow relative to an object in freefall through an atmosphere, such as that of a person's body during the freefall portion of a [[skydive]] or [[BASE jump]]. In a normal skydive the vertical descent of the skydiver creates an upward relative wind. The relative wind strength increases with increased descent rate.

The relative wind is directly opposite to the direction of travel.

Therefore, when a skydiver exits a forward-moving aircraft such as an aeroplane, the relative wind emanates from the direction the aeroplane is facing due to the skydiver's initial forward ( horizontal ) momentum. 
As [[aerodynamic drag]] gradually overcomes this forward momentum and, simultaneously, [[gravity]] attracts the skydiver downward, the relative wind alters proportionally into an upward (vertical) direction. This creates an arc of travel for the skydiver similar to water flowing from a low pressure hose held horizontally and creates a variation in the [[angle]] of the relative wind from horizontal to vertical.

When exiting from a forward-moving aircraft (as distinguished from a hovering aircraft, such as a balloon or a helicopter in hover mode) during a normal belly-to-earth skydive, the skydiver must arch his body in the direction of travel which is initially horizontal. If the skydiver continues to arch, his belly will gradually alter pitch until he is belly-to-earth. This section of the jump is commonly referred to as "the hill".

Relative wind differs from the wind in [[meteorology]] in that the object (''e.g..'', the skydiver) moves past the air, as opposed to the air moving past the object.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called roadway powered electric vehicles) collect any form of [[potential energy]] from the road surface to supply [[electricity]] to locomotive motors and ancillary equipment within the vehicle.

==Definition==
A Road Powered [[electric vehicle]]  may be defined as a transport capsule with the following characteristics:

(1) The [[Prime mover (locomotive)|principal means of locomotion]] is one or more [[electric motor]](s)

2) The electric motors are powered by an [[electricity|electrical supply]] provided either from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] (usually on-board) or power source (typically remote, and connected directly via conductive [[electrical cable|cable]]s or [[Inductive charging|magnetic inductive fields]]

(3) There is a defined [[road]]way over which the vehicle travels (that means, although it may have some on-board battery reserve, is not intended to be [[Off-roading|a cross country vehicle]])

(4) Where an external electric supply is provided, this is typically with [[trolleybus|overhead]] conductors or [[Third rail|above-ground rails]] or (rarely) [[Resonant inductive coupling|sub-surface electro-magnets]].

(5) An all-electric vehicle typically requires one or more [[Battery electric vehicle|on-board energy supply elements]] or devices for autonomous operation, most commonly by  [[Battery (electricity)|chemical batteries]], less frequently via [[Electrical generator|electro-mechanical generators]]

(6) The electric vehicle further may include an on-board [[control system]] that directs energy from the energy storage elements, as needed, and converts such energy to electric motors used to propel the electric vehicle.

A Road Powered Electric Vehicle therefore '''''necessarily  includes a system for supplying electricity from an external power source''''' (such as a remote [[Electricity generation|power station]]) through a network of power coupling elements which provide an integral and continuous power connection between origin and destination.

==Wireless energy transfer==

{{Main|wireless energy transfer}}

In USA Patent 6421600 these power coupling elements are electro-magnetic transmission coils embedded in the roadway and reception coils which are electrically [[resonant]], so that they convert the magnetic flux above the road into electrical energy on the vehicle, which is entirely independent, since there is no mechanical or electrical link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = mi2g Ltd London UK
|date = First published 2010-June 10
|format = PDF
|accessdate = 2010-11-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA Patent 6421600 version of RPEV cited also includes:

(1) an on-board power meter to indicate the approximate consumption and an approximation of its remaining autonomous (battery) endurance or ranger range

(2) a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|wide bandwidth]] [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] to allow information signals to be sent to, and received from, the RPEV while it is in use;

(3) automated garaging, a system that automatically connects power to the RPEV when it is in storage overnight, both to recharge the on-board batteries and power the on-board [[storage heater]] in cold weather so that it is comfortable for the driver and passengers.

(4) electronic coupling between two or more RPEVs so that one can be a "master" (with a driver) and the following vehicle(s) are "slave" (controlled by the driver in the "master" vehicle) as a sort of "road train"  in order to increase [[passenger]] or [[cargo|payload]] capacity.

(5) a [[positioning system]] for determining the current location of the RPEV; and

(6) a scheduling and dispatch computer so that many RPEV's can be accommodated efficiently on any particular length of road with embedded transmission coils. Such a system could be adapted for use with remote drivers or automatic control over closed roadway circuits such as warehouses and theme parks.

'''[[Online Electric Vehicle]]s (OHVs)''' use pick-up equipment underneath the vehicle then collects power through non-contact magnetic induction, which may imply a similar electrical design.

==Wired energy transfer==

[[File:Tram train 1907.pdf|thumb|right|Tram and 'Trackless Car' share common overhead lines (from [[Harmsworth Popular Science]])]]
[[Trolleybuses]] use overhead cables which could also be used for cars, as shown in a photograph (right) carried by an encyclopedic magazine about 1910.

===Overhead power lines===
The twin overhead power lines are usually copper conductors with a flat surface, which are supported by a steel catenary wire. A pole or pantograph extends from the vehicle and presses 'slippers' or 'skates' against the conductors to complete the circuit. These slipper or skate contacts are frequently coated with graphite, or have a carbon block to reduce friction and ensure a good (low resistance) electrical connection.

Since buses are scheduled, traffic conflicts are rare. If the overhead dual power line infrastructure was used randomly by private users, then some sort of management system would be required. The simplest would be to provide the vehicles some limited autonomy so that they could simply disconnect when arriving at each intersection and reconnect when they joined the next section. A more sophisticated traffic management system, as proposed by USA Patent 6421600 (above) could facilitate transit where there are many vehicles wishing to draw power from a particular section of the infrastructure.
[[File:Continuous transit.png|thumb|left|Diagram of a possible mechanical transmission train (from [[Harmsworth Popular Science]] Volume 3, c.1913)]]
[[File:SARS RPEV.png|thumb]] [[File:CCC RPEV.png|thumb]]

Recent improvements in trolleybus design include the automatic connection and disconnection of power poles either by the driver or in the event of mechanical dis-engagement from the overhead wires, so that the driver can remain in control, using on-board battery power. Better materials and motion dynamics modeling allow speeds up to about 80&amp;nbsp;km/h so that trolleybus behavior is flexible and totally comparable with regular autonomous vehicle performance, even at crossings and road-junctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ground-level power supply===
[[Ground-level power supply]] is an alternative to overhead power lines. The most common version is the [[conduit current collection]] system, where the power supply is carried in a channel or vault under the roadway. This is a tube, open at the top to allow a blade to enter and extend slippers against the power conductors, which are either side of the access opening slot, near the top of the channel. The arrangement is shaped so that live surfaces can not be reached by hand, and the lower part of the conduit provides drainage to remove any water.

Conduit power was first designed in the steam age (c.1900) when power was transmitted mechanically from a series of steam-powered rotating screws, as shown in the illustration (left) also published by [[Harmsworth Popular Science]].

A more recent roadway power supply design used by the [[Bordeaux tramway]] involves alternate (line and neutral) panels which are only powered whilst they are actually under the tram. This system is called APS (French: ''Alimentation par Sol'' which implies sub-surface power feed in English).

===Overhead electrical net===
'''A parking area''' with an overhead electrical net was in use at  Seoul Grand Park Zoo in South Korea, to recharge electric vehicles {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, This was similar to a fairground [[bumper car]] arrangement which allowed vehicle batteries to be recharged, prior to introduction of the more modern OLEV [[Online Electric Vehicle]] system. The advantage was that vehicles could be parked randomly, as convenient, and there was no need for either the tripping hazard of trailing cables used by most [[electric vehicle]]s nor for fiddly precise alignment of conductor poles needed by [[trolley bus]]es.

==Linear Motor Propulsion==
{{Main|linear motor}}

An alternative form of electro-magnetic coupling is called a linear motor, first developed by Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] at [[Imperial College London]] in the 1960s.

Instead of supplying electric motors with power directly or charging on-board batteries, the RPEV is fitted with magnets which are impelled horizontally in the same way as the rotor on an ordinary electric motor is impelled to rotate. A linear motor works in exactly the same way a round motor which has been split to its centre, laid flat and extended.

The Shanghai [[Transrapid]] and [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit]] systems are practical examples of this type of RPEV technology applied to [[rail transport]] systems (which are sometimes called railroads, especially in USA).

[[Maglev]] uses magnetic repulsion to support the [[Passenger car (rail)|carriage]] weight as well as to propel the [[Rapid transit|vehicle]] forward, so wheels are not needed. Maglev  [[train]]s effectively ride on top of a magnetic wave, much as a [[surfer]] rides a wave on the sea.

[[Image:Single-phase-pole-transformer-d335.jpg|thumb|173px|A single-phase polemount stepdown transformer in Canada. One supply phase (phase-to-neutral) from the utility is converted to split-phase for the customers.]]
In electrical engineering, '''single-phase electric power''' is the distribution of [[alternating current]] [[electric power]] using a system in which all the [[voltage]]s of the supply vary in unison. Single-phase distribution is used when loads are mostly lighting and heating, with few large electric motors. A single-phase supply connected to an alternating current [[electric motor]] does not produce a revolving magnetic field; single-phase motors need additional circuits for starting (capacitor start motor), and such motors are uncommon above 10&amp;nbsp;kW in rating.

Because the voltage of a single phase system reaches a peak value twice in each cycle, the instantaneous power is not constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://aegispower.com/index.php/blog/179-what-s-the-difference-between-single-phase-and-three-phase-ac-power-supplies|title = What's the Difference Between Single Phase and Three Phase AC Power Supplies?|website = Aegis Power Systems|publisher = Aegis Power Systems|accessdate = 28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single-phase load may be powered from a [[three-phase]] distribution transformer in two ways: by connection between one phase and [[ground and neutral|neutral]] or by connection between two phases. These two give different voltages from a given supply. For example, on a 120/208 three-phase system, which is common in North America, the phase-to-neutral voltage is 120 volts and the phase-to-phase voltage is 208 volts. This allows single-phase lighting to be connected phase-to-neutral and three-phase motors to be connected to all three phases. This eliminates the need of a separate single phase transformer.

Standard [[utility frequency|frequencies]] of single-phase power systems are either 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]].  Special single-phase [[traction power network]]s may operate at 16.67&amp;nbsp;Hz or other frequencies to power electric railways.&lt;ref name=AEH/&gt;

==Splitting out==
{{Main|Split-phase electric power}}
Single-phase is commonly divided in half at the [[distribution transformer]] on the secondary winding to create [[split-phase electric power]] for household appliances and lighting.&lt;ref name=AEH&gt;Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electricians' Handbook, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}}, chapter 3, pages 3-10, 3-14 to 3-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

In North America, individual residences and small commercial buildings with services up to about 100 kVA (417 amperes at 240 volts) will usually have [[split-phase electric power|three-wire single-phase]] distribution, especially in rural areas where motor loads are small and uncommon. In rural areas where no three-phase supply is available, farmers or households who wish to use three-phase motors may install a [[phase converter]] if only a single-phase supply is available. Larger consumers such as large buildings, shopping centers, factories, office blocks, and multiple-unit apartment blocks will have three-phase service. In densely populated areas of cities, network power distribution is used with many customers and many supply transformers connected to provide hundreds or thousands of kVA, a load concentrated over a few hundred square meters.

High power systems, say hundreds of [[kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] or larger, are nearly always three phase. The largest supply normally available as single phase varies according to the standards of the electrical utility. In the [[United Kingdom]] a single-phase household supply may be rated 100 A or even 125 A, meaning that there is little need for three-phase in a domestic or small commercial environment. Much of the rest of Europe has traditionally had much smaller limits on the size of single phase supplies resulting in even houses being supplied with three-phase (in urban areas with three-phase supply networks).

If heating equipment designed for a 240-volt system is connected to two phases of a 208-volt supply, it will only produce 75% of its rated heating effect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Single-phase motors may have taps to allow their use on either 208-volt or 240-volt supply.

Single-phase power may be used for [[Railway electrification system|electric railways]]; the largest [[single-phase generator]] in the world, at [[Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant]], supplied a railway system on a dedicated [[traction power network]].

==Grounding==
Typically a third conductor, called ''[[ground and neutral|ground]]'' (or "safety ground") (U.S.) or ''protective earth'' (UK, Europe, IEC), is used as a protection against [[electric shock]], and ordinarily only carries significant current when there is a circuit fault.&lt;ref name=AEH/&gt; Several different [[earthing system]]s are in use. In some extreme rural areas [[single-wire earth return]] distribution is used.

'''Stamina wood''' is an [[engineered wood]] product made of [[wood veneer|veneers]] that have been dyed, then impregnated with phenolic [[resin]] and compressed under high pressure and heat. The result is a material that can be worked with woodworking tools, then sanded and buffed to a high luster.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to capture essential features of fluid-structure interactions subject to [[thermal fluctuation]]s while introducing approximations which facilitate analysis and the development of tractable numerical methods.  SELM is a hybrid approach utilizing an [[Continuum mechanics#Eulerian description|Eulerian description]] for the continuum hydrodynamic fields and a [[Continuum mechanics#Lagrangian description|Lagrangian description]] for elastic structures.  Thermal fluctuations are introduced through stochastic driving fields. 

The SELM fluid-structure equations typically used are  

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho
\frac{d{u}}{d{t}}
= \mu \, \Delta u - \nabla p + \Lambda[\Upsilon(V - \Gamma{u})] + \lambda + f_\mathrm{thm}(x,t)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d{V}}{d{t}} = -\Upsilon(V - \Gamma{u}) - \nabla \Phi[X] + \xi + F_\mathrm{thm}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d{X}}{d{t}} = V.
&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure ''p'' is determined by the incompressibility condition for the fluid 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot u = 0. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\Gamma, \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; operators couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian degrees of freedom.  The &lt;math&gt; X, V &lt;/math&gt; denote the composite vectors of the full set of Lagrangian coordinates for the structures.  The &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; is the potential energy for a configuration of the structures.  The &lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{thm}, F_\mathrm{thm}&lt;/math&gt; are stochastic driving fields accounting for thermal fluctuations.  The &lt;math&gt;\lambda, \xi&lt;/math&gt; are [[Lagrange multiplier]]s imposing constraints, such as local rigid body [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]]s.  To ensure that dissipation occurs only through the &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon&lt;/math&gt; coupling and not as a consequence of the interconversion by the operators &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; the following adjoint conditions are imposed

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma = \Lambda^T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thermal fluctuations are introduced through Gaussian random fields with mean zero and the covariance structure 

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle f_\mathrm{thm}(s)f^T_\mathrm{thm}(t) \rangle = -\left(2k_B{T}\right)\left(\mu \Delta - \Lambda \Upsilon\Gamma\right)\delta(t - s).
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle F_\mathrm{thm}(s)F^T_\mathrm{thm}(t) \rangle = 2k_B{T}\Upsilon\delta(t - s).
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle f_\mathrm{thm}(s)F^T_\mathrm{thm}(t) \rangle = -2k_B{T}\Lambda\Upsilon\delta(t - s).
&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain simplified descriptions and efficient numerical methods, approximations in various limiting physical regimes have been considered to remove dynamics on small time-scales or inertial degrees of freedom. In different limiting regimes, the SELM framework can be related to the [[immersed boundary method]], [[accelerated Stokesian dynamics]], and [[arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method]].  The SELM approach has been shown to yield stochastic fluid-structure dynamics that are consistent with statistical mechanics.  In particular, the SELM dynamics have been shown to satisfy [[detailed-balance]] for the [[Gibbs–Boltzmann ensemble]].  Different types of coupling operators have also been introduced allowing for descriptions of  structures involving generalized coordinates and additional translational or rotational degrees of freedom.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team boats were popular as [[Ferry|ferries]] in the [[United States]] from the mid 1810s to the 1850s.

== Types ==
The first documented [[Horse engine|horse-powered]] boat in the United States was built on the [[Delaware River]] in 1791 by John Fitch.&lt;ref name = "natgeo"&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:Lower Market Place, McCallum's Wharf, Quebec, Quebec.jpg|thumb|Lower Market Place, McCallum's Wharf, Quebec, Quebec, July 4, 1829.]]

There are three types of team boats. In one, four or five horses are placed in each side of the boat in a circular [[treadwheel]], and the paddle wheels, arranged like the side wheel [[steamboat]] of later days were turned by means of cogs and gearing connected with other cogs on the shaft of the [[Paddle steamer|paddle wheels]]. The horses were hitched to strong timbers and by a forward movement of the feet caused the treadwheel upon which they stood to revolve and thus operate the [[Gear|gear wheels]].&lt;ref name = "boyer" /&gt; 

Another type of team boat uses a "horse whim," a type of [[horse mill]]. It has a large revolving wheel in the middle, and a center post known as a "whim" (or [[Whim (mining)|horse capstan]]). The horses, which are attached to the horse whim, walk around in a circle, causing the wheel or capstan to revolve, which in turn rotates gears that rotate the paddles, or bucket wheels. The team boat of this style consisted of two complete hulls, united by a deck or bridge, but separated far enough apart to allow the paddle wheel to be set between them. They are sharp at both ends, and can be propelled backward or forward with equal ease.&lt;ref name = "boyer" /&gt;

A third design for team boats was invented in 1819, by Barnabas Langdon. Langdon's turntable design permitted the horses to walk straight ahead instead of in circles. "Langdon placed a rotating turntable slightly below the level of the boat's deck; horses stood atop the turntable through large slots in the deck and drove the wheel backward by walking in place. This design eased the burden on the horses, freed up valuable deck space, and allowed the ferry to be built atop one hull."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasw.org/users/sperkins/hrsferry.html |title=When Horses Really Walked On Water: Before the steam engine was invented, there were three sources of usable power: wind, water, and animals.

One description of a turntable type team boat using six horses says, "The treadmills, on either side, were each trod by three horses always facing in the same direction. To reverse the paddlewheels it was only necessary to stop the horses a minute, and withdraw a drop pin that would reverse the gearing."&lt;ref name = "oldtimers" /&gt;

== The ''Experiment'' ==
[[File:1808 horse paddle-boat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Experiment (horse-powered boat)|Experiment]]'', 1808 horse paddle-boat]]
The ''[[Experiment (horse-powered boat)|Experiment]]'', built sometime around 1807-1810, was an early horse-powered [[ferry]] boat. It was a twelve-ton three-mast boat drawing a few feet of water, about 100 feet [[Waterline|long]] by 20 feet [[Beam (nautical)|beam]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=K1YdAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=%22The+Experiment%22+%22David+Grieve%22+horse+boat+screw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Experiment%22%20%22David%20Grieve%22%20horse%20boat%20screw&amp;f=false |last1=Bishop |first1=James Leander |first2=Edwin Troxell |last2=Freedley |first3=Edward |last3=Young |page=12 |title=A history of American manufactures from 1608 to 1860: exhibiting the origin and growth of the principal mechanic arts and manufactures, from the earliest colonial period to the adoption of the constitution and comprising annals of the industry of the United States in machinery |volume=2 |publisher=E.

The horse boat technology to propel the boat upstream was originally invented by David Grieve and granted a patent February 24, 1801 in the patent category of "Boats to ascend rivers". The complete recorded patent was lost in [[Patent Office 1836 fire|the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire]].&lt;ref name="HorsePaddleBoat"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Dick |last1=Sheaff |work=Ephemera |url=http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/powered_boats.html |title=Powered Boats |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel idea of propelling vessels upstream by the use of a large mechanical screw in the water is now referred to as [[John Ericsson#Propeller design|Ericsson’s propeller]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt;

Team boat [[Ferry|ferries]] were very popular. First, they were thought to be cheaper to operate than any other type of ferry boat, and second, they did not incur fees under the Fulton-Livingston patents monopoly.&lt;ref name = "boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "oldtimers" /&gt; In ferry service, horses could be stabled on land, and there was no need to feed them on the boat, because the work was intermittent.&lt;ref name = "antebellum" /&gt; 

There were cases in which team boats replaced steam boats for reasons of economy. In 1812, two steam boats designed by [[Robert Fulton]] were placed in use in New York, for the [[Paulus Hook]] Ferry from the foot of Cortlandt Street, and on the Hoboken Ferry from the foot of Barclay Street. The ''Juliana'', running from Barclay Street, was withdrawn from service, as announced, in favor of the more convenient horse boat. It is almost certain, however, that this retrograde step was taken because of the monopoly enjoyed by Mssrs. Fulton and Livingston for the navigation of the waters of New York State by steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Attempts were made with moderate success to ascend the Ohio and Mississippi with teams of horses on board. In 1824 the team boat ''Genius of Georgia'' operated on the [[Savannah River]], under Captain William Bird, carrying a cargo of sundries. An 1820 report by the South Carolina Department of Public Works described a five-man boat powered by eight mules; it carried 300 bales of cotton 250 miles in fifteen days at a cost of just $116.25. However, for through traffic, the team boats never passed the experimental stage.&lt;ref name = "antebellum" /&gt;

The South Ferry horse ferry operating at [[Albany, New York]] in 1827 was replaced by a steamboat in 1828. The North Ferry horse ferry at Albany operated from 1831-1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22661">A '''thermoset polymer matrix''' is a synthetic [[polymer]] reinforcement first developed for structural applications,&lt;ref&gt;Polymer Matrix Composites: Materials Usage, Design, and Analysis, SAE International, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-7680-7813-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as  [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[radar]] domes on [[aircraft]] and [[graphite]]-[[epoxy]] payload bay doors on the [[space shuttle]]. In polymer matrix composites, polymers act as binder or matrix to secure in place incorporated particulates, fibres or other reinforcements.

They were first used after [[World War II]], and continuing research has led to an increased range of [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset resins]], polymers or plastics,&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Thermoset Plastics, ed. S.H. Goodman, H. Dodiuk-Kenig, William Andrew Inc., USA, 3rd edition, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4557-3107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as engineering grade thermoplastics,&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Thermoplastics, ed. O. Olabisi, K Adewale, CRC Press, USA, 2nd edition, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1-466577220}}&lt;/ref&gt; all developed for use in the manufacture of polymer composites with enhanced and longer-term service capabilities. Thermoset polymer matrix technologies also find use in a wide diversity of non-structural industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Polymer Applications: Essential Chemistry and Technology, Royal Society of Chemistry, UK, 1st edition, 2016, {{ISBN|978-1782628149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foremost types of [[thermosetting polymer]]s used in structural composites are benzoxazine resins, bis-Maleimide resins (BMI), cyanate ester resins, epoxy (epoxide) resins, phenolic (PF) resins, unsaturated polyester (UP) resins, polyimides, polyurethane (PUR) resins, silicones, and [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl esters]].

==Benzoxazine resins==
{{Main article|Oxazines}}
These are made by the reaction of phenols, formaldehyde and primary amines which at elevated temperatures (400&amp;nbsp;°F (200&amp;nbsp;°C)) undergo ring–opening polymerisation forming polybenzoxazine thermoset networks; when hybridised with epoxy and phenolic resins the resulting ternary systems have glass transition temperatures in excess of 490&amp;nbsp;°F (250&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Benzoxazine Resins, ed. Hatsuo Ishida And Tarek Agag, Elsevier B.V., 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-444-53790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Benzoxazine resins.jpg|thumb|Benzoxazine resin synthetic pathway, structure and cure mechanism]]

Cure is characterised by expansion rather than shrinkage and uses include structural [[prepreg]]s, liquid molding and film adhesives for composite construction, bonding and repair. The high aromatic content of the high molecular weight polymers provides enhanced mechanical and flammability performance compared to epoxy and phenolic resins.

==Bis-maleimides (BMI)==
{{Main article|Maleimide}}
Formed by the [[condensation reaction]] of a [[diamine]] with [[maleic anhydride]], and processed basically like epoxy resins ({{convert|350|F}} cure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenzenberger|first1=Horst|title=Recent advances in thermosetting polyimides|journal=British Polymer Journal|volume=20|issue=5|year=1988|pages=383–396|issn=00071641|doi=10.1002/pi.4980200503}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an elevated post-cure ({{convert|450|F}}), they will exhibit superior properties. These properties are influenced by a 400-450&amp;nbsp;°F (204-232&amp;nbsp;°C) continuous use temperature and a glass transition of {{convert|500|F}}. [[File:Bismaleimide resins.jpg|thumb|Bismaleimide resin synthetic pathway and structure]]

This thermoset polymer type is merged into composites as a [[prepreg]] matrix used in electrical [[printed circuit board]]s, and for large scale structural [[aircraft]] – [[aerospace]] composite structures, etc. It is also used as a coating material and as the matrix of glass reinforced pipes, particularly in high temperature and chemical environments.

==Cyanate ester resins==
{{Main article|Cyanate ester}}
The reaction of bisphenols or multifunctional phenol novolac resins with cyanogen bromide or chloride leads to cyanate functional monomers which can be converted in a controlled manner into cyanate ester functional prepolymer resins by chain extension or copolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kessler|first1=Michael R.|title=Cyanate Ester Resins adapted from Cyanate Ester Resins|journal=Wiley Encyclopedia of Composites|year=2012|doi=10.1002/9781118097298.weoc062}}&lt;/ref&gt; When postcured, all residual cyanate ester functionality polymerises by cyclotrimerisation leading to tightly crosslinked polycyanurate networks with high thermal stability and glass transition temperatures up to 752&amp;nbsp;°F (400&amp;nbsp;°C) and wet heat stability up to around 400&amp;nbsp;°F (200&amp;nbsp;°C).[[File:Cyanate ester resins.jpg|thumb|Cyanate ester monomer, prepolymer and polycyanurate structures]]

Cyanate ester resin prepregs combine the high temperature stability of polyimides with the flame and fire resistance of phenolics and are used in the manufacture of aerospace structural composite components which meet fire protection regulations concerning flammability, smoke density and toxicity. Other uses include film adhesives, surfacing films and [[3D printing]].

==Epoxy (epoxide) resins==
[[Epoxy]] resins are thermosetting prepolymers made either by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with hydroxyl functional aromatics, cycloaliphatics and aliphatics or amine functional aromatics, or by the oxidation of unsaturated cycloaliphatics. The diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) and bisphenol-F (DGEBF) are the most widely used due to their characteristic high adhesion, mechanical strength, heat and corrosion resistance.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee and K. Neville, Handbook of Epoxy Resin, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Epoxide functional resins and prepolymers cure by polyaddition/copolymerisation or homopolymerisation depending on the selection of crosslinker, hardener, curing agent or catalyst as well as by the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Chemistry and Technology of Epoxy Resins, ed. B. Ellis, Springer Netherlands, 1993, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5302-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Epoxy resin.jpg|thumb|Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy resin structure]]

Epoxy resin is used widely in numerous formulations and forms in the aircraft-aerospace industry. It is regarded as "the work-horse of modern day composites". In recent years, the epoxy formulations used in composite prepregs have been fine-tuned to improve their toughness, impact strength and moisture absorption resistance. Maximum properties have been realized for this polymer.

This is not only used in aircraft-aerospace demand. It is used in military and commercial applications and is also used in construction. Epoxy-reinforced concrete and glass-reinforced and carbon-reinforced epoxy structures are used in building and bridge structures.

Epoxy composites have the following properties:
&lt;!-- many of the figures have no units stated --&gt;
* High-Strength Glass Fiber Reinforced
* Relative Density	          1.6-2.0
* Melting temperature(°C)	
* Thermoset Processing Range(°F)	       C:300-330,I=280-380
* Molding pressure	1-5
* Shrinkage	0.001-0.008
* Tensile strength (p.s.i.) 5,000-20,000
* Compressive strength (p.s.i.)	18,000-40,000
* Flexural Strength (p.s.i.) 8000-30,000
* Izod impact strength (ft·lb/in) 0.3-10.0
* Linear expansion (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; in./in./°C)	11-50
* Hardness Rockwell	M100-112
* Flammability	V-0
* Water absorption 24h (%)	0.04-0.20

Epoxy Phenol Novolac (EPN) and Epoxy Cresol Novolac (ECN) resins made by reacting epichlorohydrin with multifunctional phenol novolac or cresol novolac resins have more reactive sites compared to DGEBF epoxy resins and on cure result in higher crosslink density thermosets. They are used in printed wire/circuit board laminating and also for electrical encapsulation, adhesive and coatings for metal where there is a need to provide protection from corrosion, erosion or chemical attack at high continuous operating temperatures. [[File:Epoxy phenol novolac resin.jpg|thumb|Epoxy phenol novolac resin structure]]

==Phenolic (PF) resins==
There are two types of [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|phenolic resins]]&lt;ref&gt;Phenolic Resins Technology Handbook, NPCS Board of Consultants &amp; Engineers, 2007, {{ISBN|9788190568500}}&lt;/ref&gt; - novolacs and resoles. Novolacs are made with acid catalysts and a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than one to give methylene linked phenolic oligomers; resoles are made with alkali catalysts and a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of greater than one to give phenolic oligomers with methylene and benzylic ether-linked phenol units. [[File:Novolac phenolic resin.jpg|thumb|Novolac phenolic resin structure]] [[File:Resole phenolic resin.jpg|thumb|Resole phenolic resin structure]]

Phenolic resins, originally developed in the late 19th century and, regarded as the first truly synthetic polymer types, are often referred to as the “work-horse of  thermosetting resins”. They are characterised by high bonding strength, dimensional stability and creep resistance at elevated temperatures, and frequently combined with co-curing resins such as epoxies.

General purpose [[Molding (process)|molding]] compounds, engineering molding compounds and sheet molding compounds are the primary forms of phenolic composites. Phenolics are also used as the matrix binder with Honeycomb core. Phenolics find use in many electrical applications such as [[Circuit breaker|breaker]] boxes, [[brake lining]] materials and most recently in combination with various reinforcements in the molding of an [[Cylinder block|engine block-head]] assembly, called the [[polimotor]]. Phenolics may be processed by the various common techniques, including compression, transfer and [[injection molding]].

Properties of phenolic composites have the following properties:
&lt;!-- many of the figures have no units stated --&gt;
* High-Strength Glass Fiber Reinforced
* Relative Density	     1.69-2.0
* Water Absorption 24h(%)	0.03-1.2
* Melting Temperature (◦c)	
* Thermo set Processing Range  (◦F) C:300-380 I:330-390
* Molding pressure 	I-20
* Shrinkage	0.001-0.004
* Tensile Strength (p.s.i.) 7000-18000
* Compressive Strength (p.s.i.) 16,000-70,000
* Flexural Strength (p.s.i.)12,000-60,000
* Izod Impact strength (ft-lb/in) 0.5-18.0
* Linear expansion (10−6 in./in./°C) 8-21
* Hardness Rockwell	E54-101
* Flammability	V-0

==Polyester resins==
[[Unsaturated polyester]] resins are an extremely versatile,&lt;ref&gt;Unsaturated Polyester Technology, ed. P.F. Bruins,  Gordon and Breach, New York, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Composites Handbook, Scott Bader Company Ltd, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and fairly inexpensive class of thermosetting polymer formed by the polycondensation of glycol mixtures containing propylene glycol, with a [[dibasic acid]] and anhydrides usually maleic anhydride to provide backbone unsaturation needed for crosslinking, and orthophthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid where superior structural and corrosion resistance properties are required. Polyester resins are routinely diluted/dissolved in a vinyl functional [[monomer]] such as [[styrene]] and include an inhibitor to stabilize the resin for storage purposes. Polymerisation in service is initiated by free radicals generated from ionizing radiation or by the photolytic or thermal decomposition of a radical initiator. [[Organic peroxide]]s, such as [[methyl ethyl ketone peroxide]] and auxiliary accelerators which promote decomposition to form radicals are combined with the resin to initiate a room temperature cure. [[File:Unsaturated polyester.jpg|thumb|Unsaturated polyester resin synthetic pathway and structure]]

In the liquid state, unsaturated polyester resins may be processed by numerous methods, including Hand Layup, vacuum bag molding, and spray-up and compression molded Sheet Molding Compound (SMC). They can also be [[B-staging|B-staged]] after application to chopped reinforcement and continuous reinforcement, to form pre-pregs. Solid molding compounds in the form of pellets or granules are also used in processes such as compression and transfer molding.

==Polyimides==
There are two types of commercial [[polyimide]]s: thermosetting cross-linkable polyimides made by the condensation of aromatic diamines with aromatic dianhydride derivatives and anhydrides with unsaturated sites that facilitate addition polymerisation between preformed imide monomers and oligomers,&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Scola and J.H. Vontel, Polym. Compos., 1988, 9(6), 443-452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polyimides, eds. D Wilson et al., Springer, Netherlands, 1990, {{ISBN|978-94-010-9663-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thermoplastic polyimides formed by the condensation reaction between aromatic diamines and aromatic dianhydrides. Thermoset polyimides are the most advanced of all thermoset polymer matrices with characteristics of high temperature physical and mechanical properties and are available commercially as resin, prepreg, stock shapes, thin sheets/films, laminates, and machined parts. Along with the high temperature properties, this thermoset polymer type must be processed at very high temperatures and relative pressure to produce optimum characteristics. With prepreg materials, {{convert|600|F}} to {{convert|650|F}} temperatures and  {{convert|200|psi|kPa|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} pressures are required. The entire cure profiles are inherently long as there are a number of intermediate temperatures dwells, duration of which are dependent on part size and thickness. [[File:Polyimide prepolymers.jpg|thumb|Thermoset polyimide prepolymer structure]]

The cut of polyimides is {{convert|450|F}}, highest of all thermosets, with short term exposure capabilities of {{convert|900|F}}. Normal [[operating temperature]]s range from [[cryogenic]] to {{convert|500|F}}.

Polyimide composites have the following properties:
* Good mechanical properties and retention at high temperatures
* Good electrical properties
* High wear resistance
* Low creep at high temperatures
* Good compression with glass or graphite fiber reinforcement
* Good chemical resistance
* Inherently flame resistant
* Unaffected by most solvents and oils

Polyimide film &lt;ref&gt;http://www.profma.com/polyimide.htm&lt;/ref&gt; possesses a unique combination of properties that make it ideal for a variety of applications in many different industries especially as excellent physical, electrical, and mechanical properties are maintained over a wide temperature range.

High-performance polyimide resin is used in electrical, wear resistant and as structural materials when combined with reinforcement for aircraft-aerospace applications, which are replacing heavier more expensive metals. High temperature processing causes some technical problems as well as higher costs compared to other polymers. Hysols &lt;ref&gt;http://www.henkel-cee.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-0AC83309-79FA31DA/henkel_cee/hs.xsl/5497_COE_HTML.htm?countryCode=com&amp;BU=industrial&amp;brand=0000000386&lt;/ref&gt; PMR series is an example of this polymer.

==Polyurethane (PUR) resins==
Thermoset [[polyurethane]] prepolymers with carbamate (-NH-CO-O-) links are linear and elastomeric if formed by combining diisocyanates (OCN-R1-NCO) with long chain diols (HO-R2-OH), or crosslinked and rigid if formed from combinations of [[isocyanate|polyisocyanate]]s and, [[polyol]]s. They can be solid or have an open cellular structure if foamed, and are widely used for their characteristic&lt;ref&gt;Polyurethane Handbook, ed. G Oertel, Hanser, Munich, Germany, 2nd edn., 1994, {{ISBN|1569901570}}, {{ISBN|978-1569901571}}&lt;/ref&gt; high adhesion and resistance to fatigue. Polyurethane foam&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciba.com/index/ind-index/ind-pla/ind-pla-polymersandpolymerprocessing/ind-pla-pol-polyurethane.htm&lt;/ref&gt; structural cores combined with glass-reinforced or graphite-reinforced composite laminates are used to make lightweight, strong, sandwich structures. All forms of the material, inclusive of flexible and rigid foams, foam moldings, solid [[elastomer]]ic moldings and extrudates, when combined with various reinforcement–fillers have found commercial applications in thermoset polymer matrix composites.

They differ from [[polyurea]]s which are thermoset elastomeric polymers with carbamide (-NH-CO-NH-) links made by combining diisocyanate monomers or prepolymers (OCN-R-NCO) with blends of long-chain amine-terminated polyether or polyester resins (H2N-RL-NH2) and short-chain diamine extenders (H2N-RS-NH2). Polyureas are characterised by near instantaneous cure, high mechanical strength and resistance to corrosion so are widely used for 1:1 volume mix ratio spray applied, abrasion resistant waterproofing protective coating and lining.

==Silicone resins==
[[Silicone resin]]s are partly organic in nature with a backbone polymer structure made of alternating [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] [[atom]]s rather than the familiar [[carbon]]-to-carbon backbone characteristics of organic polymers. In addition to having at least one oxygen atom bonded to each silicon atom, silicone resins have direct bonds to carbon and therefore also known as polyorganosiloxanes. They have the general formula (R2SiO)n and the physical form (liquid, gel, elastomer or solid) and use varies with molecular weight, structure (linear, branched, caged) and nature of substituent groups (R = alkyl, aryl, H, OH, alkoxy). Aryl substituted silicone resins have greater thermal stability than alkyl substituted silicone resins when polymerised (condensation cure mechanism) at temperatures between ~300&amp;nbsp;°F (~150&amp;nbsp;°C) and ~400&amp;nbsp;°F (~200&amp;nbsp;°C). Heating above ~600&amp;nbsp;°F (~ 300&amp;nbsp;°C) converts all silicone polymers into ceramics&lt;ref&gt;Concise Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, ed. J.I. Kroschwitz, Wiley, New York, 1990, {{ISBN|0-471-5 1253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; since all organic constituents pyrolytically decompose leaving crystalline silicate polymers with the general formula (-SiO2-)n. In addition to applications as [[ceramic matrix composite]] precursors, silicone resins in the form of polysiloxane polymers made from silicone resins with pendant acrylate, vinyl ether or epoxy functionality find application as UV, electron beam and thermoset polymer matrix composites where they are characterised by their resistance to oxidation, heat and ultraviolet degradation.

Assorted other uses in the general area of composites for silicones include sealants, coating materials, and as a reusable bag material for vacuum-bag curing of composite parts.

==Vinyl ester resins==
[[Vinyl ester resin]]s made by addition reactions between an epoxy resin with acrylic acid derivatives, when diluted/dissolved in a vinyl functional [[monomer]] such as [[styrene]], polymerise. The resulting thermosets are notable for their high adhesion, heat resistance and corrosion resistance. They are stronger than polyesters and more resistant to impact than epoxies.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cassis and R.C. Talbot in Handbook of Composites, ed. S.T. Peters, Springer US, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-412-54020-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinyl ester resins are used for wet lay-up laminating, SMC and BMC in the manufacture and repair of corrosion and heat resistant components ranging from pipelines, vessels and buildings to transportation, marine, military and aerospace applications. [[File:Figure A1.28.jpg|thumb|Vinyl ester]]

==Miscellaneous==
Amino resins are another class of thermoset prepolymers formed by copolymerisation of amines or amides with an aldehyde. [[Urea-formaldehyde]] and [[Melamine resin|melamine-formaldehyde]] resins, although not widely used in high performance structural composite applications, are characteristically used as the polymer matrix in molding and extrusion compounds where some use of fillers and reinforcements occurs. Urea-formaldehyde resins are widely used as the matrix binder in construction utility products such as [[particle board]], [[wafer board]], and [[plywood]], which are true particulate and laminar composite structures. Melamine-formaldehyde resins are used for plastic laminating.

Furan resin prepolymers made from [[furfuryl alcohol]], or by modification of [[furfural]] with phenol, formaldehyde, urea or other extenders, are similar to amino and phenolic thermosetting resins in that cure involves polycondensation and release of water as well as heat. While they are generally cured under the influence of heat, catalysts and pressure, furan resins can also be formulated as dual-component no-bake acid-hardened systems which are characterised by high resistance to heat, acids and alkalies. Furan resins are of increasing interest for the manufacture of sustainable composites - biocomposites made from a bio-derived matrix (in this case furan resin), or biofibre reinforcement, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malaba|first1=Talent|last2=Wang|first2=Jiajun|title=Unidirectional Cordenka Fibre-Reinforced Furan Resin Full Biocomposite: Properties and Influence of High Fibre Mass Fraction|journal=Journal of Composites|date=2015|volume=2015|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2015/707151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titanium(II) oxide''' ([[Titanium|Ti]][[Oxygen|O]]) is an [[inorganic]] [[chemical compound]] of titanium and oxygen. It can be prepared from [[titanium dioxide]] and titanium metal at 1500 °C.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[non-stoichiometric]] in a range TiO&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt; to TiO&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;  and this is caused by vacancies of either Ti or O in the defect rock salt structure&lt;!-- (chalk)--&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; In pure TiO 15% of both Ti and O sites are vacant.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;  Careful annealing can cause ordering of the vacancies producing a monoclinic form which has 5 TiO units in the primitive cell that exhibits lower resistivity.&lt;ref&gt;Electrical and Magnetic Properties of TiO and VO,  Banus M.

The {{nihongo|'''Toyota Sequoia'''|Japanese: トヨタ セコイア|Toyota Sekoia}} is a [[full-size]] [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] manufactured by [[Toyota]] and derived from its [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]] pickup truck.

Introduced in 2000 and manufactured at [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana]] in [[Princeton, Indiana]], the Sequoia is the first vehicle from a Japanese marque in the popular mainstream full-sized SUV class in North America, and initial planning done by first-generation Sequoia chief engineer Kaoru Hosegawa aimed the Sequoia directly at the [[Ford Expedition]], also competing with the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and the later [[Nissan Armada]].

The Sequoia slots in between the [[mid-size]] [[Toyota 4Runner]] and the premium [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] in the North American Toyota SUV lineup, and is the largest SUV currently being produced under the Toyota brand.

In 2015 the Sequoia was available in the [[United States]] (All regions), [[Bolivia]], [[Canada]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]]  in LHD only. 
As of 2017, the Sequoia is sold in the United States (All regions), Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen  in LHD only.

Development of a full-size SUV alongside a T100 replacement began in the mid-1990s, with a design freeze in 1997 (styled by Toshihiko Shirasawa) and design patent filing of the production design on April 4, 1998 at the Japan Patent Office (JPO) under #1054583. After the introduction of the [[Toyota Tundra]] in 1999, speculation started that Toyota intended to compete in the full-size market with a Tundra-based SUV called the Highlander. However, the Highlander name was used on a [[Toyota Highlander|midsize Camry-based crossover]] and the Tundra-based SUV was introduced on January 11, 2000 at the North American Auto Show as the '''Toyota Sequoia''', with full production starting in September 2000 for the 2001 model year.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The engine, dashboard, sheetmetal, and chassis are shared with the Tundra, with the exception of rear [[disc brake]]s and a more sophisticated multi-link live axle rear suspension. The Sequoia was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award in 2001. When the Sequoia was introduced, it was slightly longer than the contemporary [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J100)|Land Cruiser]], larger than the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] in most dimensions and similar in size to the [[Ford Expedition]]; its V8 engine was certified as an [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]]. Frame assemblies and driveshafts are produced by [[Dana Holding Corporation]].

The Sequoia came in two trim levels: ''SR5'' and ''Limited''. The base ''SR5'' started at $32,820 while the more expensive ''Limited'' started at $41,855. It was sold in both [[two-wheel drive]] and [[four-wheel drive]] versions. [[Vehicle Stability Control]] was standard on all models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |title=Iihs-Hldi |publisher=Iihs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407160743/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |archivedate=2010-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facelift===
[[File:2005-2007 Toyota Sequoia Limited.jpg|thumb|left|2005–2007 Toyota Sequoia Limited]]
For the 2005 model year, the Sequoia received a mild facelift. A new [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] equipped with [[VVT-i]] was new for 2005, as well as a 5-speed [[automatic transmission]], replacing the previous 4-speed. 4 wheel drive models got a Torsen center differential, replacing the previous open differential, that splits power in full-time mode 40% front and 60% rear under normal driving, and can send up to 53% to the front and 71% to the rear during slip. The grill was redesigned, and the orange lamps were removed from the taillights.

Towing Capacity for the 2005 model year:
*2WD: {{convert|6500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}

Toyota unveiled the 2008 Toyota Sequoia at the November 2007 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]], with sales beginning that following December. Like the original Sequoia, the new model is based on the new [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. However major differences with the Tundra include a fully boxed frame, a rear [[independent suspension]] featuring [[double wishbone]]s with coil springs for improved ride comfort and room, and a locking center [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] on 4-wheel drive models.  The new suspension helps give the Sequoia a tighter turning radius of {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} and allows for a fold-flat rear seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota/TYT2007110908452.aspx?ncid=12075 |title=Toyota Vehicles : Toyota Unveils All-New 2008 Sequoia At 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show / Toyota |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date= |accessdate=2009-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota stated the new frame is 70 percent more resistant to bending flex with torsional rigidity up 30 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=123421 |title=First Drive: 2008 Toyota Sequoia |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210032456/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=123421 |archivedate=2009-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the new model weighs {{convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} more than the previous Sequoia. The [[drag coefficient]] has been reduced to 0.35.

Improvements include an optional [[Ultra-low emission vehicle|ULEV-II]] compliant 381 horsepower 5.7&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UR engine#3UR-FE|3UR-FE]]'' V8, mated to a 6-speed automatic.

The 2008 Sequoia comes in three trim lines: the SR5 and Limited, and new Platinum. Pricing ranges from about $34,000 to $55,000 depending upon the trim line and configuration.
The base engine is the previous ULEV compliant 4.7&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UZ engine#2UZ-FE|2UZ-FE]]'' {{convert|276|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] featured from the previous generation. The 4.7&amp;nbsp;L is standard on the SR5, while the Limited and Platinum models come standard with a 5.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 engine. Four-wheel drive is available on all models.

The interior of the 2008 Sequoia features the same dash as the new Tundra. Standard features include a tilt and telescopic steering wheel, power windows and doors, dual sun visors, and a [[keyless entry]].  Options include DVD based [[automotive navigation system|navigation]] with [[backup camera]] and 7" screen, a rear DVD entertainment system, a 14-speaker JBL audio system, and heated seats with ventilated coolers in the front row and warmers in the second row, available in Platinum trim. The Limited trim includes audio, climate, and hands-free [[Bluetooth]] mobile phone system controls, an improved [[JBL]] audio system, [[electroluminescent]] Optitron gauges, and an [[electrochromic]] [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|auto-dimming rear-view mirror]] and side view mirrors with a [[HomeLink]] transceiver. The Platinum model includes a standard DVD navigation with a backup camera, a rear [[air suspension]] which can lower for easy loading, and [[Dynamic Laser Cruise Control]].

Seating arrangements are for seven or eight passengers, eight for SR5 and Limited models and seven for Platinum models. Power folding 60/40 split third row seats are available on the Platinum. The Sequoia has a maximum towing capacity of {{convert|7400|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} with the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 in 2WD SR5 form or {{convert|7100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} in the 4WD SR5 trim.  For complete trailer &amp; weight capacities, see Toyota's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/sequoia/specs.html |title=Toyota Sequoia - 2010 Performance &amp; Specifications |publisher=Toyota.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exterior differences include door handle colors (color-keyed for the SR5; chrome for the Limited and Platinum), diamond-cut {{convert|20|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} aluminum alloy wheels for the Platinum trim, and varying power-heated remote-controlled side mirrors.

In 2015, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) found the Sequoia 4WD to have the lowest overall driver death rate in its class with 0 deaths per million registered vehicle years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/sr/statusreport/article/50/1/1 |title=Death rates fall as vehicles improve |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |location=US |date=2015-01-29 |accessdate=2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/driver-death-rates |title=Driver death rates |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |location=US |date=2015-01-29 |accessdate=2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model year changes===
*The 2009 model year adds E85 flex fuel capability for the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 sold in certain states.
*For the 2010 model year the 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 is replaced by an all-new 4.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UR engine#1UR-FE|1UR-FE]]'' engine paired to a six-speed automatic transmission.  The SR5 and Platinum trims become mono-spec and the Limited grade offers three stand alone options (navigation system, rear-seat entertainment and seven-passenger seating).  Front driver and passenger knee airbags were added as a standard feature. Platinum models get wood trim on the steering wheel and shift gear, and Bluetooth and audio controls are standard on the SR5 trim. The Timberland Mica exterior color gets replaced with the new Camry's Spruce Mica. All audio systems have USB connectivity with [[iPod]] integration, and the rear-view mirror on the Limited trim has a built-in rear-view camera.
*For the 2012 model year, Toyota's Entune System was added as a standard on SR5, while an upgraded version featuring navigation became an optional feature on Limited and standard on the Platinum trim.
*For the 2014 model year, a Blu-ray DVD player became an optional feature on Limited and standard in Platinum.
*No major changes were made for the 2015 and 2016 model years.

===2018 Refresh===
On February 9, 2017, Toyota unveiled a refreshed Sequoia for the 2018 model year, featuring new standard LED headlights, daytime running lights and foglights, (note: 2001-07 models have this system too,  but not the basic model), and three new exterior colors: Midnight Black Metallic, Shoreline Blue Pearl and Toasted Walnut Pearl. Each trim level also gets its own specific grille design. It also added a [[Toyota Racing Development|TRD]] level trim to its returning SR5, Limited, and Platinum trims, an upgraded instrumentation panel, automotive emergency braking and the Toyota Safety Sense feature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-toyota-sequoia-preview-1420693364653/ "2018 Toyota Sequoia Preview"] from Cars.com (February 9, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recall==
The 2008-2010 Sequoias were part of one of the [[2009-2010 Toyota recalls]] that required the installation of a small shim to relieve unwanted friction and restore fluidity to the accelerator pedal.  Early 2003 Sequoias were recalled to reprogram the Vehicle Stability Control system due to the possibility of poor acceleration at certain low speeds. The 2002-3 Sequoia model years also had a defect in the front ball joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota/customer-faqs-for-2003-toyota-157609.aspx?ncid=11092 |title=Toyota Vehicles : Customer FAQs for 2003 Toyota Sequoia Recall / Toyota |publisher=Toyota |location=US |date= |accessdate=2010-07-06 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2004 Toyota Sequoias were subject to the Takata Airbag recall done for free by Toyota dealerships. Recently, the Sequoia, along with the Tacoma and Tundra, have another recall due to the frame prematurely rusting.  If there is a 10 MM perforation found on the frame, the vehicle frame will be replaced, if the service is done within 12 years of vehicle purchase or 1 year after recall became official.  For those vehicles without 10 MM perforation and located in a cold weather state, Toyota will perform an undercoating service to prevent future rust from forming.

'''Vacuum evaporation''' is the process of causing the [[pressure]] in a liquid-filled container to be reduced below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, causing the liquid to evaporate at a lower temperature than normal. Although the process can be applied to any type of liquid at any vapor pressure, it is generally used to describe the boiling of [[water]] by lowering the container's internal pressure below standard [[atmospheric pressure]] and causing the water to boil at [[room temperature]].

The vacuum evaporation treatment process consists of reducing the interior pressure of the evaporation chamber below atmospheric pressure. This reduces the boiling point of the liquid to be evaporated, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for heat in both the boiling and condensation processes. In addition, there are other technical advantages such as the ability to distill other liquids with high boiling points and avoiding the decomposition of substances that are sensitive to temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Gemma|last2=Cambiella|first2=Ángel|last3=Benito|first3=José M.|last4=Pazos|first4=Carmen|last5=Coca|first5=José|title=The effect of additives on the treatment of oil-in-water emulsions by vacuum evaporation|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=June 2007|volume=144|issue=3|pages=649–654|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.01.090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
When the process is applied to [[food]] and the water is [[evaporate]]d and removed, the food can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. It is also used when boiling a substance at normal temperatures would chemically change the consistency of the product, such as [[egg whites]] [[coagulating]] when attempting to [[dehydrate]] the [[albumen]] into a powder.

This process was invented by [[Henri Nestlé]] in 1866, of [[Nestlé]] Chocolate fame,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  although the [[Shakers]] were already using a [[vacuum pan]] earlier than that (see [[condensed milk]]).

This process is used industrially to make such food products as [[evaporated milk]] for [[milk chocolate]], and [[tomato paste]] for [[ketchup]].

[[File:Vacuum evaporation plant.jpg|thumb|Vacuum evaporation plant]]
[[File:00-vacuum-pan-sugar-factory.JPG|thumb|right|vacuum pans in a beet sugar factory]]In the sugar industry vacuum evaporation is used in the [[crystallization]] of [[sucrose]] solutions. Traditionally, this process was performed in batch mode, but nowadays continuous vacuum pans are available.&lt;ref&gt;BMA Gruppe. [http://www.bma-worldwide.com/products/sugar-and-sweeteners/vacuum-pans-batch-and-continuous-types-vkt.html Article on continuous vacuum pans.] Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wastewater treatment==
Vacuum evaporators are used in a wide range of industrial sectors to treat [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Condorchem Envitech. [http://condorchem.com/en/view/50-Vacuum-evaporators "Vacuum evaporators"] as a technology for industrial water-based liquid waste minimization and treatment. Retrieved 27 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a clean, safe and very versatile technology having low management costs, which in most cases serves as a zero-discharge treatment system.

==Thin film deposition==
Vacuum evaporation is also a form of [[physical vapor deposition]] used in the [[semiconductor]], [[microelectronics]], and [[optic]]al industries and in this context is a process of depositing [[thin films]] of material onto surfaces.  Such a technique consists of pumping a [[vacuum chamber]] to pressures of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]] and heating a material to produce a [[flux]] of [[vapor]] in order to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its [[vapor pressure]] is high enough to produce a flux of several [[Angstroms]] per second by using an [[electrical]]ly [[resistive]] heater or bombardment by a high [[voltage]] beam.

'''Wet rot''' is a [[generic term]] used to define a [[Paraphyly|variety]] of [[Fungus|fungal]] [[species]], such as ''[[Coniophora puteana]]'' ([[Common name|otherwise known]] as [[cellar fungus]]). Wet rot fungi obtain their [[food]] by [[decomposition|breaking down]] the [[cell wall]]s of [[wood cell]]s resulting in a loss of strength of the [[wood]]. This can cause problems in the [[Structural integrity and failure|structural integrity]] of [[structure]]s.

'''Branding''' is an easy and economical way to permanently mark anything that burns ([[wood]], [[leather]], [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], food, [[soap]], [[wax]], etc.). This is done by either a fire-heated tool or an electrically-heated tool, which is pressed onto the object, leaving behind a mark with the shape of the impressed tool.
