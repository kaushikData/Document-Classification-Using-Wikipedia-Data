== History ==

[[3D printing]] began to be used in production versions of spaceflight hardware in early 2014.  In January of that year, [[SpaceX]] first flew a "[[Falcon 9]] rocket with a 3D-printed [[Cryogenic rocket engine|Main Oxidizer Valve]] (MOV) body in one of the nine [[Merlin 1D]] engines". The valve is used to control flow of [[cryogenic]] [[liquid oxygen]] to the engine in a high-pressure, low-temperature, high-vibration physical environment.&lt;ref name=sz20140801/&gt;

In 2015–2016, other 3D-printed spacecraft assemblies were ground-tested, including high-temperature, high-pressure rocket engine combustion chambers and the entire mechanical spaceframe and propellant tanks for a small satellite of a few hundred kilograms.&lt;ref name=pr20140626/&gt;

In June 2014, [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] (AJR) announced that they had "manufactured and successfully tested an engine which had been entirely 3D printed."  The ''Baby Banton'' engine is a {{convert|5000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|disp=flip}} thrust engine that runs on [[LOX]]/[[RP-1|kerosene]] propellant.&lt;ref name=3dp20140626&gt;
{{cite news|title=Aerojet Rocketdyne 3D Prints An Entire Engine in Just Three Parts |url=http://3dprint.com/7355/3d-printed-engine/|accessdate=2014-08-08 |publisher=3dprint.com |date=2014-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By March 2015, AJR had completed a series of hot-fire tests for additively manufactured components for its full-size [[AR-1 (rocket engine)|AR-1]] booster engine.&lt;ref name=ajr20150315&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerojet Rocketdyne Hot-Fire Tests Additive Manufactured Components for the AR1 Engine to Maintain 2019 Delivery|url=https://www.rocket.com/article/aerojet-rocketdyne-hot-fire-tests-additive-manufactured-components-ar1-engine-maintain-2019|publisher=Aerojet Rocketdyne|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[United Launch Alliance]] [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]] [[launch vehicle]]—with first launch no earlier than 2019—is evaluating 3D printing for over 150 parts: 100 polymer and more than 50 metal parts.&lt;ref name=ibt20150421&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=Jeff |title=Vulcan Rocket: 3D Printing Launch Plan Includes More Than 100 Components |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/vulcan-rocket-3d-printing-launch-plan-includes-more-100-components-1890292 |accessdate=22 April 2015 |work=International Business Times |date=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, a 3D printed rocket engine had successfully launched a rocket to [[outer space|space]]. when on 25 May 2017, an [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]] rocket launched to space from [[New Zealand]] that was the first to be powered by a main stage rocket "engine made almost entirely using 3D printing."&lt;ref name=independent20170606&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/a-3d-printed-rocket-engine-just-launched-a-new-era-of-space-exploration-a7765496.html https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/a-3d-printed-rocket-engine-just-launched-a-new-era-of-space-exploration-a7765496.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Electron's first successful orbital launch was on 21 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/01/21/rocket-lab-delivers-nanosatellites-to-orbit-on-first-successful-test-launch/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

=== Rocket engines ===
The [[SuperDraco]] engine that provides [[launch escape system]] and propulsive-landing thrust for the [[Dragon V2]] passenger-carrying [[space capsule]] is fully printed, and was the first fully printed [[rocket engine]].  In particular, the engine combustion chamber is printed of [[Inconel]], an alloy of nickel and iron, using a process of [[direct metal laser sintering]], and operates at a [[chamber pressure]] {{convert|1000|psi|kPa|disp=flip}} at a very high temperature.  The engines are contained in a printed protective nacelle to prevent fault propagation in the event of an engine failure.&lt;ref name=aw20140530&gt;

The '''age-area hypothesis''' is a concept in [[cultural anthropology]] that [[culture|cultural traits]] tend to expand outward from their origin with time. Thus, the larger an area that a trait is found in, the older it is. 

The age-area hypothesis is controversial, and considered by some to be discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2740657 Historical Inferences from Guttman Scales: The Return of Age-Area Magic?] Theodore D. Graves; Nancy B. Graves; Michael J. Kobrin  Current Anthropology, Vol. 10, No. 4. (Oct., 1969), pp. 317-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1924">An '''argument''' in literature is a brief summary, often in [[prose]], of a poem or section of a poem or other work.  It is often appended to the beginning of each chapter, book, or [[canto]].  They were common during the [[Renaissance]] as a way to orient a reader within a large work.

[[John Milton]] included arguments for each of the twelve books of the second edition of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', published in 1674 (the original ten-book edition of 1667 did not include them).  They present a concise but often simplified account of what ''happens'' in the book, though they seem not to be intended to have interpretive value, and they have been only sporadically referenced by [[literary criticism|critics]].  The first begins:
:This first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject, Mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac't: Then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the command of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep.

The argument could also be in verse, as in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' or [[William Blake]]'s [[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]].  Most arguments included in poems are written by the authors themselves, but in other cases they could be added subsequently by a printer or publisher to an earlier work.

An example of modern literature using this technique is [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[A Suitable Boy]]'' (1993), where each of the 19 sections are described by a rhyming couplet on the table of contents.

[[File:Authepsa2.jpg|thumb|right|Aauthepsa (the second cut from ''A Dictionary of Greek...'')]]
[[File:1989_CPA_6045.jpg|thumb|right|A 1800s [[samovar]], for comparison]]
In [[classic antiquity]] '''authepsa''' or '''autepsa''' ({{lang-gr|αὐθέψης}}, authepses : αὐτός + ἕψω, "self-boiling", "self-cooking")&lt;ref&gt;[http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=2005748 "Definition of authepsa"] at ''Numen. The Latin Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; was a vessel used for water heating. Basically, it was a vase with a central tube used to keep coals.

''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'' describes it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063 ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', 1890 edition] at [[Perseus Project]] (the book is in public domain)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
AUTHEPSA (αὐθέψης), or “self-boiler,” was a vessel used for heating water or keeping it hot. As is well known, both hot and cold water were served by the attendants at well-appointed Roman tables (calidae gelidaeque minister, Juv. 5.63, with Mayor's note). For this purpose vessels were used which cannot have differed much in construction from our modern tea-urns (Böttiger, Sabina, 2.30), and like them might be made of costly materials and in artistic designs (authepsa illa, quam tanto pretio nuper mercatus est, Cic. pro Rose. Amer. 46.133; authepsas argenteas, Lamprid. Heliog. 19). 

Many ingenious contrivances for economical and portable cooking have been found at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and are now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale (formerly Borbonico) at Naples]]. It is probable, however, that the authepsa, unlike the ''[[aënum]]'' and ''[[caccabus]]'', was not used for cooking; and it is rather to be identified with a utensil from the same collection (Mus. Borbon. vol. iii. pl. 63) in the first cut above. This vessel is in bronze, and of very tasteful workmanship: the cylinder in the centre was filled with charcoal, and has a grating which allowed the air to enter and the ashes to escape. The second cut, from Mus. Borbon. vol. v. pl. 44, shows another of more elaborate construction. 

The Russian [[samovar]] is likewise explained to mean “self-boiler,” and appears to be little different from the authepsa.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Voice type}}
A '''bass''' ({{IPAc-en|b|eɪ|s}} {{respell|BAYSS}}) is a type of [[classical music|classical]] male [[singing]] [[human voice|voice]] and has the lowest [[vocal range]] of all [[voice type]]s. According to ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', a bass is typically classified as having a vocal range extending from around the second E below [[middle C]] to the E above middle C (i.e., [[Scientific pitch notation|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]).&lt;!-- This is a statement of what the reference says: please do not edit without supplying a new reference! --&gt;&lt;ref name=Grove1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grovemusic.com | title=Bass | accessdate=14 June 2006 | author=Owen Jander | author2=Lionel Sawkins | author3=J.

Categories of bass voices vary according to national style and classification system. Italians favour subdividing basses into the ''basso cantante'' (singing bass), ''basso buffo'' ("funny" bass), or the dramatic ''basso profondo'' (low bass). The American system&lt;ref&gt;Boldrey, Richard (1994) Guide to Operatic Roles &amp; Arias, Redmond: PST... Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the bass-baritone, comic bass, lyric bass, and dramatic bass. The German ''[[fach]]'' system&lt;ref&gt;Kloiber, Rudolf et al., (2007) Handbuch der Oper, 12th edition, Munich: Bärenreiter&lt;/ref&gt; offers further distinctions: Spielbass (Bassbuffo), Schwerer Spielbass (Schwerer Bassbuffo), Charakterbass (Bassbariton), and Seriöser Bass. These classification systems can overlap. Rare is the performer who embodies a single ''fach'' without also touching repertoire from another category.

== History ==
Cultural influence and individual variation create a wide variation in range and quality of bass singers. Parts for basses have included notes as low as the [[B♭ (musical note)|B-flat]] two octaves and a tone below middle C (B{{Music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), for example in [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 2]] and the [[Rachmaninov]]'s [[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All-Night Vigil]], [[A (musical note)|A]] below that in [[Frederik Magle]]'s [[Cantabile (symphonic suite)|symphonic suite ''Cantabile'']], [[G (musical note)|G]] below that (e.g. Measure 76 of ''Ne otverzhi mene'' by [[Pavel Chesnokov]]) or [[F (musical note)|F]] below those in ''Kheruvimskaya pesn (Song of Cherubim)'' by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]. Many [[basso profondo]]s have trouble reaching those notes, and the use of them in works by Slavic composers has led to the colloquial term "Russian bass" for an exceptionally deep-ranged basso profondo who can easily sing these notes. Some traditional Russian religious music calls for A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (110 [[Hertz|Hz]]) drone singing, which is doubled by A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (55&amp;nbsp;Hz) in the rare occasion that a choir includes exceptionally gifted singers who can produce this very low human voice pitch.

Many British composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] have written parts for bass (such as the first movement of his choral work ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]'') that center far higher than the bass [[tessitura]] as implied by the clef.&lt;!--Note:Do not change that to your own opinion unless you have a decent source which you CITE, and do not change the information whilst leaving it still pointing to the old citation--&gt;&lt;ref name=Grove1 /&gt; The ''[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]'' defines the range as being from the E below low C to middle C (i.e. E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/vocalrg.htm Ranges Guide], Yale University Music Library, taken from the ''Harvard Dictionary of Music''&lt;/ref&gt;

The bass has the lowest [[vocal range]] of all [[voice type]]s, with the lowest [[tessitura]]. The low extreme for basses is generally C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (two Cs below middle C). However, some extreme bass singers, referred to as [[basso profondo]]s and [[oktavist]]s, are able to reach much lower than this.

== In choral music ==
{{Choral voice classification}}
In [[SATB|SATB four-part mixed]] chorus, the bass is the lowest vocal range, below the [[tenor]], [[alto]], and [[soprano]]. Voices are subdivided into first bass and second bass with no distinction being made between bass and [[baritone]] voices, in contrast to the three-fold (tenor–baritone–bass) categorization of solo voices. The exception is in arrangements for male choir (TTBB) and [[barbershop quartet]]s (TLBB), which sometimes label the lowest two parts baritone and bass.

== In opera ==
Within [[opera]], the lowest note in the standard bass repertoire is D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, sung by the character Osmin in Mozart's ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'', but few roles fall below F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Although Osmin's note is the lowest 'demanded' in the operatic repertoire, lower notes are heard, both written and unwritten: for example, it is traditional for basses to interpolate a low C in the duet "Ich gehe doch rathe ich dir" in the same opera; in Richard Strauss' ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', Baron Ochs has an optional C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ("Mein lieber Hippolyte"). The high extreme: a few bass roles in the standard repertoire call for a high F{{Music|#}}, the one above middle C), but few roles go over F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In the operatic bass repertoire, the highest notes are a G{{Music|#}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (The Barber in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' by Shostakovich) and, in the aria "Fra l'ombre e gl'orrori" in Handel's [[serenata]] ''[[Aci, Galatea e Polifemo]]'', Polifemo reaches an A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Within the bass voice type category are seven generally recognized subcategories: ''basso cantante'' (singing bass), ''hoher'' bass (high bass), ''jugendlicher'' bass (juvenile bass), ''basso buffo'' ("funny" bass), ''Schwerer Spielbass'' (dramatic bass), lyric bass, and dramatic ''basso profondo'' (low bass).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

''[[Basso profondo]]'' (lyric low bass) is the lowest bass voice type. According to [[J. B.

In its place is a kind of tonal solidity, a wall-like front, which may nevertheless prove susceptible to the other kind of vibrato, the slow beat or dreaded wobble."

'''''Big John, Little John''''' is an American Saturday-morning [[sitcom|situation comedy]], produced by [[Sherwood Schwartz]], which starred [[Herb Edelman|Herbert Edelman]] as "Big John" and [[Robbie Rist|Robert "Robbie" Rist]] as "Little John."  The show first aired on September 11, 1976 on [[NBC]], and ran for one season of 13 episodes. The series was produced by Redwood Productions in association with D'Angelo-Bullock-Allen Productions.  In the United Kingdom, it was shown on [[BBC One]].

==Plot summary==
[[Image:Robbierist.jpg|left|thumb|Little John ([[Robbie Rist]]), as seen in the opening credits.]]
The show centered around a forty-year-old [[middle school]] science teacher named John Martin (played by Edelman). While vacationing in [[Florida]], he drinks from a spring which turns out to be the legendary [[Fountain of Youth]] sought by [[Juan Ponce de León]]. The water changes him into a twelve-year-old boy (played by Rist), and back again.

The changes occur spontaneously and without warning. Because Martin only sipped the water, the changes are recurring and not permanent; according to legend, had he taken a full drink, he would be age twelve permanently. Only his wife, Marjorie ([[Joyce Bulifant]]), and son, Ricky ([[Mike Darnell]]), know his secret, though Martin's students (who befriend him as "Little John") and his boss, principal Bertha Bottomly (Olive Dunbar), do become suspicious that something unusual is going on. The Martin family explain the younger John as their nephew, staying with them. Throughout the series, "Big John" unsuccessfully tries to find a cure for his predicament, but his experiences as "Little John" often give him insight into what his students are facing.

To make the two actors resemble each other more closely, Rist's blond hair was dyed brown, while Edelman wore a hairpiece that partially covered his baldness. Edelman and Rist appeared together in 1977, on the [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]].

'''Body Worlds''' ([[German language|German]] title: Körperwelten) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies, animals, and other [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of [[plastination]]. [[Gunther von Hagens]] developed the preservation process which "unite[s] subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|title=Plastination|website=www.koerperwelten.com|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601170955/http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|archive-date=1 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s.

A series of ''Body Worlds'' anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide, sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts. Nevertheless, Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died, and his organization keeps extensive documentation of this permission. Von Hagens emphasizes both educational and artistic aspects of his complex and innovative dissections, and offers online teaching guides for educators. He also tries to distinguish his efforts from those of competitors who may have been less thorough in obtaining advance permission from their specimen sources.

==Background==
[[File:Body Worlds Exhibit San Diego 2009.jpg|thumb|Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds, San Diego, California, 2009]]

===Method===
The exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laymen about the human body, leading to better health awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelm.co.uk/video_4x3.html?bcpid=1213934526&amp;bctid=1454906724 |title=Channel M No Smoking Day 12 March 2008 |publisher=Channelm.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the human plastinates are from people who donated their bodies for plastination via a body donation program. Each Body Worlds exhibition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15 |title=Body Worlds Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175844/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15# |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains approximately 25 full-body plastinates with expanded or selective [[organ (biology)|organs]] shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems.

To produce specimens for ''Body Worlds'', von Hagens employs 340 people at five laboratories in three countries, China, Germany and Kyrgyzstan. Each laboratory is categorized by specialty, with the China laboratory focusing on animal specimens. One of the most difficult specimens to create was the [[giraffe]] that appears in ''Body Worlds &amp; The Cycle of Life''. The specimen took three years to complete – ten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe, because its final weight (like all specimens after plastination) is equal to the original animal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

More than 200 specimens of real human organs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4 |title=Plastinated Organs |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115101531/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4# |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and organ systems are displayed in glass cases, some showing various medical conditions. Some of the specimens, such as the Tai Chi Man, demonstrate interventions, and include [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] such as [[hip replacement|artificial hip]] [[joint]]s or [[heart valve]]s. Also featured is a liver with cirrhosis and the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker are placed side by side. A prenatal display features fetuses and [[embryo]]s, some with [[congenital disorder]]s.

===Tours===
Body Worlds exhibitions have received more than 37 million visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014837/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html# |archive-date=22 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the world's most popular touring attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,443881,00.html |title=Fox news Dead Body Show Promotes Health, Exhibitor Says |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds'' was first presented in [[Tokyo]] in 1995. Body Worlds exhibitions have since been hosted by more than 50 museums and venues in North America, Europe and Asia. ''Body Worlds 2 &amp; The Brain – Our Three Pound Gem'' (concerning the brain and [[nervous system]]) opened in 2005 at the [[California Science Center]] in [[Los Angeles]]. {{As of|2010|September}} it is showing at the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Telus World of Science]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceworld.ca/bodyworlds|title=Galleries &amp; Theatres - Science World British Columbia|website=www.scienceworld.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Body Worlds exhibits (as well as Von Hagens himself) were featured in the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Among the plastinates featured were the ''Poker Playing Trio'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''Rearing Horse and Rider''.

''Body Worlds 3 &amp; The Story of the Heart'' (concerning the [[cardiovascular system]]) opened on 25 February 2006, at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]]. On 9 July 2009 this show appeared at the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. {{As of|2010|May}}, it is showing at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Denver]], Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmns.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions Current Exhibitions], Denver Museum of Nature and Science. Retrieved 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds 4'' debuted 22 February 2008 at the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]] in [[England]] and was in the Cureghem Cellars in [[Brussels]] until March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodyworlds.red-dog.com/ Cureghem Cellars Official BODY WORLDS site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610060739/http://bodyworlds.red-dog.com/ |date=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds &amp; The Mirror of Time'' (featuring human development and aging) debuted at [[The O2 (London)|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in London in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitlondon.com/bodyworlds |title=Visit London BODY WORLDS at the O2 official site |publisher=Visitlondon.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727080255/http://www.visitlondon.com/bodyworlds/ |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens (The cycle of life)'' opened in Heidelberg in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koerperwelten-deutschland.de/english.html Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds Vital'' was inaugurated at the Universum museum of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=universum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universum.unam.mx/bodyworlds/en/ |title=Body Worlds Vital |publisher=UNAM |accessdate=1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory framework==

===Czech Republic===
In July 2008, the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban "advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money or similar advantages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=323506 |title=Czech Senate toughens rules for handling of human tissue |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On Tuesday 21 April 2009, a French judge ruled concerning the [[Paris]] exhibition of ''Our Body: The Universe Within'', that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a "violation of the respect owed to them". "Under the law, the proper place for corpses is in the cemetery", said Judge Louis-Marie Raingeard. Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20,000 euro (over 26,000 dollars) for each day it stayed open. The judge also ordered authorities to seize the 17 bodies on display and all of the organs on display from an unknown number of people for proper burial. Gunther Von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his Body Worlds franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7411070 France Shuts Down Popular Bodies Show]&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]].

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] created legislation for exhibits of human remains, including plastinated bodies and body parts, in [[England and Wales]] under the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]]. This requires a licence to be granted by the [[Human Tissue Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm HTA Licensing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424090842/http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm |date=24 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Tissue Act superseded the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], which had been found by an independent commission (The Redfern Report)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/31/alderhey1 |title=UK, Main findings of the Redfern report |publisher=Guardian |date= 31 January 2001|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues, following the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]]. In March 2008, the [[Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]] was granted such a licence to hold ''Body Worlds 4'' and a further licence was granted to the exhibition in the O2, London, in 2008.

====Scotland====
The [[Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006]] – which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 – covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act, licences for the handling of human remains, including display, must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry.

{{quote|Subsection 9: If the Scottish Ministers think it desirable to do so in the interests of education, training or research, they may grant a license to a person to publicly display the body or, as the case may be, the part, and a person is authorized under this subsection to so display a body or a part of a body if, at the time of the display he is licensed under this subsection.}}

Various organizations gave evidence to the [[Scottish Executive]] during the consultation process, including the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], the [[Wellcome Trust]], and the [[Museums Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/ma/11480 |title=Response by the Museums Association on the Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill |publisher=Museums Association |date=8 September 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Various legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors.

National legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63 |title=Anatomical Gift Act |publisher=Anatomical Gift Act |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923090355/http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63# |archive-date=23 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] which states that "an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education" and prohibits trafficking in donated human organs for profit.

In early 2008, former U.S. Republican Representative [[Todd Akin|W. Todd Akin]] proposed an amendment to the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] of 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesurge.com/bills/69436-hr5677-federal |title=Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Statesurge.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States." The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is "too broad" and that "Preventing importation of all plastinated specimens could severely restrict their use for medical education.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |title=American Association of Anatomists Newsletter Vol. 17, No. 3, September 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110113/http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 2007–2008 Congressional session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5677 |title=H.R. 5677: To amend the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Govtrack.us |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
California's proposed bill AB1519 (Ma), sponsored by Assemblywoman [[Fiona Ma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ma |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080617_amended_sen_v92.html |title=California State bill AB1519 (Ma) |publisher=Leginfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to "require exhibitors to get a county permit; to do so, they would have to prove to county health officials that the people whose cadavers were on display — or their next of kin — had consented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25,0,2070702.story |title=Cadaver shows raise consent concerns – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=25 January 2008 |first=Marc |last=Lifsher |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129210804/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25%2C0%2C2070702.story |archivedate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof.&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |title=Legislation to Regulate Dead Body Exhibits Moves on to The Governor |publisher=Californiachronicle.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911144748/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was vetoed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on 26 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080926_history.html A.B. No. 1519 bill history, from the Government of California]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
The state of [[Florida]] prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains and "Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into, within, or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this state's anatomical board if the science center notifies the board of any such transportation or exhibition, as well as the location and duration of any exhibition, at least 30 days before such transportation or exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=sb2554.html&amp;Directory=session/2007/Senate/bills/billtext/html/ |title=State of Florida Legislation |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In January 2009, Rep. Marcus Oshiro introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbulletin.com/editorials/20090129_Enact_restrictions_on_cadavers_shown_in_public_exhibits.html |title=Enact restrictions on cadavers shown in public exhibits |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies, the selling of dead human bodies and defines the term "dead human body" to include plastinated bodies and body parts. It would increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to $5,000.

HB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies. Would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Georgette |url=http://hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/inspired-by-bodies.html |title=Hawaii House Blog: Inspired by Bodies |publisher=Hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
In June 2008, [[New York (state)|New York]] State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. A bill that was sponsored by Senator Jim Alesi requires anyone showing an exhibit that uses real human bodies in New York museums to produce a permit detailing their origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 |title=Rochester Homepage Cracking down on human body exhibits |publisher=Rochesterhomepage.net |date=19 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208180852/http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 | archivedate = 8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
Representative [[Mike Fleck|Mike Fleck's]] proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=2299&amp;pn=3339 |title=Pennsylvania bodies exhibit regulatory bill |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
The state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered a bill that would "require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/Summary.aspx?bill=1253&amp;year=2007 |title=State of Washington Bill Requiring written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Religious objections===
Religious groups, including representatives of the [[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ Archdiocese of Vancouver – Body Worlds Exhibit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125000/http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ |date=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Jewish]] rabbis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DEBORAH SUSSMAN SUSSER Associate Editor |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |title='Body Worlds' comes to Phoenix – Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |publisher=Jewishaz.com |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609080641/http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |archive-date=9 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body.

===Sex plastinate===
In 2003, while promoting a display in the Hamburg Museum of Erotica, von Hagens announced his intention to create a sex plastinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |title=Prof in Corpse Sex plan |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613044212/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |archivedate=13 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex, intended for a Berlin exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Peter Kiefer Und Claudia Weingärtner |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/berlin/aktuell/2009/05/05/koerperwelten-dr-tod-gunther-von-hagens/er-zeigt-leichen-beim-sex.html |title=Dr. Tod zeigt Leichensex in Berlin |publisher=Bild.de |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lessening donor organ availability===
In 2007, the [[Bishop of Manchester]] launched a campaign&lt;ref&gt;Bishop of Manchester's campaign Site Corpseshow.info&lt;/ref&gt; to coincide with the opening of Body Worlds in that city, accusing the exhibitors of being "body snatchers" and "robbing the NHS", arguing that donation of bodies for plastination would deprive the [[National Health Service]] of organs for transplant. The site included a government petition calling for "a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses".

===Consent===
{{see also|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}

Questions raised regarding deceased hospital patients from [[Kyrgyzstan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |title=Kirghisien No Skeletons in the Closet — Facts, Background and Conclusions: A response to the alleged corpse scandals in Novosibirsk, Russia, and Bishkek, Kyrgizstan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110115/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and executed prisoners from [[China]] – were categorically stated to have never been used in a Body Worlds exhibition, according to BodyWorlds. "Five years ago, customs officers intercepted 56 bodies and hundreds of brain samples sent from the Novosibirsk Medical Academy to von Hagens' lab in Heidelberg, Germany. The cadavers were traced to a Russian medical examiner who was convicted last year of illegally selling the bodies of homeless people, prisoners and indigent hospital patients. Von Hagens was not charged with any wrongdoing, and says his cadavers are obtained only through proper legal and ethical channels.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687|title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ethical Commission set up by the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles in 2004 had the following members: 
Reverend Richard Benson, Assistant Prof of Moral Theology and Academic Dean, 
St. John's Seminar, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles;
David C. Blake, PhD, JD, VP, Mission and Ethics,
Saint John's Health Center;
Rabbi Morley Feinstein,
Senior Rabbi, University Synagogue;
Reverend Leonard Jackson,
Associate Minister,
First African Methodist Episcopal Church (First AME). 
They determined that 
"All the bodies need to be properly donated. Advisors felt that this is the most controversial aspect of the project. Proper body donation should be verified to the Science Center's satisfaction, and involves several components. Several advisors reviewed the Body Donor and felt it should be reviewed to ensure that it meets an adequate standard of disclosure and informed consent. They recommended that the form should be clear to make sure the bodies in the exhibit consented to public display. The source of donated bodies should be verifiable; Ask an independent party to review donor forms, verifying that all bodies are donated properly.; Communicate to guests, near the entrance of the exhibit, that the bodies are donated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115125640/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ethical concern, consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethics. "That paperwork is then separated from the bodies, which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure, because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Hans Martin Sass, a philosophy professor with a speciality in ethics, was hired by the California Science Center to investigate Body Worlds before the show's U.S. debut in 2004. He matched over 200 donation forms to death certificates, but he did not match the paperwork to specific bodies von Hagens has on display.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

===Import law concerns===
International trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported, because the way their categorization codes (as "art collections") do not require [[Centers for Disease Control]] stamps or death certificates, both of which are required for medical cadavers.&lt;ref&gt;Television broadcast: Channel 3SAT, 1 May 2000,"Die Leichenshow" ("The Cadaver Show")&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 97050000.48 "items in anatomical collections". This customs code encompasses "zoological, botanical, mineralogical or anatomical collections or items in such collections."&lt;ref&gt;Warenverzeichnis für die Außenhandelsstatistik (List of goods for statistics on exports), 1998 Edition of the Federal Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical concerns about cadaver displays===
In an ethical analysis, Thomas Hibbs, professor of ethics and culture at [[Baylor University]], a private [[Baptist]]-affiliated institution, compared cadaver displays to pornography, in that they reduce the subject to "the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=eResources, http://www.eResources.com |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/soa/bodyworlds.htm |title=A Journal of Technology and Society – Dead Body Porn – Thomas S.

In a 2006 lecture entitled "Plasti-Nation: How America was Won",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |title=Public Lectures: Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won Archives |publisher=Blog.lib.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628063801/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia Tanassi, professor of medical ethics and anthropology at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]], explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier. Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry, pointing to an ethics report from the California Science Center. As part of that review, bioethicist Hans Martin Sass was sent to Heidelberg to match donor consents with death certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been expressed about the educational aspects, especially the inclusion of these displays for school field trips. St. Louis Diocese Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic Schools avoid scheduling field trips, stating that parents, and not children, should retain the freedom of deciding whether or not their children will view the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |title=St. Louis Ticket Broker &amp;#124; St Louis Cardinals &amp; St Louis Blues Tickets &amp;#124; Mizzou Football Tickets from The Ticket Guys |publisher=Myfoxstl.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623080125/http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |archivedate=23 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned with how "some kids process" these "graphic" images, Des McKay, school superintendent in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], British Columbia (near [[Greater Vancouver]]), barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |title=Abbotsford schools barred from taking ghoulish field trip |publisher=Canada.com |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208231942/http://www2.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |archivedate=8 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial to the Abbotsford News, Rev.

===Press limitations===
Von Hagens maintains [[copyright]] control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors are not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers are required to sign agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to Von Hagens. Because of a similar agreement applied to sound bites (O-Töne, in German) a German press organization suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition in Munich in 2003 .&lt;ref&gt;Keine O-Töne über Körperwelten [http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html Pressemitteilung, Deutscher Journalisten-Verband, 25 August 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231505/http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html# |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling plastinates===
The Body Worlds website offers plastinated pieces for sale. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Although some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user—those intending to use the pieces for "research, educational, medical or therapeutic purposes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donating Your Body For Plastination|url=http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|publisher=Institute for Plastination|accessdate=24 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232216/http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;—many pieces, including animal testicles and baby chicks, require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices (including one slice of copulating humans) for sale to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastination-products.com/Blood-vessel-configuration/Human-blood-vessel-configuration/Hearts/Human-heart-natural::1239.html |title=Menschliches Herz; natürlich – von Hagens Onlineshop |publisher=Plastination-products.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitors ==
The success of Body Worlds has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including ''[[BODIES... The Exhibition]]'' and ''Our Body: The Universe Within'' in the [[United States]], ''[[Bodies Revealed]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Body Exploration'' in the [[Republic of China]], ''Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[South Korea]], ''[[Jintai Plastomic]]: Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[Japan]], ''Cuerpos Entrañables'' in [[Spain]].

Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens' plastinates; Von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued ''Body Exploration'' and ''Bodies Revealed''.
The suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the [[counterparty]] asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted.

Such lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1145538532408 |title=Body Exhibits Attract Suits on Contracts, Copyrights |publisher=Law.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have not stopped the competition. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from ''Bodies Revealed'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110112/http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition went on successfully.

Several of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company [[Premier Exhibitions]]. They started their first ''Bodies Revealed'' exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]] which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their ''Bodies Revealed'' and ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 are Mexico City, Atlanta (GA), London, Great Britain and Las Vegas (Nevada).

Unlike Body Worlds, none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Dr. Roy Glover, a spokesperson for ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' said all their exhibits use unclaimed cadavers, deposited at the University of Dalian by Chinese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=NPR Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibitions to offer refunds to visitors when it could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo commented: "Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals. Nor is Premier able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Cuomo Settlement With 'Bodies...

'''Cavity walls''' consist of two "skins" separated by a hollow space (cavity).&lt;ref&gt;"Cavity" def. 4. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The skins are commonly [[masonry]], such as brick or concrete block. Masonry is an [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] material, and therefore will slowly draw rainwater or even humidity into the wall, as well as from the inside of the house as from outside. The cavity serves as a way to drain water back out through [[weep]] holes at the base of the wall system or above windows. The weep holes allow wind to create an air stream through the cavity and the stream removes evaporated water from the cavity to the outside. Usually weep holes are created by intentionally leaving several vertical joints, also open head joints, open about two meters apart at the base of in every story. Weep holes are also placed above windows to prevent [[dry rot]] of a wooden window frame. A cavity wall with masonry as both inner and outer skins is more commonly referred to as a double [[wythe]] masonry wall.&lt;ref&gt;Matthys, John H.. ''Masonry: components to assemblages''. Philadelphia, PA: ASTM, 1990. 175. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The typical cavity wall method of construction was introduced in Northwest Europe during the 19th century and gained widespread use from the 1920s. In some early examples stones were used to [[Tie (cavity wall)|tie]] the two leaves of the cavity wall together,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aecb.net/forum/index.php?topic=561.0 |title=AECB Forum : Victorian cavity wall thread |access-date=2006-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060407/http://www.aecb.net/forum/index.php?topic=561.0 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 20th century metal [[Tie (engineering)|tie]]s came into use. Initially cavity widths were extremely narrow and were primarily implemented to prevent the passage of moisture into the interior of the building. The widespread introduction of [[Cavity wall insulation|insulation]] into the cavity began in the 1970s with it becoming compulsory in building regulations during the 1990s.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

==Components==
[[File:Cavity Wall .jpg|thumb|300x300px|Components on a CMU and brick cavity wall]]
A cavity wall is composed of two masonry walls separated by a continuous air space in between the outer and the inner wall. The '''outer wall''' is the brick wall that faces the outside of the building structure.[1]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} The '''inner wall''', separated from the outer wall by a continuous air space or the cavity, is the wall on the interior of the building structure. The inner wall may be constructed of masonry units such as concrete block, structural clay, brick or in some other cases reinforced concrete.[1]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}
These two walls have to be fastened together with '''metal''' ties or '''bonding blocks'''.[2]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} The ties will allow the cavity wall to be strong.



The '''water barrier''' is a thin membrane that will keep moisture away from the cavity side of the interior [[wall]]. [[File:Weep hole.jpg|Weep holes in masonry wall|thumb]]

In cavity walls the [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|'''flashing''']] component is very important for the overall water management of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masoncontractors.org/2012/05/11/masonry-wall-flashings/ |title=Masonry wall flashings |publisher=Masoncontractors.org |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main purpose of the flashing is to direct water out of the cavity.  Metal flashing will usually extend from the interior wall through the outer wall and a weep hole with a downward curve should be provided in order to get water out. Flashing system in cavity walls are typically located close to the base of the wall, so that it will collect, on the bottom, all the water that goes down the wall.

'''[[Weep|Weep holes]]''' are drainage holes left in the exterior wall of the cavity wall, to provide an exit way for water in the cavity.

[[Expansion joint|'''Expansion and control joints''']] do not have to be aligned in cavity walls.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43286484|title=Ramsey/Sleeper architectural graphic standards|last=1884-1963.|first=Ramsey, Charles George,|date=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=Sleeper, Harold Reeve, 1893-1960., Hoke, John Ray, 1950-|isbn=0471348163|edition=10th|location=New York|oclc=43286484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern cavity wall construction, '''cavity [[R-value (insulation)|insulation]]''' is typically added.  This construction makes possible to add a continuous insulation layer in between the two [[wythe]]s and, vertically, through the slabs, which minimizes [[Thermal bridge|thermal bridges.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Wall issues==

Breathing Performance: Early cavity wall buildings are structures that exchange moisture readily with the indoor and outdoor environment. Materials used in repairs must be selected with care so they do not affect the breathing performance of the materials.[4]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cavity wall insulation installed in older buildings can create problems with moisture retention. [4]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Thermal mass]] cavity walls are thick walls. These help stabilize the interior environment of a building better that the thinner modern walls.[4]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Environmental Influences: The orientation or design of a building may affect the performance of different façades on a building. Some walls may receive more rainwater and wind than others depending in their orientation or protection to some of the faces. [4]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Damp]]: Moisture is one of the main problems in materials weathering. [4]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A '''city bicycle''', '''urban bicycle''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?site=&amp;tbm=pts&amp;source=hp&amp;q=urban+bicycle&amp;oq=urban+bicycle&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l5j0i22i30k1l5.1494.3602.0.3819.14.13.0.0.0.0.54.605.13.13.0....0...1.1.64.hp..1.13.604.0..0i22i10i30k1.xkNikprsmag&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=uwJiWZ6UGInewQKOz6ugAQ|title=urban bicycle - Google Patents|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''European city bike''' (ECB), '''classic bike''' or simply '''city-bike''', is a [[bicycle]] designed for frequent short, moderately paced rides through relatively flat [[urban area]]s.  It is a form of [[utility bicycle]] commonly seen around the world, built to facilitate everyday riding in normal clothes in a variety of weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/06/copenhagenize-worlds-most-bike-friendly-cities/  www.wired.com] ''worlds-most-bike-friendly-cities'' - Consulted on 2015-02-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally as they are more suitable for urban environments, they focus more on comfort and practicality instead of speed or efficiency. They normally have a slightly curved, roughly planar aligned and elevated [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebar]], providing users an upright sitting position. They have fewer gears and they often are heavier than [[road bicycle]]s. They might have the top central frame bar diagonally aligned for allowing easy mounting in and out and they might have a back or front frame for transport of items. The saddle is typically larger compared with other bicycles and the majority is provided with [[Bicycle chain|chain]] and tires protections against oil or dirt.&lt;ref name="bike def" /&gt;

City bikes may be individually owned or operated as part of a [[Bicycle sharing system|public bike sharing scheme]].

==Design and operation==
[[Image:Gazelle Omafahrrad series -1.jpg|thumb|250px|A vintage ''[[Roadster (bicycle)#Ladies' model and the Omafiets|Omafiets]]'', the Dutch ladies' bicycle]]

==="Stadsfiets" as a defining term===
The Dutch term ''Stadsfiets'' is a useful starting point for defining the nature of the design, as it has the full set of features commonly incorporated into a European city bike.   The Dutch words ''fiets'' and ''stadsfiets'' mean ''bicycle'' and ''city bicycle'', respectively.  A ''stadsfiets'' is considered to be a fully outfitted European city bike, distinguished by the following typical features: upright riding position, fully enclosed [[chain case|chaincase]], [[skirt guard|skirtguard]], [[O-lock]], hub gearing, [[hub dynamo|dynamo hub]], manually operated small warning bell, and built-in lights.

German and Dutch versions of the European city bike are similar, though there are differences.&lt;ref&gt;''Duitse Versus Nederlandse Stadsfiets'', Vogelvrije Fietser, January/February 2008, pp. 20-21, [http://media.fietsersbond.nl/VVF/vvf-1-2008-testkees_duitse_stadsfiets.pdf Article in Dutch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Roadster (bicycle)|English roadster]]'' is similar in design, appearance, and intended use.  The primary differences are that the continental bicycles tend to have a higher handlebar position for a more upright riding posture, and are more likely to have [[Bicycle brake systems#Rod-actuated brakes|rod-actuated]] drum brakes.  Because of Great Britain's cultural and trading influence in its former colonies, the roadster can still be seen in local production and use in many countries of the world.

===Traditional vs. contemporary design===
A traditional-styled European city bike includes a frame made of low-carbon high-tensile steel, black paint with chromed accessories, an opaque skirtguard, bottle dynamo, simple dynamo-powered lights, and either a single-speed or 3-speed internally geared hub.

Contemporary city bikes are increasingly found in many European cities, including [[Amsterdam]] and [[Copenhagen]].  Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear [[skirt guard]], colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front suspension fork, suspension seatpost, [[Hub dynamo]], dynamo lighting with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable [[kickstand]], child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork.  Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a ''less is more'' philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Duitse Versus Nederlandse Stadsfiets'', Vogelvrije Fietser, January/February 2008, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batavus 4.jpg|thumb|250px|Contemporary-designed European city bicycle.]]

===Examples===
The following bicycles provide most or all of the features are commonly found in The Netherlands or Denmark on a city bike:
* [[Batavus]], Crescendo model
* [[Gazelle (bicycle)|Gazelle]]
* [[Kronan (bicycle)|Kronan]]
* Skeppshult (bicycle) Skeppshult
* Sparta, "Atlas Trendy N7" model
* Kildemoes, "Classic" model

* [[Flying Pigeon]], PA-02 (men's), PA-06 (men's double top tube), and PB-13 (women's) models, made in China
* [[Trek Bicycle Corporation]], L300 model and other "City/Trekking/Leisure" models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trekbikes.com/be/nl/ www.trekbikes.com/be/nl/]  Retrieved on 17 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Motobecane USA "Bistro 3", "Bistro 7" and "Bistro 8" model
* Windsor "Essex" and "Oxford" model

While differing in many details, some American bicycle manufacturers have incorporated some features of traditional European city bikes in models such as:&lt;ref name="bike def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centurycycles.com/buyers-guides/bicycle-types-how-to-pick-the-best-bike-for-you-pg9.htm|author=Century Cycles|title=Bicycle Types: How to Pick the Best Bike for You, City Bikes|date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windsor USA features the "Essex" and "Oxford" model, men's and women's models
* Motobecane Bistro 8 features quilted stitching on saddle and grips along with an 8 speed internal hub 
* ''[[Electra Bicycle Company|Electra]] Royal 8'', ''Breezer Uptown 8'', ''Biria Trekking Superlight 8'', and the ''PUBLIC C7i''

===Suitability compared to hybrid or commuter bikes===
The suitability and availability of fully outfitted city bikes depends on multiple factors, including local terrain, city density, car traffic, weather, and bicycle infrastructure.  Traditional European city bikes are optimized for short-distance, frequent transportation over flat terrain in urban settings.  However, such bikes are also used in hilly Switzerland, including [[Basel]] and [[Bern]], where 23% and 15% of daily trips are made by bicycle respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/cycling/cycling_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A fully outfitted European city bike or heavy [[utility bicycle|utility roadster]] typically weighs 35–50 pounds (16–23&amp;nbsp;kg), compared with 14–22 pounds (6–10&amp;nbsp;kg) for the average road [[racing bicycle|racing bike]] and 22–29 pounds (10–13&amp;nbsp;kg) for the typical modern [[mountain bike]], [[touring bicycle]], or hybrid [[hybrid bicycle#City bike|city bike]], [[hybrid bicycle#Commuter bike|commuter]], or [[hybrid bicycle#Cross bike|cross bike]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ballantine|Ballantine, Richard]], ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'', New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; A steel-frame European city bike with hub gear, chain case, and other features is heavier and more difficult to ride uphill than a road bike.&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine, Richard, ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'', New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 32–34: Ballantine writes: "I like [European city bikes] fine — in the Netherlands. Pedaling them up any kind of a hill is hard work."&lt;/ref&gt; A steel-frame bike is more cumbersome to carry and store, so it might not be the best choice for commuters needing to transport their bicycles on public transportation nor cyclists living or working in upper floor residences.&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine, Richard, ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'', New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, European city bikes are often locked and stored outside businesses or residences, even during inclement weather. For easier carrying and storage, makers of European city bikes provide features similar to city bikes on [[folding bicycle]]s. In the Netherlands, many modern city bikes are also available with an aluminum alloy frame, significantly reducing weight to partly overcome the practical difficulties with a heavier bike.
 
In the United States, Americans living in cities or suburbs with many days of sunshine per year have traditionally used road racing bicycles, [[touring bicycle|sport/touring]] bicycles, or mountain bikes for general commuting or utility purposes. For all-weather use, U.S. buyers tend to purchase substantially lighter machines than the traditional ''Stadsfiets'' or utility roadster, instead choosing [[hybrid bicycle#City bike|hybrid city bikes]] or commuter bikes derived from road or mountain designs.  The latter frequently employ lightweight frames and wide gear ranges for use on higher-speed roadways as well as steep terrain. To save weight, some hybrid city or commuter bikes do not usually possess many accessories, adding only fenders, a rack, and perhaps a partial chainguard, as well as front and rear lights.&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine, Richard, ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'', New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Their smaller bulk and lighter weight often permits them to be carried into offices and residences, an advantage in countries with extremely high rates of bicycle vandalism and theft (even of older or obsolete models with little monetary value).&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine, Richard, ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'', New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most European city bikes are designed to withstand year-round outdoor storage, even in frigid Scandinavia where daily bike usage remains high year-round. Thus, European city bikes need not always be brought indoors and can be left outside, properly locked.  To deter theft and vandalism, the European city bike has a tougher frame, non-quick-release seat and wheels, and a rear-wheel lock.  To prevent theft or vandalism, it is ideal to bring the bike indoors, but this isn't always possible in dense cities with compact living quarters.

===Lightweight variants===
Much like the English ''[[Roadster (bicycle)#Design and variants|sports roadster]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldonbrown.com/english-3.html#sports  www.sheldonbrown.com], The Golden Age of 3 Speeds – Roadster, Sports or Club? Retrieved 2009-09-25..&lt;/ref&gt; a lighter-weight variant of the contemporary European city bike adheres to the same general approach to bike design and use, but saves weight and increases efficiency by using:

* Caliper brakes instead of hub brakes
* Derailleurs rather than hub gearing
* A battery-based lighting system rather than a hub dynamo system
* Carbon front fork
* Aluminum rims and hubs, with fewer spokes
* Light plastic or webbing skirt guard, or no skirtguard
* No suspended seat or fork
The lightweight European city bike is a popular model for Dutch brands such as [[Batavus]] and [[Gazelle (bicycle)|Gazelle]], where high levels of bicycle use result in demand for higher performance city bicycles, which is otherwise similar to the fully outfitted typical European city bike.  This is sometimes marketed as a "sports" variant of the latter.

==Typical features==
[[File:Ciclista antípodas.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A city bike with a [[step-through frame]] is practical for easy mounting in and out. Straight sitting position focusing on comfort instead of speed. [[gear case|Chainguard]] and [[Fender (vehicle)#Bicycles and motorcycles|mudguards]] protect against oil or dirt.]]

===Hub gearing===
A [[hub gear]] is an important feature of a European city bike.  A hub gear system provides greater ease-of-use than a derailleur system due to the ability to change gear stationery, smooth changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hub of the Matter |url=https://rideonmagazine.com.au/hub-of-the-matter/ |website=Ride on Magazine |publisher=Ride on Magazine |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ability to provide a wide range of ratios, and the requirement of little maintenance.

A geared hub requires only one shifter rather than two, thus is easier to use than the pair of derailleurs which provide a greater number of speeds to sporting bicycles that need them.  A European city bike or roadster typically has 3, 5, 7, 8 or 11 speeds.  In a few high-end models, a [[Rohloff]] 14-speed geared hub is available.  Batavus makes several models of full-featured city bikes that have a [[NuVinci Continuously Variable Transmission|NuVinci]] hub with continuously variable drive ratio.  The ''NuVinci'' has nearly the same range as an 8-speed hub (around 300%), selectable at any ratio within the range.  With most bikes, the [[bicycle gearing]] may be scaled up or down as needed, for example by installing a smaller [[crankset|chainring]] in front and/or larger sprocket in back to facilitate climbing.

Hub gearing permits the use of a fully enclosed [[chaincase]], which minimizes the need for maintenance.  A hub gear has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment.  A hub gear system is heavier than a derailleur system.  In a hub gear system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system.  If a geared hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it.

===Angled-back handlebars===
A European city bike has angled-back handlebars and an upright riding position.  The handlebars, similar to the [[bicycle handlebar#Upright or North Road|North Road]] style handlebars, have a moderate rise and are swept back toward the body, enabling a fully upright posture similar to a person walking.  The rider is easily visible to other traffic and can easily see traffic and hazards.

The handlebar's shape allows shopping bags, locks, and other items to be hung from the bars without slipping off.  This reduces steering control, but that is compensated by the more stable geometry of the frame and forks.

===Stable geometry===
A curved fork and angled vertical tubing provides stable, non-twitchy steering, enabling the rider to ride with one hand, while freeing the other hand for signalling or to secure a load on the rear rack.  Europeans commonly use the free hand to hold an umbrella or cell phone, or to hold the shoulder of a child riding their own bike, to train the child for positioning on the road. A coaster brake further enables such one-handed riding, because the one hand on the handlebar only has to steer, not also brake.

A stable European city bike enables securely travelling along in a position that is as upright as walking; it feels stable and relaxed, like walking very fast.  A safe city bike needs to be capable of easily turning without falling over, and needs to be capable of moving reliably with shopping bags and a lock hanging from the handlebars.

===Hub dynamo, automatic lights and magnetic lights===
A [[hub dynamo]] enables a built-in [[Bicycle lighting|lighting system]] without the loud noise and high drag of a bottle (sidewall) dynamo, and without the unreliability, high cost, ecological disposal problem, and maintenance inherent with batteries.  The hub dynamo powers LED or halogen front and rear lights.  The lights have a built-in reflector.  The taillight is mounted cleanly on the rear rack or fender.  A built-in reflector in the headlight and taillight surrounds or is adjacent to the LED or light bulb.  Built-in lights stay on point, i.e., need no adjustments.
[[Image:Gazelle Speciaal -5.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional [[bottle dynamo]] and lamp]]
The latest systems include a capacitor-powered standlight, powered for a few minutes by a capacitor.  This prevents the lights from going out as soon as the bike speed drops to less than a few miles per hour; this evens out the amount of light at various speeds, sustaining the light at lower speeds.

The latest systems include automatic switching based on darkness+motion detection.  This prevents having to reach to physically position a [[bottle dynamo]] or consume set-up time; this enables ready, guaranteed lighting regardless of the daylight conditions.  A three-position switch has positions for Off, On, and Auto.  A hub dynamo prevents the usage-overhead and preparation time of attaching the headlight and taillight to the bike prior to using the bike, and prevents having to remove the headlight and taillight and carry them while the bicycle is parked in public.  A built-in light system avoids a failing battery lamp and prevents getting a ticket and fine from having no lights at night.

Many Danish bikes feature lights powered through [[electromagnetic induction]]. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels, eliminating the need for batteries while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos.

===Front suspension with built-in headlight===
A front suspension fork is common on high-end, contemporary-styled European city bikes.  This is often a coil/oil or air/oil [[Bicycle fork|suspension fork]] with adjustable compression and rebound.  A traditional roadster has no front suspension, or a spring-based front suspension  that has more limited travel and adjustability.

Some high-end models integrate the headlight into the front fork and fender assembly.  This discourages vandalism, protects the wiring, and reduces the number of external wires and cables.

===O-lock===
[[Image:Bike O Lock Japan.jpg|right|thumb|Bike O Lock]]
A built-in [[O-lock]] is a type of [[bicycle lock]] that prevents ride-off theft, establishes ownership, secures the back wheel to the frame (which can be separately locked), and provides a lock and slot for a cable.  An O-lock is also called a ring lock or wheel lock.

The O-lock facilitates outdoor parking, by reducing the risk that someone can steal the bike by quickly riding off on it.  An O-lock is lightweight and unobtrusive.  It can be locked very quickly and conveniently, such as when parking the bike outside a store while running errands.

The O-lock also serves as a deterrent to ownership disputes, as the person who has the O-lock key is proven to be the owner of the bike.  More recent O-locks have a slot to attach an armored cable, allowing a cyclist to lock the frame, wheels, and seat.

O-locks provide a limited degree of security, like all locks.&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine, Richard, ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'', New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 154-158: In some less-civilised cities of the world, bicycle locks offer little protection against thieves armed with moving vans, prybars, portable saws, and cutters to remove locks or their attachment points (posts, bike racks, etc.).  Even if unsuccessful in stealing the bike, it is not uncommon for thieves to extensively damage or vandalise it, making public parking hazardous.&lt;/ref&gt;  The greatest security requires using multiple types of locks together.  In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft and the owner must show that they have the key, to demonstrate that the bike was locked.  The key can only be removed by locking the lock.  In other locations, the O-lock is used along with locking the frame to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.&lt;ref&gt;MacBike Amsterdam Safe Cycle Guide, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjNNDPXVvT0, depicts a ride-off theft at 4:50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skirt guard ===
A [[skirt guard]] (or coatguard) allows using the bike with normal clothes, for both the main rider and a passenger riding on the back rack.  The skirt guard helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, [[cloak]], dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and chaincase.  It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes.

A skirtguard prevents winter or flowing spring clothing from getting caught in the area where many features converge: the back brake, O-lock, and spokes.  The skirtguard and O-lock form an integrated system.  The O-lock catches clothing, so the skirtguard is needed to compensate.  The O-lock passes through a hole in the skirt guard.  The traditional, old-fashioned city bike has a solid (opaque) fabric skirt guard, while the contemporary European city bike has a clear plastic guard.

===Fully enclosed chain guard ===
[[File:Bicycle in The Hague 25.JPG|thumb|250px|Riding in a dress on a bicycle with fully enclosed chain guard.]]
A fully enclosed [[chain guard]] or chaincase enables using the bike with normal clothes and no preparation activity, such as wearing [[trouser clips]] or rolling up a trouser leg.  A full guard prevents oil stains on clothes, and keeps trouser legs from getting caught in the chain or front chainring.  While newer designs may use a partial chain guard, the latter still permits the chain to occasionally catch and stain loose trouser legs if not secured.

A full chain guard also keeps the drive train (chain and external gears) clean and efficient by excluding water, mud, and grit which could splash onto the chain and front chainring, increase wear, and reduce drivetrain efficiency.  To repair a rear flat tire, a fully enclosed chain guard must be partially disassembled to remove the back wheel, or the tire must be repaired in-place without removing the wheel.

===Full fenders with mudguard flaps===
The fenders are aluminum or plastic, sometimes with a taillight affixed to the bottom of the back fender.  The fairly low bottom of the back fender reduces road grime splashing up to a cyclist who is following behind.  Integrated fenders designed into the bike provide a clean, safe attachment, and match the bike frame.

===Enclosed drum brakes===
Enclosed [[drum brake]]s or a rear coaster brake are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes.  A bike with drum brakes is optimized for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, drum brakes provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less.

Enclosed drum brakes require infrequent maintenance, compared to rim brakes or disc brakes, and are more durable than disc brakes, which are exposed.

Drum brakes are best suited for slower, moderate use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load.  Under such heavy braking, drum brakes are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout.  A common model of drum brake is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the drum brake from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.

Drum brakes are heavier than rim brakes.

===Luggage carrier===
[[File:Bicycle in The Hague 36.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Transporting a passenger on the back rack, and a child next to the handlebar.]]
A Dutch convention is to carry a passenger on the [[Luggage carrier|back rack]], the passenger balancing side-saddle.  The sturdy rack supports passenger weight, to carry a passenger and sustain a launch without collapsing.  A standard strap assembly attaches cleanly to the rack, providing useful transport capability.  There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 elastic straps.  The rack is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted on the back of the rack.

Danish bikes are usually equipped with a back rack with a spring-loaded clamp.

===Dual or adjustable kickstand===
A [[kickstand]] is present, and is often dual-leg or a center-stand for stability while the bike is carrying children or a load.  Alternately, an adjustable-length kickstand enables parking regardless of the slope and load.

===Tires and wheels===
[[Bicycle tire|Tires]] are puncture-resistant for travelling without a pump and tools to fix a flat tire.  Width is normally medium to wide (1.5-1.75&amp;nbsp;inches; 38–44&amp;nbsp;mm), providing a balance of speed with durability and cushioning.  These are semi-slick road tires with shallow tread, such as Schwalbe Marathon tires.  Such tires are faster and quieter than mountain-bike tires, and more durable and reliable than road-racing tires. Reflective bands on the sidewalls make the wheels visible as wheels, not just as small reflectors.  This makes the bike more visible from side at night by cars without using reflective clothing and extra lights.

Large 28", 700 B or 700 C [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] are typical, providing a smoother ride than 26" wheels.  On traditional Dutch city bikes, extremely thick spokes add carrying strength.  To discourage theft, the front and back wheels use axle bolts instead of quick-releases.  European city bikes are used in bike-friendly areas for short distances with sturdy tires. These features are suited to riding without tools or quick-release wheels.

===Platform pedals===
The platform pedals allow use with normal shoes.

===Saddle===
The saddle is typically moderately broad, softly cushioned, and is often suspended.  A non quick-release seat prevents having to lock or remove the seat to prevent theft.

===Other features===
A bell is standard equipment for bikes in Europe, and is required by law in some European countries, such as Denmark, Poland and Germany.  Additional features are available, such as front and rear [[bicycle reflector]]s, baskets,&lt;ref&gt;EN 14872 standard&lt;/ref&gt; [[child seat]]s&lt;ref&gt;they follow the [[EN 14344]] and [[ISO 11243]] standards&lt;/ref&gt; and a windshield.

==Media and politics==
In 1997, then [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] was given a European city bike named ''City Bike One'' as a memento of his visit to Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;''The City Bike and Copenhagen'' [http://www.bycyklen.dk/english/thecitybikeandcopenhagen.aspx Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220111452/http://www.bycyklen.dk/english/thecitybikeandcopenhagen.aspx |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17294">'''Comic book therapy''' is a form of [[art therapy]] in which those undergoing rehabilitation or those who have already completed rehabilitation express their experiences through personal narratives within a comics format. The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific [[comic book]]s, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses. Clients are encouraged to present their thoughts and feelings they experienced while reading as well as to draw parallels with their own lived experiences based on the events that occur within the books.&lt;ref name="Comicspedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicspedia.net/|title=Comicspedia: the intersection of comic books and clinical psychology|last=O'Connor|first=Patrick|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in an effort to reach a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] moment of clarity and understanding of one's own life.

Both forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping.

Comic book therapy is currently being applied to a variety of populations, including patients diagnosed with life-altering diagnoses (i.e. cancer, Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, etc.), patients and family members experiencing severe illness or death, families undergoing therapy, sexual assault survivors, and soldiers returning from war.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McMullin|first=Juliet|date=2016-06-01|title=Cancer and the Comics: Graphic Narratives and Biolegitimate Lives|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maq.12172/abstract|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=149–167|doi=10.1111/maq.12172|issn=1548-1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warson|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-04-01|title=Healing Pathways: Art Therapy for American Indian Cancer Survivors|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13187-012-0324-5|journal=Journal of Cancer Education|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1007/s13187-012-0324-5|issn=0885-8195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czerwiec|first=M.

== Comic Book Therapy and Graphic Medicine ==
{{main|Graphic medicine}}

Graphic medicine, originally coined by [http://myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams], is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop-culture trend.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It owes its success in part to the rise of [[medical humanities]], an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as "graphic pathologies", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease.

Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well.

The general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.

== History ==
The foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920's just after the culmination of the First World War.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/history-of-comics/|title=The History of Comics: Decade by decade {{!}} The Artifice|website=the-artifice.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially starting out as small black-and-white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of ''The Funnies #1'' that the first collection of comics material came about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]], [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]], [[Peanuts]],'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]].''

Professionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920's, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicmedicine.org/a-short-history-of-art-comics/|title=A Short History of "Art" Comics {{!}} Graphic Medicine|last=Williams|first=Ian|date=|work=Graphic Medicine|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics #1'']], the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=M|date=2017|title=Graphic Novels: A Brief History, Their Use in Business Education, and the Potential for Negotiation Pedagogy|url=|journal=Negotiation and Conflict Management Research|volume=10|pages=324–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Current Uses in Today's Medical Setting ==
Since its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=M.J|date=1971|title=The use of graphic images in psychotherapy|url=|journal=American Journal of Art Therapy|volume=10|pages=153–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=E|date=1997|title=The symbolic graphic life-line: Integrating the past and present through graphic imagery|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=14|pages=261–267|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=A.J.|date=2017|title=Using comics to communicate about health: An introduction to the symposium on visual narratives and graphic medicine|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=32|pages=523–524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jawad|first=Muna|date=2015-12-01|title=Comics are Research: Graphic Narratives as a New Way of Seeing Clinical Practice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=369–374|doi=10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.

=== Therapeutic Tool ===

==== Creating a comic book ====
One form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based story telling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple mediums. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=M.J.|date=2004|title=Comics as Art Therapy|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=21|pages=42–43|doi=10.1080/07421656.2004.10129317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"/&gt; Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, M.J. &amp; Myers, K.R.|first=|date=|title=Graphic medicine: use of comics in medical education and patient care.|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=340|pages=574–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reading a comic book ====
Another form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[eating disorder]]s, and so on. Popular novels include ''Cancervixen: a True Story'' by [[Marisa Acocella Marchetto]], ''Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me'' by [[Sarah Leavitt]], and ''Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me'' by [[Ellen Forney]]. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described  within the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karno|first=M.|last2=Brunon|first2=J|last3=Arch|first3=M|last4=Waldron|first4=P|date=1977|title=Therapeutic use of generative graphics|url=|journal=Art Psychotherapy|volume=4|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.

=== Educational Tool ===
Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmond|first=S.W.|last2=Echevarria|first2=M|date=|title=Healthcare Transformation and Changing Roles for Nursing|journal=Orthopedic Nursing|volume=36|issue=1|pages=12–25|doi=10.1097/NOR.0000000000000308|issn=0744-6020|pmc=5266427|pmid=28107295}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu/medical-education/md-program|title=M.D. Program {{!}} Medical Education|website=medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael J.|last2=Myers|first2=Kimberly|last3=Watson|first3=Katie|last4=Czerwiec|first4=M. K.|last5=Shapiro|first5=Dan|last6=Draus|first6=Stephanie|date=2016-12-01|title=Creativity in Medical Education: The Value of Having Medical Students Make Stuff|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=475–483|doi=10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Projects that crisis camps often work on include setting up [[social network]]s for people to locate missing friends and relatives, creating maps of affected areas, and creating inventories of needed items such as food and clothing.

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many crisis camps were set up around the world, often under the name "Crisis Camp Haiti", to help with the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17,0,6468659.story |title=Crisis Camp Haiti: Techno-types volunteer their computer skills to aid quake victims |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120063956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17%2C0%2C6468659.story |archivedate=January 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-dressing''' is the act of wearing items of [[clothing]] and other [[accoutrements]] commonly associated with the opposite sex within a particular [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;"cross-dress." ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition.'' Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-dressing has been used for purposes of [[disguise]], comfort, and self-expression in modern times and throughout history.

Almost every human society throughout history has had [[gender role|expected norms for each gender]] relating to style, color, or type of clothing they are expected to wear, and likewise most societies have had a set of [[Social aspects of clothing|guidelines, views or even laws]] defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender.

The term ''cross-dressing'' refers to an action or a behavior without attributing or implying any specific causes for that behavior. It is often assumed that the connotation is directly correlated with behaviors of [[transgender]] identity or [[Human sexuality|sexual]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior, but the term itself does not imply any motives and is not synonymous to one's gender identity.

==History==
{{Main article|History of cross-dressing}}
{{Crossdressing}}
[[File:Crossdressing circa 1890 Frances Benjamin Johnston (right).jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] (right) poses with two cross-dressing friends; the "lady" is identified by Johnston as the illustrator Mills Thompson.]]
[[File:Lady Bunny and Sherry Vine by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|225px|[[Drag queen]]s are a form of cross-dressing as [[performance art]].]]

Cross-dressing has been practiced throughout much of recorded history and in many societies. There are many examples in [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], and [[Hindu mythology]]. A reasonable number of historical figures are known to have cross-dressed to varying degrees and for a variety of reasons. There is a rich history of cross-dressing found in folklore, literature, theater, and music.  Examples include [[Kabuki]] and [[Korean shamanism#Chaesu-gut (채수굿)|Korean shamanism]].

It was once considered [[taboo]] in Western society for women to wear clothing traditionally associated with men, except when done in certain circumstances such as cases of necessity (as per [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s guidelines in ''Summa Theologiae II''), which states: "Nevertheless this may be done sometimes without sin on account of some necessity, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, or through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |title=Summa Theologiae Part II |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cross-dressing is cited as an abomination in the Bible in the book of [[Deuteronomy]] (22:5), which states: "A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deuteronomy 22:5 (NIV) |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22:5 |accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Aquinas noted above this principle was interpreted to be based on context. Other people in the Middle Ages occasionally disputed its applicability; for instance, the 15th-century French poet [[Martin le Franc]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Don't you see that it was forbidden
That anyone should eat of an animal
Unless it had a cleft foot
And chewed its cud?
To eat of a hare no one dared
Neither of sow nor of piglet,
Yet should you now be offered any,
You would take many a morsel.&lt;ref&gt; Merkle, Gertrude H. "Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc", ''Martin Le Franc's Commentary on Jean Gerson's Treatise on Joan of Arc'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
However, women had to disguise themselves as men in order to participate in the wider world. For example, [[Margaret King]] cross-dressed in the early nineteenth century to attend medical school, as none would accept female students. While this prohibition remained in force in general throughout the Middle Ages and early modern era, this is no longer the case and Western women are often seen wearing trousers, ties, and men's hats. Nevertheless, many cultures around the world still prohibit women from wearing trousers or other traditionally male clothing.

Cross-dressing in [[Siglo de Oro|sixteenth- and seventeenth-century]] Spain was frequent among actors, and the theater was at the time the most popular form of entertainment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Brian|title=Crossdressing, Crossculture: Conceptions and Perceptions of Crossdressing in Golden Age Madrid and Tudor-Stuart London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a fascination with female cross-dressers particularly (women dressed as men), who were "extremely popular" in the "[[Siglo de Oro|Golden Age]] ''[[Comedia (Spanish play)|Comedia]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seagraves|first1=Rosie|title=SHE AS HE: CROSS-DRESSING, THEATER, AND "IN-BETWEENS" IN EARLY MODERN SPAIN|date=August 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male actors might play the "women dressed as men" parts. Spain eventually found this cross-dressing to be threatening to social order, and passed laws targeting female [[Transvestism|transvestites]] throughout the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Brian|title=Crossdressing, Crossculture: Conceptions and Perceptions of Crossdressing in Golden Age Madrid and Tudor-Stuart London|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reactions and disapproval, it continued to remain very popular in the ''comedia''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Varieties==
There are many different kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior.&lt;ref name = "eucwqo"&gt;''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana&lt;/ref&gt; Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style, out of personal preference for clothing associated with the opposite sex. In this case, a person's cross-dressing may or may not be apparent to other people. Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]].

'''Gender disguise''' has been used by women and girls to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as [[male]] in society and by men and boys to pass themselves off as [[female]]. Gender disguise has also been used as a [[plot device]] in storytelling and is a recurring motif in literature, theater, and film. It is a common plot device in narrative [[ballads]].&lt;ref name="child106"&gt;{{cite book|last=Child|first=Francis James
|title=The English and Scottish Popular Ballads|publisher=Dover Publications Inc|volume=II|pages=428–432|isbn=978-0-486-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, some women have cross-dressed to take up male-dominated or male-exclusive professions, such as military service. Conversely, some men have cross-dressed to escape from mandatory military service&lt;ref&gt;See the television series ''M.A.S.H.'' for an example of a cross-dresser who didn't want to serve in the military (Max Klinger). Although the character was played for laughs, his situation was based on military regulations prohibiting cross-dressing.&lt;/ref&gt; or as a disguise to assist in political or social protest, as men did in the [[Rebecca Riots]].

Gender disguise has also been used by women in modern times to pass as a male soldier in [[battle reenactment]]s. In 1989,  Lauren Burgess dressed as a male soldier in a U.S. National Park service reenactment of the [[Battle of Antietam]], and was ejected after she was discovered to be a woman. Burgess sued the Park Service for sexual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |last1=Robinson |first1=Lynda |last2= |first2= |agency= |date=September 30, 1991 |title=Battle re-enactor finds herself at war with U.S. Park Service |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-30/news/1991273008_1_re-enactors-civil-war-burgess/2 |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |issn=1930-8965 |oclc=244481759 |publisher=Trif Alatzas |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=13 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case spurred spirited debate among Civil War buffs.

[[Undercover journalism]] may require cross-dressing, as with [[Norah Vincent]]'s project [[Self-Made Man (book)|''Self-Made Man'']].

Single-sex theatrical troupes often have some performers who cross-dress to play roles written for members of the opposite sex ([[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]). Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing [[dress]]es, is often used for comic effect onstage and on-screen.

[[Drag (clothing)|Drag]] is a special form of performance art based on the act of cross-dressing. A [[drag queen]] is usually a [[Sex assignment|male-assigned]] person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious make-up, and [[Wig (hair)|wig]]. A drag queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A [[faux queen]] is a female-assigned person employing the same techniques.

A [[drag king]] is a counterpart of the drag queen but usually for much different audiences, and is defined as a female-assigned person who adopts a masculine persona in performance or imitates a male film or pop-music star. Some female-assigned people undergoing [[gender reassignment therapy]] also self-identify as ''drag kings'' although this use of "drag king" would generally be considered inaccurate.

[[File:Transvestite in latex clothes.JPG|thumb|225px|A transvestic fetishist wearing latex clothes]]
A [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetishist]] is a person (typically a [[heterosexual]] male) who cross-dresses as part of a [[sexual fetish]].

The term ''underdressing'' is used by male cross-dressers to describe wearing female undergarments under their male clothes. The famous low-budget film-maker [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] said he often wore women's underwear under his military uniform during World War II.

Some people who cross-dress may endeavor to project a complete impression of belonging to another gender, including mannerisms, [[Speech communication|speech]] patterns, and emulation of [[Sex-determination system|sexual characteristics]]. This is referred to as passing or "trying to pass" depending how successful the person is. An observer who sees through the cross-dresser's attempt to pass is said to have ''read'' or ''clocked'' them. There are videos, books, and magazines on how a man may look more like a woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Transformation'' magazine; interviews for ''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana&lt;/ref&gt;

''Female masking'' is a form of cross-dressing in which men wear [[mask]]s that present them as female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vicestyle.com/en/news/today/post/female-masking | title=Female Masking | publisher=Vice Style | author=Jamie Clifton | date=August 30, 2011 | accessdate=2012-02-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717035229/http://vicestyle.com/en/news/today/post/female-masking | archivedate=July 17, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes either member of a heterosexual couple will cross-dress in order to arouse the other. For example, the male might wear skirts or lingerie and/or the female will wear boxers or other male clothing. (See also [[forced feminization]])

Others may choose to take a mixed approach, adopting some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a man might wear both a [[dress]] and a [[beard]]. This is sometimes known as ''[[genderfuck]]''.  In a broader context, crossdressing may also refer to other actions undertaken to pass as a particular sex, such as [[Packing (phallus)|packing]] (accentuating the male crotch bulge) or, the opposite, [[tucking]] (concealing the male crotch bulge).&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Sue, and Genny Beemyn. "Beyond a binary: The lives of gender‐nonconforming youth." About Campus 17.4 (2012): 2-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothes==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
The actual determination of cross-dressing is largely [[socially constructed]]. For example, in Western society, trousers have long been adopted for usage by women, and it is no longer regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn [[Men's skirts|skirt-like garments]] such as the [[kilt]] or [[sarong]], these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both men's and women's clothing are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.

[[File:vanessatv.jpg|thumb|225px|Some male crossdressers seek a more subtle feminine image.]]
[[Cosplaying]] may also involve cross-dressing, for some females may wish to dress as a male, and vice versa (see [[Crossplay]]). Breast binding (for females) is not uncommon and is one of the things likely needed to cosplay a male character.

In most parts of the world it remains socially disapproved for men to wear clothes traditionally associated with women. Attempts are occasionally made, e.g. by [[fashion designer]]s, to promote the acceptance of [[male skirt|skirts]] as everyday wear for men. Cross-dressers have complained that society permits women to wear pants or jeans and other masculine clothing, while condemning any man who wants to wear clothing sold for women.

While creating a more feminine figure, male cross-dressers will often utilize different types and styles of [[breast forms]], which are silicone [[prostheses]] traditionally used by women who have undergone [[mastectomies]] to recreate the visual appearance of a breast.

While most male cross-dressers utilize clothing associated with modern women, some are involved in subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in [[vintage clothing]]. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as femininely as possible, so they wear frilly dresses with lace and ribbons, [[bridal gown]]s complete with veils, as well as multiple [[petticoat]]s, [[corset]]s, [[girdle]]s and/or [[garter belt]]s with [[nylon stockings]].

==Social issues==
[[File:A Morning Frolic, or the Transmutation of the Sexes.jpg|thumb|left|Satire on cross-dressing, around 1780 Britain]]
Cross-dressers may begin wearing clothing associated with the opposite sex in childhood, using the clothes of a sibling, parent, or friend. Some parents have said they allowed their children to cross-dress and, in many cases, the child stopped when they became older. The same pattern often continues into adulthood, where there may be confrontations with a spouse. Married cross-dressers experience considerable anxiety and guilt if their spouse objects to their behavior. Sometimes cross-dressers have periodically disposed of all their clothing, a practice called "purging", only to start collecting other gender's clothing again.&lt;ref name = "eucwqo"/&gt;

==Analysis==
The historical associations of maleness with power and femaleness with submission and frivolity mean that in the present time a woman dressing in men's clothing and a man dressing in women's clothing evoke very different responses. A woman dressing in men's clothing is considered to be a more acceptable activity.

Advocacy for social change has done much to relax the constrictions of gender roles on men and women, but they are still subject to prejudice from some people.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; It is noticeable that as 'transgender' is becoming more socially accepted as a normal human condition, the prejudices against cross-dressing are changing quite quickly, just as the similar prejudices against homosexuals have changed rapidly in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/chapter-2-social-acceptance/|title=A Survey of LGBT Americans - Chapter 2: Social Acceptance|date=2013-06-13|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason it is so hard to have statistics for female-assigned cross-dressers is that the line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This is one of the many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day [[masculism|masculist]] movement.

The general culture has very mixed views about cross-dressing. A woman who wears her husband's shirt to bed is considered attractive while a man who wears his wife's nightgown to bed may be considered transgressive.  [[Marlene Dietrich]] in a tuxedo was considered very erotic; [[Jack Lemmon]] in a dress was considered ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Blechner, M. J. (2009) ''Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis.''  New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; All this may result from an overall gender role rigidity for males; that is, because of the prevalent gender dynamic throughout the world, men frequently encounter discrimination when deviating from masculine gender norms, particularly violations of [[heteronormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/media/users/lec321/Sirin_Articles/Sirin_McCriery__Mahalik_2004.pdf |title=Differential Reactions to Men and Women's Gender Role Transgressions: Perceptions of Social Status, Sexual Orientation, and Value Dissimilarity |publisher=NYU |format=PDF |accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A man's adoption of feminine clothing is often considered a going down in the gendered social order whereas a woman's adoption of what are traditionally men's clothing (at least in the English-speaking world) has less of an impact because women have been traditionally subordinate to men, unable to affect serious change through style of dress. Thus when a male cross-dresser puts on his clothes, he transforms into the quasi-female and thereby becomes an embodiment of the conflicted gender dynamic. Following the work of [[Judith Butler|Butler]], gender proceeds along through ritualized performances, but in male cross-dressing it becomes a performative "breaking" of the masculine and a "subversive repetition" of the feminine.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalysts today do not regard cross-dressing by itself as a psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life. "For instance," said Dr. Joseph Merlino, senior editor of ''Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius'', "[suppose that]...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't want to keep it confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to my office and I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment."&lt;ref&gt;Shankbone, David. "[[n:Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy#Gender identity and Heteronormativity|Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino]]",  ''[[Wikinews]]'' (October 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[visual novel]] gameplay of the previous games, ''Ultra Despair Girls'' is a third-person adventure game with horror elements, in which players control Komaru Naegi as she tries to survive in a city overrun by Monokuma robots.&lt;ref name="siliconera1"/&gt; Komaru is armed with a megaphone-shaped Hacking Gun that can use various types of Truth Bullet, which are unlocked as the game progresses. Using the Hacking Gun, Komaru can perform various actions, such as attacking enemies, taking control of them, activating certain machinery, or scanning the environment for clues or hidden items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/07/22/danganronpa-another-episodes-megaphone-weapon-kinds-uses/ |title=Danganronpa: Another Episode’s Megaphone Weapon Has All Kinds Of Uses |work=Siliconera |date=2014-07-22 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the game, Komaru is also assisted by the first game's Toko Fukawa, who uses a stun gun to switch over to her split personality, the serial killer Genocide Jack. When the stun gun is charged up, players can temporarily take control of Jack, who can attack with razor sharp scissors. Attacking enemies fills up the "Scissor Fever" gauge, allowing Jack to perform special attacks to instantly defeat multiple enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2013/09/danganronpa-another-episode-stars-komaru-naegi |title=Danganronpa: Another Episode stars Komaru Naegi |work=Gematsu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monocoins earned from defeating enemies can be used to purchase upgrades for both Komaru's Hacking Gun and Jack's scissors, and various skills can be unlocked and equipped, such as extended health. The game features three difficulty settings, with harder difficulties containing less ammunition and fewer opportunities to use Jack's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/21/danganronpa-another-episode-mode-players-just-want-see-story/ |title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has A Mode For Players That Just Want To See The Story |work=Siliconera |accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
{{see also|List of Danganronpa characters#Danganronpa Another Episode|label 1 = List of Danganronpa characters}}
The game takes place half a year after the events of the first game, prior to the events of the second game. Komaru Naegi, the younger sister of the first game's protagonist, Makoto Naegi, has spent the past year locked inside an apartment complex in Towa City, unaware of the events that have gone on in the outside world. She is suddenly forced to flee when she was attacked by deadly Monokuma robots and comes across Future Foundation member Byakuya Togami, who gives Komaru a special Hacking Gun that can fight against the robot and orders her to escape the city. However, Komaru's escape fails and she is captured by a group of elementary-school children known as the Warriors of Hope, who seek to create a utopia for children by murdering all the adults with their robots. They force Komaru to join their "Demon Hunting" game and drop her into the city, where she is saved by Homicidal maniac Genocide Jack, who soon reverts to her true self, Toko Fukawa, a survivor of Hopes Peak High School. Toko can now control Jack through the use of a stun gun. Learning that Byakuya may have been kidnapped by the Warriors of Hope, Toko agrees to team up with Komaru to find Byakuya and escape the city. Along the way they encounter a resistance group, run by Haiji Towa, and meet a white bear robot named Shirokuma.

As Komaru and Toko go on their journey, fighting against the Warriors of Hope and encountering much despair along the way, they learn that the Warriors of Hope are in worship of Junko Enoshima, the Ultimate Despair responsible for bringing about the end of the world, and seek to create a successor. Confronting the group's leader, Monaca Towa, and defeating their advisor Kurokuma, Komaru is given the choice of destroying the Monokuma Controller, which would stop all the robots but at the cost of sacrificing all the children wearing Monokuma Kid masks. Monaca then reveals that her goal is to turn Komaru into the next Junko Enoshima, trying to coerce her into destroying the controller by allegedly revealing her parents were killed. However, Toko, having learned a great deal from travelling with Komaru, slaps some sense into her and together they overcome despair in order to defeat an out-of-control mech. As Monaca is inevitably rescued by Nagito Komaeda, who encourages her to become the next Junko herself, it is revealed that both Shirokuma and Kurokuma were controlled by the real Junko's AI, who has Izuru Kamukura carry out the next part of her plan. Meanwhile, after rescuing Byakuya, Komaru and Toko decide to stay behind in Towa City to help out those who need it.&lt;ref name="siliconera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/23/danganronpa-another-episode-features-characters-first-two-games/ |title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Features More Characters From The First Two Games |work=Siliconera |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2014/06/danganronpa-another-episode-main-characters-introduced |title=Danganronpa: Another Episode's main characters introduced |work=Gematsu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if Komaru chooses to destroy the controller before learning its true purpose, the Bad Ending is triggered and all of the Monokuma Kids are killed as their masks explode. Komaru becomes the hero of the resistance, but she feels extremely guilty for what she has done.

With the two previous entries in the ''Danganronpa'' series being visual novel adventure games, members of [[Spike Chunsoft]] wanted to develop a spin-off game that was more action oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ta|first=Anthony|url=http://www.thegameraccess.com/interviews/vita/danganronpa-another-episode-ultra-despair-girls-interview/|title=Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls Interview|publisher=TheGamerAccess|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=August 7, 2016|time=1:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the proponents for a spin-off game was series writer Kazutaka Kodaka;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/09/danganronpa-another-episode-will-surprise-fans-says-writer/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Will Surprise Fans Says Scenario Writer|publisher=Siliconera|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had wanted to write a story of two characters running away from despair, and he felt that the easiest way to do this was through an action game that necessitated movement.&lt;ref name="PlayStation Blog Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clements|first=Ryan|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/03/11/danganronpa-another-episode-your-questions-answered/|title=Danganronpa Another Episode: Your Questions Answered|publisher=PlayStation Blog|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Spike Chunsoft [[Green-light|green-lit]] the proposal, they let Kodaka have free rein to write the narrative for ''Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls''.&lt;ref name="Kotaku Interivew"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schreier|first=Jason|url=http://kotaku.com/a-brief-q-a-with-the-writer-of-danganronpa-1689628454|title=A Brief Q&amp;A With The Writer Of ''Danganronpa''|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kodaka stated that he spent an equal amount of time writing the dialogue and backstories for the protagonists as he did for the antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=North|first=Dale|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/12/danganronpa-writer-isnt-interested-in-creating-bite-sized-mobile-experiences/2/|title=Danganronpa writer isn’t interested in creating bite-sized mobile experiences|publisher=VentureBeat|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=August 7, 2016|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aspect of ''Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls'' that the development team was worried about was whether the shift in gameplay genres would alienate players who were not good at action games. They decided to add the mechanic of switching between characters, as Genocide Jack would make the game significantly easier.&lt;ref name="Kotaku Interivew"/&gt;

''Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls'' was announced at a [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] press conference in September 2013, where the first gameplay trailer was shown; the trailer also teased the [[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony|third entry in the series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Sal|url=http://gematsu.com/2013/09/danganronpa-another-episode-announced-for-ps-vita|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode announced for PS Vita|work=Gematsu|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then released in Japan on September 25, 2014.&lt;ref name="Japan Date"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/25/danganronpa-another-episode-introduces-rpg-themed-villainous-kids/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Introduces The RPG-Themed Villainous Kids|publisher=Siliconera|date=June 25, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote the game, Spike Chunsoft offered several [[pre-order]] bonuses, including digital [[Wallpaper (computing)|wallpaper]]s, [[mousepad]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Sal|url=http://gematsu.com/2014/08/danganronpa-another-episode-japanese-shop-specific-pre-order-bonuses-announced|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Japanese shop-specific pre-order bonuses announced|publisher=Gematsu|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[smartphone]] stand.&lt;ref name="Japan Date"/&gt; Additional merchandise such as Monokuma [[stuffed toy]]s and an [[armband]] were also offered at [[Comiket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/16/survive-comiket-danganronpa-another-episode-goods/|title=Survive Comiket With These Danganronpa: Another Episode Goods|publisher=Siliconera|date=August 16, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NIS America]] [[video game localization|localized]] and published the international versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/2/19/8073463/danganronpa-another-episode-playstation-vita-us-release|title=Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls coming to Vita in US this fall|publisher=Polygon|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in North America on September 1, 2015, in Europe on September 4, and in Australia on September 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=James|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/09/01/danganronpa-another-episode-ultra-despair-girls-launches-this-week/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls launches this week|publisher=VG247|date=September 1, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIS America offered a limited edition of the game, which included a [[concept art]] book, the game's [[soundtrack]], and other collector's items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Sal|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/05/danganronpa-another-episode-limited-edition-announced|title=Danganronpa Another Episode limited edition announced|publisher=Gematsu|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIS America released the game for [[PlayStation 4]] in North America and Europe in Summer 2017.&lt;ref name="PS4release" /&gt;

The '''dirac''' is a Somali dress worn by women that is long, usually ankle length, loose-fitting and usually has at least two colors. Its popularity began increasing in the 1970s and 1980s, and during those decades the dirac began replacing the [[guntiino]] in terms of popularity among women.&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Dress in Somali Culture - Page 82, Heather Marie Akou - 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It looks similar to the ''[[grand boubou]]'' worn by women in French-speaking West Africa. It is usually worn along with a [[gorgoro]], an undergarment.&lt;ref&gt;The International Politics of Fashion: Being Fab in a Dangerous World, Andreas Behnke - 2016 p 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Pease earned a B.A. (1968) and M.A. (1969) at the [[University of Missouri]] and a Ph.D. in English from the [[University of Chicago]] (1973). He has been on the faculty of Dartmouth College since 1973. He has been a visiting professor or scholar at Indiana University, Wesleyan University, University of Pittsburgh, Oxford University, Freie Universitaet, University at Buffalo, and the University of Rome Tor Vegata.

==New Americanists==
Pease was among the scholars identified by Frederick C. Crews as "The New Americanists" in his 1988 critique of "the now dominant faction" in American Studies published in The New York Review of Books under the title "Whose American Renaissance?" &lt;ref name="newamericanists"&gt;[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1988/10/27/whose-american-renaissance/ 'Whose American Renaissance']&lt;/ref&gt; Pease appropriated this name from Crews to push forward new methods of interpretation and critique within American literary studies and within American Studies. The work of the New Americanists, and Pease in particular, challenged existing paradigms of reading, in particular the liberal consensus that depended upon a separation between culture and the public sphere. Pease's response to Crews appeared in an essay published in 1990 in [[boundary 2]] as "New Americanists: Revisionist Interventions into the Canon." In an interview with Racheal Fest appearing in [[boundary 2]] Pease calls says of the legacy of the New Americanists: "I see the chief legacy of the New Americanists as the ongoing transformation of knowledge production in literature departments across the United States" &lt;ref name="b2interview"&gt;Racheal Fest, "Legacies of the Future: An Interview with Donald E. Pease," boundary 2 (2018) 45 (2): 221-242.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Duke University Press description of Pease's the Americanist Series as dedicated to "the return of sociolpolitical questions, counternational discourses, and minority perspectives to American studies"&lt;ref name="dukenewamericanists"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


==Dr. Seuss==
Pease is a noted scholar of [[Dr._Seuss|Theodor Geisel]] or “Dr. Seuss.” He authored an interpretive biography for Oxford University Press’s “Lives and Legacies” series titled Theodor SEUSS Geisel in 2010. This book places Dr. Seuss in a pantheon of great writers including Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Benjamin Franklin, T.S. Eliot and William Faulkner&lt;ref name="imagetext"&gt;[http://imagetext.english.ufl.edu/archives/v6_1/fitzsimmons/  “Review of Theodor SEUSS Geisel by Donald E. Pease”]&lt;/ref&gt;. Pease provides what he terms a “psychobiography” of Dr. Seuss by interpreting the transformation of Theodor Geisel from “an artist tycoon of Madison Avenue into a world-renowned author of children’s books" &lt;ref name="pmla2011"&gt;Donald E. Pease, “Dr. Seuss in Ted Geisel’s NeverNever Land” PMLA 126.1 (2011), 197 &lt;/ref&gt;. Jenny Williams, writing for [[WIRED]], calls Pease’s book “an academic study of the content, meaning and motivations of Geisel's work" &lt;ref name="wired"&gt;Jenny Williams, "Review: Take a Deeper Look at Theodor SEUSS Geisel," 06/10/10 WIRED Magazine https://www.wired.com/2010/06/theodor-seuss-geisel/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Fellowships and honors==
Pease has held fellowships from the [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Guggenheim]], [[Andrew W. Mellon|Mellon]], [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], and [[Hewlett Foundation|Hewlett]] foundations. He has received two [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] grants to direct programs for college teachers on the subject of nineteenth-century American Literature. Professor Pease serves on the Board of Governors of the Clinton Institute in American Studies and received the Dartmouth College Faculty Award for Service to Alumni Continuing Education in 1999, awarded by Dartmouth's Alumni Council. In 2000 he was a guest lecturer for the Drue Heinz Visiting Professor at Oxford University. Professor Pease has been Distinguished Visiting Professor at the JFK Institute in American Studies at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]; the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], and the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]]. The Faculty of Languages at [[Uppsala University]] ([[Sweden]]) awarded Pease a doctorate ''honoris causa'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="dartmouth"/&gt; In 2012 the American Studies Association (ASA) awarded Pease the Carl Bode-Norman Holmes Pearson Prize for Outstanding Contributions to American Studies. Robyn Wiegman, Professor of Literature and of Women’s Studies at Duke University, writes of Pease's contribution to the field of American Studies: “As one of the most important scholars in American Studies today and a major architect of its extra institutional pedagogies, his contributions to the field are unsurpassed.” &lt;ref name="asa"&gt;[http://www.theasa.net/prizes_and_grants/awards_and_prizes/#bode ASA Awards website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dartmouthnow"&gt;[http://now.dartmouth.edu/2012/11/donald-e-pease-awarded-the-prestigious-bode-pearson-prize-in-american-studies/  Dartmouth Press Release ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118074559/http://now.dartmouth.edu/2012/11/donald-e-pease-awarded-the-prestigious-bode-pearson-prize-in-american-studies/ |date=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Education 2030 Agenda''' refers to the global commitment of the [[Education For All|Education for All]] movement to ensure access to basic education for all.  It is an essential part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration]] and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with [[UNESCO]] and global partners, can translate commitments into action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf|title=Education Transforms Lives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education 2030 Agenda stretches from early childhood learning to youth and adult education and training; Emphasizes the acquisition of skills for work; Underlines the importance of citizenship education; Focuses on inclusion, equity and gender equality; And aims to ensure quality learning outcomes for all, throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the main responsibility for implementing the agenda lies with governments, UNESCO and partners provide support through coordinated policy advice, technical assistance, capacity development and monitoring of progress at global, regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ten targets to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda ==
The 10 targets of [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 4 encompass many different aspects of education. Seven targets are of expected outcomes and three are means of achieving these targets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Edupunk.jpg|thumb|Jim Groom as "poster boy" for edupunk]]
'''Edupunk''' is a [[do it yourself]] (DIY) attitude to teaching and learning practices.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keats"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/16-10/st_jw | title = Jargon Watch: Green Crude, Popcorning, Edupunk | author = Keats, Jonathon | publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] | date = 2008-09-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Kuntz described edupunk as "an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ’70s bands like The Clash to the classroom."&lt;ref name="kuntz"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuntz|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructional applications can be described as DIY education or ''edupunk''.

The term was first used on May 25, 2008, by [[Jim Groom]] in his blog,&lt;ref name="groom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/the-glass-bees/ | title = The Glass Bees | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-25 | accessdate = 2008-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered less than a week later in the [[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]].&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; [[Stephen Downes]], an [[online education]] theorist and an editor for the ''[[International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning]]'', noted that "the concept of edupunk has totally caught wind, spreading through the blogosphere like wildfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44760 | title = Introducing Edupunk | author = [[Stephen Downes]] | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Edupunk has risen from an objection to the efforts of government and [[Corporatism|corporate interests]] in reframing and bundling [[emerging technologies]] into ''[[wikt:cookie-cutter|cookie-cutter]]'' products with pre-defined application—somewhat similar to traditional [[punk ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mortarboard/2008/06/punk_or_more_precisely.html | title = Nevermind the pedagogues, here's edupunk | author = Cohen, David | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2008-06-16 | location=London | date=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to corporate influence on education is only one part of edupunk, though. Stephen Downes has identified three aspects to this approach:
* Reaction against [[commercialization]] of learning
* [[DIY ethic|Do-it-yourself attitude]]
* Thinking and learning for yourself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rowell | first = Laurie | title = "Edupunk" Rocks the (Virtual) House | newspaper = eLearn Magazine  | date = 2008-07-08 | url = http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&amp;article=65-1 | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of edupunk was the [[University of British Columbia]]'s course "[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Murder Madness and Mayhem]]" experiment of creating articles on [[Wikipedia]] in spring 2008, "(having) one’s students as partners and peers."&lt;ref name="mayhem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/murder-madness-mayhem/ | title = Murder, Madness, Mayhem is so EDUPUNK&lt;!--(sic)--&gt; | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video clip illustrating an edupunk approach, produced by Tony Hirst at the Open University in the UK, on 8 June 2008, illustrated how quickly the edupunk concept has been adopted outside North America.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTlescIvW0 | title = Changing Expectations| author = Hirst, A.| publisher = YouTube | date = 2008-06-08 | accessdate = 2008-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A website set up by Australian educators illustrates how edupunk spread,&lt;ref name="ausedupunk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edupunk.com.au | title = edupunk | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827204329/http://www.edupunk.com.au/ | archivedate = 2008-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a presentation by [[Norm Friesen]] of [[Thompson Rivers University]] identifies a number of possible intellectual precursors for the movement.

[[Hampshire College]], [[Evergreen State College]], [[Marlboro College]], [[New College of Florida]], and [[Warren Wilson College]] are collegiate institutions imbued with edupunk ideology.&lt;ref name="Friesenpres"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blip.tv/play/AeuPI4OyJA | title = The Edupunk Heritage: Precursors of Open Learning | author = [[Norm Friesen]] | publisher = Blip.tv | date = 2009-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friesenart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/Open_Education:_Precursors| title = Open Education: Precursors | author = [[Norm Friesen]]| publisher = WikiEducator | date = 2009-02-22 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic Squelch''' is a type of electronic [[Rhythm (music)|beat]] originating from [[Chicago]] in the 1980s and describable as a combination of "squeak" and "oonts", similar to the sound made by disproportionately [[Amplifier|amplifying]] the [[Synthesizer#ADSR envelope|start/"attack"]] and/or [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuating]] the [[Synthesizer#ADSR envelope|"hold" and "release"]] of the sound made by forcefully pushing a flexible object (such as a finger or cleaning cloth) across and against a smooth inflexible surface (such as glass). This type of sound occurs often in [[Rave music|rave]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[techno]], and especially [[house music]].

'''Folk memory''' is a term sometimes used to describe stories, [[folklore]] or [[Mythology|myths]] about past events that have been [[Oral tradition|passed orally]] from generation to generation. The events described by the memories may date back hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years and often have a local significance. They may explain physical features in the local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], provide reasons for [[cultural]] traditions or give [[etymologies]] for the names of local places.

It corresponded somewhat to white men's pictures of elephants. It was of huge size, in build like an elephant, had tusks, and was hairy. These animals were seen not so very long ago, it is said, generally singly, but none have been seen now for several generations. Indians come across their bones occasionally. The narrator said he and some others, a few years ago, came on a shoulder-blade... as wide as a table (about three feet).”  However, the animal in this story was predatory and carnivorous, suggesting the memory of the proboscideans had become conflated with that of other megafauna, such as bears and [[Saber-toothed cat|sabertooths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 534495 | pages = 427–473 [450–451] | last1 = Teit | first1 = J.

Even more so than is ordinary for the study of [[history]], the plausible historical connections listed above could be inaccurate due to the difficulty of piecing together [[prehistoric]] or [[preliterate]] fragments of evidence into a meaningful understanding. They must rely on more [[speculation]] to fill in evidence gaps than would be acceptable in another context that provided more rigorous [[Verification and validation|verifiability]] of the records available.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

'''Gado-gado''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] or [[Betawi language|Betawi]]), also known as '''lotek''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]), is an [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] [[salad]]&lt;ref name="Balidaily"&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Gado-gado’ Ayu Minantri |date=5 December 2013 |author=Luh De Suriyani |url=http://www.thebalidaily.com/2013-12-05/gado-gado-ayu-minantri.html |newspaper=Bali Daily |accessdate=12 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615015458/http://www.thebalidaily.com/2013-12-05/gado-gado-ayu-minantri.html |archivedate=15 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of slightly [[boiled]], [[Blanching (cooking)|blanched]] or [[steamed]] [[vegetable]]s and [[hard-boiled eggs]], boiled potato,  fried [[tofu]] and [[tempeh]], and ''[[lontong]]'' (rice wrapped in a banana leaf), served with a [[peanut sauce]] dressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gado-gado|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gado-gado|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balidaily"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No Money, No Honey: A study of street traders and prostitutes in Jakarta by Alison Murray. Oxford University Press, 1992. Glossary page xii&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''gado-gado'' is promoted as one of 5 [[national dish]]es of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Kompas.com-Makanan-Nasional"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://travel.kompas.com/read/2018/04/10/171000627/kemenpar-tetapkan-5-makanan-nasional-indonesia-ini-daftarnya|title=Kemenpar Tetapkan 5 Makanan Nasional Indonesia, Ini Daftarnya - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-04-18|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''gado'' or the verb ''menggado'' means to consume something without rice. ''Gado-gado'' in Indonesian literally means "mix-mix" since it is made of rich mixture of vegetables such as [[potatoes]], [[string beans|longbeans]], [[bean sprouts]], [[spinach]], [[chayote]], [[bitter gourd]], [[corn]] and [[cabbage]], with [[tofu]], [[tempeh]] and hard-boiled eggs, all mixed in peanut sauce dressing, sometimes also topped with ''[[krupuk]]'' and sprinkles of fried [[shallot]]s. ''Gado-gado'' is different from ''lotek atah'' or ''[[karedok]]'' which uses raw vegetables. Another similar dish is the Javanese ''[[pecel]]''.

==Region==
''Gado-gado'' is widely sold in almost every part of [[Indonesia]], with each area having its own modifications.&lt;ref name="Balidaily"/&gt; It is thought to have originally been a [[Sundanese cuisine|Sundanese]] dish, as it is most prevalent in Western parts of [[Java]] (which includes [[Jakarta]], [[Banten]], and [[West Java]] provinces). The [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese]] have their own slightly similar version of a vegetables-in-peanut-sauce dish called ''[[pecel]]'' which is more prevalent in Central and East Java. ''Gado-gado'' is widely available from hawkers' carts, stalls (''[[warung]]'') and restaurants and hotels in [[Indonesia]]; it is also served in Indonesian-style restaurants worldwide. Though it is customarily called a salad, the peanut sauce is a larger component of ''gado-gado'' than is usual for the dressings in Western-style salads; the vegetables should be well coated with it.

Some eating establishments use different mixtures of peanut sauce, such as adding [[cashew nut]]s for taste. In Jakarta, some eating establishment boast ''gado-gado'' as their signature dish, some of which have been in business for decades and have developed faithful clientele. Gado-Gado Boplo restaurant chain for example has been around since 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Gado-Gado Boplo |url =http://www.boplo.net/profile.html | language = Indonesian |accessdate =12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gado-Gado Bonbin in Cikini has been around since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Enjoying Jakarta through culinary nostalgia | author =Triwik Kurniasari and Maulina Sartika Pravitasari | date =15 August 2008 | url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/15/enjoying-jakarta-through-culinary-nostalgia.html |accessdate =12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to a delicious ''gado-gado'' is the sauce made of fried crushed savory peanuts, sweet palm sugar, garlic, chilies, salt, tamarind and a squeeze of lime.&lt;ref name="Balidaily"/&gt; Gado-gado is generally freshly made, sometimes in front of the customers to suit their personal preference for the degree of spiciness, which corresponds to the amount of [[chili pepper]] included. However, particularly in the West, ''gado-gado'' sauce is often prepared ahead of time and in bulk. ''Gado-gado'' sauce is also available in dried form, which simply needs to be rehydrated by adding hot water.

''Gado-gado'' sauce is not to be confused with [[satay]] sauce, which is also a peanut sauce.

== Ingredients ==

=== Peanut sauce dressing ===
[[Image:Gado-Gado stall.JPG|thumb|right|Gado-gado stall displaying ingredients of the dish.]]
Most of flavours in gado-gado are acquired from the mixture of its ''bumbu kacang'' or peanut salad dressing. Gado-gado perfectly combines a slightly sweet, spicy and savory tastes.&lt;ref name="Balidaily"/&gt; The common primary ingredients of the peanut sauce are as follows:

* ground fried [[peanut]]s ([[kidney bean]]s may be substituted for a richer taste)
* [[coconut sugar]]/[[palm sugar]] (substitute [[brown sugar]] if unavailable)
* [[Chili pepper|chillies]] (according to preference and desired degree of spiciness)
* ''[[terasi]]'' (dried ''shrimp paste'')
* [[salt]]
* [[tamarind]] juice
* [[lime juice]]
* water to dilute

The traditional method of making ''gado-gado'' is to use the ''cobek'' ([[mortar and pestle|pestle]]) and ''ulekan'' or flat rounded stone. The dry ingredients are ground first, then the tamarind liquids is added to achieve the desired consistency.

=== Vegetables ===
[[Image:Gado gado ulek.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Indonesian way of making ''gado-gado''.]]
The composition of the vegetable salad varies greatly, but usually comprises a mixture of some of the following:
* [[blanching (cooking)|blanched]] - shredded, chopped, or sliced green vegetables such as cabbage, [[Ipomoea aquatica|kangkung]], [[spinach]], [[bean sprout]]s, boiled young [[jack fruit]], [[chayote]], [[Green bean|string bean]], [[green bean]], [[bitter melon]], and [[Maize|corn]]. 
* sliced - boiled [[potatoes]]
* uncooked - sliced [[cucumber]]
* peeled and sliced boiled [[egg (food)|egg]]s
* sliced - fried [[tofu]] and [[tempeh]]
Outside Indonesia, it is usual to improvise with whatever vegetables are available.
All the ingredients are blanched or lightly boiled, including vegetables, potatoes and bean sprouts, except for the tempeh and tofu, which is fried, and cucumber which is sliced and served fresh.&lt;ref name="Balidaily"/&gt; The blanched vegetables and other ingredients are mixed well with the peanut sauce.

=== Garnishes and rice===
In Indonesia ''gado-gado'' is commonly served mixed with chopped ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'' (glutinous rice cake), or with [[steamed rice]] served separately.  It is nearly always served with ''[[krupuk]]'' (crackers), e.g. [[tapioca]] crackers or ''[[emping]]'', Indonesian style fried crackers, which are made from ''[[melinjo]]''. A common garnish is ''bawang goreng'' a finely-chopped fried [[shallot]] sprinkles.&lt;ref name="Balidaily"/&gt;

The '''Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering''' ('''GATE''') is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science. GATE is conducted jointly by the [[Indian Institute of Science]] and seven [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Indian Institutes of Technologies]] at [[IIT Roorkee|Roorkee]], [[IIT Delhi|Delhi]], [[IIT Guwahati|Guwahati]], [[IIT Kanpur|Kanpur]], [[IIT Kharagpur|Kharagpur]], [[IIT Madras|Chennai (Madras)]] and [[IIT Bombay|Mumbai (Bombay)]] on behalf of the National Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), [[Government of India]].

The GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to various [[post-graduate education]] programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings (i.e., government-owned companies) for recruiting graduate engineers in entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India. GATE is also recognized by various institutes outside India, such as [[Nanyang Technological University]] in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/graduate/R-Programs/BeforeApplying-Research/Pages/GeneralAdmissionRequirements.aspx|title=General Admission Requirements|website=admissions.ntu.edu.sg|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial assistance in post-graduate programs==

A valid GATE score is essential for obtaining financial assistance during Master’s programs and direct Doctoral programs in Engineering / Technology / Architecture and Doctoral programs in relevant branches of Science in Institutes supported by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development|Ministry of Human Resources Development]] (MHRD) or other Government agencies. As per the directives of MHRD, the following procedure is to be adopted for admission to the post-graduate programs (Master’s and Doctoral) with MHRD scholarship/assistant-ship: Depending upon the norms adopted by a specific institute or department of the Institute, a candidate may be admitted directly into a course based on his/her performance in GATE only or based on his/her performance in GATE and an admission test / interview conducted by the department to which he/she has applied and/or the candidate’s academic record. If the candidate is to be selected through test/interview for post-graduate programs, the minimum of 70% weight is given to the performance in GATE and the remaining 30% weight can be given to the candidate’s performance in test/interview and/or academic record. The admitting institutes can, however, prescribe a minimum passing percentage of marks in the test/interview. Some colleges/institutes specify GATE qualification as the mandatory requirement even for admission without MHRD scholarship/assistant-ship.

To avail the financial assistance (scholarship), the candidate must first secure admission to a program in these Institutes, by a procedure that could vary from institute to institute. Qualification in GATE is also a minimum requirement to apply for various fellowships awarded by many Government organizations. The criteria for postgraduate admission with scholarship/assistant-ship could be different for different institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In December 2014, the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] and MHRD announced that the scholarship for GATE-qualified master's degree students is increased by 55%, from {{INRConvert|8000}} per month to {{INRConvert|12400}} per month.&lt;ref name="The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/UGC-hikes-basic-fellowship-amount-scholarships/articleshow/45349034.cms | title=UGC hikes basic fellowship amount, scholarships. | work=The Times of India | date=2 December 2014 | accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India Today"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/ugc-raised-the-scholarship-amount-for-gate-qualified-students/1/404921.html | title=UGC raises scholarship amount for GATE qualified students. | work=India Today | date=3 December 2014 | accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duration and examination type ===

The examination is of 3 hours duration, and contains a total of 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs (four answer options out of which the correct one has to be chosen) and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse).Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== Syllabi ===

* Verbal Ability: English grammar, sentence completion, verbal analogies, word groups, instructions, critical reasoning and verbal deduction.
* Numerical Ability: Numerical computation, numerical estimation, numerical reasoning and data interpretation.
*Engineering Mathematics (not for all Papers)
*Technical Ability: Technical questions related to the Paper chosen

=== Questions and marking scheme ===
The examination will consist of totally 65 questions, segregated as One-mark and Two-mark questions. Out of 65 questions, 10 questions will be from General Aptitude (Verbal and Numerical ability) and 55 questions will be Technical, based on the Paper chosen. The General Aptitude section will have 5 One-mark questions and 5 Two-mark questions, accounting for about 15% of total marks. The Technical section and Engineering Mathematics section will combinedly have 25 One-mark questions and 30 Two-mark questions, accounting for about 85% of total marks. Further, all the sections will have both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs. The examination awards negative marks for wrong MCQ answers. Usually, 1/3rd of original marks will be deducted for wrong MCQ answers (i.e -0.33 for wrong One-mark answers and -0.66 for wrong Two-mark answers) while there is no negative marks for NATs.

==Result and test score==

GATE results are usually declared about one month after the examinations are over. The results show the total marks scored by a candidate, the GATE score, the all-India rank (AIR) and the cut off marks for various categories in the candidate's paper. The score is valid for 3 years from the date of announcement of the GATE results. The score cards are issued only to qualified candidates.

===Normalized GATE Score (new procedure)===

'''''Calculation of "normalized marks" for subjects held in multiple sessions (CE, CS, EC, EE and ME):'''''

[[File:Actual vs. Normalized Marks in GATE.png|thumb|400 px|'''Graph showing the linear relationship between "actual marks" and "normalized marks" of a candidate, in a multiple-session subject (CE, EE, ME, EE or CE) of GATE.''' &lt;br/&gt; {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = average marks of top 0.1 % candidates in all sessions of that subject. &lt;br/&gt; ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; = mean + standard deviation, of marks of all candidates in all sessions of that subject. &lt;br/&gt; {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''ti''&lt;/sub&gt; = average marks of top 0.1 % candidates in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; session of that subject. &lt;br/&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''iq''&lt;/sub&gt; = mean + standard deviation, of marks of all candidates in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; session of that subject.]]

From 2014 onward, examination for CE, CS, EC, ME and EE subjects is being held in multiple sessions. Hence, for these subjects, a suitable normalization is applied to take into account any variation in the difficulty levels of the question sets across different sessions. The normalization is done based on the fundamental assumption that ''"in all multi-session GATE papers, the distribution of abilities of candidates is the same across all the sessions"''. According to the GATE committee, this assumption is justified since "the number of candidates appearing in multi-session subjects in GATE 2014 is large and the procedure of allocation of session to candidates is random. Further it is also ensured that for the same multi-session subject, the number of candidates allotted in each session is of the same order of magnitude."

Based on the above, and considering various normalization methods, the committee arrived at the following formula for calculating the normalized marks, for CE, CS, EC, EE and ME subjects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gate.iitk.ac.in/GATE2015 | title=GATE 2015 - Post Exam - GATE 2015 Score Card | publisher=GATE Office, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur | accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalized mark ({{overset|︿|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; candidate in ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; session, is given by &lt;br&gt;
{{overset|︿|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac | {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; | {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''ti''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''iq''&lt;/sub&gt; }} ( ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''iq''&lt;/sub&gt; ) + ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br&gt; where,
: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual marks obtained by the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; candidate in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; session,
: {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the average marks of the top 0.1 % candidates in all sessions of that subject,
: ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of mean and standard deviation of marks of all candidates in all sessions of that subject,
: {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''ti''&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of marks of top 0.1 % candidates in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; session of that subject,
: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''iq''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of mean and standard deviation of marks of all candidates in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; session of that subject.

After evaluation of the answers, normalized marks based on the above formula will be calculated using the raw (actual) marks obtained by a candidate in the CE, CS, EC, EE or ME subject. The "score" will be calculated using these normalized marks. For all other subjects (whose tests are conducted in a single session), the actual marks obtained by the candidates will be used in calculating the score.

'''''Calculation of GATE Score for all subjects (single-session and multiple-session):'''''

[[File:GATE score graph.png|500 px|thumb|'''Graph showing the linear relationship between marks and score in GATE.''' &lt;br&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; = Qualifying marks for general category candidates. &lt;br&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = Average marks of top 0.1 % candidates (for subjects with 10000 or more appeared candidates) or top 10 candidates (for subjects with less than 10000 appeared candidates). &lt;br&gt; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; = 350. &lt;br&gt; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = 900. &lt;br&gt; ''Note: In case of multiple-session subjects (EC, CS, ME, EE and CE), "marks" considered are the "normalized marks".'']]

From GATE 2014 onward (and year 2014-15 of the 2-year validity period of GATE 2013 score), a candidate's GATE score is computed by the following new formula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appsgate.iitg.ac.in/ GATE Score]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; S = S_q + (S_t - S_q) \frac {M - M_q}{\overline{M}_t - M_q} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
where,
: ''S'' = Score (normalized) of a candidate,
: ''M'' = Marks obtained by a candidate ("normalized marks" in case of multiple-session subjects CE, CS, EC, EE and ME),
: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; = Qualifying marks for general category candidates in that subject (usually 25 or μ + σ, whichever is higher),
:: μ = Average (i.e. arithmetic mean) of marks of all candidates in that subject,
:: σ = Standard deviation of marks of all candidates in that subject,
: {{overline | ''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = Average marks of top 0.1 % candidates (for subjects with 10000 or more appeared candidates) or top 10 candidates (for subjects with less than 10000 appeared candidates),
: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = 900 = Score assigned to {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,
: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; = 350 = Score assigned to ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:GATE 2015 - ME - scorecard (identity blurred).jpg|thumb|400 px|A scorecard in the Mechanical Engineering test of GATE 2015. (The candidate's photograph, signature, name, registration number, and QR code are blurred.)]]
'''''Percentile:'''''

A candidate's percentile denotes the percentage of candidates scoring lower than that particular candidate. It is calculated as:

''Percentile'' = ( 1 - {{sfrac | ''All India rank'' | ''No. of candidates in that subject''}} ) x 100%

===Old formula===

Till GATE 2012 (and year 2013-14 of the 2-year validity period of GATE 2013 score), the score was calculated using the formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gate.iitb.ac.in/gate2013/gate-score-formula-2012/|title=GATE Score Formula 2012|website=iitb.ac.in|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GATE score = &lt;math&gt;10 (a_g + s_g\frac{m-a}{S})&lt;/math&gt;

where,
: ''m'' = Marks obtained by the candidate,
: ''a'' = Average of marks of all candidates who appeared in that subject, in that year, with marks less than zero converted to zero,
: ''S'' = Standard deviation of marks of all candidates who appeared in that subject, in that year, with marks less than zero converted to zero,
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; = Global average of marks of all candidates who appeared across all subjects in current and past 5 years (i.e. 2010 to 2013 for GATE 2013), with marks less than zero converted to zero,
: ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; = Global standard deviation of marks of all candidates who appeared across all subjects in current and past 5 years (i.e. 2010 to 2013 for GATE 2013), with marks less than zero converted to zero.

==Qualifying marks==

The rules for qualifying marks have varied from year to year. The qualifying marks (out of 100) are different for different subjects as well as categories.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Category !! Qualifying mark (out of 100)
|-
| [[Forward caste|General (GN)]] || 25 or μ + σ, whichever is higher.
|-
| [[Other Backward Class|Other backward classes (OBC)]] || 90% of general category's qualifying mark.
|-
| [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST)]] || 2/3 (i.e., 66.67%) of general category's qualifying mark.
|}

Here μ is the average (i.e., arithmetic mean) of marks of all candidates in the subject (with negative marks converted to zero) and σ is the standard deviation of all marks in that subject.

Usually, the general category's qualifying mark is in the 25 to 50 range.

The Government of India implemented reservations for other backward classes in college admissions and public sector job recruitment in the year 2008. Before that, all [[Other Backward Class|OBC]] candidates were included in the "general" category. There was no separate OBC category then.

A total of 1,200,728 candidates registered for GATE 2013 and 984,855 candidates (82.02%) appeared for the exam, of which 136,699 (13.88%) qualified in GATE 2013.&lt;ref name="gate.iitb.ac.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gate.iitb.ac.in/gate2013/gate-2013-result-statistics/|title=GATE 2013 Result Statistics|website=iitb.ac.in|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-hour test was conducted on two days over four sessions in total. The computer based online exam for 2,02,223 candidates in fifteen papers was conducted in 572 centers spread over 123 cities and towns across the country on 20 January 2013. The offline exam for 9,98,505 candidates in the remaining six papers was conducted in 992 centers spread over 183 cities and towns across the country on 10 February 2013.&lt;ref name="gate.iitb.ac.in"/&gt;

A larger fraction of the registered men appeared (88%) for the exam than women candidates (72%). Nearly 81% of the total number of candidates who appeared for GATE 2013 were from four papers: Electronics and Communication Engineering (2,56,135), Computer Science and Information Technology (2,24,160), Mechanical Engineering (1,65,814) and Electrical Engineering (1,52,381).&lt;ref name="gate.iitb.ac.in"/&gt;

Women formed 20.9% of the total qualified candidates. As per the candidate supplied category (General, OBC-NC, SC, and ST) information, among the qualified candidates, 72,125 belong to General, 41,237 to OBC-NC, 18,936 to SC, and 4,401 to ST category. Physically challenged candidates comprised a total of 1,136 among the qualified in various categories.&lt;ref name="gate.iitb.ac.in"/&gt;

The top five States that had qualified candidates as their permanent residence were Andhra Pradesh (22,476), Uttar Pradesh (22,400), Maharashtra (9,951), Bihar (9,820), and Kerala (8,992).&lt;ref name="gate.iitb.ac.in"/&gt;

The city of New Delhi has the maximum number of qualified candidates who had mentioned it as their correspondence address. "Correspondence address City" has a slightly different bearing compared to the "Permanent State".  While the Permanent Residence State often relates to the "Native" State or State where their Parents/Guardians live, the Correspondence City is mostly related to the current residence, which is more likely to be the place of study or employment.&lt;ref name="gate.iitb.ac.in"/&gt;

==Difficulty level ==

GATE, for long, has been known to test the Engineering basics in a smart way. Complaints of "lengthy" problems have been rare. But the task of mastering an entire course of Engineering (around 30 undergraduate subjects) for a three-hour test, itself gives the test a certain level of toughness. Each year, only around 15% of all appearing candidates qualify. High percentiles (more than 99th percentile, in some cases) are required to get admission in M.Tech. or M.E. degree programs in [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] and [[Indian Institute of Science]], or get shortlisted for job interviews in Indian public sector undertakings.

==Admission to post-graduate programs==

Unlike undergraduate admissions in India, candidates must apply individually to each institute after the institute has published its M.Tech. notification (usually in the month of March). There is no separate counselling held.

Some institutions specify GATE qualification as mandatory even for admission of self-financing students to postgraduate programs. GATE qualified candidates are also eligible for the award of [[Research fellow|Junior Research Fellowship]] in [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] Laboratories and CSIR sponsored projects. Top rank holders in some GATE papers are entitled to apply for "Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Fellowship" awarded by CSIR.
Some government organizations prescribe GATE qualification as a requirement for applying to the post of a Scientist/Engineer.

In recent years, various academicians have recognized GATE as being one of the toughest exams in its category. Some non-Indian universities like the [[National University of Singapore]], [[Nanyang Technological University]] in [[Singapore]] and some technical universities in [[Germany]] also identify GATE score as a parameter for judging the quality of the candidates for admission into their Masters and Ph.D. programs.

Some management institutes like NITIE, Mumbai offer admission to Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering on the basis of GATE score.

Most Indian institutes do not specify cut-off marks for previous years. So there is a general confusion in terms of selecting institutes and specializations. But in the recent years [[IIT Kharagpur]] and [[IIT Guwahati]] have been specifying last year cut-off mark list. [[Indian Institute of Technology Delhi]] has a very detailed website on [http://www.iitd.ac.in/programs/master/index.html Post Graduate (PG)] activities and admissions where students can find the relevant information on cut-off marks etc. Typically the [[Indian Institute of Science]] and [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] are the most selective followed by [[National Institutes of Technology]] and others. Also there are some state universities in India, whose standards and facilities are very much comparable to top [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]]s and [[National Institutes of Technology|NIT]]s. Some of them are [[PEC University of Technology]] ([[Chandigarh]]), [[Bengal Engineering and Science University]] (recently converted to [[IIEST]]), [[Jadavpur University]], [[Delhi Technological University]], [[gautam budh technical university, u.p]], Cochin University of Science and Technology ([[CUSAT]]), [[Andhra University College of Engineering]], [[Osmania University]] etc. Even within the top institutes, the selection criteria varies widely across departments and programs depending on expertise areas. The Directorate of Technical Education of [[Maharashtra]] state has also started conducting CAP round from the year 2013 for GATE and non-GATE candidates in all institutes in Maharashtra that offer M.E./M.Tech. programs.

===CSIR's JRF - GATE fellowship===

The [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) introduced the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) - GATE scheme in 2002 to allow GATE-qualified engineering graduates and [[Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test|GPAT]]-qualified pharmaceutical graduates to pursue research through suitable Ph.D. programs at CSIR laboratories.&lt;ref name="csirhrdg.res.in"&gt;[http://www.csirhrdg.res.in/jrfgate.pdf GATE Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stipend and tenure:'''

The fellowship amount is {{INRConvert|25000}} per month plus HRA (house rent allowance). In addition, contingency grant of {{INRConvert|20000}} per annum (calculated on pro-rata basis for fraction of a year) is also provided. On completion of 2 years as JRF - GATE, the fellowship may be upgraded to SRF (Senior Research Fellowship) - GATE and stipend may be increased to {{INRConvert|28000}} per month in the subsequent years, on the basis of assessment of CSIR JRF-NET guidelines.

The total duration of the fellowship is 5 years, within which the candidate is expected to complete the Ph.D. degree.&lt;ref name="csirhrdg.res.in"/&gt;

==Recruitment==

[[Public sector undertakings in India|Public sector undertakings]] (PSUs) in India, for long, have had troubles conducting their recruitment processes with more than 100,000 students taking the exams for less than 1000 jobs (a selection rate of less than 1%). After sensing the exponential rise in the number of engineering graduates in India who wish to get a PSU job, the PSUs have decided that a GATE score shall be the primary criteria for initial shortlisting. This change was the primary cause for the rapid increase in applicants for GATE 2012.

[[Indian Oil Corporation]] was the first PSU which successfully tested out this system and was followed two years later by [[National Thermal Power Corporation]], [[Bharat Heavy Electricals]], [[Bharat Electronics]] &amp; [[PowerGrid Corporation of India]].

Usually these companies release their recruitment notifications right after GATE notification, indicating that candidates have to take GATE to be considered for a job in their organizations.

===List of companies===

Many companies have signed [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandums of Understanding]] (MoUs) with the GATE organizing committee, for using GATE score as a screening tool for recruiting engineers at entry level positions.

==Year and Organizing Institute==

Each year's GATE is organised by any one of 8 institutes: [[Indian Institute of Science|IISc]] and 7 [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]]. The overall co-ordination and responsibility of conducting GATE lies with this institute, which is designated as the Organizing Institute (OI) for GATE of that year. GATE coaching [[institutes]] often make speculations regarding the topics to focus upon depending upon the institute that is the OI of that year.{{citation needed | date = June 2015}}

{{About|the historic type of domestic servant|other uses|The Handmaid (disambiguation){{!}}The Handmaid}}
[[File:John Collier - Pharaohs Handmaidens.jpg|thumb|''The Pharaoh's Handmaidens'' by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]]]]

A '''handmaiden''', '''handmaid''' or '''maidservant''' is a personal [[maid]] or female servant.&lt;ref&gt;It is also used metaphorically for something whose primary role is to serve or assist.{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/handmaiden |title=Handmaiden - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on culture or historical period, a handmaiden may be of slave status or may be simply an employee. However, the term ''handmaiden'' explicitly implies lowly status.

==Depictions in Abrahamic texts==
[[Image:Bartolomé Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|thumb|''The Annunciation'' by [[Bartolomé Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]], 1655–1660, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the term handmaid is applied to a female servant who serves her mistress, as in the case of [[Hagar]] being described as [[Sarah|Sarai's]] handmaid,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|16:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zilpah]] being [[Leah|Leah's]] handmaid&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bilhah]] as [[Rachel|Rachel's]] handmaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:3-4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/2017/04/151796/handmaids-tale-meaning-rachel-bilhah-bible-story|title=This Biblical Story Is At The Heart Of "The Handmaid's Tale"|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases, the mistress "gave" their handmaid to their husbands "to wife", to bear his "seed" (children). The use in the Torah of the prefix "to", as in "gave to wife", may indicate that the wife is a [[concubine]] or inferior wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vadimcherny.org/judaism/women_similar_wives.htm Women, similar to wives] from vadimcherny.org&lt;/ref&gt; The text repeats that these people remain handmaids of their mistress though they are also the concubine of the mistress's husband. They are referred to interchangeably by the Hebrew terms {{Script/Hebrew|אָמָה}} (''’āmāh'') and {{Script/Hebrew|שִׁפְחָה}} (''šip̄ḥāh'').

==Mary==
In [[Christianity]], [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]] is referred to as the "handmaid of the Lord" or "servant of the Lord",&lt;ref name="Closs2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Closs|first=Michael P.|title=The Book of Mary: A Commentary on the Protevangelium of James|date=29 June 2016|publisher=FriesenPress|language=English |isbn=9781460284872|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are titles of honour for the mother of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Press2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Press|first=Liturgical|title=Collection of Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary|year=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|language=English|isbn=9780814634868|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Gospel of Luke]] describes Mary as the "handmaid of the Lord" (Greek δούλη, ''doulē'') when she gives her consent to the message of the Angel (cf. {{Bibleverse|Luke|1:38|KJV}}), and when she proclaims the greatness of the Lord because of "the great things" he has worked in her (cf. {{Bibleverse|Luke|1:49|KJV}})."&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

'''Hiri''' is the name for the traditional [[trade]] voyages that formed an important part of the culture of the [[Motuan people|Motu people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Origins==

The Motu live in a comparative [[rain shadow]] – the [[dry season]] is unusually harsh, and there are not enough suitable areas for the growing of [[sago]] (''rabia''). On the other hand, the Motu, unlike most people of Papua New Guinea, were skilled in the art of making [[pottery|clay]] cooking pots (''uro'').

The traditional Hiri voyages carried the much-prized Motu cooking pots to the people of the [[Gulf of Papua]], and brought back plentiful supplies of sago for the Motu.

==Legend==

Edai Siabo, from the village of Boera, was returning from a fishing trip when a great eel appeared and dragged him under the water. The eel was really the spirit of the sea. He returned Edai to the surface of the sea, after instructing him to build a great lagatoi ([[canoe sailing|sailing canoe]]), to fill it with cooking pots, and to sail westward, following the south-east [[trade wind]] called the ''laurabada'' in the Motu language. Obeying the spirit, he built the first hiri lagatoi, named it ''Bogebada'' (which means sea-eagle), and had it loaded with pots made by his wife. He and his friends then sailed up the coast into the waters of the Gulf of Papua.

For months, the Bogebada and its crew were away. The villagers were all convinced the crew had perished. They mocked Edai’s wife, and tried to force her to remarry. Before Edai left, he had instructed her to stay within a corner of her house, not to bathe in the sea, to keep a tally of the days the Bogebada had been gone, to keep her fire burning, and to have her skin tattooed by an old woman. Failing to stick to this routine would endanger the expedition and the lives of Edai and his men.

One day, a lagatoi appeared on the horizon and slowly approached the village. It was Bogebada. Edai was arriving back home, a hero. His wife jumped into the sea and washed away her accumulated dirt, put on her finest costume, walked out onto the verandah of the house, hit it with a stick, shouted, ‘Hedihoroha Bogebada!’ and began dancing in joy.

==The Hiri voyages==

Every year Motu men prepared lagatois (large, multi-hulled sailing canoes) for the hiri, while the women shaped and fired the uro (pots). When the laurabada (south-east trade winds) started to blow, the canoes set off to the west.

The outward voyage was usually comparatively short and uneventful, typically only a week or so. The destination was almost always a village in the Gulf where the crew of the lagatoi were known from previous voyages, and the trade itself was quickly made. A simplified form of the Motu language (nowadays called [[Hiri Motu]]) was used for communication between the traders. The voyagers could not return immediately, however. For a start they had to wait for the change of the season, and the onset of the lahara, the [[monsoon]] wind from the north-west that would carry them home. Secondly, their canoes had to be enlarged and re-built to carry the much more bulky cargo of sago.

After two or three months, the homeward voyage began. This was far more dangerous than the outgoing voyage, as the lahara season produces heavy seas and the risk of severe storms. The lagatoi themselves were burdened by a far heavier cargo, not to mention extra hulls, that enabled more sago to be carried, but did little for the seaworthiness or handiness of the canoes. It was an anxious time for the wives of the lagatoi crews as they faithfully followed the ritual started by Edai’s wife to ensure a safe return.

When the lagatoi canoes did return safely, it was a time for great rejoicing (moale).

==Twentieth century and later==

The Hiri voyages continued, interrupted only by the Second World War, until the late fifties, when a heavily laden and storm-damaged lagatoi foundered off Boera village on its return voyage with heavy loss of life. Further voyages were forbidden by the colonial authorities.

With independence, and the need of Papua New Guineans to preserve and celebrate their culture, the Hiri Moale Festival was started. The festival coincides with the national independence day celebrations, and features traditional dances, the Hiri Queen contest (a beauty pageant), the arrival of the lagatoi, canoe racing, musical presentations, and an arts and crafts exhibition.

In recent years, there has been some controversy about Hiri Moale being held in Port Moresby, rather than at nearby Boera, traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Edai Siabo.

==Origins==
Welsh evolved from [[British language (Celtic)|British]], the [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken by the ancient [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]. Alternatively classified as [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] or [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic|P-Celtic]], it probably arrived in [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[Bronze Age]] or [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the [[Firth of Forth]].&lt;ref name="KochBritons"&gt;Koch, pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Early Middle Ages]] the British language began to fragment due to increased dialect differentiation, evolving into Welsh and the other [[Brythonic languages]] ([[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and the extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]). It is not clear when Welsh became distinct.&lt;ref name=Koch1757&gt;Koch, p.&amp;nbsp;1757.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth H. Jackson]] suggested that the evolution in syllabic structure and sound pattern was complete by around 550, and labeled the period between then and about 800 "Primitive Welsh".&lt;ref name=Koch1757 /&gt; This Primitive Welsh may have been spoken in both Wales and the [[Hen Ogledd]] ("Old North"), the Brythonic-speaking areas of what is now [[northern England]] and southern [[Scotland]], and therefore been the ancestor of [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] as well as Welsh. Jackson, however, believed that the two varieties were already distinct by that time.&lt;ref name=Koch1757/&gt; The earliest Welsh poetry – that attributed to the ''[[Cynfeirdd]]'' or "Early Poets" – is generally considered to date to the Primitive Welsh period. However, much of this poetry was supposedly composed in the Hen Ogledd, raising further questions about the dating of the material and language in which it was originally composed.&lt;ref name=Koch1757/&gt;

==Old Welsh==
{{main|Old Welsh}}
The next main period, somewhat better attested, is [[Old Welsh]] ({{lang|cy|Hen Gymraeg}}, 9th to 11th centuries); [[poetry]] from both Wales and [[Scotland]] has been preserved in this form of the language.  As [[Anglo-Saxons|Germanic]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] colonisation of Great Britain proceeded, the Brythonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England, speaking [[Cumbrian language|Cumbric]], and those in the south-west, speaking what would become [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and so the languages diverged. The [[Book of Aneirin|Book]] of [[Aneirin]] (''Canu Aneirin'', c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;600) and the [[Book of Taliesin|Poetry, or Book]], of [[Taliesin]] (''Canu Taliesin'') belong to this era, though both also include some poems originally written in Primitive Welsh.

==Middle Welsh==
{{main|Middle Welsh}}
[[Middle Welsh]] ({{lang|cy|Cymraeg Canol}}) is the label attached to the Welsh of the 12th to 14th centuries, of which much more remains than for any earlier period. This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of the existing [[Welsh law]] manuscripts.  Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible, albeit with some work, to a modern-day Welsh speaker.

The famous cleric [[Gerald of Wales]] tells a story of King [[Henry II of England]]. During one of the King's many raids in the 12th century, Henry asked an old man of [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire]], whether he thought the Welsh language had any chance:

:My Lord king, this nation may now be harassed, weakened and decimated by your soldiery, as it has so often been by others in former times; but it will never be totally destroyed by the wrath of man, unless at the same time it is punished by the wrath of God. Whatever else may come to pass, I do not think that on the Day of Direst Judgement any race other than the Welsh, or any other language, will give answer to the Supreme Judge of all for this small corner of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pencader.org.uk/history/old-man-pencader/ Pencader].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Welsh==

===Early Modern Welsh===
Modern Welsh can be divided into two periods. The first, ''Early Modern Welsh'' ran from the early 15th century to roughly the end of the 16th century.

===Late Modern Welsh===
''Late Modern Welsh'' began with the publication of [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]]'s [[Welsh Bible|translation of the Bible]] in 1588. Like its English counterpart, the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]], this proved to have a strong stabilizing effect on the language, and indeed the language today still bears the same ''Late Modern'' label as Morgan's language. Of course, many changes have occurred since then.

===19th century===
The 19th century was a critical period in the history of the Welsh language and one that encompassed many contradictions. In 1800 Welsh was the main spoken language of the vast majority of Wales, with the only exceptions being some border areas and other places which had seen significant settlement, such as south [[Pembrokeshire]]; by the 1901 census this proportion had declined to a little over half of the population, though the large increase in the total population over the century (due to the effects of [[industrialisation]] and in-migration) meant that the total number of Welsh speakers grew throughout the 19th century, peaking in the 1911 census at over one million even as the proportion of the Welsh population that could speak Welsh fell below 50% for the first time&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Aitchison and H. Carter. Language, Economy and Society. The changing fortunes of the Welsh Language in the Twentieth Century. Cardiff. University of Wales Press. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Especially when compared to other stateless languages in Europe, the language boasted an extraordinarily active press, with poetry, religious writing, biography, translations, and, by the end of the century, [[novels]] all appearing in the language, as well as countless newspapers, journals and periodicals. An ongoing interest in antiquarianism ensured the dissemination of the language's medieval poetry and prose (such as the [[Mabinogion]]). A further development was the publication of some of the first complete and concise Welsh [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Early work by Welsh [[lexicography|lexicographic]] pioneers such as [[Daniel Silvan Evans]] ensured that the language was documented as accurately as possible. Modern dictionaries such as the {{lang|cy|[[Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru]]}} (the [[University of Wales]] Dictionary), are direct descendants of these dictionaries.

Despite these outward signs of health, it was during the nineteenth century that English replaced Welsh as the most widely spoken language within the country. Wales, particularly the [[South Wales Coalfield]], experienced significant population growth and in-migration (primarily from England and Ireland) which changed the linguistic profile of some areas (though other areas would remain Welsh-speaking despite the changes). 

Welsh held no official recognition and had limited status under the British state. Learning English was enthusiastically encouraged, in contrast, Welsh was not taught or used as a medium of instruction in schools, many of which actively discouraged the use of Welsh using measures such as the [[Welsh Not]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. Welsh was increasingly restricted in scope to the non-conformist religious chapels, who would teach children to read and write in Sunday schools. Individuals such as [[Matthew Arnold]] championed the virtues of [[Welsh literature]] whilst simultaneously advocating the replacement of Welsh as the everyday language of the country with English, and many Welsh-speakers themselves such as [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] and [[John Ceiriog Hughes]] advocated bilingualism, if not necessarily the extinction of Welsh.

By the end of the nineteenth century English came to prevail in the large cities of South East Wales. Welsh remained strong in the north west and in parts of mid Wales and south-west Wales. Rural Wales was a stronghold of the Welsh language - and so also were the industrial slate-quarrying communities of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire.&lt;ref&gt;See: R. Merfyn Jones, ''The North Wales Quarrymen, 1874-1922''. Bethesda and Dinorwig were the largest slate quarries in the world and the largest industrial concerns in North Wales. Welsh was the working language of the quarries and of the North Wales Quarry Workers' Union. It was also the language of the quarry communities. Many of the leading Welsh literary figures of the late 19th and 20thC had their roots in these quarrying communities - e.g. [[T. H. Parry-Williams]]; [[R. Williams Parry]]; [[Thomas Parry (author)]]; [[William John Gruffydd]]; [[Silyn Roberts]]; [[Ifor Williams]] - as did a number of leading Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, including [[Cledwyn Hughes, Baron Cledwyn of Penrhos]] and [[Goronwy Roberts, Baron Goronwy-Roberts]]. Even in the industrial south east, the continuing strength of the Welsh language led the Independent Labour Party in 1911 to include Welsh language pages in the [[Merthyr Pioneer]] - edited at [[Keir Hardie]]'s request by [[Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[non-conformist]] churches throughout Wales were strongly associated with the Welsh language.

===20th century===
By the 20th century, the numbers of Welsh speakers were shrinking at a rate which suggested that the language would be extinct within a few generations.

According to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of those aged three years and upwards in Wales and Monmouthshire spoke Welsh (8.5% monoglot Welsh speakers, 35% bilingual in English and Welsh). This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 49.9% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million (15.1% monoglot, 34.8% bilingual).  The distribution of those speaking the language however was unevenly distributed with five counties remaining overwhelmingly and predominantly Welsh speaking: 
*[[Anglesey]]: 88.7% spoke Welsh while 61.0% spoke English 
*[[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]]: 89.6% spoke Welsh while 64.1% could speak English
*[[Caernarfonshire]]: 85.6% spoke Welsh while 62.2% could speak English
*[[Carmarthenshire]]: 84.9% spoke Welsh while 77.8% could speak English
*[[Merionethshire]]: 90.3% spoke Welsh while 61.3% could speak English
Outside these five counties, a further two areas were noted as having a majority who spoke Welsh, those being:
*[[Denbighshire]]: 56.7% could speak Welsh while 88.3% could speak English
*[[Merthyr Tydfil|Merthyr Tydfil Country Borough]] 50.2% while 94.8% could speak English

====1921 Census and the founding of Plaid Cymru====
The 1921 census recorded that of the population of Wales (including Monmouthshire,) 38.7% of the population could speak Welsh while 6.6% of the overall population were Welsh monoglots.  In the five predominantly Welsh speaking counties, Welsh was spoken by more than 75% of the population, and was more widely understood than English: 
*Anglesey: 87.8% could speak Welsh while 67.9% could speak English 
*Cardiganshire: 86.8 could speak Welsh, 72.4% could speak English
*Carmarthenshire: 84.5% could speak Welsh while 83.1% could speak English
*Merioneth: 84.3% could speak Welsh while 69.5% could speak English
*Carnarvonshire: 76.5% could speak Welsh while 73.3% could speak English

Denbighshire was the only other county where a majority could still speak Welsh, here, 51.0% could speak Welsh and 94.0% could speak English.  As for larger urban areas, Aberdare was the only one where a majority could still speak Welsh, here 59.0% could speak Welsh while 95.4% could speak English.  In Cardiff, Wales' capital, 5.2% of people could speak Welsh, while 99.7% of people could speak English.  
At a district level, Llanfyrnach rural district in Pembrokeshire had the highest percentage of Welsh speakers; at 97.5%, while Penllyn rural district in Merioneth had the highest percentage of Welsh monoglots; at 57.3%.  Bethesda urban district in Carnarvonshire was the most Welsh speaking urban district in Wales; 96.6% of the district's population could speak Welsh.&lt;ref name="Vision of Britain|1921 Census"&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/SRC_P/11/EW1921GEN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plaid Cymru, The Party of Wales was founded at a 1925 [[National Eisteddfod]] meeting, held in [[Pwllheli]], [[Gwynedd]] with the primary aim of promoting the Welsh language.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1994, 547&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Tân yn Llŷn'' 1936====
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:490px-Lewis Valentine 1936.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Lewis Valentine]] in 1936 in ''Coelcerth Rhyddid'']] --&gt;

Concern for the Welsh language was ignited in 1936 when the UK government decided to build an [[RAF]] training camp and aerodrome at [[Penyberth]] on the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] in [[Gwynedd]]. The events surrounding the protest became known as ''Tân yn Llŷn'' (Fire in Llŷn).&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1994, 593&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government had settled on Llŷn as the location for this military site after plans for similar bases in [[Northumberland]] and [[Dorset]] had met with protests.&lt;ref name="Daviesp592"&gt;Davies 1994, 592&lt;/ref&gt;

However, UK Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] refused to hear the case against basing this RAF establishment in Wales, despite a deputation claiming to represent half a million Welsh protesters.&lt;ref name="Daviesp592" /&gt; The opposition against 'British' military usage of this site in Wales was summed up by [[Saunders Lewis]] when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the 'essential homes of [[Welsh culture]], [[idiom]], and [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|literature]]' into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare.&lt;ref name="Daviesp592" /&gt;

On 8 September 1936 the building was arsoned, and Welsh nationalists [[Saunders Lewis]], [[Lewis Valentine]] and [[David John Williams|D.J. Williams]] claimed responsibility.&lt;ref name="Daviesp592" /&gt; The case was tried at Caernarfon, where the jury failed to reach a verdict. It was then sent to the [[Old Bailey]] in London, where the "Three" were convicted and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. On their release from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of 15,000 people at a pavilion in [[Caernarfon]].&lt;ref name="Daviesp592" /&gt;

====Broadcasting in Welsh and 1931 census====

With the advent of [[BBC Radio Wales|broadcasting in Wales]], Plaid Cymru protested against the lack of Welsh-language programmes in Wales and launched a campaign to withhold licence fees. Pressure was successful, and by the mid-1930s more Welsh-language programming was broadcast, with the formal establishment of a Welsh regional broadcasting channel by 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1994, 590&lt;/ref&gt; However, no dedicated Welsh-language television channel would be established until 1982.

According to the 1931 census, out of a population of just over 2.5 million, the percentage of Welsh speakers in Wales had dropped to 36.8%, with [[Anglesey]] recording the highest concentration of speakers at 87.4%, followed by [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] at 87.1%, [[Merionethshire]] at 86.1%, and [[Carmarthen]] at 82.3%. [[Caernarfon]] listed 79.2%.&lt;ref name="1931CountyMap"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1931.shtml County map 1931 BBC Wales History Extracted 12-03-07]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Radnorshire]] and [[Monmouthshire]] ranked lowest with a concentration of Welsh speakers less than 6% of the population.&lt;ref name="1931CountyMap" /&gt;

==== Welsh courts act 1942====

Following the arrests of D.J Williams, Saunders Lewis and Lewis Valantine for the "tân yn llŷn" in 1936 all three were tried on charges of arson in Caernarfon crown court where their pleads were deemed invalid as they all pleaded in Welsh. Following the jury's indecision on the matter it was decided that the case should be moved to the Old Bailey causing outrage though Wales which along with the lack of status for the Welsh language in the legal system sparked action. At Cardiff Eisteddfod in 1939 a petition was launched by Undeb Cymdeithasau Cymru (The union of Welsh societies) calling for recognition of the Welsh language in the courts. Their presentation of the petition to parliament in 1941 lead to the passing of the Welsh courts act of 1942 and thus the validation of pleas in the Welsh language.

====The flooding of Tryweryn 1956====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cofiwch Dryweryn.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Remember Tryweryn'' — famous graffiti]] --&gt;

In 1956, a [[private bill]] sponsored by [[Liverpool City Council]] was brought before the UK [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] to develop a water [[Llyn Celyn|reservoir]] from the [[Afon Tryweryn|Tryweryn Valley]], in [[Meirionnydd]] in Gwynedd. The development would include the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] (Holly Chapel), a Welsh-speaking community of historic significance. Despite universal and [[bi-partisan]] objections by Welsh politicians (35 out of 36 Welsh [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] opposed the bill, and one abstained) the bill was passed in 1957. The events surrounding the flooding highlighted the status of the language in the 1950s and 1960s.

====''Tynged yr Iaith'' and the 1961 census====
In 1962 [[Saunders Lewis]] gave a radio speech entitled {{lang|cy|[[Tynged yr iaith]]}} (The Fate of the Language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless [[direct action]] was taken. Lewis was responding to the 1961 census, which showed a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers from 36% in 1931 to 26% in 1961, out of a population of about 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1961.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07]&lt;/ref&gt; Meirionnydd, Anglesey, Carmarthen, and Caernarfon averaged a 75% concentration of Welsh speakers, but the most significant decrease was in the counties of [[Glamorgan]], [[Flintshire|Flint]], and [[Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1961.shtml 1961 BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1931.shtml 1931 BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' intent was to motivate [[Plaid Cymru]] to take more direct action to promote the language; however it led to the formation of ''[[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]]'' (the Welsh Language Society) later that year at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in [[Pontardawe]] in [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Morgan, K O]], ''Rebirth of a Nation'', (1981), OUP&lt;/ref&gt;

====Welsh Language Act 1967====

With concern for the Welsh language mounting in the 1960s, the [[Welsh Language Act 1967]] was passed, giving some legal protection for the use of Welsh in official government business. The Act was based on the [[Hughes Parry report]], published in 1965, which advocated equal validity for Welsh in speech and in written documents, both in the courts and in public administration in Wales. However the Act did not include all the Hughes Parry report's recommendations. Prior to the Act, only the English language could be spoken at government and court proceedings.

====Hunger strike for S4C====

Following the defeat of the Welsh Assembly "Yes Campaign" in 1979, and believing Welsh nationalism was "in a paralysis of helplessness", the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Home Secretary announced in September 1979 that the government would ''not'' honour its pledge to establish a Welsh-language television channel,&lt;ref name="Daviesp680"&gt;Davies 1994, 680&lt;/ref&gt; much to widespread anger and resentment in Wales, wrote Dr. Davies.&lt;ref name="Daviesp680" /&gt;

In early 1980 over two thousand members of Plaid Cymru pledged to go to prison rather than pay the [[television licence]] fees, and by that spring Gwynfor Evans announced his intention to go on [[hunger strike]] if a Welsh-language television channel was not established. In early September 1980, Evans addressed thousands at a gathering in which "passions ran high", according to Dr. Davies.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1994, 667&lt;/ref&gt; The government yielded by 17 September, and the Welsh Fourth Channel ([[S4C]]) was launched on 2 November 1982.

====Welsh Language Act 1993====
The Welsh Language Act 1993 put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the [[public sector]].

The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]] had made English the only language of the [[Courts of England and Wales|law courts]] and other aspects of public administration in Wales. Although the [[Welsh Language Act 1967]] had given some rights to use Welsh in court, the Welsh Language Act 1993 was the first to put Welsh on an equal basis with English in public life.

The Act set up the [[Welsh Language Board]], answerable to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]], with the duty to promote the use of Welsh and to ensure compliance with the other provisions. Additionally, the Act gave Welsh speakers the right to speak Welsh in court proceedings under all circumstances. The previous Act had only given limited protection to the use of Welsh in court proceedings. The Act obliges all organisations in the [[public sector]] providing services to the public in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis; however it does not compel private businesses to provide services in Welsh: that would require a further Language Act.

Some of the powers given to the Secretary of State for Wales under this Act were later devolved to the [[National Assembly for Wales]] ({{lang|cy|Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru}}), but others have been retained by Westminster.

===21st century===

In a speech at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|2000 National Eisteddfod]] at [[Llanelli]], [[Cynog Dafis]], ''Plaid Cymru'' AM, called for a new Welsh-language movement with greater powers to lobby for the Welsh language at the Assembly, UK, and EU levels.&lt;ref name="languagemovement"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/871220.stm Call for new language movement Tuesday, 8 August, 2000 extracted 27 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Dafis felt the needs of the language were ignored during the first year of the Assembly, and that in order to ensure the dynamic growth of the Welsh language a properly resourced strategy was needed.&lt;ref name="languagemovement"/&gt; In his speech Dafis encouraged other Welsh-language advocacy groups to work more closely together to create a more favourable climate in which the use of Welsh was "attractive, exciting, a source of pride and a sign of strength".&lt;ref name="languagemovement"/&gt; Additionally, Dafis pointed towards efforts in areas such as [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] as successful examples to emulate.&lt;ref name="languagemovement"/&gt;

Lord Elis-Thomas, former ''Plaid Cymru'' president,  disagreed with Dafis' assessment, however. At the [[Urdd]] Eisteddfod, Lord Elis-Thomas said that there was no need for another Welsh language act, citing that there was "enough goodwill to safeguard the language's future".&lt;ref name="languagerow"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/776895.stm Elis-Thomas in language row Sunday, 4 June, 2000 extracted 27 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; His comments prompted ''Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg'' and many others to call for his resignation as the Assembly's presiding officer.&lt;ref name="languagerow" /&gt;

====2001 census and second home controversy====

In the 1991 census, the Welsh language stabilised at the 1981 level of 18.7%.

According to the 2001 census the number of Welsh speakers in Wales increased for the first time in over 100 years, with 20.8% in a population of over 2.9 million claiming fluency in Welsh.&lt;ref name="censusrise"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2755217.stm Census shows Welsh language rise Friday, 14 February, 2003 extracted 12-04-07]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, 28% of the population of Wales claimed to understand Welsh.&lt;ref name="censusrise" /&gt; The census revealed that the increase was most significant in urban areas, such as [[Cardiff]] with an increase from 6.6% in 1991 to 10.9% in 2001, and [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] with an increase from 9% in 1991 to 12.3% in 2001.&lt;ref name="censusrise" /&gt; However, the number of Welsh speakers declined in [[Gwynedd]] from 72.1% in 1991 to 68.7%, and in [[Ceredigion]] from 59.1% in 1991 to 51.8%.&lt;ref name="censusrise" /&gt; Ceredigion in particular experienced the greatest fluctuation with a 19.5% influx of new residents since 1991.&lt;ref name="censusrise" /&gt;

The decline in Welsh speakers in Gwynedd and Ynys Môn may be attributable to non-Welsh-speaking people moving to North Wales, driving up property prices to levels that local Welsh speakers cannot afford, according to former Gwynedd county councillor [[Seimon Glyn]] of Plaid Cymru.

Glyn was commenting on a report underscoring the dilemma of rocketing house prices outstripping what locals could pay, with the report warning that "...traditional Welsh communities could die out..." as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1521881.stm 'Racist' remarks lost Plaid votes, BBC Wales, 3 September, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the rural Welsh property market was driven by buyers looking for second homes for use as [[holiday homes]], or for retirement. Many buyers were drawn to Wales from England because of relatively inexpensive house prices in Wales as compared to house prices in England.&lt;ref name="Houseprices"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1480685.stm Property prices in England and Wales Wednesday, 8 August, 2001, extracted 24 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Outstripped"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1688974.stm House prices outpacing incomes Monday, 3 December, 2001, extracted 24 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in home prices outpaced the average earned income in Wales, and meant that many local people could not afford to purchase their first home or compete with second-home buyers.&lt;ref name="Outstripped"/&gt;

In 2001 nearly a third of all properties sold in Gwynedd were bought by buyers from out of the county, and some communities reported as many as a third of local homes used as holiday homes.&lt;ref name="Apology"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1123782.stm Apology over 'insults' to English, BBC Wales, 3 September, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SecondHome"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/524419.stm UK: Wales Plaid calls for second home controls, BBC Wales, November 17, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  Holiday home owners spend less than six months of the year in the local community.

The issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language further complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.&lt;ref name="Apology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Highlands"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/567938.stm Double tax for holiday home owners Thursday, 16 December, 1999, extracted 24 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HouseingReview"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1527298.stm Controls on second homes reviewed Wednesday, 5 September, 2001 extracted 24 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1918383.stm Gwynedd considers holiday home curb Tuesday, 9 April, 2002, extracted 24 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern for the Welsh language under these pressures prompted Glyn to say "Once you have more than 50% of anybody living in a community that speaks a foreign language, then you lose your indigenous tongue almost immediately".&lt;ref name="Protects"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1397281.stm Plaid plan 'protects' rural areas, BBC Wales, 19 June, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plaid Cymru'' had long advocated controls on second homes, and a 2001 task force headed by Dafydd Wigley recommended land should be allocated for affordable local housing, called for grants for locals to buy houses, and recommended that council tax on holiday homes should double, following similar measures in the [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name="SecondHome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Highlands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Protects"/&gt;

However the [[Welsh Labour]]-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Welsh Assembly|Assembly coalition]] rebuffed these proposals, with Assembly housing spokesman [[Peter Black (Welsh politician)|Peter Black]] stating that "we [cannot] frame our planning laws around the Welsh language", adding "Nor can we take punitive measures against second home owners in the way that they propose as these will have an impact on the value of the homes of local people".&lt;ref name="Protects"/&gt;

In contrast, by autumn 2001 the [[Exmoor National Park]] authority in England began to consider limiting second home ownership there, which was also driving up local housing prices by as much as 31%.&lt;ref name="HouseingReview"/&gt; [[Elfyn Llwyd]], ''Plaid Cymru's'' Parliamentary Group Leader, said that the issues in Exmoor National Park were the same as in Wales, however in Wales there is the added dimension of language and culture.&lt;ref name="HouseingReview"/&gt;

Reflecting on the controversy Glyn's comments caused earlier in the year, Llwyd observed "What is interesting is of course it is fine for Exmoor to defend their community but in Wales when you try to say these things it is called racist..."&lt;ref name="HouseingReview"/&gt;

Llwyd called on other parties to join in a debate to bring the Exmoor experience to Wales when he said "... I really do ask them and I plead with them to come around the table and talk about the Exmoor suggestion and see if we can now bring it into Wales".&lt;ref name="HouseingReview"/&gt;

By spring 2002 both the [[Snowdonia|Snowdonia National Park]] (Welsh: ''Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri'') and [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park]] (Welsh: ''Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro'') authorities began limiting second home ownership within the parks, following the example set by Exmoor.&lt;ref name="ParkBan"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1857381.stm Park to ban new holiday homes Wednesday, 6 March, 2002 extracted 24 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; According to planners in Snowdonia and Pembroke applicants for new homes must demonstrate a proven local need or that the applicant had strong links with the area.

It seems that the rise of [[Welsh nationalism]] rallied supporters of the language, and the establishment of Welsh television and radio found a mass audience which was encouraged in the retention of its Welsh. Perhaps most important of all, at the end of the 20th century it became compulsory for all schoolchildren to learn Welsh up to age 16, and this both reinforced the language in Welsh-speaking areas and reintroduced at least an elementary knowledge of it in areas whlich had become more or less wholly Anglophone. The decline in the percentage of people in Wales who can speak Welsh has now been halted, and there are even signs of a modest recovery. However, although Welsh is the daily language in many parts of Wales, English is universally understood. Further, overall figures may be misleading and it might be argued that the density of welsh speakers (which, if high, leads to a thriving welsh culture) is an equally important statistic. Put another way, were 50,000 additional welsh speakers to be concentrated in areas where welsh is spoken by at least 50% of the population, this would be much more important to the sustainability of the welsh language than the same number dispersed in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea cities.

====2011 census====
In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8% to 19%. Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7% of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.

'''Jumpstyle''' is an [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] style and music genre popular in [[Western Europe]], with existent scenes in [[Eastern Europe]],  [[Australia]], and the [[Americas]]. 

Jumpstyling is often referred to as "Jumpen": a combination of the English word 'Jump' and the Dutch and German suffix '-en' (meaning "to jump", or "jumping").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''USA Jumpstyle'' |title=Jumpstyle Info |url=http://www.usajumpstyle.com/jumpinfo.htm |accessdate=7 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812055932/http://www.usajumpstyle.com/jumpinfo.htm |archivedate=12 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It originated in 1997 in [[Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.xlr8r.com/features/2008/01/what-is-it-jumpstyle|title=What Is It? Jumpstyle|last=|first=|date=29 January 2008|website=|publisher=XLR8R|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gathered bigger popularity in their neighbouring country, the [[Netherlands]], in the 2000s.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=November 2015}}
Jumpstyle, originally known simply as '''jump''', was created in Belgium and started in 1997. It was a short-lived small genre that didn't gain popularity in its original form. However, it came back to the public during the turn of the century, and fandom began increasing throughout Europe after undergoing significant changes in Germany in early 2003.

After acquiring its current name, jumpstyle was reintroduced in Europe and in 2005 saw artists and groups producing and releasing its music.

The first key stage of its popularity came between 2007 and 2008 due to the success of music videos such as Scooter's "[[The Question Is What Is the Question?|The Question Is What Is The Question?]]" and "[[Jumping All Over the World (song)|Jumping All Over the World]]", which led to their 13th studio album reaching #1 in the UK charts. However, there are still some radio stations left, broadcasting Jump in its traditional form. The oldest jumpstyle radio was founded in 2005 and still exists today under the name of JumpStation.FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jumpstation.fm |title=First French Tek / Hardtechno / Jump Radio |publisher=JumpStation.FM |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style has also been fused with other genres, for example, [[Major Lazer]] and [[The Partysquad]] mixed a unique track with a [[oldskool jungle|jungle]] vocal sample in the track "[[Original Don]]", with jumpstyle/[[hardstyle]] influences. Also, [[Joel Fletcher|Joel Fletcher's]] remix of [[Savage (rapper)|Savage's]] 2005 single "[[Swing (Savage song)|Swing]]" uses jumpstyle influences.

==Tournaments and leagues==
There are various jumpstyle leagues across the world; mostly in the form of online video submissions and internet competitions. However, in Belgium there have been staged tournaments such as the European Jump Masters.

The UK was the first to officially establish online leagues to an international level, with the FIJL (First International Jumpstyle League), but unfortunately support was lacking, and many competitors pulled out, leaving much confusion.

On the upside, this sparked several International Leagues in countries such as Australia, Russia, Germany and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = ''Jumpstylers.ru''| title = International Jumpstyle Leagues| url = http://jumpstylers.ru/forum/2-jumpstyle-league-jumpstylersru.html| accessdate = 2 August 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Jumpstyle music is an offspring of [[tech-trance]], [[hardstyle]], [[gabber]] and [[mákina]]. Its [[tempo]] is usually between 140 and 150 [[Beats per minute|BPM]]. However, it cannot be seen as merely a slowed down version of gabber. It is characterised by a [[TR-909|909]] kick drum used in a [[Four-on-the-floor (dance)|four on the floor]] beat. It also has influences from [[hard house]] and [[electro house]]. Starting around 2002–03, Jumpstyle music begins to gain influence from [[hardstyle]] sound, such as pitched basslines set at a melody, more complex, multiband distortion, and synthesizers utilising square waveforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = ''Jumpisthestyle.com''| title = Over Jumpen (about Jump)| url = http://jumpisthestyle.com/jumpstyle/overjump| accessdate = 2 November 2008|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kilroy Was Here - Washington DC WWII Memorial.jpg|thumb|300px|Engraving of Kilroy on the [[National World War II Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.]]
[[File:OPERATIONS CROSSROADS, ATOM BOMB TEST, BIKINI ATOLL 111-adc-7171 HD 2Mbps.webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=00:49|300px|"Kilroy was here" graffiti by [[Bikini Atoll]], film shot in 1946]]
'''Kilroy was here''' is an American expression that became popular during [[World War II]], typically seen in graffiti. Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with GIs in the 1940s: a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with his fingers clutching the wall.

"Kilroy" was the American equivalent of the Australian [[Foo was here]] which originated during [[World War I]]. "Mr Chad" or just "Chad" was the version that became popular in the United Kingdom. The character of Chad may have been derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating "Kilroy was here". According to Dave Wilton, "Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase."&lt;ref name="openwriting.com" /&gt;  Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, [[Eugene the Jeep|The Jeep]], and Sapo.

According to [[Charles Panati]], "The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up."&lt;ref name="dope"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the origin of "Kilroy was here"?|work=The Straight Dope|date = 4 August 2000|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1812/whats-the-origin-of-kilroy-was-here|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known if there was an actual person named Kilroy who inspired the graffiti, although there have been claims over the years.

== Origin and use of the phrase ==

[[File:Kilroy Berlin Wall.JPG|thumb|right|A depiction of Kilroy on a piece of the [[Berlin Wall]] in the [[Newseum]] in Washington, D.C.]]
The phrase may have originated through United States servicemen who would draw the doodle and the text "Kilroy was here" on the walls and other places where they were stationed, encamped, or visited.  An ad in ''Life'' magazine noted that WWII-era servicemen were fond of claiming that "whatever beach-head they stormed, they always found notices chalked up ahead of them, that 'Kilroy was here'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|date=17 May 1948|page=120|author1=Inc|first1=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' notes that it was particularly associated with the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]], at least when observed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523"&gt;''Brewer's'': Cassell, 1956. p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, the graffiti (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged.&lt;ref name=quinion/&gt;

Many sources claim origin as early as 1939.&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert|title=The 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G4IkgU7jpLwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22kilroy+was+here%22+1939#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kilroy%20was%20here%22%201939&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=113|chapter=Leisure Activities|isbn=9780313312991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jbrown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jerold E.|title=Historical dictionary of the U.S. Army|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ygqNt3ra-vYC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=kilroy+was+here+1939#v=onepage&amp;q=kilroy%20was%20here%201939&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-29322-8|page=264|chapter=Kilroy}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of the phrase may date from 1937, before World War II. The US History Channel broadcast ''Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed'' in 2007 included a shot of a chalked "KILROY WAS HERE" dated 1937-05-13. [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]]'s vault was loaded in 1937 and inaccessible until the 1970s, when an audit was carried out and the footage was shot.&lt;ref name=phrases/&gt; However, historian Paul Urbahns was involved in the production of the program, and he says that the footage was a reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilroywashere.org/001-Pages/01-0KilroySightings-4.html|title=Kilroy Was Here in 1937 . . . Well, not really|work="Kilroy Was Here" Sightings page 4|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one story, German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This led [[Adolf Hitler]] to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found "Kilroy was here" written in the VIP bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was.&lt;ref name="openwriting.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rottman, Gordon L.: ''FUBAR: Soldier Slang of World War II'' {{ISBN|978-1-84603-175-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; War photographer [[Robert Capa]] noted a use of the phrase at [[Bastogne]] in December 1944: "On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of [[Anthony McAuliffe|McAuliffe]]'s GIs: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capa|first=Robert|title=Slightly Out of Focus|year=1947|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foo was here ===
{{main article|Foo was here}}
The phrase "Foo was here" was used from 1941–45 as the Australian equivalent of "Kilroy was here". "Foo" was thought of as a [[gremlin]] by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the name may have been derived from the 1930s cartoon ''[[Smokey Stover]]'' in which the character used the word "foo" when he could not remember the name of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patridge|first1=Eric|last2=Beale|first2=Paul|title=A dictionary of catch phrases: British and American, from the sixteenth century to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Nm3jbg0JalMC&amp;pg=PA136|year=1986|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05916-X|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Foo came from the acronym for [[Forward Observation Officer]], but this is unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html|title=foo|date=29 December 2003|work=The Jargon File 4.4.7|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real Kilroys ===
''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says simply that Kilroy was "the name of a mythical person".&lt;ref name=quinion/&gt; One theory identifies [[James J. Kilroy]] (1902–1962) as the man behind the signature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|name=James J. Kilroy|10932011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American shipyard inspector.&lt;ref name=quinion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-kil1.htm|title=Kilroy was here|last=Quinion|first=Michael|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicated J.J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the [[American Public Transportation Association|American Transit Association]]&lt;ref name=jbrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; to establish the origin of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1946|title=Kilroy Was Here|journal=In Transit|publisher=Amalgamated Transit Union|volume=54-55|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships as they were being built as a way to be sure that he had inspected a compartment, and the phrase would be found chalked in places that nobody could have reached for graffiti, such as inside sealed hull spaces.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1946/12/24/archives/transit-association-ships-a-street-car-to-shelter-family-of-kilroy.html "Transit Association Ships a Street Car To Shelter Family of 'Kilroy Was Here']", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 December 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'' notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that "the phrase grew by accident."&lt;ref name="Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523" /&gt;

The ''Lowell Sun'' reported in November 1945 that Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy, Jr. from [[Everett, Massachusetts]] wrote "Kilroy will be here next week" on a barracks bulletin board at a [[Boca Raton, Florida]] airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad.&lt;ref name=phrases/&gt; The Associated Press similarly reported Sgt. Kilroy's account of being hospitalized early in World War II, and his friend Sgt. James Maloney wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, according to the AP account, and other airmen soon picked it up. Francis Kilroy only wrote the phrase a couple of times.&lt;ref name=quinion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ov8pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SGgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1606,3592510|title="Kilroy" Mystery is Finally Solved|last=Associated Press|date=14 November 1945|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure was initially known in the United Kingdom as "Mr Chad" and would appear with the slogan "Wot, no sugar" or a similar phrase bemoaning shortages and rationing.&lt;ref name="openwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shackle |first=Eric |url=http://www.openwriting.com/archives/2005/08/mr_chad_and_kil.php |title=Mr Chad And Kilroy Live Again |publisher=Open Writing |date=7 August 2005 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/19/a3568719.shtml |title=WW2 People's War&amp;nbsp;– Mr. CHAD |publisher=BBC |date=24 January 2005 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes.&lt;ref name=wot&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|title=Wot!

Chatterton was nicknamed "Chat", which may then have become "Chad."&lt;ref name="openwriting.com" /&gt; ''Life Magazine'' wrote in 1946 that the RAF and Army were competing to claim him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944.&lt;ref name=wot/&gt; The character resembles [[Alice the Goon]], a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933,;&lt;ref name=perception/&gt; and another name for Chad was "The Goon".&lt;ref name=wot/&gt;

A spokesman for the [[Royal Air Force Museum London]] suggested in 1977 that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter [[Omega]], used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vYUwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iNwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7272,5785548&amp;dq=kilroy+chad&amp;hl=en|title=Changing Patterns in World Graffiti|date=16 March 1977|work=Ludington Daily News|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life'' suggested that Chad originated with [[REME]], and noted that a symbol for [[alternating current]] resembles Chad (a [[sine wave]] through a straight line), that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of [[electrical resistor]]s.&lt;ref name=wot/&gt; The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave.&lt;ref name=perception&gt;{{cite book|last=Zakia|first=Richard D.|title=Perception and imaging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWtM-L83RnwC&amp;pg=PA245|year=2002|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-80466-X|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' suggested in 2000 that "Mr. Chad" was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that a man named Dickie Lyle was at [[RAF Yatesbury]] in 1941, and he drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room and wrote "Wot, no leave?" beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/nov/25/books.guardianreview8|title=Dimpled and pregnant|last=McKie (Smallweed) |first=David |date=25 November 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 which included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]] who drew the circuit diagram with the words "WOT! No electrons?"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a [[square wave]] using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick. This version was initially called Domie or Doomie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafcaa.org.uk/legends.html |title=Wot no respect? |date=9 December 2009 |work=RAF Related Legends |publisher=RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818224613/http://www.rafcaa.org.uk/legends.html |archivedate=18 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Life'' noted that Doomie was used by the RAF.&lt;ref name=wot/&gt; REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed "Chad's Temple"; the RAF claimed that it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school; and the [[Desert Rats]] claimed that it came from an officer in El Alamein.&lt;ref name=wot/&gt;

It is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple "What, no bread?" or "Wot, no [[Tea|char]]?" to the plaintive; one sighting was on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in [[Operation Market Garden]] with the complaint "Wot, no engines?" The ''Los Angeles Times'' reported in 1946 that Chad was "the No. 1 doodle", noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with "Wot, no Tories?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/415580011.html?dids=415580011:415580011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+01%2C+1946&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=NO.+1+DOODLE&amp;pqatl=google|title=No. 1 Doodle|last=Plimer|first=Denis|date=1 December 1946|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase "Wot—no Fuehrer?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EK80AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lYYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6559,1420808|title=Mr. Chad travels|date=12 October 1946|work=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As rationing became less common, so did the joke. The cartoon is occasionally sighted today as "Kilroy was here",&lt;ref name=phrases&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/219500.html |title=Kilroy was here|work=Phrases.org.uk|date=|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "Chad" and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture.

== Smoe ==
{{redirect|Smoe|the fictional name|Joe Shmoe}}
Writing about the Kilroy phenomenon in 1946, '' The Milwaukee Journal'' describes the doodle as the European counterpart to "Kilroy was here", under the name Smoe. It also says that Smoe was called Clem in the African theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8B4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ByUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2098,6309168|title=There Are Places Nobody Ever Was Before, but Look, Kilroy Was There|date=28 November 1946|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that next to "Kilroy was here" was often added "And so was Smoe". While Kilroy enjoyed a resurgence of interest after the war due to radio shows and comic writers, the name Smoe had already disappeared by the end of 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ny0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8iMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1704,5204006|title=Once Honorably Discharged, Kilroy is Here, but No Smoe|date=9 December 1946|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A B-24 airman writing in 1998 also noted the distinction between the character of Smoe and Kilroy (who he says was never pictured), and suggested that Smoe stood for "Sad men of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=John Laurence|title=The forbidden diary: a B-24 navigator remembers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3nxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kilroy|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-158187-1|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondents to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1962 also insisted that Clem, Mr. Chad or Luke the Spook was the name of the figure, and that Kilroy was unpictured. The editor suggested that the names were all synonymous early in the war, then later separated into separate characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|title=Letters to the Editor: Miscellany|date=16 November 1962|work=Life Magazine|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lithuanian Sign Language''' ('''LGK''', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: Lietuvių gestų kalba) is the national [[sign language]] used in [[Lithuania]], with several regional variants. Very little is known about its history before 1945. From 1945 to 1990 it was used along with [[Russian Sign Language]] and the two sign languages became very similar. Russian lip-patterns used with some LGK signs indicate that the sign may have been originally borrowed from Russian Sign Language. When Lithuania became independent, its contacts with Russian Sign Language were almost cut off, and now it's developing as an independent language, with some influence from international signs.

Linguistic research of LGK started in 1996, when it was recognized as the native language of the Deaf. Since then, a Lithuanian Sign Language Dictionary (based on traditional word to sign principle) was published in 5 volumes (including about 3000 signs), along with some thematic vocabularies and bilingual texts in LGK and Lithuanian (including ''Adam's book''). Now work is being done on an LGK database and sign language teaching materials for parents of deaf children, teachers teaching deaf students and sign language interpreters.

The ochre colour of Lizzie’s body aimed to mirror the colour of the land. The frill neck lizard is a native Australian animal which inhabits northern parts of the country. The lizard was chosen because of its will to survive along with its tenacity, it carries the Paralympic message of power and pride to both Australians and international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sydney-2000/mascot|title=Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games - Lizzy|publisher=International Paralympic Committee (IPC)|date=n.d.|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength, determination and attitude of Lizzie symbolise the character traits of all Paralympic Athletes.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brittain |first=Ian |date=2012 |title=From Stoke-Mandeville to Stratford: A History of the Summer Paralympic Games|publisher= Illinois: Common Ground}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lizzie has been given the voice of Olivia Newton-John, a well-known Australian singer, actor and entertainer. Olivia made performances with Lizzie leading up to the Games, spreading the word about excellence within the Paralympic Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1997/oreXXVI18/oreXXVI18f.pdf|title=Olympic Games|publisher=Olympic Information Center|date=1997|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding visibility and community engagement to Lizzie the lizard ultimately led to marketing success, unrivalled by the three olympic mascots. Lizzie captured the imagination of the public, leading to the iconic representation at the Paralympic games.  The Australian Paralympic Committee noted the significant branding capitol and realised that this could be leveraged in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Legg |first1=David |last2=Gilbert |first2=Keith |editor1-last=Darcy |editor1-first=Simon | editor2-last=Appleby |editor2-first=Louis| title=Paralympic Legacies |publisher= Illinois: Common Ground Publishers |date=2011 | pages=75–95 |chapter=Chapter 8: Sydney 2000: Moving from Post-Hoc Legacy to Strategic Vision and Operational Partnerships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Low comedy''', in association to [[comedy]], is a dramatic or literary form of [[entertainment]] with no primary purpose but to create [[laughter]] by [[boasting]], boisterous jokes, [[drunkenness]], scolding, [[fighting]], [[buffoonery]] and other riotous activity.&lt;ref&gt;low comedy. (2013). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349662/low-comedy&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by "horseplay", [[slapstick]] or [[farce]]. Other examples include one throwing a custard pie into another's face. This definition has also expanded to include lewd types of comedy that rely on physical jokes, for example, the [[wedgie]].

== History ==
This type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays.  Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers.  Over time as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: [[stand-up comedians]], [[musicals]], etc.  This type of comedy also was employed in most [[cartoons]].

== Society ==
Low comedy in [[society]] is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of [[mass media|media]], such as [[television]] and [[theatre]]. It can also be found in public and occupations, such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term ''low'' is represented in association to [[low culture]]. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain non-academic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;.  Gans, H. J. (1975). Popular culture and high culture; an analysis and evaluation of taste. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style. 

Low comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to [[high comedy]]. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.&lt;ref&gt;By, B. A. (1934, Jan 21). Salute to low comedy. New York Times (1923-Current File). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/101030559&lt;/ref&gt; 

The classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy are. For example, due to the overdoing of [[sitcoms]] in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, M. (1995, Oct 30). Low comedy of 'high society'. USA TODAY. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/408705508&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=April 2014}}  Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">A '''pedagogical agent''' is a concept borrowed from [[computer science]] and [[artificial intelligence]] and applied to education, usually as part of an [[Intelligent tutoring system|intelligent tutoring system (ITS)]]. It is a simulated human-like interface between the learner and the content, in an educational environment. A pedagogical agent is designed to model the type of interactions between a student and another person. Mabanza and de Wet define it as "as a character enacted by a computer that interacts with the user in a socially engaging manner".&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mabanza|first1=N|last2=de Wet|first2=L|title=Determining the Usability Effect of Pedagogical Interface Agents on Adult Computer Literacy Training|journal=E-Learning|volume=528|pages=145|date=2014|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-41965-2_6|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|isbn=978-3-642-41964-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pedagogical agent can be assigned different roles in the [[learning environment]], such as tutor or co-learner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chin|first1=Doris B.|last2=Dohmen|first2=Ilsa M.|last3=Cheng|first3=Britte H.|last4=Oppezzo|first4=Marily A.|last5=Chase|first5=Catherine C.|last6=Schwartz|first6=Daniel L.|title=Preparing students for future learning with Teachable Agents|journal=Education Tech Research Dev|date=2010|volume=58|issue=6|pages=649–669|doi=10.1007/s11423-010-9154-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the desired purpose of the agent. "A tutor agent plays the role of a teacher, while a co-learner agent plays the role of a learning companion".&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;
[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|right|Computerized agent designed to facilitate interaction between the computer program and the person.]]

== History ==
The history of Pedagogical Agents is closely aligned with the history of [[computer animation]]. As computer animation progressed, it was adopted by educators to enhance computerized learning by including a lifelike interface between the program and the learner. The first versions of a pedagogical agent were more cartoon than person, like Microsoft's [[Office Assistant|Clippy]] which helped users of Microsoft Office load and use the program's features in 1997. However, with developments in computer animation, pedagogical agents can now look lifelike. By 2006 there was a call to develop modular, reusable agents to decrease the time and expertise required to create a pedagogical agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silveira|first1=R.A.|last2=Gomes|first2=E.R.|last3=Vicari|first3=R|editor1-last=Kumar|editor1-first=D|editor2-last=Turner|editor2-first=J|title=Education for the 21st Century-Impact of CIT and Digital Resources|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=Boston|pages=411–415|chapter=Intelligent Learning Objects: An Agent Approach to Create Interoperable Learning Objects}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a call in 2009 to enact agent standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veletsianos|first1=George|last2=Miller|first2=Charles|last3=Doering|first3=Aaron|title=ENALI: A research and design framework for virtual characters and pedagogical agents|journal=Educational Computing Research|date=2009|volume=41|issue=2|pages=171–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization and re-usability of pedagogical agents is less of an issue since the decrease in cost and widespread availability of animation tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Govindasamy|first1=Malliga K.|title=Animated pedagogical agents: A review of agent technology software in electronic learning environments|journal=Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia|date=2014|volume=23|issue=2|pages=163–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schroeder|first1=Noah L.|last2=Adesope|first2=Olusola O.|title=A case for the use of pedagogical agents in online learning environments|journal=Journal of Teaching and Learning with Technology|date=2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individualized pedagogical agents can be found across disciplines including medicine, math, law, language learning, automotive, and armed forces.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; They are used in applications directed to every age, from preschool to adult.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

== Learning theories related to pedagogical agent design ==

=== Distributed cognition theory ===
[[Distributed cognition|Distributed cognition theory]] is the method in which cognition progresses in the context of collaboration with others. Pedagogical agents can be designed to assist the cognitive transfer to the learner, operating as artifacts or partners with collaborative role in learning. To support the performance of an action by the user, the pedagogical agent can act as a cognitive tool as long as the agent is equipped with the knowledge that the user lacks. The interactions between the user and the pedagogical agent can facilitate a social relationship. The pedagogical agent may fulfill the role of a working partner.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Apostol|first1=Ailviu|last2=Şoica|first2=Oana|last3=Manasia|first3=Lorendana|last4=Ştefan|first4=Cătălin|title=Virtual Pedagogical Agents in the Context of Virtual Learning Environments: Framework and Theoretical Models|journal=ELearning &amp; Software for Education|date=2013|issue=2|pages=531–536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-cultural learning theory ===
[[Sociocultural perspective|Socio-cultural learning theory]] is how the user develops when they are involved in learning activities in which there is interaction with other agents. A pedagogical agent can: intervene when the user requests, provide support for tasks that the user cannot address, and potentially extend the learners cognitive reach. Interaction with the pedagogical agent may elicit a variety of emotions from the learner. The learner may become excited, confused, frustrated, and/or discouraged. These emotions affect the learners' motivation.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
It has been suggested by researchers that pedagogical agents may take on different roles in the learning environment.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schroeder|first1=Noah L.|last2=Adesope|first2=Olusola O.|title=A Systematic Review of Pedagogical Agents' Persona, Motivation, and Cognitive Load Implications for Learners|journal=Journal of Research on Technology in Education (Routledge)|date=Spring 2014|volume=46|issue=3|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these roles are: supplanting, scaffolding, coaching, testing, or demonstrating or modelling a procedure. A pedagogical agent as a tutor has not been demonstrated to add any benefit to an educational strategy in equivalent lessons with and without a pedagogical agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Richard E.|last2=Fledon|first2=David F.|editor1-last=Mayer|editor1-first=Richard|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-107-61031-6|chapter=Ten Common but Questionable Principles of Multimedia Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Mayer, there is some support in research for pedagogical agent increasing learning, but only as a presenter of social cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Mayer|editor1-first=Richard|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-107-61031-6|chapter=Principles Based on Social Cues}}&lt;/ref&gt; A co-learner pedagogical agent is believed to increase the student's self-efficacy. By pointing out important features of instructional content, a pedagogical agent can fulfill the signaling function, which research on multimedia learning has shown to enhance learning. Research has demonstrated that human-human interaction may not be completely replaced by pedagogical agents, but learners may prefer the agents to non-agent multimedia systems.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; This finding is supported by [[Agency (sociology)|social agency theory]].

== Design ==
The appearance of a pedagogical agent can be manipulated to meet the learning requirements. The attractiveness of a pedagogical agent can enhance student's learning when the users were the opposite gender of the pedagogical agent. Male students prefer a sexy appearance of a female pedagogical agents and dislike the sexy appearance of male agents. Female students were not attracted by the sexy appearance of either male or female pedagogical agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chih-Chien|last2=Yeh|first2=Wei-Jyh|title=Avatars with Sex Appeal as Pedagogical Agents: Atttractiveness, Trustworthiness, Expertise, and Gender Differences|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|date=2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=403–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6774">'''Pornography in the Americas''' consists of pornography made and viewed in North, Central and South American and Caribbean countries and territories. Although the culture of [[Latin America]] has traditionally been strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, which tends to be socially conservative, pornography is now typically legal in countries such as [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]]. The viewing of pornography in the region has been popularized by the [[Internet]] and [[DVD]]s.

Pornography between consenting adults is legal in many American countries including [[Colombia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/opinion/columnistasdelimpreso/daniel-pacheco/columna-revolucion-del-porno-decente La revolución del porno decente]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://historico.elpais.com.uy/04/10/17/pciuda_116702.asp Policía crea unidad de ciberpatrullaje]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brazil ==
In Brazil, [[pornographic film actor]]s must be 18 or older. Pornography which does not involve bestiality is legal when sold in public places. Depiction of sex with animals is legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistagalileu.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI112289-17799,00-ALGUEM+JA+FOI+PRESO+POR+ZOOFILIA+NO+BRASIL.html Revista Galileu - ''not''ÍCIAS - Alguém já foi preso por zoofilia no Brasil?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[magazine]] and DVD covers that depict genitalia must not be visible from public view, and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older.

== Canada ==
{{Main|Pornography in Canada}}
The laws of Canada permit the sale of [[hardcore pornography]] to anyone over the age of eighteen. While persons below that age may have pornography in their possession, its sale to them is prohibited.

Most hardcore pornography is sold in [[adult bookstore|adult stores]] or on [[adult websites]].

== Chile ==
[[Chile]]'s pornography industry began in the 1950s and grew significantly until the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]]. Under the subsequent [[military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military dictatorship of Chile]] the industry was suppressed. Following the [[Chilean transition to democracy]] and the development of the Internet, the pornography industry in the country has begun to expand again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://culturacolectiva.com/adulto/la-industria-de-la-pornografia/|title=La industria de la pornografía|publisher=Cultura Colectiva|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colombia ==
[[Colombia]] has become a big hub for live web cam streams and has seen a rise in camgirls as a result of the increase in access to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/21/porns-new-capitals-romania-and-colombia.html|title=EPorn's new capitals: Romania and Colombia?|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 98% of "latin" models come from Colombia while only 2% come from Mexico and Brazil.

== Cuba ==
Pornography is illegal in Cuba, however the laws were relaxed in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=119822|title=Pornography in Cuba, Enemy of the State|author=Frank Simon|date=7 July 2016|work=Havana Times|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{Main|Pornography in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], pornography is not unlawful at the federal level, but is subject to the [[Miller test|''Miller'' test]], which was developed in the 1973 case ''[[Miller v. California]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=us/413/15.html Text of the decision and dissents], from findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The Miller test was an effort to differentiate between pornography and 'obscenity.' It has three parts:

* Whether "the average person, applying contemporary [[community standards]]", would find that the [[Work of art|work]], taken as a whole, appeals to the [[wiktionary:prurient|prurient]] interest,
* Whether the work depicts or describes, in a [[patently offensive]] way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law,
* Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious [[Literature|literary]], [[art]]istic, [[Politics|political]], or [[Science|scientific]] value.&lt;ref&gt;This is also known as the ''(S)LAPS test''—[Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered obscene only if ''all three'' conditions are satisfied. Local areas are permitted to develop their own laws on the issue, as long as they do not conflict with federal law.

Pornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies, which offer pornography films through cable channels and in-room movies in hotels. Pornography distribution changed radically during the 1980s, with [[videotape|VHS]] and [[cable television]] largely displacing X-rated theaters. VHS distribution, in turn, has been replaced by [[DVD]] and Internet distribution for [[niche markets]]. Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the United States alone. An estimated 211 new pornographic films are made every week in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,947880,00.html With pot and porn outstripping corn, America's black economy is flying high], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Ragnastrike Angels'''''|ラグナストライクエンジェルズ|Raguna Sutoraiku Enjeruzu}} is a Japanese short [[anime]] series airing on TV consisting of 12, 30-second long episodes airing from April 3 to June 19, 2016. It is based on the video game of the same name and was released on December 15 in Japan for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android (Operating System)|Android]], [[Personal computer|PC]].

==Plot==
The year is 2035 E.R.  Giant living creatures called Fiarem have suddenly appeared on Earth.

Although mankind tries to oppose them by releasing a large number of Ectis, a type of battle android, they are undeniably inferior to face the Fiarem, which are over {{convert|50|m|ft|disp=or}} tall and overwhelmingly powerful.

In order to overcome this situation, the Japanese Diet makes the decision to use Cell Growth Factor CGF-3 technology, which enlarges living beings, for military motives and send humans into battle as giant weapons.

Six heroines are selected as appropriate subjects for enlargement, and enter the Anti-Fiarem Specialists Unit, Ragna Strikers. These young women, trusting their bonds with the secret government agency, head into battle with their powerful enemies.

'''[[Religion]]''' in '''[[Ecuador]]''' is an expression of the different cultural heritages in Ecuadorian culture, including those stemming from the Spanish colonization, Native Amerindians and Afro-Ecuadorians. [[Christianity]] is the largest religion in [[Ecuador]].

Among the old churches are new ones and many more being built by the Catholic Church. The Evangelical Missionary Union represents many [[Protestants]] in Ecuador; [[Anglican]] churches in Ecuador belong to [[Province 9 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. Other religions are present in small numbers: [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Mormonism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]].

==Catholicism==
{{see also| Roman Catholicism in Ecuador}}
[[File:Domes of the Catedral de la Immaculada Concepción.jpg|thumb|right|Arguably the most emblematic Church of Ecuador it's located in Cuenca.]]
After the Spanish colonization, [[Ecuador]] became a [[Roman Catholic]] country. The Catholic Church had and still has an important place in the Ecuadorian government and society. After the Constitution of 1869, the official religion became Catholicism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlh.lahora.com.ec/paginas/historia/historia9c.htm/ Ecuador and the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; and only Catholics could obtain citizenship. In 1899, the liberal government of Alfaro made a new constitution which respected all religions and guaranteed freedom of religious choice. The public education became free of religious influence. Nevertheless, private catholic schools still existed.  [[Monsignor]] Antonio José [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] González Zumárraga is the emeritus [[Archbishop]] of Quito. He is in charge of the Ecuadorian Catholic Church. The Apostolic [[Nuncio]] to Ecuador is Giacomo Guido Ottonello.&lt;ref&gt;[http://75.125.60.12/~iglesia4//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=29/ Ecuadorian Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestants==
In Latin America Protestants are most often called [[Evangelicals]] (Evangelicos).  Ecuador has now about 11% of the population calling itself protestant. Most are Pentecostals, but many denominations are active.

===Latter-day Saints===
{{main|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Ecuador}}
[[File:2005-April-Ecuador 067 retouched.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Guayaquil Ecuador Temple]] (Mormon)]]
The first [[Mormon]] missionaries in Ecuador arrived in 1965. On August 1, 1999, the [[Guayaquil Ecuador Temple]] was dedicated by President [[Gordon B. Hinckley]].

Latter-day Saint membership in Ecuador has increased significantly in recent years. In 2008, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] reported having 185,663 members in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/ecuador LDS Newsroom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617143951/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/ecuador |date=2008-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostolics===
[[File:IEANJESUS 50 1.jpg|thumb|right|50th Anniversary Celebration]]
The "[[Jesus Name Apostolic Church of Ecuador]]" (Iglesia Evangelica Apostolica del Nombre  de Jesus) is the largest [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Apostolic/Pentecostal]] [[Church body|church]] in Ecuador with more than 100,000 members in Ecuador. Considered a Missionary Church they have churches and missions in [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[San Salvador]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Israel]].

==Judaism==
{{see also|History of the Jews in Ecuador}}
The "Jewish Community of Ecuador" (Comunidad Judía del Ecuador) has its seat in [[Quito]] and has approximately 290 members. Nevertheless, this number is declining because young people leave the country towards the United States of America or Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jabad.org.ec/ Ecuadorian Jewish Community]&lt;/ref&gt; The Community has a Jewish Center with a [[synagogue]], a country club and a cemetery. It supports the "Albert Einstein School", where Jewish history, religion and [[Hebrew]] classes are offered.
 
There is a very small community in [[Cuenca (Ecuador)|Cuenca]]. The "Comunidad de Culto Israelita" reunites the Jews of [[Guayaquil]]. This community works independently from the "Jewish Community of Ecuador".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congresojudio.org.ar/comunidades.asp?id=ecuador/ Congreso Judío]&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish visitors to Ecuador can also take advantage of Jewish resources as they travel&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelingrabbi.com/countries/ecuador/ Traveling Rabbi Guide to Ecuador]&lt;/ref&gt; and keep [[kosher]] there, even in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelingrabbi.com/2011/05/04/keeping-kosher-in-the-amazon-rainforest/ Keeping Kosher in the Amazon Rainforest]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{see also|Islam in Ecuador}}
The "Islam Community of Ecuador" (Comunidad Islámica del Ecuador) is of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] denomination and has approximately 60 members in Ecuador. It runs the [[Mosque]] Assalam in the city of Quito.

The "Asociación Islámica Cultural Khaled Ibn al Walidi" reunites the [[Arab Muslims]] in the country and has its seat in [[Quito]].

The Islamic Center "Al Hijra" is located in [[Guayaquil]], Ecuador's largest city and economic hub, with an estimated 85 members.

==Bahá'í Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]], while being registered with the government, has small numbers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecuador: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90252.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]: [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'i radio in [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]] that was started on October 12, 1977, was the first [[Bahá'í radio#Ecuador|Bahá'i radio station]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = National Bahá'i Community of Ecuador |title = The Bahá'í Radio of Ecuador |url=http://www.ec.bahai.org/main.cfm?doc=102&amp;comm=17&amp;lang=1&amp;action=normal |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Bahá'í governing body of Ecuador is based in [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec.bahai.org/main.cfm?action=contact&amp;doc=102&amp;comm=17&amp;lang=1 Baha'i Community of Ecuador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhism was originally brought to Ecuador by immigrants from China and Japan. A large number of these immigrants and their descendants have retained their native religions with approximately 5,000 practicing Buddhists. In 1995 Taiwanese missionaries began building the Templo Mision Budista in Guayaquil. Finished in 2007, it opened its doors to the public in 2008 and is one of the largest Buddhist temples in South America.
==History==

===In the colony===
The Roman Catholic Church assumed a pivotal role in Ecuador virtually at the onset of the Spanish conquest. Catholicism was a central part of Hispanic culture, defining the ethos and worldview of the time. Through the Office of the Inquisition, the church examined the "purity" of possible officeholders. The church was virtually the only colonial institution dealing with education or the care of the needy. It amassed great wealth through donations, dowries, and outright purchases. Virtually every segment of the organization—the hierarchy, individual clerics, and religious orders—owned some form of assets.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;Kluck, Patricia. "Religion". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html A Country Study: Ecuador] (Dennis M. Hanratty, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1989). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the independence===
[[File:Catedral de Latacunga.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Latacunga's Church]]
The liberals' ascendancy in 1905 brought a series of drastic limitations to the Roman Catholic Church's privileges. The state admitted representatives of other religions into the country, established a system of public education, and seized most of the church's rural properties. In addition, legislation formally abolished tithes (although many hacienda owners continued to collect them). The 1945 constitution (and the Constitution of 1979) firmly established freedom of religion and the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

===Changes in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s===
Beginning in the 1960s, the country's Catholic bishops became increasingly active in supporting social change. Church leaders organized literacy campaigns among the Indians, distributed the institution's remaining lands, assisted peasants in acquiring land titles, and helped communities form cooperatives. In the 1970s and 1980s, the bishops espoused a centrist position on social and political issues. The episcopate contended that the unjust organization of Ecuadorian society caused many to live in misery. The bishops also claimed that the economic development of the 1970s and early 1980s had merely widened the gap between rich and poor. At the same time, however, Catholics were warned against employing Marxian analyses of society or endorsing violence or class conflict.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

===Church support for social reform===
Church support for social reform occasionally brought it into conflict with government authorities. In 1976, for example, police arrested Riobamba bishop [[Leonidas Proaño Villalba]]—the episcopate's most outspoken critic of Ecuadorian society and politics—and sixteen other Latin American bishops who were attending a church conference in Chimborazo Province. After accusing the prelates of interfering in Ecuador's internal politics and discussing subversive subjects, the minister of interior released Proaño and expelled the foreign bishops from the country. Some Catholics formed groups to support conservative causes. The Committee of Young Christians for [[Christian civilization|Christian Civilization]], for example, advocated scuttling the "confiscatory and anti-Christian" agrarian reform laws.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

==Internal organization of the Catholic Church in Ecuador==
In 1986 the Roman Catholic Church was organized into three archdioceses, ten dioceses, one territorial prelature, seven apostolic vicariates, and one apostolic prefecture. The church had only 1,505 priests to minister to a Catholic population of slightly more than 8 million, a ratio of 1 priest for every 5,320 Catholics.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Although approximately 94 percent of Ecuadorians were at least nominally Roman Catholic at the time, most either did not practice their religion or pursued a syncretistic version. Most Sierra Indians, for example, followed a type of folk Catholicism in which doctrinal orthodoxy played only a small part. Indigenous beliefs combined with elements of Catholic worship. Much of community life focused on elaborate fiestas that marked both public and family events. Although the precise configuration of fiestas varied from community to community, in general public fiestas involved an individual in a series of increasingly demanding and expensive sponsorships (cargos) of specific religious celebrations. By the time individuals had completed all the expected cargos, they were recognized community leaders.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

==Religious freedom==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Ecuador}}
The separation of state and religion is since 1986 guaranteed.

The Ecuadorian Constitution of 1998 includes two articles providing for freedom of worship:

* Art. 23: States, among others that "all people are legally born free and equal and that they will not be discriminated on the basis of religion". It guarantees also the freedom of religion. "Freedom of religion is guaranteed. Every individual has the right to freely profess his/her religion and to disseminate it individually or collectively. All religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law." The right to declare or not about ones religious affiliation is also guaranteed.
* Art. 81: Prohibits publicity that encourages violence, racism, sexism, religious or political intolerance.

==Conversions==
The Roman Catholic Church's relatively weak presence in the countryside and in squatter settlements, coupled with the nominal, syncretistic practice of most Catholics, created a fertile ground for Protestant [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionary activity. Although multidenominational groups such as the [[Avant Ministries|Gospel Missionary Union]] (GMU) had been active in Ecuador since the beginning of the twentieth century, significant levels of conversion did not occur until the late 1960s. By the late 1970s, the [[Avant Ministries|GMU]] reported that it had converted 20,000 Sierra Indians in Chimborazo Province alone. [[Christian and Missionary Alliance|The Christian and Missionary Alliance]] indicated that conversions among Indians in Otavalo climbed from 28 in 1969 to 900 in 1979. By the mid-1980s, an estimated 50,000 Ecuadorians had converted to [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Other significant forces in the Protestant camp included World Vision, an evangelical development group based in California, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). The Texas-based SIL dispatched linguists to remote areas of Ecuador to study and codify tribal languages. The eventual goal of such efforts was to translate the Bible.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The phenomenal pace of conversion — some observers estimated that evangelicals and Pentecostals totaled 40 percent of the population in [[Chimborazo Province, Ecuador|Chimborazo]] Province in the late 1980s — affected social relations in rural areas. Change in religious affiliation was a major rupture with an individual's past traditions and social ties, effectively removing him or her from participation in fiestas—a major focus of much of community life. Families and extended families found the break with the rest of the community easier in the company of fellow converts. Protestantism replaced the patterns of mutual reciprocity characteristic of peasant social relations with a network of sharing and support among fellow believers. This support system extended to migrants; converts who left for the city or the coast sought out their coreligionists for assistance in finding lodging and employment even as Catholics looked to their compadres.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

'''''Rövarspråket''''' ({{lang-en|The Robber Language}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[language game]]. It became popular after the books about [[Bill Bergson]] by [[Astrid Lindgren]], where the children use it as a [[code]], both at play and in solving actual crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=Lind51 |last=Lindgren |first=Astrid |authorlink=Astrid Lindgren |title=[[Bill Bergson Lives Dangerously]] (Mästerdetektiven Blomkvist lever farligt) |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for encoding is simple. Every consonant (spelling matters, not pronunciation) is doubled, and an ''o'' is inserted in-between. Vowels are left intact. It is quite possible to render the ''Rövarspråket'' version of an [[English language|English]] word as well as a [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''e.g.'':

:''sos-tot-u-bob-bob-o-ror-non'' or ''sostotubobboborornon''

that syllable chain would mean ''stubborn''. Needless to say, the code is not very useful in written form, but it can be tough when spoken by a trained (and thus quick) user. On the other hand, for an untrained speaker, a word or phrase can often be something of a [[tongue-twister]] or a [[shibboleth]].

Today, the books (and subsequent films) are so well known in Sweden, and also in Norway, that the language is part of the culture of schoolchildren. Most Scandinavians are familiar with it.

The '''Seven Wonders of Portugal''' ({{lang-pt|Sete Maravilhas de Portugal}}) is a list of cultural wonders located in Portugal.  The creation of the list was supported by the Ministry of Culture and organized by the companies Y&amp;R Brands S.A. and Realizar S.A.

Initially 793 national [[monuments of Portugal]] were listed by [[Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico]] (IPPAR) as candidates, however in the first round of selections a board of experts reduced the number to 77.  The contenders were further reduced to 21 finalist in four different categories by Conselho de Notáveis at the [[University of Évora]].

The six-month-long public elections started on 7 December 2006 to select the top seven wonders. Votes could be cast via [[Internet voting|internet]], [[telephone]] and [[Short message service|SMS]]. Results of the vote were announced on 7 July 2007 at the [[Estádio da Luz]] in [[Lisbon]],&lt;ref&gt;http://portugalwelcome.com/7-maravilhas-de-portugal-post/&lt;/ref&gt; as were the results of the global [[New Seven Wonders of the World]] contest.

{{nihongo foot|'''''Shadow the Hedgehog'''''|シャドウ・ザ・ヘッジホッグ|Shadō za Hejjihoggu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[platform video game]] developed by [[Sega Studios USA]], the former United States division of [[Sega]]'s [[Sonic Team]], and published by Sega. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] to the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, the game features [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] as the main character, and was revealed at the March 2005 [[Walk of Game]] event. It was released for the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]]s in November 2005.
 
Following the trend of contemporary ''Sonic'' games such as ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' and ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', ''Shadow the Hedgehog'' is a 3D platform game; however, it also features [[third-person shooter]] elements. Most levels have three possible missions&amp;mdash;"Hero," "Dark," or "Normal"&amp;mdash;that the player may choose to complete, while some have only two of the three. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels, a feature referenced by the game's tagline. The plot centers on the attempt of Shadow, a creation of [[Doctor Eggman]]'s grandfather, [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog video game characters#Professor Gerald Robotnik|Professor Gerald Robotnik]], to learn about his past while suffering from [[amnesia]]. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks.

''Shadow the Hedgehog'' received generally unfavorable reviews&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO "MIXED" AS THIS IS NOT WHAT METACRITIC SAYS. Thank you. --&gt; from critics. The game was criticized for its controls, plot, and dark themes, especially the addition of guns and other weapons to traditional ''Sonic'' gameplay. However, some reviewers praised its [[replay value]]. The game was a commercial success, selling more than 2 million copies by March 2007.

==Gameplay==
''Shadow the Hedgehog'' is a [[platform game]] that incorporates elements of [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] gameplay. Like previous games in the ''Sonic'' series, basic gameplay involves running quickly, collecting [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Rings|rings]], and destroying enemies.&lt;ref name="GSPS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/shadowthehedgehog/review.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202035043/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/shadowthehedgehog/review.html|archivedate=2 February 2009 |title=''Shadow the Hedgehog'' for PS2 Review|publisher=GameSpot|date=November 21, 2005|accessdate=January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP PS2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sewart |first=Greg |date=January 12, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U6mYaVqw?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20121108105236/http://www.1up.com/reviews/shadow-the-hedgehog |archivedate=15 November 2014 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3146953&amp;p=2&amp;sec=REVIEWS |title=Reviews: Shadow the Hedgehog for PS2 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow collects rings as a form of health; when he is attacked by an enemy, ten of his rings bounce away from him in all directions.

[[File:ShadowTheHedgehogGun.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Shadow uses a gun to defeat a G.U.N. soldier. The game's violent theme and mechanics were two major areas of criticism.|alt=The hedgehog from the cover shoots a single bullet from a machine gun-like firearm at a human soldier who attempts to do the same. The setting is a disheveled city street at night with tall buildings surrounding the area and an elevated highway overhead.]]
New gameplay features distinguish ''Shadow the Hedgehog'' from previous ''Sonic'' games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding an element of [[third-person shooter]] gameplay.&lt;ref name="gtreview"/&gt; Parts of the scenery, such as [[traffic sign]]s, can also be used as weapons.&lt;ref name="ign_interview"/&gt; Another new feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as [[motorcycle]]s and alien aircraft.&lt;ref name="GSPS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gtreview"/&gt; Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

As in most ''Sonic'' series games, the Chaos Emeralds play a major role; they help Shadow remember his past&lt;ref name="NWR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo World Report - GC Preview: Shadow the Hedgehog|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/previewArt.cfm?artid=3768|date=September 7, 2005|last=Castaneda|first=Karl|publisher=[[Nintendo World Report]]|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.&lt;ref name="GSPS2"/&gt;

The game includes a [[two-player video game|two-player mode]]&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; that retains the single-player mechanics but is set in one of three specially designed stages and uses a vertically [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] to separate each player's view. Each player chooses one of the available characters&amp;mdash;Shadow, two metallic versions of him, and [[palette swap|palette-swapped]] variants of each. The combatants attack each other and steal each other's rings until all but one are eliminated. Additionally, in single-player mode, a second player may take control of Shadow's sidekick character in some stages.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Characters===
{{further information|List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters}}
Shadow the Hedgehog, the game's titular protagonist, was created 50 years before the game's events by [[Professor Gerald Robotnik]] in an orbital military research [[space station|space colony]] known as the ARK. Robotnik was trying to unlock the secrets of eternal life on the government's orders and create the "Ultimate Life Form." To that end, Robotnik designed Shadow to harness the powers of the Chaos Emeralds. At the end of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', his first in-game appearance,&lt;ref name="press_release"/&gt; Shadow was presumed dead, but he returned in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'' with [[amnesia]] that persists into the events of ''Shadow the Hedgehog''.&lt;ref name="gtreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allgame"/&gt;

The Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) is the military of Earth's government, the United Federation, and it is directed by the G.U.N. Commander. When completing "Hero" missions, Shadow usually helps G.U.N. and heroic characters from the ''Sonic'' series, including [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], [[Amy Rose|Amy]], [[Rouge the Bat|Rouge]], [[E-123 Omega|Omega]], [[Vector the Crocodile|Vector]],&lt;ref name="profiles"/&gt; [[Charmy Bee|Charmy]], and [[Espio the Chameleon|Espio]].&lt;ref name="espio"&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Espio:''' Damn! We've been detected!|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their aim is to protect Earth from both Doctor Eggman and the Black Arms, an army of various related alien species that invade Earth from the Black Comet. Black Doom, the leader of the Black Arms, sends an extension of himself called "Doom's Eye" to watch Shadow and help him complete missions. When completing "Dark" missions, Shadow helps either Black Doom or Doctor Eggman, each of whom wants the Chaos Emeralds for himself. In one "Hero" mission of Sky Troops, Shadow assists Doctor Eggman in battling the Black Arms.

===Plot===
[[File:ShadowTheHedgehogMap vector.svg|thumb|left|225px|Completing "Hero," "Dark," or "Normal" missions determines which levels are subsequently playable. Each white box represents a level, and each red or blue box represents a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] mission at the end of the game. The colored lines that connect levels show how the completion of certain missions affects the storyline.|alt=A diagram shows twenty-four white boxes, representing levels, arranged to show the possible progressions through the game.]]
At the beginning of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'' that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter [[Maria Robotnik|Maria]], who was killed by [[G.U.N. soldiers]].&lt;ref name="Herald Sun"/&gt; Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of ''Sonic Heroes'', Shadow wonders if he too is an android.&lt;ref name="press_release"/&gt; The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Black Doom:''' Shadow... As you can see, the day of reckoning will soon be here. Find the seven Chaos Emeralds and bring them to me as promised.|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Shadow:''' If he says he knows the truth about who I am... then like it or not, I have to believe him. The only way I'm going to get the secrets to my past is to get those Chaos Emeralds!|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game progresses through the Westopolis level and five more levels from the different paths Shadow may take. As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories.&lt;ref name="GSPS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="press_release"/&gt; He can choose to help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep the Chaos Emeralds for himself.&lt;ref name="NWR"/&gt; The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the Chaos Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Shadow:''' Finally... I've got ALL the Chaos Emeralds!|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Shadow:''' With the power of these Emeralds, Black Doom and his army are finished!|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; to planning to destroy the planet.&lt;ref name="damn planet"&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Shadow:''' With the power of these Emeralds, I'm going to destroy this damn planet!|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completing all ten endings unlocks the game's true ending in which Black Doom uses Chaos Control, enhanced by the power of all seven Chaos Emeralds, to bring the Black Comet to the Earth's surface. Black Doom explains that the Black Arms intend to use humans as an energy source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Black Doom:''' Humans are a great energy source for us... they will be well-kept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Black Comet begins to release a nerve gas into the Earth's atmosphere that causes total paralysis in those who inhale it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Black Doom:''' A special weapon... this gas, once released, is quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. In a moment, total paralysis will hit your nervous system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Black Doom:''' The end is near, now. Before long, the gas from this Comet will have spread over the entire planet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow confronts Black Doom after the "Last Way" level, where he discovers that Professor Gerald Robotnik created the ARK's Eclipse Cannon weapon to destroy the Black Comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Gerald:''' Shadow...it's up to YOU and only YOU can stop them! I developed the Eclipse Cannon...it's the only weapon that can destroy that Black Comet. Shadow, you are the only hope... to save mankind as we know it. The future of this planet depends on...YOU!}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their confrontation, Black Doom reveals that Shadow was created using Black Doom's blood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Black Doom:''' Don't you know? You were created from MY blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he attempts to use [[mind control]] on Shadow, but fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Black Doom:''' Well, well, well...seems like you're immune to my mind control.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Doom then transforms into a giant called Devil Doom;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow the Hedgehog|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Black Doom:''' Have it your way, Shadow.

Many critics derided the game's sense of maturity for a ''Sonic'' game, especially the addition of guns and other weapons.&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=January 2006|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=199|page=111}} In ''Nintendo Power''{{'}}s final issue in December 2012, Thomason recanted his 8.0 score, stating, "I was young, stupid, and had an inexplicable weakness for any game starring hedgehogs.

Reviewers also criticized the game's controls, especially Shadow's homing attack causing unexpected character deaths. ''Game Informer''{{'}}s Matt Helgeson complained that the attack "frequently sends you careening off into nothingness, resulting in cheap death after cheap death."&lt;ref name="Game Informer"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/ACF9E983-A37C-48E7-BA3E-EE74B1858338.htm?CS_pid=220511|title=''Shadow the Hedgehog'' for GameCube Review|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=January 2006|last=Helgeson|first=Matt|accessdate=March 27, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060526221039/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/ACF9E983-A37C-48E7-BA3E-EE74B1858338.htm?CS_pid=220511 |archivedate=26 May 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nintendo Power'', ''X-Play'', Eurogamer, ''Official Xbox Magazine'', and GameSpy agreed.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bramwell|first=Tom|date=November 15, 2005|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_shadowthehedgehog_xbox|title=Shadow the Hedgehog Review|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/shadow-the-hedgehog/667700p1.html|title=GameSpy: Shadow the Hedgehog Review|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|date=November 16, 2005|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OXMUK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=130786&amp;site=cvg|title=Xbox Review: Shadow the Hedgehog|publisher=''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]''|date=December 6, 2005|accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xplayreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/14/Shadow_the_Hedgehog.html|title=Reviews: Shadow the Hedgehog|publisher=''[[X-Play]]''|accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other complaints focused on the mechanics of weapons and vehicles. Greg Mueller of [[GameSpot]] felt that the guns were nearly useless because of a lack of a target lock or manual aim, combined with an ineffective auto-aim.&lt;ref name="GSreview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Greg|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-the-hedgehog-review/1900-6140200/|title=Shadow the Hedgehog for GameCube review|publisher=GameSpot|date=November 21, 2005|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] staff writer [[Matt Casamassina]], [[1UP.com]] staff writer Greg Sewart, ''Game Informer'', ''X-Play'', GameSpy, and [[London]]'s ''[[The Times]]'' also criticized the mechanics of Shadow's weapons, vehicles, and other aspects of the game's controls.&lt;ref name="1UP PS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/667/667843p1.html|title=IGN: Shadow the Hedgehog Review for GameCube|date=November 17, 2005|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xplayreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thetimes"&gt;{{cite news|date=January 7, 2006|title=Shadow The Hedgehog|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Thomason said that "blasting Shadow's foes with the wide variety of weapons at his disposal is just plain fun."&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

The [[level design]] received mixed comments. Mueller called some levels "extremely frustrating".&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Helgeson stated that the fast-paced "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for ''Game Informer'', called the level design "disastrous".&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt; ''Official Xbox Magazine'' was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D ''Sonic'' gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed ''[[Sonic Heroes]]''.&lt;ref name="OXMUK"/&gt; GameTrailers found that "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the ''Sonic'' universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops and an assortment of other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball."&lt;ref name="gtreview"/&gt; Bettenhausen included "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" of some stages in his limited praise.&lt;ref name="1UP GC"/&gt; Casamassina disliked the "stupid level design", saying that "[j]ust because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome."&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; GameSpy observed that "the areas are much less open than in previous ''Sonic'' games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints."&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt; ''Nintendo Power'' singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

Critics praised the game's replay value, applauding the many possible paths that a player may take through the game. GameTrailers stated, "this choose-your-own-adventure style gives the game replay value that many platformers lack."&lt;ref name="gtreview"/&gt; The [[Melbourne]], Australia, publication ''[[Herald Sun]]'', ''Nintendo Power'', and ''Official Xbox Magazine'' thought similarly.&lt;ref name="Herald Sun"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 26, 2006|title=Game of the week; Shadow the Hedgehog; GameCube/PS2/Xbox (rrp $79.95) Rating: 3.5/5|journal=[[Herald Sun]]|issue=1|page=F02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OXMUK"/&gt; GameSpot praised the variety of alternate endings, but concluded that "the gameplay isn't fun enough to warrant playing the game through multiple times."&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Bettenhausen thought that the morality system felt artificial, but said that it extended the game's replay value.&lt;ref name="1UP GC"/&gt;

[[File:1963 march lincoln memorial.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States is an example of a [[social movement]]. Pictured are marchers at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] during the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on August 28, 1963.]]

'''Social change''' is an alteration in the [[social order]] of a [[society]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 &lt;/ref&gt;. Social change may include changes in [[nature]], [[social institution]]s, [[social behaviour]]s, or [[social relations]]. also in history, once learned: is REPS. R-Religion E-Economical P-political S-social. Which is a very helpful strategy for identifying changes.

== Definition ==

Social change may refer to the notion of [[social progress]] or [[sociocultural evolution]], the philosophical idea that society moves forward by evolutionary means. It may refer to a paradigmatic change in 
the socio-economic structure, for instance a shift away from [[feudalism]] and towards [[capitalism]]. Accordingly, it may also refer to [[social revolution]], such as the [[socialism|Socialist]] revolution presented in , or to other [[social movements]], such as [[Women's suffrage]] or the [[Civil rights movement]]. Social change may be driven by cultural, religious, economic, scientific or technological forces&lt;ref&gt;Little, D (2000) Explaining large-scale historical change. Philosophy of the Social Sciences 30(1): 89–112.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Prominent theories ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
Change comes from two sources. One source is random or unique factors such as climate, weather, or the presence of specific groups of people. Another source is systematic factors. For example, successful development has the same general requirements, such as a stable and flexible government, enough free and available resources, and a diverse social organization of society. On the whole, social change is usually a combination of systematic factors along with some random or unique factors.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Shackman, Ya-Lin Liu and George (Xun) Wang. [http://gsociology.icaap.org/report/summary2.htm "Why does a society develop the way it does?."] 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories of social change. Generally, a [[theory of change]] should include elements such as structural aspects of change (like population shifts), processes and mechanisms of social change, and directions of change.&lt;ref&gt;Haferkamp, Hans, and Neil J. Smelser, editors. [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6000078s/ "Social Change and Modernity."] Berkeley:  University of California Press, c1992 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hegelian''': The classic [[Hegelian]] dialectic model of change is based on the interaction of opposing forces.  Starting from a point of momentary stasis, Thesis countered by Antithesis first yields conflict, then it subsequently results in a new Synthesis.
* '''Marxist''': [[Marxism]] presents a dialectical and materialist concept of history; Humankind's history is a fundamental struggle between [[social class]]es.
* '''Kuhnian''': The [[philosopher of science]], [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' with respect to the [[Copernicus|Copernican]] Revolution that people are likely to continue utilizing an apparently unworkable paradigm until a better paradigm is commonly accepted .
* '''Heraclitan''': The Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] used the metaphor of a river to speak of change thus, "On those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow" (DK22B12).  What Heraclitus seems to be suggesting here, later interpretations notwithstanding, is that, in order for the river to remain the river, change must constantly be taking place.  Thus one may think of the Heraclitan model as parallel to that of a living organism, which, in order to remain alive, must constantly be changing. A contemporary application of this approach is shown in the social change theory [[SEED-SCALE]] which builds off of the [[Complexity economics|complexity theory]] subfield of [[Emergence]].
* '''Daoist''': The Chinese philosophical work ''[[Dao De Jing]]'', I.8 and II.78 uses the metaphor of water as the ideal agent of change.  Water, although soft and yielding, will eventually wear away stone.  Change in this model is to be natural, harmonious and steady, albeit imperceptible.

== Current social changes ==

=== Global demographic shifts ===
{{Main article|Demographics of the world}}

One of the most obvious changes currently occurring is the change in the relative global population distribution between countries. In the recent decades, developing countries became a larger proportion of world population, increasing from 68% in 1950 to 82% in 2010, while population of the developed countries has declined from 32% of total world population in 1950 to 18% in 2010. China and India continue to be the largest countries, followed by the US as a distant third. However, population growth throughout the world is slowing. Population growth among developed countries has been slowing since the 1950s, and is now at 0.3% annual growth. Population growth among the less developed countries excluding the least developed has also been slowing, since 1960, and is now at 1.3% annual growth. Population growth among the least developed countries has slowed relatively little, and is the highest at 2.7% annual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Shackman, Gene, Xun Wang and Ya-Lin Liu. 2011. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1966739 "Brief review of world population trends - Population."]. Retrieved May 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gendered patterns of work and care ===
In much of the [[developed world]], changes from distinct men's work and [[women's work]] to more gender equal patterns have been economically important since the mid-20th century. Both men and women are considered to be great contributors&lt;ref&gt;Social Foundations of Thought and

==Characters==

===Main characters===

====Gabriel Logan====
'''Voiced by''': [[John Chacon]] (''Syphon Filter'' 1-3) &amp; [[James Arnold Taylor]] (''Omega Strain'', ''Dark Mirror'', ''Logan's Shadow'')

'''Gabriel "Gabe" Logan''' is the main protagonist of the series. Born in [[Camden, New Jersey]], Gabe served in the [[United States Army Rangers|75th Ranger Regiment]] and fought in [[Grenada]]. He met [[#Lian Xing|Lian Xing]] in 1987, during a mission in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-occupied [[Afghanistan]]. He served in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. In 1993 he joined the Agency.

In ''The Omega Strain'', Gabe is appointed Commander-In-Chief, and reforms the Agency, naming it the International Presidential Consulting Agency (IPCA). In [[Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow|Logan's Shadow]], Gabe is shot four times in the chest by Trinidad at the end of the game. A Sony representative, artist Athey Moravetz, confirmed he was killed during this firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dualshockers.com/2015/01/22/sony-bends-new-ps4-game-isnt-syphon-filter-according-to-former-employee-provides-more-information/|title=Sony Bend's New PS4 Game Isn't Syphon Filter According to Former Employee; Provides More Information|date=2015-01-22|work=DualShockers|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lian Xing====
'''Voiced by''': Ava Fang (''Syphon Filter''), Zoe Galvez (''Syphon Filter'' 2, 3) &amp; [[Kim Mai Guest]] (''Omega Strain'', ''Dark Mirror'', ''Logan's Shadow'')

'''Lian Xing''' is Gabe Logan's partner in the Agency and later the IPCA. Born in [[Kashi, China]], she first met Logan in [[Afghanistan]] in 1987, both working on assignments against the [[Soviets]]. During the 1990s, Lian was then working for the IPCA as Logan's partner. In the second game, it is revealed that before she joined the Agency, she was an agent of the  [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]].

In ''Logan's Shadow'', it is revealed that she has a husband, Shen Rei. It is also revealed that she is in love with Gabe. Lian may be the last surviving character of the original series after the events at the end of "Logan's Shadow".

====Teresa Lipan====
'''Voiced by''': [[Shannon Tilton]]

'''Teresa Lipan''' is a former [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] agent, voiced by [[Shannon Tilton]] in all appearances. Originally from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], she implied that her family is of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent during her testimony in the third game. She graduated from college and started working for the ATF in 1992. In her first mission for the ATF, Lipan was caught in the middle of a conspiracy with [[National Security Agency]] agents. With the help of an undercover [[Gabe Logan]], Teresa saves her fellow ATF agents and as many militia men as she can. She also saves Dusty and Debbie Oakton, family relatives of Earl Oakton, a mountain survivalist who was executed by NSA agents.

In the series, Teresa Lipan started working for the Agency in 1994, but prior to the events of the first game she leaves the Agency, upon discovering what the Agency really was. At the end of ''Syphon Filter 2'', Teresa decide to fake her death after getting shot and seriously injured by turncoat CBDC agent Jason Chance. In ''Syphon Filter 3'', she tracked down Russian spy Mara Aramov and managed to expose her and Secretary of State Vince Hadden about the agency's activities while testifying about her involvement with the conspiracy.

Although initially reluctant, Teresa joined the IPCA to provide backup reconnaissance in ''Omega Strain''. In ''Logan's Shadow'', Teresa is shot by Trinidad at the end of the game. Whether she survived is unknown.

====Lawrence Mujari====
'''Voiced by''': Bryan Session (''Syphon Filter'' 2 &amp; 3) &amp; [[Khary Payton]] (''Omega Strain'', ''Dark Mirror'')

'''Lawrence Mujari''' is a friend of Teresa Lipan, introduced in the second game. He was a former [[soldier]] in the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] during the time of [[apartheid]]. In Syphon Filter 2 he reveals that he has a medical degree, saying "I'm a pathologist, not an hemathologist". It is also known, for example according to his Senate testimony given during ''Syphon Filter 3'', Mujari testified it was in this role that he first encountered the Syphon Filter virus, during his 1984 investigation of a new [[disease outbreak]] at a [[gold mine]] located in [[Mpumalanga]]. Mujari has a  [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] during this testimony; during this flashback, the player controls him while he carries out that investigation.

After seeing the effects of viral [[infection]]s firsthand, Mujari left his previous work and joined the Agency, in which he trained as a [[Biochemistry|biochemist]]. He was a strong believer in non-lethal force (although he killed numerous people during his 1984 mission) and had a deep personal aversion to violence, but did kill in self-defense. Mujari is killed by Chinese agent Trinidad at the end of ''Logan's Shadow''.

===The Consortium===

The '''Consortium''' was a fictional [[organization]] that appeared in the first two games, that controlled the '''Agency''', an [[Men in Black|MIB]] style [[black ops]]-[[counter-terrorism]] organization of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]], and also helped fund '''Pharcom''''s development of the '''Syphon Filter virus'''.

They planned to sell the virus on the [[Underground economy|black market]] to various [[Terrorism|terrorists]] &amp; [[Organized crime|criminal groups]] such as [[#Black Baton|Black Baton]], the [[Yakuza]], and [[Insurgency|insurgents]] in [[Russia]], as part of their plan to usurp control of various [[First World|first world]] [[Government]]s such as [[United States|America]], '''Russian''', [[China]] &amp; [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Members include Mihai Niculescu, Vincent Hadden, Mara Aramov, Jonathan Phagen, Thomas Markinson, Edward Benton, Lyle Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Murukawa Industries, [[Russian Mafia|Russian gangsters]] and various [[corruption|corrupt]] members of the [[US Government]].

====Leadership====

=====Mihai Niculescu=====
'''Voiced by''': [[Alastair Duncan (actor)|Alastair Duncan]]

'''Mihai Niculescu''' was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[billionaire]] and the major antagonist of the series; his role being the overall commander of The Consortium. He is introduced in ''The Omega Strain''. Niculescu is later killed by two criminal gunmen when his records are erased by a virus planted by an IPCA agent while in Zurich.

=====Vincent Hadden=====
'''Voiced by''': Bob Saenz (''Syphon Filter'' 3)

'''Vincent Hadden''' was the [[United States Secretary of State]] and the second-in-command of The Consortium. He first appeared in the first game as the shadowy figure who tells Markinson that they will "wait and see what he [Gabe Logan] can discover". He is later seen talking to Aramov. He is also featured at the beginning of the second game and later during the game with his face shadowed again, and finally seen talking to Aramov at the end of the game. He appears more often in the third installment. In the beginning of the second game, he explains the nuclear launch that was caused at the end of the first game to the public. In the end, he appeared spying on Logan, Xing and Mujari, beside Teresa Lipan's grave.

In the third game, he calls for Logan, Xing and Mujari to testify. He questions each person, while being intrigued by their stories. It is revealed that Hadden was the leader behind The Agency and The Consortium. Aramov kills Hadden. Mujari notes that leadership in The Consortium is rapidly shifting after Hadden's death.

=====Mara Aramov=====
'''Voiced by''': Anna Murivitskaya (''Syphon Filter''), Elina Fillipova (''Syphon Filter 2''), Corina Harmon (''Syphon Filter 3'') &amp; [[Jennifer Hale]] (''Omega Strain'', ''Dark Mirror'')

'''Mara Aramov''' was an ex-[[KGB]] agent and one of the major [[antagonist]]s in the series. In 1997, as revealed in ''Dark Mirror'', Victor Yavlinski, boss of the Yavlinski Crime family in Kaliningrad, hired Mara Aramov to assassinate his opponents throughout the city. She killed six of Yavlinski's nemesis in cold blood on December 24, while they were sleeping with their wives or lovers, "leaving the kids empty clips instead of presents", as Logan stated.

'''''The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy''''' is an influential [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of socially sanctioned [[cannibalism|cultural cannibalism]] across the world, which casts a critical perspective on the existence of such practices. It was authored by the American anthropologist William Arens of [[Stony Brook University]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1979.

Arens' primary hypothesis is that despite claims made by western explorers and anthropologists since the 15th century, there is no firm, substantiable evidence for the socially accepted practice of cannibalism anywhere in the world, at any time in history. Dismissing claims of cultural cannibalism made against the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] peoples by invading Spanish colonialists, he tackles 19th and 20th century claims regarding socially acceptable cannibalism in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[New Guinea]]. Turning to prehistory, he critiques [[archaeology|archaeological]] claims to have discovered evidence for such practices in Europe and North America. In the second half of the work, Arens puts forward his argument that an erroneous belief in "others" who commit socially sanctioned cannibalism is a global phenomenon. He proceeds to chastise the anthropological community for perpetuating the "Man-Eating Myth", suggesting reasons as to why they have done so.

''The Man-Eating Myth'' was widely reviewed in [[academic journal]]s and also attracted attention from mainstream press. Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative nature of the work. Critics charged Arens with constructing [[straw man argument]]s and for exaggerating the methodological problems within anthropology. Although influential, in ensuing decades, increasing archaeological study of cannibalism led many to dismiss Arens' hypothesis.

==Background==
William Arens undertook the research for his [[PhD]] in [[Tanzania]], [[Eastern Africa]]. After beginning his fieldwork in a rural community there in 1968, he discovered that the locals referred to him as ''mchinja-chinja'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term meaning "blood-sucker". This was due to a widespread belief in the community that Europeans would collect the blood of Africans whom they killed, convert it into red pills, and consume it. He would note that by the time he left the community a year-and-a-half later, most of the locals still continued to believe this myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 10&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface to ''The Man-Eating Myth'', Arens notes that he was first inspired to begin a fuller investigation of cannibalism while teaching an introductory course on anthropology at [[Stony Brook University]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. One student asked him why he focused his teaching on such topics as kinship, politics and economics rather than the more "exotic" subjects of [[witchcraft]], fieldwork experiences and cannibalism. Arens concurred that these latter topics would interest his students to a greater extent than those which he was then lecturing on, and so undertook an investigation into the prior accounts of cannibalism in the anthropological record.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he began to read up on the written accounts of cultural cannibalism, he was struck by inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the [[American Anthropological Association]], but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 172&amp;ndash;173.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Riviere"&gt;[[#Riv80|Rivière 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "[T]his essay has a dual purpose. First, to assess critically the instances of and documentation for cannibalism, and second, by examining this material and the theoretical explanations offered, to arrive at some broader understanding of the nature and function of anthropology over the past century. In other words, the question of whether or not people eat each other is taken as interesting but moot. But if the idea that they do is commonly accepted without adequate documentation, then the reason for this state of affairs is an even more intriguing problem."

In chapter one, "The Nature of Anthropology and Anthropophagy", Arens discusses the study of anthropophagy, or cannibalism, within the anthropological discipline. Noting that anthropologists have widely taken it for granted that there are societies who socially sanction cannibalism, he nevertheless states that there is no "adequate documentation" for such practices anywhere in the world. In the second part of the chapter, he explores several first-hand accounts of cannibalism and highlights their implausible and inaccurate nature. Beginning with the German [[Hans Staden]]'s claims to have encountered socially sanctioned cannibalism among the [[Tupinambá people]] of South America in the 1550s, Arens illustrates a number of logical contradictions in Staden's account, and highlights the dubious nature of the text. The anthropologist then moved on to the 19th-century accounts of widespread socially approved cannibalism among the Polynesian people of [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]] provided by Ta'unga, a Polynesian native who had been converted to Christianity and wrote for the [[London Missionary Society]]; Arens again highlights a number of inconsistencies and logical impossibilities in Ta'unga's claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 5&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter, entitled "The Classic Man-Eaters", explores the accounts of cannibalism produced by European colonialists and travellers in the Americas during the Early Modern era. It begins by documenting the Spanish interaction with the [[Island Caribs|Carib people]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]], first begun by [[Christopher Columbus]] and his men in the 1490s. Columbus noted that the Caribs had been described as cannibals by the neighbouring [[Arawak people]] of the [[West Indies]], but was initially sceptical about such claims himself. Arens highlights that it was only later, when Columbus began to oversee largescale colonization and pacification of Carib lands, that he began to assert that they were cannibals, in order to legitimize his cause. Arens then proceeds to note that the Spanish government only permitted the enslavement of cannibals in the Caribbean, leading European colonists to increasingly label the indigenous peoples as cannibalistic in order to increase their economic power. Following on from this, Arens goes on to critique the longstanding claims that the [[Aztec]] people of [[Mexico]] were cannibals; noting that while the early Spanish accounts of the Aztecs include first-hand descriptions of [[human sacrifice]], he highlights that none of these Spanish observers actually witnessed cannibalism, despite the claims that were later made asserting the cannibalistic nature of Aztec religion. In contrast, Arens argues that the Aztecs found the idea of cannibalism &amp;ndash; even in survival conditions &amp;ndash; socially reprehensible, and believed that some of their neighbouring peoples were guilty of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 41&amp;ndash;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hans Staden, Tupinamba portrayed in cannibalistic feast.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Original 1557 Hans Staden [[woodcut]] of the Tupinambá portrayed in a cannibalistic feast; Arens argued that the whole scenario was invented by Staden with no basis in reality.]]

Chapter three, "The Contemporary Man-Eaters" explores the claims made for socially sanctioned cannibalism in the 20th century, with a particular focus on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[New Guinea]]. Regarding the former, Arens discusses [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s work in disproving that the [[Azande]] people were cannibalistic, before arguing that the stories of socially accepted cannibalism in the "[[Africa|Dark Continent]]" were based largely on misunderstandings and the sensationalist claims of European travellers like [[Henry Morton Stanley]], and that there was no reputable first-hand accounts of such a practice anywhere in Africa. Instead, he notes that many African societies found cannibalism to be a reprehensible anti-social activity that was associated with [[witchcraft]], drawing comparisons with the Early Modern European witch hunt. Moving on to look at claims for cannibalism in New Guinea made by anthropologists like [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ronald Berndt]], he notes that none of them ever actually came across any evidence of the practice themselves, before going on to critique claims that cannibalism was the cause of the ''[[kuru (disease)|kuru]]'' outbreak among the New Guinean [[Fore people]] in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 82&amp;ndash;116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth chapter, entitled "The Prehistoric World of Anthropophagy", Arens deals with [[archaeology|archaeological]] arguments for socially approved cannibalism in European and North American prehistory. He argues that many early archaeologists, in viewing prehistoric societies as "primitive" and "savage", expected to find widespread evidence of cannibalism within the archaeological record, just as [[social anthropology|social anthropologists]] were claiming that the practice was widespread in recently documented "primitive", "savage" societies. He critiques various claims that broken bones represent evidence of cannibalism, both in [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] [[Yorkshire]] and in the case of [[Peking Man]], maintaining that these breakages could represent many different things rather than cannibalism. He then moves on to look at North American examples, including those from the Pueblo period in the Southwestern United States and among the [[Iroquois]] in the country's northeast, in both instances critiquing an interpretation of socially sanctioned cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 119&amp;ndash;136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The penultimate chapter, "The Mythical World of Anthropophagy", consists of Arens' argument that all human groups have been accused of socially accepted cannibalism at one point in time, and that these cannibals are often usually thought of as "others", being outside of the accuser's society, and are associated with certain animals because of their "non-human" behaviour. From this, he deduces that the belief in cannibalism is a "universal phenomenon", and questions why this should be so. He suggests that societies gain a sense of self-meaning by conjuring the image of an opposite culture that breaks societal taboos. He also describes the manner in which many societies hold origin myths that involve them once being incestuous cannibals before they became civilised, in this way referencing the ideas expressed by the psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] in his ''[[Totem and Taboo]]''. He then proceeds to discuss a variety of other related issues, such as the connection between cannibalism and witchcraft, the role of gender and class in cannibal claims, and the role of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 139&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Mythical World of Anthropology", Arens looks at the manner in which anthropologists have approached the idea of cultural cannibalism. Noting the widespread western idea that cannibals exist "beyond the pale of civilization", in the land of savagery and primitivism, he argues that anthropologists have taken it upon themselves to explain and rationalize the cannibalism of such "primitives" without first proving that they were cannibalistic to start with. He connects this to the attitude held by many westerners both past and present that they are the bearers of civilization who have helped to put a stop to cannibalism. Challenging and criticizing the anthropological community's long-term advocacy of what he considers the "Man-Eating Myth", he draws comparisons with the belief in demonic witchcraft and cannibalism in Europe that led to the witch trials of the Early Modern period, ending his work on a quote from the historian [[Norman Cohn]]'s book ''[[Europe's Inner Demons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 163&amp;ndash;185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main arguments==

===The existence of cultural cannibalism===
In ''The Man-Eating Myth'', Arens notes that he was unable to find any form of "adequate documentation" for the existence of socially sanctioned cannibalism in any recorded society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he remained "dubious" that cannibalism has ever existed as an approved social activity.&lt;ref name="Arens 9"&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless refused to rule out the possibility that it had ever occurred, maintaining that the correct methodological stance was to hold an open mind on the issue, and that it would be impossible to conclusively state that no society throughout human history has ever culturally sanctioned cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt; From this definition of "cultural cannibalism" he excludes those instances where people have resorted to cannibalism under survival conditions, or where individuals have committed cannibalism as an anti-social activity that is condemned by the rest of their community.&lt;ref name="Arens 9"/&gt;

===The universal belief in cultural cannibalism===
[[Image:Antisemitic-church-fresco.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] in St Paul's Church in [[Sandomierz]], Poland, that depicts the [[blood libel]], the idea that European Jews captured and devoured Christian children. Arens considers this to be another component of the "Man-Eating Myth".]]
Arens considers the belief in cannibalism to be a "universal phenomenon" that has been exhibited in all inhabited regions of the world.&lt;ref name="Arens 139"/&gt; He expresses his view that "all cultures, subcultures, religions, sects, secret societies and every other possible human association have been labeled anthropophagic by someone."&lt;ref name="Arens 139"&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that accusations of socially sanctioned cannibalism in a society typically arise from an alternative society with whom they are often in conflict. As evidence, he notes that pagan Romans labelled the early Christians as cannibals, despite the lack of any evidence for this, and subsequently Christians in Medieval Europe [[blood libel|labelled Jews as cannibals]], again without any corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that across the world, cannibals are viewed as non-human entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human species of animal, and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to kill and consume humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 140&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arens proceeds to ponder the question as to why societies across the world believe that other, exotic societies exhibit cannibalism. He notes that the development of a "collective prejudice" against a foreign entity provides meaning for the group by conjuring up an opposite who commit social taboos.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that one society's belief that a foreign society is cannibalistic might arise from an inability to differentiate between the latter's conceptions of the natural and the [[supernatural]]. As evidence, he asserts that rumors that the Indigenous Americans of Northeastern Canada were cannibals arose when foreign societies learned of their folkloric beliefs in man-eating giants who lived in the wilderness and conflated this fantasy with reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 150&amp;ndash;151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The anthropological approach to cultural cannibalism===
Arens' third primary argument is that ever since the development of the discipline, the anthropological community have continually perpetuated the "Man-Eating Myth" that cultural cannibalism was widespread across the world. In this way, he sees anthropologists as following in the path of Christian friars from the Early Modern period who asserted the existence of cannibalism "beyond the pale of civilization", in societies that are either historically or geographically distinct to western culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore argues that both Christian proselytizers and academic anthropologists have sought to accuse non-western, non-Christian peoples of cultural cannibalism in order to then explain and rationalize their "savage" ways; in doing so, he argues, they continue to portray the Christian west as a civilizing influence on the world that suits their own socio-political agendas. In this way, Arens feels that the "Man-Eating Myth" furthers the "we-they" dichotomy between westerners and non-westerners,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 167&amp;ndash;169.&lt;/ref&gt; and has indirectly lent some justification for the western exploitation of "savage" non-western peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

He does not believe that there was any conscious academic conspiracy to spread the claims of cultural cannibalism, instead believing that they have arisen as a result of poor methodologies that have been used in this area, namely a lack of properly scrutinizing sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore suggests that anthropologists have failed to tackle this issue because &amp;ndash; while novel ideas are certainly welcomed &amp;ndash; they feared that by criticising long-held core assumptions, they would be upsetting the established ''status quo'' within the discipline, and would ultimately tarnish the reputation of anthropology itself by suggesting that it had made major errors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Are79|Arens 1979]]. pp. 176&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt;

involves actual physical consumption of human flesh on rare occasions, which I am prepared to do, Arens still leaves little room for fleshing out the culture of cannibalism because he has buried the bones in a tomb of overly constrained empiricism. The cant from Arens seems to be that if cannibalism can be shown to be anchored in the murky world of mythic thought, metaphoric equations, and symbolic actions, then it has a chance of being reduced to that existence alone."

}}
''The Man-Eating Myth'' was reviewed by Ivan Brady for the ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' journal. He noted that the framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even if it could be deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an "unsophisticated" version of [[positivism]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a critical eye over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only "direct observation" will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept anything short of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes that there are other activities in the world that surely go on &amp;ndash; such as [[masturbation]] in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces &amp;ndash; but that these would be hidden by a veil of secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a [[straw man argument]] by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is "indeterminate", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as "reckless" in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can be blamed on poor observation standards.&lt;ref name="Brady 1982"&gt;[[#Bra82|Brady 1982]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' published a highly negative review by [[Peter Rivière|P. G. Rivière]] of the [[University of Oxford]]. Criticizing what he saw as the "chatty '[[Self-righteousness|Holier-than-Thou]]' tone" of the book, Rivière asserted that at only 160 pages of text, Arens had failed to give sufficient attention to the subject and evidence, instead devoting much of the space to constructing and demolishing straw men arguments. Coming to the defence of those who believe the account of Staden regarding cannibalism among the Tupinambá by arguing that it could indeed reflect the German explorer's genuine experiences, Rivière notes that Arens has not tackled all of the claims which assert that this South American people committed anthropophagy. Furthermore, he expresses his opinion that Arens' work has made him reassess the evidence for Tupinambá cannibalism, the existence of which he is now even more thoroughly convinced. Proclaiming it to be both a "bad" and a "dangerous" book, he finally expresses his fear that it might prove to be "the origin of a myth".&lt;ref name="Riviere"/&gt; Similarly, Shirley Lindenbaum of the [[New School for Social Research]] published her highly negative review of Arens' work in the journal ''[[Ethnohistory]]''. Casting a critical eye on his claims, she notes that his use of source material was "selective and strangely blinkered", which detracted from his ideas of "collective prejudice" which she considers valuable. Critiquing his discussion of the Fore people of New Guinea as being littered with inaccuracies, she draws comparisons between cannibalism and sexual activity, noting the latter is also not directly observed by anthropologists but nonetheless undoubtedly goes on. She furthermore expresses surprise that the work was ever designed for a scholarly audience because of its poor levels of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lin82|Lindenbaum 1982]].&lt;/ref&gt;

James W. Springer of [[Northern Illinois University]] reviewed Arens' book for ''[[Anthropological Quarterly]]''. He hoped that the book would in part have a positive legacy, in that it might make anthropologists look more closely and critically at their source material, and praised its criticism of the claims regarding [[Aztec cannibalism]]. He nevertheless proclaimed that Arens was "almost certainly wrong", making use of faulty evaluation methods and being excessively critical of any and all claims for cultural cannibalism, failing to prove dishonesty or prejudice on the behalf of Europeans who have claimed evidence for cultural cannibalism. He criticises both Arens' treatment of Staden's claims and his discussion of Iroquois cannibalism, claiming that Arens has neglected to mention many Native American first-hand testaments as to the cannibalistic nature of these people. Ultimately, he dismissively asserted that ''The Man-Eating Myth'' "does not advance our knowledge of cannibalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spr80|Springer 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt; More favourably, R.E. Downs of the [[University of New Hampshire]] reviewed the work for ''[[American Ethnologist]]''. Noting that the book was "provocative" in its thesis, he felt that it was bound to raise many "hackles", and that it would lead future anthropologists to challenge other long-standing beliefs about non-western "primitive" societies, such as that of widespread [[incest]] and [[promiscuity]].  Ultimately, he remarked that while many anthropologists might dispute Arens' ideas, never again could they claim that the existence of cultural cannibalism was an undisputed fact.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dow80|Downs 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;

of why people in general, and anthropologists in particular, are so willing to accept its existence despite this lack of evidence. The ideas in this book should serve to stimulate further investigations of these topics. Unfortunately, however, Arens fails to support satisfactorily his main thesis that no adequate documentation for cannibalism exists for any culture, an argument that seems too much the result of the author's personal convictions and too little the product of careful research.

}}

The geographer Thomas Krabacher of the [[University of California]] undertook a review of ''The Man-Eating Myth'' for the journal ''[[Human Ecology (journal)|Human Ecology]]''. Believing that a critical study of cannibal claims has been long needed, he was nevertheless perturbed that Arens' work failed to be either comprehensive or objective. Although concurring that reports of cannibalism have been all too readily accepted without being properly scrutinized, Krabacher nonetheless argues that he has used a "careless and selective" approach to the literary sources. He also sees problems in Arens' approach to the nature of the evidence, stating that the anthropologist has not given sufficient thought to what would constitute reliable testimony in the case of cannibalism. Drawing comparisons with sexual behaviour, he notes that it would not always be possible for a western anthropologist to directly view cannibalism, which would likely be hidden from their view by many practitioners, and that as such, second-hand accounts would have to do. He then critiques Arens' writing style, believing it to be "contentious and possibly offensive", and highlighting a number of typological errors.&lt;ref name="Krabacher"/&gt;

Khalid Hasan's review of ''The Man-Eating Myth'' appeared in the ''[[Third World Quarterly]]'' journal. Considering it to be a "brilliant and well documented" tome, he praised Arens' "admirable" work and expressed his hope that others would expand on his initial thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Has80|Hasan 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt; The German journal ''Anthropos'' published a largely positive review of Arens' work by John W. Burton, in which he described it as an "extensive and meticulous" study which was the model of a "fair and reasoned argument". Supporting Arens' arguments, he proclaimed that the final chapter should be essential reading for all anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bur80|Burton 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;
P. Van de Velve reviewed the book for the Dutch journal ''Anthropologica''. Van de Velve felt that the book contained several weaknesses, for instance Arens did not, he notes, explain how the claim for cultural cannibalism can be successfully refuted. The Dutch scholar also noted that the argument that anthropology focused on examining "non-bourgeoisie" cultures was not new. Ultimately however, Van de Velve considered it to be a well written book that offered "good reading", particularly for students.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Van82|Van de Velve 1982]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent academic reception===

====In archaeology====
Archaeologist Paola Villa, one of the primary excavators of [[Fontbrégoua Cave]], a Neolithic site in Southeastern France where the team argued for the existence of cannibalism, made reference to Arens' work in a 1992 paper of his published in the ''[[Evolutionary Anthropology (journal)|Evolutionary Anthropology]]'' journal. Villa noted that following the book's publication, prehistorians always dealt with suspicions of cannibalism with "extreme reluctance and scepticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vil92|Villa 1992]]. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English archaeologist [[Timothy Taylor (archaeologist)|Timothy Taylor]] critically discussed Arens' work in his book ''The Buried Soul: How Humans Invented Death'' (2002). Proclaiming that "there is now overwhelming biological, anthropological and archaeological evidence that cannibalism was once all around us", he attacked Arens for his blanket and "bizarre" accusations against the concept of cultural anthropophagy. He argued that ''The Man-Eating Myth'' had become so influential upon publication because it was what a generation of anthropological and archaeological students wanted to hear, not because it represented a coherent argument, citing P.G. Rivière's negative review in ''Man''. Commenting on the situation in archaeology, he felt that following the publication of Arens' work, archaeologists had ceased to cite cannibalism as an explanation, to the detriment of the discipline itself. Presenting evidence to counter Arens' claims, Taylor cites the accounts of cannibalism among Pom and Passon, two [[chimpanzees]] of [[Gombe National Park]] whose anti-social activities were recorded by [[Jane Goodall]], and from this discusses the evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. Proceeding to defend various ethnographic accounts of cultural cannibalism, he argues that this thoroughly disproves the beliefs which "Arensite" anthropologists find it "comfortable or fashionable" to believe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tay02|Taylor 2002]]. pp. 57&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in ''The Buried Soul'', he proclaims that Arens' book is pervaded by a "hollow certainty of viscerally insulated inexperience", and he claims that such a flawed methodology has echoes in the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine's ''[[Speak of the Devil (book)|Speak of the Devil: Tales of Satanic Abuse in Contemporary England]]'' (1998); Taylor himself suggests that multiple claims of the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] have been incorrectly dismissed for being considered "improbable".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tay02|Taylor 2002]]. pp. 280&amp;ndash;283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arens' book was also briefly mentioned by the Scottish archaeologist Ian Armit in his book, ''Headhunting and the Body in Iron Age Europe'' (2012). Armit noted that though the book was influential, most anthropologists would "probably" argue that Arens' wholesale dismissals had gone "too far". He also saw Arens' work as symptomatic of a trend within anthropology to neglect the "undesirable" cultural practices of non-western societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arm12|Armit 2012]]. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press attention===
Arens' book gained attention from the popular press soon after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra82|Brady 1982]]. p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sick Child''''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: '''''Det syke barn''''') is the title given to six paintings and a number of [[lithograph]]s, [[drypoint]]s and [[etchings]] completed by the Norwegian artist [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), between 1885 and 1926. All record a moment before the death of his older sister Johanne Sophie (1862–1877) from [[tuberculosis]] at 14. Munch returned to this deeply traumatic event again and again in his art, over six completed oil paintings and many studies in various media, over a period of more than 40 years. In the works, Sophie is typically shown on her deathbed accompanied by a dark-haired, grieving woman assumed to be her aunt Karen; the studies often show her in a cropped head shot. In all the painted versions Sophie is sitting in a chair, obviously suffering from pain, propped by a large white pillow, looking towards an ominous curtain likely intended as a symbol of death. She is shown with a haunted expression, clutching hands with a grief-stricken older woman who seems to want to comfort her but whose head is bowed as if she cannot bear to look the younger girl in the eye.

Throughout his career, Munch  often returned to and created several variants of his paintings. ''The Sick Child'' became for Munch—who nearly died from tuberculosis himself as a child—a means to record both his feelings of despair and guilt that he had been the one to survive and to confront his feelings of loss for his late sister. He became obsessive with the image, and during the decades that followed he created numerous versions in a variety of formats. The six painted works were executed over a period of more than 40 years, using a number of different models.&lt;ref name="F361"&gt;Facos, 361&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has been described as "a vivid study of the ravages of a degenerative disease".&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Stephen; Crow, Thomas; Lukacher, Brian. "Nineteenth Century Art: A Critical History". London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2007. 422. {{ISBN|0-5002-8650-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the paintings and many of the ancillary works are considered significant to Munch's oeuvre. An 1896 lithograph in black, yellow and red was sold in 2001 at [[Sotheby's]] for $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.artvalue.com/auctionresult--munch-edvard-1863-1944-norway-the-sick-child-i-das-kranke-ki-1780362.htm Lot 338: The Sick Child (Das Kranke Kind I)]''. artvalue.com.

==The paintings==
[[File:Edvard Munch - The sick child (1907) - Tate Modern.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Edvard Munch, ''The Sick Child'', 1907. 4th in the series.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;"[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=10482 ''The Sick Child'', 1907]". [[Tate Gallery]], London. Retrieved 25 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Oil on canvas, 137 × 139 cm. [[Tate]], London.]]
Each painting shows Sophie in profile, lying on her deathbed, and obviously having difficulty breathing, a symptom of advanced, severe tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="C23"&gt;Cordulack, 23&lt;/ref&gt; She is propped from her waist up by a large thick white pillow which partially hides a large circular mirror hung on the wall behind her. She is covered by a heavy dark blanket. She has red hair and is shown as frail and with a sickly pallor and vacant stare.&lt;ref name="F361" /&gt; She looks towards a dark and portentous full-length curtain to her left, which many art historians interpret as a symbol of death.

A dark-haired and older woman in a black dress sits by the child's bedside, holding her hand. The bond between the two is established through the joining of their hands, which are positioned at the exact center of each work. Their shared grip is typically rendered with such pathos and intensity that art historians believe that not only did the two figures share a deep emotional bond, but that they were most likely blood relations. In probability the woman is Sophie's aunt&lt;ref name="F361" /&gt; Karen. Some critics have observed that the older woman is more distressed than the child; in the words of critic Patricia Donahue, "It is almost as though the child, knowing that nothing more can be done, is comforting a person who has reached the end of her endurance".&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Patricia. "Nursing, the Finest Art: An Illustrated History". St. Louis, MO: Mosby, 1996. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The woman's head is bowed in anguish to the extent that she seems unable to look directly at Sophie. Because of this, her face is obscured and the viewer can only see the top of her head. A bottle is placed on a dressing table or locker to the left. A glass can be seen to the right on a vaguely described table.

The paintings vary in their colourisation.  White especially figures in the first in the series, a representation of oblivion. Later, green and yellow figure as expressive representations of sickness, while in most works the reds represent the most dramatic and physical feature of late stage tuberculosis: coughing up blood.&lt;ref name="F361" /&gt;

===Style===
Every piece in the series is strongly influenced by the conventions of [[German Expressionism]], while many are heavily [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] in technique. The painted versions are built up from thick layers of [[impasto]] paint, and typically show strong broad vertical brush strokes. The emphasis on verticals gives the works a hazy feel and adds to their emotive power, an effect the art critic [[Michelle Facos]] described as presenting the viewer with "a scene experienced at close range but hazily, as if viewed through tears or the veil of memory".&lt;ref name="F361" /&gt;

Munch was only 26 when he completed the 1885–86 painting and uncertain enough of his ability, he gave it the tentative title ''Study''. Munch completed six paintings titled ''The Sick Child''. Three are now in Oslo (1885–86, 1925, 1927), the others in [[Gothenburg]] (1896), Stockholm (1907), and London (1907). He created eight studies in drypoints and etching after his breakthrough in 1892 when demand for his work grew.&lt;ref name="BM"/&gt; The first version took over a year to complete. Munch found it an unhappy and frustrating experience, and the canvas was worked and reworked almost obsessively. Between 1885 and 1886 Munch painted, scrubbed out and repainted the image,&lt;ref name="F361" /&gt; before finally arriving at an image he was satisfied with. He often mentioned the works in his journals and publications, and it features heavily in his "The Origin of the Frieze of Life" (''Live Friesens tilblivelse''). He later wrote that the 1885–86 painting was such a difficult struggle that its completion marked a major "breakthrough" in his art.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Munch explained: "I started as an [[Impressionist]], but during the violent mental and vital convulsions of the Bohême period Impressionism gave me insufficient expression—I had to find an expression for what stirred my mind ... The first break with Impressionism was the Sick Child—I was looking for expression ([[Expressionism]])."&lt;ref name="Eggum46"&gt;Eggum, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting materials===
British and Norwegian scientists have investigated the painting in the Nasjonalmuseet Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Singer, Trond Aslaksby, Biljana Topalova-Casadiego and Eva Storevik Tveit, Investigation of Materials Used by Edvard Munch, Studies in Conservation 55, 2010, pp. 274-292.&lt;/ref&gt; The pigment analysis revealed an extensive palette consisting of pigments such as [[lead white]], [[zinc white]], artificial [[ultramarine]], [[vermilion]], red lake, [[red ochre]], [[emerald green]], [[chrome yellow]], [[zinc yellow]], and [[cobalt blue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/edvard-munch-sick-child/ Edvard Munch, The Sick Child, Nasjonalmuseet Oslo], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Munch wrote to the director of Oslo's National Gallery admitting that "As for the sick child, it was the period I think of as the Age of the Pillow. A great many painters did pictures of sick children on their pillows."&lt;ref&gt;Bischoff, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Munch was referring to the prevalence of tuberculosis at the time; contemporary depictions of the disease can be seen in the works of [[Hans Heyerdahl]] and [[Christian Krohg]].

==Reception==
When the 1885–86 original version was first exhibited at the 1886 Autumn Exhibition in [[Oslo|Christiania]], it was jeered by spectators and drew "a veritable storm of protest and indignation" from critics dismayed at his use of impressionistic techniques, his seeming abandonment of line,&lt;ref&gt;Eggum, 45&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that the painting seemed to be unfinished. Many found it unsatisfactory that the key passage in the painting - the women's joined hands - was not well detailed, there are no lines to describe their fingers and the centerpiece essentially comprises blobs of paint. In defence Munch said, "I don't paint what I see but what I saw."&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, AS. "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jun/22/edvard-munch-ghosts-of-vampires-and-victims Edvard Munch: the ghosts of vampires and victims]". ''The Guardian'', 22 June 2012. Retrieved 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was reviewed by the critic Andreas Aubert, who wrote: "There is genius in Munch. But there is also the danger that it will go to the dogs ... For this reason, for Munch's own sake, I would wish that his Sick Child had been refused ... In its present form this 'study'(!) is merely a discarded half-rubbed-out sketch."&lt;ref name="Eggum46" /&gt;

Over 40 years later, the [[Nazi]]s deemed Munch's paintings "[[degenerate art]]" and removed them from German museums. The works, which included the 1907 version of ''The Sick Child'' from the [[Galerie Neue Meister|Dresden Gallery]], were taken to Berlin to be auctioned. Norwegian art dealer Harald Holst Halvorsen acquired several, including ''The Sick Child'', with the goal of returning them to [[Oslo]]. The 1907 painting was purchased by Thomas Olsen in 1939 and donated to the [[Tate Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

==Notability==
On 15 February 2013, four Norwegian postage stamps were published by [[Posten Norge]], reproducing images from Munch's art to recognise the 150th anniversary of his birth. A close-up of the child's head from one of the lithographic versions was used for the design of the 15 [[Norwegian krone|krone]] stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thornews.com/2013/02/14/munchs-the-scream-on-a-postage-stamp/ Munch’s “The Scream” on a Postage Stamp]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sixth Sense''''' is a 1999 American [[supernatural horror film]] written and directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]]. The film tells the story of Cole Sear ([[Haley Joel Osment]]), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled [[child psychologist]] named Malcolm Crowe ([[Bruce Willis]]) who tries to help him. The film established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for [[plot twist|surprise ending]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a29642/the-sixth-sense-ending/|title=Why The Sixth Sense Ending Has Never Been Matched|last=Howard|first=Michael|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released by [[Hollywood Pictures]] on August 6, 1999, the film was well-received by critics; praise was given to its acting performances (particularly Willis, Osment, and [[Toni Collette]]), atmosphere, and twist conclusion. ''The Sixth Sense'' was the second-highest-grossing film of 1999 (behind ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''), taking about $293 million in the US and $379 million in other markets. This made it the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing horror film]] (in unadjusted dollars) until that time; it was surpassed by ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' in 2017.

The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Shyamalan, [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Osment, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Collette.

==Plot==
Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in [[Philadelphia]], returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. A young man then appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself.

The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother Lynn worries about his social skills, especially after seeing signs of physical harm. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees [[Ghost|ghosts]], who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.

At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, Vincent begins crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to attempt helping.

Cole talks to one of the ghosts, a young girl named Kyra who recently died after a chronic illness. He goes with Crowe to her funeral reception at her home, where Kyra directs him to a box holding a videotape, which he then gives to her father. The tape shows Kyra's mother poisoning her daughter's food. By proving she was a victim of [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], Cole has saved Kyra's younger sister, the mother's next victim.

Learning to live with the ghosts he sees, Cole begins to fit in at school and is cast as the lead in the school play, which Crowe attends. The doctor and patient depart on positive terms and Cole suggests to Crowe that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep. Later, while stuck in traffic, Cole confesses his secret to his mother, saying that someone died in an accident ahead of their traffic and he knows because the person is next to him. Although his mother at first does not believe him, Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him. He describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance, even though Lynn thought her mother was not there. He further relays the answer to a question his mother privately asked at her mother's grave: "Every day." When Cole asks what question she asked, his mother tearfully answers, "Do I make her proud?" They hug.

Crowe returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing. While still asleep, Anna asks her husband why he left her, and drops Crowe's wedding ring. He remembers what Cole said about ghosts, notices how people have been ignoring him as if he wasn’t there, and remembers when Vincent shot him in the beginning of the film. Crowe finds the gunshot wound is still there and he is wearing the same clothes as when he was shot, revealing that he has actually been deceased the whole time due to his gunshot wound. Because of Cole's efforts, Crowe's unfinished business – rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent – is finally complete. Crowe fulfills the second reason he returned: to tell his wife she was never second, and that he loves her. With his goals complete, his spirit exits through a light filled doorway.

==Production==
David Vogel, then-president of production of [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]], read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights to the script, despite the high price of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Allison Hope|title=Shyamalan’s Hollywood Horror Story, With Twist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/business/media/02night.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=December 30, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, with Vogel leaving the company shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bart|first1=Peter|title=Moguls make switch after power turns off: Is there life after Hollywood?|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-02/entertainment/sns-201207020800reedbusivarietynvr1118056154-20120702_1_power-players-dick-cook-david-vogel|accessdate=December 30, 2014|work=Variety|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney—apparently in a show of little confidence in the film—sold the production rights to [[Spyglass Entertainment]], while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James B.

The color red is intentionally absent from most of the film, but it is used prominently in a few isolated shots for "anything in the real world that has been tainted by the other world"&lt;ref&gt;Screenwriter/director M. Night Shyamalan, "Rules and Clues" bonus featurette on the DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; and "to connote really explosively emotional moments and situations".&lt;ref&gt;Producer Barry Mendel, "Rules and Clues" bonus featurette on the DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the door of the church where Cole seeks sanctuary; the balloon, carpet, and Cole's sweater at the birthday party; the tent in which he first encounters Kyra; the volume numbers on Crowe's tape recorder; the doorknob on the locked basement door where Malcolm's office is located; the shirt that Anna wears at the restaurant; Kyra's mother's dress at the wake; and the shawl wrapped around the sleeping Anna.

All of the clothes Malcolm wears during the film are items he wore or touched the evening before his death, which included his overcoat, his blue rowing sweatshirt and the different layers of his suit. Though the filmmakers were careful about clues of Malcolm's true state, the camera zooms slowly towards his face when Cole says, "I see dead people." In a special feature, the filmmakers mention they initially feared this would be too much of a giveaway, but decided to leave it in.&lt;ref&gt;Producer Frank Marshall, "Rules and Clues" bonus featurette on the DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marisa Tomei]] was considered for the role of Lynn Sear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Twisted Facts About ''The Sixth Sense''|date=6 August 2016|publisher=''[[Mental Floss]]''|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/66913/17-straightforward-facts-about-sixth-sense|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Successful Pyrate''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Charles Johnson (writer)|Charles Johnson]], first performed 1712, published 1713, dealing with the life of the [[pirate]] [[Henry Every|Henry Avery]].

''The Successful Pyrate'' is a romanticised dramatisation of two episodes contained in a [[pamphlet]] recently published concerning the career of the pirate [[Henry Every|Henry Avery]]: his capture of the [[Mughal Empire|Mogul]] [[Aurengzeb]]'s ship ''[[Ganj-i-Sawai|Gang-i-sawai]]'', allegedly carrying the Mogul's granddaughter; and a plot against him by his lieutenant De Sale and other pirates.

In the play, Avery goes under the name Arviragus, and has made himself a King in [[Madagascar]]. He captures the Indian princess Zaida and tries to force her to marry him, but she is in love with a young man named Aranes. There is an offstage fight and Aranes is reported killed; meanwhile, De Sale, who has confided to the audience that he plots to overthrow Arviragus and make himself King, ingratiates himself with Zaida.

De Sale's fellow plotters are bumbling incompetents and their plans are easily thwarted, followed by a comic trial scene. It is revealed that Aranes is Arviragus' long lost son, whom he recognizes from a bracelet, and that he is still alive, his friend Alvarez having died in his place. The plotters are executed and Aranes and Zaida marry.

The play is more [[comedy]] than anything else. The pirates are mostly fools, in particular Sir Gaudy Tulip, an aged and cowardly London beau; the ''Gang-i-sawai'' is, for no reason other than comic effect, carrying two European ladies, Tulip's ex-mistress and another pirate's ex-wife, who exchange tart comments with the men; the drunken conspirators and outrageously partial court are played entirely for laughs.

'''Umalohokan''' refers to the [[town crier]]s of [[ancient barangay]]s in the [[Philippines]].  They were responsible for going around and making people aware of new laws and policies enacted by the [[Datu]] or chieftain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agoncillo|first=Teodoro A. |author2=Oscar M. Alfonso |author3=Milagros Guerrero |publisher=Malaya books|year=1970|pages=47|title=History of the Filipino people|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTwMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Umalohokan&amp;dq=Umalohokan&amp;pgis=1|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, however, have a different interpretation.  In cases of large scale disputes between barangays in the [[Visayas]], the respective Datus of the barangays may elect a head Datu, called an Umalohokan, to serve as judge.  The Spanish colonizers noted that elections were held in the Philippines before they arrived, specifically for this post.  When the dispute was settled, the term of the Umalohokan was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Laput  | first = Ernesto J.  | authorlink = Ernesto J.

'''Urbanus''' is a Flemish [[celebrity comics|celebrity comic strip]] loosely based on Flemish comedian and singer [[Urbanus]]. The stories are written by Urbanus himself and drawn by [[Willy Linthout]]. The first story was published in 1982 and is still in syndication as of this day, being the longest-running and most successful Flemish comic strip based on a celebrity. The comics sell well in the [[Netherlands]] too, due to Urbanus' popularity there.

==Concept==
In the series Urbanus is portrayed as an eleven to twelve-year old version of himself, despite his full-grown beard. Just like the real Urbanus he lives in [[Tollembeek]], but here end all similarities. Urbanus is portrayed as a bad young boy who frequently tries to trick the local villagers, his parents, his teacher, his fellow students and gets into trouble for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanusfan.be/urbanusstrip.php|title=Urbanus (De Stripheld)|work=urbanusfan.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of comedy is [[Surreal humor|absurd]], [[Black comedy|black]] and often vulgar. All animals in this comic strip are able to talk. Pop culture references to TV shows, comics, cartoons, films and Urbanus' own merchandise are frequently made. The authors deliberately use Flemish dialect instead of standard Dutch and also deliberately keep the drawing style naïve and simple, inspired by the series of [[Marc Sleen]].

The albums are usually long adventure stories, but some are one-page gags as well.

==History==
[[Willy Linthout]] drew the first ''Urbanus'' story in November 10, 1982, without interference of Urbanus himself. As the comedian felt Linthout didn't quite capture his style he became the series' permanent collaborator from the second album on. From December 16, 1982 until April 25, 1996 all albums were published by Uitgeverij Loempia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/linthout.htm|title=Willy Linthout|work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; a publishing company created by Linthout and Jef Meert. Since 1996 [[Standaard Uitgeverij]] does the publishing.

==Characters==
The main characters are:

* '''Urbanus''': A young ten to twelve-year-old boy. He frequently misbehaves and gets punished for it.
* '''Cesar''': Urbanus' father. He is a [[Pigeon racing|pigeon racer]] and farmer who spends most of his time with smoking pipe, drinking beer, reading his newspaper, watching TV and committing [[adultery]] with local prostitutes.
* '''Eufrazie''': Urbanus' pious mother. She is a housewife who devoutly believes in the Roman Catholic Church and spends most of her time with brushing off a Virgin Mary statue on her closet. 
* '''Nabuko Donosor''': Nabuko Donosor is Urbanus' dog. He is completely yellow, wears [[slipper]]s on his feet and the upper jaw of his head floats above the lower jaw. He is actually an alien lifeform, but treated like a dog by everyone else. 
* '''Amedee''': Urbanus' [[house fly]]. He is hyper intelligent and often understands situations or finds solutions to problems the others can't comprehend. 
* '''Annatol''': Urbanus' goldfish.
* '''Wieske''': Urbanus' pig. 
* '''Nonkel Fillemon''': The family's rich and elderly uncle. Urbanus' family is always waiting for him to pass away so they can inherit his massive fortune, but he always survives.
* '''Jef Patat''': A local poor and sleazy scoundrel who lives under a bridge. He is often active in criminal affairs and tries to trick everybody. Patat is more or less the [[antagonist]] of the series, if Urbanus doesn't perform that part himself.
* '''Meester Vladimir Kweepeer''': The local sadistic but otherwise not very bright [[headmaster]].
* '''Dikke Herman''': An obese boy who wears glasses and has a large yellow quiff on his head. He is a frequent target of abuse by other characters, most notably Urbanus himself.
* '''Het Negerken''': A local black boy who is nicknamed "The Little Negro". His real name is Botswana. 
* '''Meneer Pastoor''': The local Roman Catholic priest. He enjoys drinking [[sacramental wine]] and frequently neglects his [[celibacy|oath of celibacy]] by visiting local prostitutes. 
* '''René and Modest''': Two local police officers who enjoy beating up people.
* '''Juffrouw Pussy''': A young and attractive female teacher who is adored by everyone, especially Urbanus.
* '''Stef, Staff &amp; Stylo''': A gang consisting of three thieves who are brothers of differing height. They are clearly inspired by [[The Daltons (Lucky Luke)|The Daltons]]. 
* '''God''': God is portrayed as an angry old man living up in Heaven. He is married and has two children. God is often agitated by Urbanus' behaviour on Earth.

==Animated film==
In 1992 a partial animated adaptation of the 18th "Urbanus" album "Het Lustige Kapoentje" was made in collaboration with [[20th Century Fox]]. Urbanus voiced himself. It was released on video, but didn't have much success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2378273/|title=Het lustige kapoentje (1992) - IMDb|date=22 October 1992|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbanus-online.be/kalender.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animated shorts were made in 1999, based on the gag comics. They are made available on Urbanus' official site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanusfan.be/urbanusstrip/urbanusstripfilmpjes.php|title=Urbanus (De Stripheld) / Filmpjes|work=urbanusfan.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crossover==
In 1997 Urbanus and Linthout made a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] comic strip named "Kiekebanus", in which characters from their series meet characters from [[Merho]]'s series ''[[De Kiekeboes]]''. In another [[De Kiekeboes]] album, "Bij Fanny op Schoot" (2005), Urbanus and his family were also guest stars.

==In popular culture==
On April 8, 2000 Urbanus, Amedee and Nabuko Donosor received their own statue in [[Tollembeek]]. It was designed by Koen Tinel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanus-online.be/standbeeld.html|title=Untitled Document|work=urbanus-online.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbanus also received a statue in [[Middelkerke]] on July 7, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/oid140049/archief-urbanus-heeft-standbeeld-op-middelkerkse-zeedijk|title=Urbanus heeft standbeeld op Middelkerkse zeedijk|author=BELGA|work=Gazet van Antwerpen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sculpted by Luc Cauwenberghs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toerismemiddelkerke.be/toerisme/page19124854.aspx|title=Middelkerke toerisme - Urbanus|work=toerismemiddelkerke.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2915">'''Violent disorder''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/2 section 2(1)] of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. Sections 2(1) to (4) of that Act provide:

:(1) Where 3 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for their personal safety, each of the persons using or threatening unlawful violence is guilty of violent disorder.
:(2) It is immaterial whether the 3 or more use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously.
:(3) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.
:(4) Violent disorder may be committed in private as well as in public places.

'''"3 or more persons"'''

See the following cases:
*R v Mahroof, 88 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 317, CA
*R v Fleming and Robinson [1989] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 658, CA
*R v McGuigan and Cameron [1991] Crim LR 719, CA

'''"Violence"'''

This word is defined by section 8.

==Mens rea==
For the [[mens rea]], see section 6(2).

==Indictment==
As to particularisation, see R v Mahroof, 88 Cr App R 317, CA.

==Alternative verdict==
See sections 7(3) and (4).

==Arrest==
Before 1 January 2006 this offence was classified as an [[arrestable offence]] by virtue of section 24(1)(b) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. See now sections 24 and 24A of that Act, as substituted by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].

==Mode of trial and sentence==
Violent disorder is triable [[either way]]. A person guilty of violent disorder is liable on [[conviction]] on [[indictment]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on [[summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 2(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cases are relevant:

*R v Tomlinson, 157 JP 695, CA
*R v Hebron and Spencer, 11 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 226, [1989] Crim LR 839, CA

The '''Winter Music Conference''' ('''WMC''') is a week-long [[electronic music]] conference, held every March in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], [[United States]]&lt;ref name=mntimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Jose D.|last=Duran|title=How Russell Faibisch Built Ultra Music Festival -- and Whom He's Battled Along the Way |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2013-03-14/music/how-russell-faibisch-built-ultra-music-festival-and-whom-he-s-battled-along-the-way/full/ |work=[[Miami New Times]] |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1985. It is also known as the premiere platform for [[electronic dance music]]. The conference brings together professionals such as artists, [[DJ]]s, [[A&amp;R|record label representatives]] (A&amp;R), [[music producer|producer]]s, [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]s, [[radio]] and the [[News media|media]] for [[seminars]] and panel discussions.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Thousands of attendees attend the WMC each year from around the world.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt;

==History and background==
[[File:South beach miami at night.JPG|thumb|left|275px|The conference is spread across various locations in [[Miami]].]]
It was founded in 1985 by Louis Possenti and Bill Kelly. Held annually in Miami Beach, Fla., the Winter Music Conference, or "WMC" as followers of [[electronic dance music]] call it, has hosted up to an estimated 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2012/03/16/winter-music-conference-hits-miami-full-force/|title=Winter Music Conference Hits Miami Full Force|last=Sager|first=Rebekah|date=2012-03-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Winter Music Conference took place at the [[Fort Lauderdale]] [[Marriott International|Marriott]] during 19–21 Feb. 1986.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473184/blood-on-the-dancefloor-winter-music-conference-vs-ultra-music-festival|title=Blood On the Dancefloor: Winter Music Conference Vs. Ultra Music Festival|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were approximately 80 dance music industry insiders in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roamingsolutions.com.au/blogs/news/17715845-the-winter-music-conference-miami|title=The Winter Music Conference - Miami|website=www.roamingsolutions.com.au|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1986, the event festivities have moved down south, across [[Miami Beach]] and [[Downtown Miami]]. 

A major event during WMC is the International Dance Music Awards (IDMAs). The IDMAs are an integral part of WMC generating over two million votes from music enthusiasts in 209 countries and territories every year to recognize and honor exceptional achievements in 57 award categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmcinfo.com/category/idma/|title=IDMA Archives - Winter Music Conference 2018|website=Winter Music Conference 2018|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event commands a major international draw with around 38 percent of attendees coming from outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="WMC: General Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=WMC: General Facts|url=http://www.wintermusicconference.com/addinfo/generalfacts/ |work=Winter Music Conference|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference serves as a platform for many underground and indie artists from over 70 different countries who spend the conference at events and panels; it is also a medium used by several [[entrepreneur]]s and [[consumer electronics|consumer electronic]] companies to present their businesses and technological developments.&lt;ref name="WMC: General Facts" /&gt;

The WMC &amp; [[The Recording Academy]] began in 1996 - a partnership presenting The Producers Forum, a gathering of legendary artists.&lt;ref name="WMC: Featured Events"&gt;{{cite web|title=WMC: Featured Events|url=http://www.wintermusicconference.com/events/featured/ |work=Winter Music Conference|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''Ultra Beach Music Festival'', now known as [[Ultra Music Festival]], became an event as part of Winter Music Conference, taking place on 13 Mar. 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/2015/ultra-timeline/index.html|title=In the mix: The history of Ultra Music Festival in Miami|last=Ruhi|first=Noel Gonzalez and Adrian|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waxpoetics Magazine, JBL, and Stanton sponsored the first International Record Collectors Show in 2007.&lt;ref name="WMC: General Facts" /&gt; The WMC 2009 introduced the first annual WMC [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] Challenge at The Miami Beach Resort &amp; Spa with celebrity hosts, judges, and VJs from various parts of the world hosted by VJ Psyberpixie and Felix Sama.&lt;ref name="WMC: Featured Events" /&gt; This inaugural year of the competition resulted in Sergey Lobodln (Moscow, Russia), walking away with the top winner prize.&lt;ref name="WMC: Events"&gt;{{cite web|title=WMC: Events: VJ Challenge|url=http://www.wmcon.com/events/vjchallenge/ |work=Winter Music Conference|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the VJ Challenge was expanded into two areas of competition; Video Mixing and Audio/Visual Mixing. The 2010 VJ Challenge winners were AeonChild (Boulder, Colorado) in the video category and [[Eclectic Method]] (London/NYC) in the Audio/Visual category.&lt;ref name="2010 WMC VJ Challenge"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 WMC VJ Challenge|url=http://justinkent.com/news/wmc-vj-challenge-2010.html |work=Winter Music Conference|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Miami Beach Resort also received the performance of the RoboMusic Demo in which Funkstar De Luxe and RoboProfessor (Henrik Hautop Lund) create live interactive compositions of RoboMusic.

Since 2008, the conference has received increasing competition from the [[International Music Summit]] taking place in [[Ibiza]] in May.

In 2011, for the first time, WMC and [[Ultra Music Festival]] split and took place during two completely separate weekends in March. This was "a gross inconsideration by the WMC for event planners worldwide and artist scheduling." according to Windish Agency [[Talent agent|booking agent]] Steve Goodgold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2014 was the last year that WMC lasted a total of ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wintermusicconference.com/pressroom/releases/wmc2014_dates.php|title=Winter Music Conference Announces 2014 Dates - Winter Music Conference 2016 - WMC 2016|website=Winter Music Conference|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, WMC took place across the span of five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wintermusicconference.com/events/schedule/2015/|title=2015 WMC Official Schedule - Winter Music Conference 2016 - WMC 2016|website=Winter Music Conference|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, 2016 was the second time that Winter Music Conference took place apart from Ultra Music Festival, lasting only four days, 21–24 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/thumps-official-guide-to-miami-music-week-2016|title=THUMP's Official Guide to Miami Music Week 2016 {{!}} Thump|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other music conferences have come about including [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Amsterdam Dance Event]] (ADE), and [[Insomniac Events|EDMbiz]] in [[Las Vegas]], which takes place during [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] yearly.

On Mar. 21, 2018, Ultra announced that it had acquired the WMC and the IDMAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8256904/ultra-music-festival-winter-music-conference-beijing|title=Ultra Music Festival Acquires Winter Music Conference, Announces Beijing Festival|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Artists==
Hundreds of industry professionals, producers, artists, promoters, record labels, and enthusiasts gather to network in various seminars, panels, workshops, parties, and DJ spinoff events. WMC is not only for the big artists, such as Tiesto and Steve Aoki but also for underground artists and DJ newbies. If you are a newbie and are asked to perform during WMC, you are being given the opportunity for thousands of attendees to listen to your music and to even possibly get scouted by a record label. 

==Events==
There are over 500 individual events during the week the conference takes place.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' named it "one of the most anticipated clubbing events in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/02/travel/escapes/02Ahead.html|title=Winter Music Conference|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|date=2007-03-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
