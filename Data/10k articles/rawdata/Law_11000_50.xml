An '''acceptable use policy''' ('''AUP'''), '''acceptable usage policy''' or '''fair use policy''', is a set of [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] applied by the owner, creator or administrator of a [[Computer network|network]], [[website]], or service, that restrict the ways in which the network, website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used. AUP documents are written for [[corporations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.hcahealthcare.com/CPM/ISSEC005.doc |title=IS.SEC.005 |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2008-12-13 |publisher=[[Hospital Corporation of America]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030111223/http://ec.hcahealthcare.com/CPM/ISSEC005.doc |archivedate=October 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[businesses]], [[universities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/computing/policy/aup.html|title=Policy on Acceptable Use of Electronic Resources|accessdate=2008-12-13|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218004711/http://www.upenn.edu/computing/policy/aup.html| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[school]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccps.k12.fl.us/Downloads/COSC0809.pdf |title=2008-2009 Code of Student Conduct |accessdate=2008-12-13 |publisher=[[Charlotte County Public Schools]] |format=pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.embarq.com/legal/acceptableuse.html|title=EMBARQ ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY &amp; VISITOR AGREEMENT|date=2006-10-20|accessdate=2008-12-13|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120134226/http://www2.embarq.com/legal/acceptableuse.html|archivedate=20 November 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and website owners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms|title=MySpace.com Terms of Use Agreement|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2008-12-13|publisher=[[Myspace]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216031739/http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms| archivedate= 16 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; often to reduce the potential for [[legal action]] that may be taken by a user, and often with little prospect of enforcement.

Acceptable use policies are an integral part of the framework of [[information security]] policies; it is often common practice to ask new members of an organization to sign an AUP before they are given access to its information systems. For this reason, an AUP must be [[concise]] and clear, while at the same time covering the most important points about what users are, and are not, allowed to do with the IT systems of an organization. It should refer users to the more comprehensive security policy where relevant. It should also, and very notably, define what [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] will be applied if a user breaks the AUP. [[Compliance (regulation)|Compliance]] with this policy should, as usual, be measured by regular [[audit]]s.

In some cases a fair usage policy applied to a service allowing nominally unlimited use for a fixed fee simply sets a cap on what may be used, intended to allow normal usage but prevent what is considered excessive. For example, users of an "unlimited" [[broadband Internet]] service may be subject to suspension, termination, or bandwidth limiting for usage which is "continually excessive, unfair, affects other users' enjoyment of the broadband service, or is not consistent with the usage typically expected on a particular access package".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talktalk.co.uk/legal/tiscali-product/fair-usage-policy/ TalkTalk Fair Usage Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301173111/http://www.talktalk.co.uk/legal/tiscali-product/fair-usage-policy/ |date=2014-03-01 }}, typical fair usage conditions for "unlimited broadband Internet" usage.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is enforced directly, without legal proceedings.

==Terminology==
AUP documents are similar to and often serve the same function as the ''[[Terms of Service]]'' document (e.g., as used by [http://mail.google.com/mail/help/terms_of_use.html Google Gmail] and [http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html Yahoo!]), although not always. In the case of [http://www.ibm.com/legal/us/ IBM.com] for instance, the [[Terms of Use]] are about the way in which IBM presents the site, how ''they'' interact with visitors of the site and little to no instruction as to how to use the site.

In some cases, AUP documents are named ''Internet and E-mail Policy'', ''Internet AUP'', ''Network AUP'', or ''Acceptable IT Use Policy''. These documents, even though named differently, largely provide policy statements as to what behavior is acceptable from users of the local network/Internet connected via the local network.

{{Globalize/UK|date=October 2013}}

==Common elements of AUP statements==
{{External links|section|date=October 2016}}

In general, AUP statements/documents often begin with a [http://www.solis.co.uk/aup/index statement of the philosophy] of the [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ing organization and intended reason as to why Internet use is offered to the users of that organization's network. For example, the sponsoring organization adopts a [[philosophy]] of self-regulation and offers the user connection to the local network and also connection to the Internet providing that the user accepts the fact she/he is going to be personally responsible for actions taken when connected to the network or Internet. This may mean that the organization is not going to provide any warning system should the user contravene policy, maintaining that it is up to the user to know when his/her actions are in violation of policy.
Often Acceptable Use Policy documents provide a statement about the use of the network and/or Internet and its [https://web.archive.org/web/20070331155213/http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/Technology/AUP/home.shtml uses and advantages] to the business, school or other organisation sponsoring connection to the Internet. Such a statement may outline the benefit of email systems, ability to gain information from [[website]]s, connection with other people through the use of [[instant messaging]], and other similar benefits of various protocols including the relatively new VoIP services.

The most important part of an AUP document is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070701161457/http://title3.sde.state.ok.us/technology/aup.htm code of conduct] governing the behaviour of a user whilst connected to the network/Internet. The [[Code of Conduct|code of conduct]] may include some description of what may be called netiquette which includes such items of conduct as using appropriate/polite language while online, avoiding [[Law|illegal]] activities, ensuring that activities the user may embark on should not disturb or disrupt any other user on the system, and caution not to reveal [[Personally identifiable information|personal information]] that could be the cause of [[identity theft]].

Most AUP statements outline [http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces consequences of violating] the policy. Such violations are met with consequences depending on the relationship of the user with the organisation. Common actions that schools and universities take is to withdraw the service to the violator and sometimes if the activities are illegal the organization may involve appropriate authorities, such as the local police. Employers will at times withdraw the service from employees, although a more common action is to terminate employment when violations may be hurting the employer in some way, or may compromise [[security]]. [http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces Earthlink], an American [[Internet service provider]] has a very clear policy relating to violations of its policy. The company identifies six levels of response to violations:

* issue warnings: written or verbal
* suspend the Member's newsgroup posting privileges
* suspend the Member's account
* terminate the Member's account
* bill the Member for administrative costs and/or reactivation charges
* bring legal action to enjoin violations and/or to collect damages, if any, caused by violations.

Central to most AUP documents is the section detailing unacceptable uses of the network, as displayed in the [http://nsit.uchicago.edu/policies/eaup/ University of Chicago AUP]. Unacceptable behaviours may include creation and transmission of [[Morality|offensive]], [[obscene]], or [[Decency|indecent]] [[document]] or [[image]]s, creation and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of material which is designed to cause [[annoyance]], inconvenience or [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], creation of [[defamatory]] material, creation and transmission that infringes [[copyright]] of another person, transmission of unsolicited [[Commerce|commercial]] or [[advertising]] material and deliberate unauthorised access to other services accessible using the connection to the network/Internet. Then there is the type of activity that uses the network to waste time of technical staff to troubleshoot a problem for which the user is the cause, corrupting or destroying other user's data, violating the privacy of others online, using the network in such a way that it denies the service to others, continuing to use software or other system for which the user has already been warned about using, and any other misuse of the network such as introduction of viruses.

[[Disclaimer]]s are often added in order to absolve an organisation from responsibility under specific circumstances. For example, in the case of [http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/tools/disclaimer.html Anglia Ruskin University] a disclaimer is added [[Absolve|absolving]] the University for errors or omissions or for any consequences arising from the use of information contained on the University website. While [[disclaimer]]s may be added to any AUP, disclaimers are most often found on AUP documents relating to the use of a website while those offering a service fail to add such clauses.

Particularly when an AUP is written for a college or school setting, AUPs remind students (or when in the case of a company, employees) that connection to the Internet, or use of a website, is a privilege, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070506164902/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/computing/policies/loughborough-aup.html demonstrated in the Loughborough University's Janet Service AUP] and not a right. Through emphasising this "privilege" aspect,  [http://www.niu.edu/aup/ Northern Illinois University] then make the connection that any abuse of that privilege can result in legal action from the University.

In a handbook for writing AUP documents, the Virginia Department of Education indicate that there are three other areas needing to be addressed in an AUP:

* a statement that the AUP is in compliance with state and national telecommunication rules and regulations
* a statement regarding the need to maintain personal safety and privacy while accessing the Internet
* a statement regarding the need to comply with Fair Use Laws and other copyright regulations while accessing the Internet

Through a cursory reading of [https://www.google.com/search?q=acceptable+use+policy&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enAU213AU213 AUP statements found by a Google Search] the variation of the inclusion of these items in AUP documents is highly variable. However, those statements in a school or university setting are more likely to include a statement to address at least the "personal safety" issue.

==Enforceability==
Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.3 This Policy shall be governed by the laws of England and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to the many jurisdictions covered by the Internet, the AUP document needs to specify the jurisdiction, which determines the laws that are applicable and govern the use of an AUP. Even if a company is only located in one jurisdiction and the AUP applies only to its employees, naming the jurisdiction saves difficulties of interpretation should legal action be required to enforce its statements.

AUP can be effectively enforced with Content and URL filters.

'''Act 250''', Vermont's Land Use and Development Act, is a law passed in 1970 by the [[Vermont]] legislature designed to mitigate the effects of development through an application process that addresses the environmental and community impacts of projects that exceed a threshold in size.

==Background==
[[land development|Development]] pressures resulting from the opening of two interstate highways ([[I-89]] and [[I-91]]) made access to the state much easier for year-round visitors, creating community concerns including road congestion, increased environmental problems, burden on local services, and rising taxes. Governor [[Deane C. Davis]] appointed a study commission in 1969 to develop a statewide law to address these concerns, as no environmental regulations or land use controls existed. A major contributor to the construction of the law was Laura G. Wheeler, in consultation with then Vermont Attorney General [[James Jeffords]].

==The law==
The law created nine District [[Environmental policy|Environmental]] Commissions to review large-scale development projects using 10 criteria that are designed to safeguard the environment, community life, and aesthetic character of the state. They have the power to issue or deny a permit to real estate developers for any project that encompasses more than 10 acres (40,000 m²), or more than one acre (4,000 m²) for towns that do not have permanent zoning and subdivision bylaws. The law also applies to any development project with more than 10 housing units or housing lots; and may also apply for construction proposed above {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of elevation. Act 250 also created the Vermont Environmental Board to review appeals coming from District Commission rulings.

===District Commissions===
The District Commissions are:

* District 1: [[Rutland County, Vermont|Rutland County]]
* District 2: [[Windham County, Vermont|Windham]] and southern [[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]]
* District 3: northern Windsor County and [[Orange County, Vermont|Orange counties]]
* District 4: [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]]
* District 5: [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington]] and [[Lamoille County, Vermont|Lamoille counties]]
* District 6: [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin]] and [[Grand Isle County|Grand Isle counties]]
* District 7: [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia]], [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans]] and [[Essex County, Vermont|Essex counties]]
* District 8: [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington County]]
* District 9: [[Addison County, Vermont|Addison County]]

=== Ten Criteria ===

The 10 Criteria are as follows:
# Will not result in undue water or air pollution.Included are the following considerations: (A) Headwaters; (B) Waste disposal (including wastewater and stormwater); (C) Water Conservation; (D) Floodways; (E) Streams; (F) Shorelines; and (G) Wetlands.
# Has sufficient water available for the needs of the subdivision or development.
# Will not unreasonably burden any existing water supply.
# Will not cause unreasonable soil erosion or affect the capacity of the land to hold water.
# Will not cause unreasonably dangerous or congested conditions with respect to highways or other means of transportation.
# Will not create an unreasonable burden on the educational facilities of the municipality.
# Will not create an unreasonable burden on the municipality in providing governmental services.
# Will not have an undue adverse effect on aesthetics, scenic beauty, historic sites or natural areas, and 8(A) will not imperil necessary wildlife habitat or endangered species in the immediate area.
# Conforms with the Capability and Development Plan which includes the following considerations: (A) The impact the project will have on the growth of the town or region: (B) Primary agricultural soils; (C) Productive forest soils; (D) Earth resources; (E) Extraction of earth resources; (F) Energy conservation; (G) Private utility services; (H) Costs of scattered developments; (J) Public utility services; (K) Development affecting public investments; and (L) Rural growth areas.
# Is in conformance with any local or regional plan or capital facilities program.

The 10 criteria have changed little since the adoption of Act 250 in 1970. Efforts have been made over the years to make the permitting process work more efficiently, along with performance standards. Today, the District Commissions receive between 600 and 800 applications per year, and hold hearings on an average of 20% of these. They have an approval record of 98%, but this rate includes plans modified during the hearing process, with conditions typically attached to permits when granted.

Act 250 jurisdiction attaches forever to permits, except to permits for quarries and logging at elevations over {{convert|2500|ft|m}}.    These permits are allowed to close when the work required to complete them is complete. There is not sufficient funding to support personnel to verify proper completion of the required activity, so the Act 250 office must rely on the permit applicant to truthfully verify completion.

One of the co-creators of Act 250 was Laura G. Wheeler of Barre Town, Vermont. Her highly successful campaign for state office having been cut short just before taking office due to medical limitations, she did not want to leave public service without ensuring a clean environment for future generations. That legacy took shape in the form of Act 250.  She consulted frequently with the then Attorney General [[James Jeffords]], who provided crucial guidance in the editing and perfecting Act 250 until it reached its final approved form. Wheeler spearheaded the campaign, researching the topic fully and consulting with many experts to ensure its success. Others who were consulted on and were instrumental in its creation include, but are not limited to: Howard Rusk of New York, Jeanne Garvin of [[Montpelier, Vermont]] and Lawrence Gurnette of Michigan.
 
Per interview with Wheeler, her primary motive was to create a more beautiful Vermont by protecting clean rivers, the forest's ability to support clean air and abundant wildlife, and to preserve Vermont's natural resources of all kinds for generations to come. Of greatest concern was forest conservation and the prevention of excessive clear cutting. She presented and promoted this landmark legislation before Congressional committee, so other leaders would have opportunity to benefit from the template created by Act 250 and be encouraged to enact similar measures in their home states. It met with great approval, with many legislators commenting that it was 'a long time coming', and 'a much needed effort to protect the planet as a whole.'

==Controversy==

The law has been controversial since its implementation,as some businesses interests do not like the restrictions placed on projects they wish to complete. In his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Governor [[Jim Douglas]] ran on a platform that included restructuring Act 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://middleburycampus.com/article/assessing-priorities-act-250-for-vermont-or-local-permit-reform-for-middlebury/ |title=Assessing Priorities Act 250 for Vermont or Local Permit Reform for Middlebury? |publisher=The Middlebury Campus |date=2003-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''Consumer Protection Act 1987''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/contents c 43]) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that made important changes to the [[consumer law]] of the United Kingdom. Part 1 implemented [[European Community]] (EC) [[Directive 85/374/EEC]], the product liability directive, by introducing a regime of [[strict liability]] for damage arising from defective products. Part 2 created government powers to regulate the safety of [[consumer product]]s through [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instrument]]s. Part 3 defined a [[criminal offence]] of '''giving a misleading price indication'''.

The '''Act''' was notable in that it was the first occasion that the UK government implemented an EC directive through an Act of Parliament rather than an [[Order in Council|order]] under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]].&lt;ref name="Gerven 2000 p.666"&gt;van Gerven ''et al.'' (2000) ''p.''666&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product liability==
Section 2 imposes [[civil liability]] in [[tort]] for [[damages|damage]] [[causation (law)|caused]] wholly or partly by a '''defect''' in a '''product'''. Liability falls on:
*Producers;
*Persons holding themselves out as producers, for example by selling [[private label]] products under their own [[brand]] ("own-branders"); and
*Importers into the European Union (EU) for commercial sale.

Liability is strict, and there is no need to demonstrate fault or [[negligence]] on behalf of the producer. Liability cannot be "written out" by an [[exclusion clause]] (s.7)

Damage includes (s.5):
*Death;
*[[Personal injury]];
*Damage to property, including [[real property|land]], provided that:
**The property is of a type usually intended for private use;
**It is intended for private use by a person making a claim; and
**The value of the damage is more than £275;
&amp;mdash; but damage to the product itself is excluded, as are other forms of [[pure economic loss]].&lt;ref&gt;Giliker &amp; Beckwith (2004) '''9-023'''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product===
A '''product''' is any goods or electricity and includes products aggregated into other products, whether as component parts, [[raw material]]s or otherwise (s.1(2)(c)) though a supplier of the aggregate product is not liable simply on the basis of that fact (s.1(3)). Buildings and land are not included though [[construction material]]s such as bricks and [[girder]]s are. Information and software are not included though printed instructions and [[embedded software]] are relevant to the overall safety of a ''product''.&lt;ref&gt;Giliker &amp; Beckwith (2004) '''9-020'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''Act''' did not apply to unprocessed [[game (food)|game]] or [[agricultural produce]] (s.2(4)) but this exception was repealed on 4 December 2000 to comply with EU Directive 1999/34/EC which was enacted because of fears over [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]].&lt;ref&gt;Shears ''et al.'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK SI|title=Consumer Protection Act 1987 (Product Liability) (Modification) Order 2000|year=2000|number=2771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=ssi|year=2001|number=265|ssi=The Consumer Protection Act 1987 (Product Liability) (Modification) (Scotland) Order 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defect===
Section 3 defines a '''defect''' as being present when "the safety of the product is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect". Safety is further defined as to apply to products that are component parts or raw materials in other products, and to [[risk]]s to property as well as risks of death and personal injury (s.3(1)).

The standard of safety that "persons generally are entitled to expect" is to be assessed in relation to all the circumstances, including (s.3(2)):
*The manner in which, and purposes for which, the product has been [[marketing|marketed]];
*Its "get-up";
*The use of any mark in relation to the product;
*Any instructions for, or warnings with respect to, doing or refraining from doing anything with or in relation to the product;
*What might reasonably be expected to be done with or in relation to the product; and
*The time when the product was supplied by its producer to another;
&amp;mdash; but the fact that older products were less safe than newer ones does not, of itself, render the older products '''defective'''.

===Limitation===
Schedule 1 amends the [[Limitation Act 1980]]. Claims under the '''Act''' are barred three years after the date when damage occurred or when it came to the knowledge of the claimant. However, no claim can be brought more than 10 years after the date the '''product''' was put into circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Limitation Act 1980, s.11A&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development risks defence===
{{main|Development risks defence}}
Section 4(1)(e) states that, in civil proceedings, it is a [[Defense (military)|defence]] to show that:

{{quotation | ... the state of [[science|scientific]] and [[technology|technical]] knowledge at the relevant time was not such that a producer of products of the same description as the product in question might be expected to have discovered the '''defect''' if it had existed in his products while they were under his control }}

This defence was allowed to member states as an option under the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;Art.15(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2004}}, all EU member states other than [[Finland]] and [[Luxembourg]] had taken advantage of it to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Giliker &amp; Beckwith (2004) '''9-029'''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept had been criticised and rejected by the [[Law Commission]] in 1977, particularly influenced by the [[thalidomide]] tragedy,&lt;ref&gt;''Liability for Defective Products'' (1977) No.82, Cmnd.6831, para.105&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Pearson Commission]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury'' (1978) Cmnd.7054&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hasson, R. A. | title=The Pearson Report: Something for Everyone? | journal=British Journal of Law and Society | volume=6 | year=1979 | pages=119–126 | doi=10.2307/1409710 | jstor=1409710 | issue=1 | publisher=British Journal of Law and Society, Vol. 6, No. 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK implementation differs from the version of the defence in Art.7(e) of the Directive:

{{quotation | ... the state of scientific and technical knowledge when [the producer] put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the '''defect''' to be discovered. }}

The directive seems to suggest that discovery of the defect must be impossible while the UK implementation seems to broaden the defence to situations where, while it would have been possible to discover the defect, it would have been [[reasonable man|unreasonable]] to expect the producer to do so. This difference led the [[Commission of the European Union]] to bring legal action against the UK in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Commission v. UK'' [1997] All ER (EC) 481&lt;/ref&gt; As there was at that time no UK case law on the defence, the [[European Court of Justice]] found that there was no evidence that the UK was interpreting the defence more broadly than the wording of the directive. This is likely to ensure that the UK legislation is interpreted to be consistent with the directive in the future, as was the case in ''[[A &amp; Others v. National Blood Authority]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2001] 3 All ER 289&lt;/ref&gt; where the judge referred to the directive rather than the UK legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Giliker &amp; Beckwith (2004) '''9-030'''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other defences===
*'''The defect is attributable to compliance with a requirement imposed by law''' (s.4(1)(a));
*'''The defendants did not at any time supply the product to another''' (s.4(1)(b)), for example where the product is [[theft|stolen]] or [[counterfeit]]ed;
*'''Supply by the defendants is not in the course of business''' (s.4(1)(c));
*'''The defect did not exist in the product when it was put in circulation''' (s.4(1)(d)), for example, where the product is damaged or altered;
*The supplier of a component or raw materials may plead that it was solely the '''design of the finished product into which his product was incorporated that was defective''' or that the '''defect in his product arose solely from compliance with the instructions of the designer of the finished product''' (s.4(1)(f)).

===Impact of the Act===
The UK was one of only a few EU member states that implemented Directive 85/374 within the three-year deadline.&lt;ref name="Gerven 2000 p.666"/&gt; There is a view that  the '''Act''' "probably represents the truest implementation" of the directive among member states. The UK did not take the option of applying a ceiling on claims for personal injury and in certain respects it goes further than the directive.&lt;ref&gt;van Gerven ''et al.'' (2000) ''pp''668-669&lt;/ref&gt;

The first claim under the '''Act''' was not brought to court until 2000, 12 years after the '''Act''' came into force and, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, there have been very few court cases. This pattern is common in other EU member states and research indicates that most claims are [[settlement (litigation)|settled]] [[out of court]]. Exact information on the impact of the '''Act''' is difficult to obtain as there is no reporting requirement similar to that under the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Giliker &amp; Beckwith (2004) '''9-036''' - '''9-038'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Report from the Commission on the Application of Directive 85/374 on Liability for Defective Products'' Com (2000) 893, para.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer safety==
Section 10 originally imposed a '''general safety requirement''' on consumer products but this was [[repeal]]ed when its effect was superseded by the broader requirements of the [[General Product Safety Regulations 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;Office of Public Sector Information (2005) [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20051803.htm#5 General Product Safety Regulations 2005 - Explanatory note]&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 11 gives the '''Secretary of State''', {{As of|2008|lc=on}} the [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]], the power to make, after consultation, [[regulation]]s by way of [[Statutory Instrument]] to ensure that:
*Goods are safe;
*Unsafe goods, or goods which would be unsafe in the hands of certain persons, are not made available to persons generally;
*That appropriate, and only appropriate, information is provided in relation to goods.

Regulations under this section cannot be made to apply to (s.11(7)):
*Growing crops and other things which are part of [[real property|land]] because they are attached to it;
*Water, food and [[fertiliser]];
*[[Natural gas|Gas]] supplied under the [[Gas Act 1986]] or the Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996;
*[[Controlled drug]]s and licensed [[medicinal product]]s.

===Enforcement authorities===
Every [[weights and measures authority]] in England, Wales and Scotland and every [[Local government in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland district council]] has a duty to enforce, as an '''enforcement authority''', the safety provisions in addition to the law on '''misleading price indications''' though these duties can be delegated by the '''Secretary of State''' (s.27). '''Enforcement authorities''' have the power to make [[test purchase]]s (s.28) and have powers of [[entry and search]] (ss.29-30). Further, a [[customs officer]] can detain goods (s.31). There are criminal offences of obstructing an officer of an '''enforcement authority''' or giving false information, punishable with a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] (s.32) and recovery of the costs of enforcement (s.35).

Appeal against detention of goods is to the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]], or in [[Scotland]] the [[Sheriff]] (s.33) and compensation can be ordered (s.34). There is a further right of appeal to the [[Crown Court]] in England and Wales, the [[County Court]] in Northern Ireland (s.33(4)).

===Breach of regulations===
Breach of '''regulations''' is a crime, punishable on [[summary conviction]] by up to 6 months' [[imprisonment]] and a fine of up to level 5 on the [[standard scale]] (s.12).

===Prohibition notices, notices to warn and suspension notices===
The '''Secretary of State''' may [[service of process|serve]] on any person (s.13):
*A '''prohibition notice''' prohibiting the supply of a product;
*A '''notice to warn''' requiring that a notice be published at the person's expenses warning about unsafe products.

An '''enforcement authority''' can serve a '''suspension notice''' prohibiting supply of a product for up to 6 months (s.14). The supplier can appeal a '''suspension notice''' to the Magistrates' Court, or in Scotland the Sheriff (s.15).

Breach of any such '''notice''' is a crime, punishable on summary conviction by up to 3 months' imprisonment and a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale (ss.13(4), 14(6)).

===Seizure and forfeiture===
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, an '''enforcement authority''' may apply to a Magistrates' Court for a '''forfeiture order''' to seize unsafe products where (s.16):
*There has been a contravention of regulations;
*An appeal has been made against a '''suspension order''' or ...
*A complaint has been made to the magistrates.

In Scotland a sheriff may make an order for '''forfeiture''' where there has been a contravention of safety regulations (s.17):
*On an application by the [[Procurator Fiscal]]; or
*Where a person is convicted of an offence under the '''Act''', in addition to any other penalty.

Appeal against '''forfeiture''' is to the Crown Court in England and Wales, the County Court in Northern Ireland (s.16(5)), or the [[High Court of Justiciary]] in Scotland (s.17(8)).

===Provision of information===
The '''Secretary of State''' may require information of any person in order to (s.18):
*Make, vary or revoke any safety '''regulations'''; or
*Serve, vary or revoke a '''prohibition notice'''; or
*Serve or revoke a '''notice to warn'''.

Failure to provide information is a crime, punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale. Provision of false information is a crime, punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to the [[statutory maximum]] and on [[indictment]] in the Crown Court of an unlimited fine (s.18(4)).

==Misleading price indications==
The '''Act''' created a crime of '''giving a misleading price indication''' in Part III where a person, in the course of business gives, by any means whatever, to a consumer an indication that is '''misleading''' as to the [[price]] at which any of the following is available (s.20)[note that Part III of the Act was repealed by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008]:
*Goods;
*Services or facilities, including (s.22):
**[[Credit (finance)|Credit]] or banking or insurance services, and incidental facilities;
**[[Foreign exchange market|Purchase or sale of foreign currency]];
**[[Electric power|Supply of electricity]];
**Provision of [[parking]] for [[motor vehicle]]s or [[travel trailer|caravan]]s, not including permanent residential [[caravan site]]s; or
*Accommodation, but not an [[interest in land]] unless (s.23):
**It was created or will be disposed of in the course of business; or
**It involves the sale of a new dwelling to a resident.

An offender can be sentenced, on summary conviction to a fine of up to the statutory maximum for Magistrates' Courts or, on conviction on indictment in the Crown Court to an unlimited fine (s.20(4)).

===Misleading===
A price indication is '''misleading''' if it conveys, or if consumers might reasonably be expected to infer, that (s.21):
*The price is less than in fact it is;
*The applicability of the price does not depend on facts or circumstances on which its applicability does in fact depend;
*The price covers matters in respect of which an additional charge is in fact made;
*Some person, who in fact has no such expectation, expects the price to be:
**Increased or reduced, whether or not at a particular time or by a particular amount; or
**Maintained, whether or not for a particular period; or
*The facts or circumstances by reference to which the consumers might reasonably be expected to judge the validity of any relevant comparison made or implied by the indication are not what in fact they are.

'''Criminal possession of a weapon''' is the unlawful [[Possession (law)|possession]] of a weapon by an individual. 

Many societies both past and present have placed restrictions on what forms of weaponry private citizens (and to a lesser extent police) are allowed to purchase, own, and carry in public.  Such crimes are [[public order crime]]s and are considered ''[[mala prohibita]]'', in that the possession of a weapon in and of itself is not evil.   Rather, the ''potential'' for use in acts of unlawful violence creates a perceived need to control them.  Some restrictions are [[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]], whereas others require some element of [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to use the weapon for an illegal purpose.  Some regulations allow a citizen to obtain a permit or other authorization to possess the weapon under certain circumstances.  Lawful uses of weapons by civilians commonly include hunting, sport, collection and [[right of self-defense|self-preservation]].

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Criminal possession of a weapon generally falls into one of several categories:
* '''Simple possession''' - The strictest of standards, some weapons are prohibited from any form of private ownership at all, even if kept in one's dwelling under secure conditions (such as a safe).  Typically this covers military devices, such as bombs, artillery, machine guns, nuclear devices and chemical weapons.  However, this may also include possession of otherwise-legal weapons by a person who is prohibited by law or court-order from possessing them (reasons include prior criminal convictions, conditions of probation or parole, and court-documented mental illness).
* '''Carry of a concealed weapon''' - A restriction on carrying of certain weapons on one's person in such a manner that it is hidden from view of others.  This can sometimes include somewhere in the same vehicle or close to one's immediate surroundings where the weapon is easily reachable.
* '''Carry in plain sight''' - The opposite of concealed carry, some jurisdictions make it a crime to carry certain weapons in plain view of others.  Reasons may be to prevent intimidation or menacing; to create a friendlier-looking population by removing visual symbols of violence; or to intimidate/control a segment of the population known for the carry of certain weapons (such as the samurai caste during the Meiji era).
* '''Carry on or about the person''' - A combination of the above, this type of restriction makes it illegal to carry the weapon at all, whether concealed or not.  This may or may not include the person's own land or place of business.

==Strict liability vs. specific intent==
All weapon possession crimes follow some standard of intent ([[mens rea]]), though this standard varies.&lt;ref name="BrodyBrody2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor Criminal Justice Program Washington State University Spokane David C Brody|author2=David C. Brody|author3=Distinguished Teaching Professor School of Criminal Justice University at Albany New York James R Acker|author4=James R. Acker|title=Criminal Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4PyAwAAQBAJ|date=7 July 2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-9845-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common is "strict liability," meaning that there is no requirement of intent whatsoever:  Merely being caught by law enforcement with the weapon in question under the circumstances described in the law (possession, concealed, or open) is a crime in and of itself, with almost no possible defense other than proving the item is not an illegal weapon within the law's definition.  Some laws allow the accused a defense to the charge that the item in question was going to be used for a specific set of lawful purposes, such as one's occupation (examples are sets of knives carried by a line cook en route to his job, or tools carried by a construction worker or craftsman).  In this case, the burden of proof is often placed on the accused, requiring them to prove their lawful intent in court. 

Other laws require proof of specific intent to commit a criminal act by the accused, thereby placing the burden on the state to produce evidence that the weapon was possessed with some unlawful purpose (such as an attempted homicide, robbery, or assault).  The circumstances under which law enforcement discover the weapon often play a strong role in this.

==Exceptions==
Many laws about weapon possession contain exemptions for persons of specific occupations, or allow for permission to be obtained from the government to lawfully possess the weapon. 

Generally, military personnel actively carrying out their duties are exempt from nearly any restriction other than internal policy and international treaties.  However, they are often restricted from possessing their issued weapons when they are not on duty.

Police often are allowed to lawfully possess certain weaponry above what the populace is allowed to possess, though this varies by nation and jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="mgal_GAM-"&gt;{{Cite web | title = GAM-Article - Criminal Law, Section 4-101 | author =  | work = mgaleg.maryland.gov | accessdate = 2015-03-20 | url = http://www.mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcr&amp;section=4-101&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2015RS&amp;tab=subject5 | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some nations police may take their armaments home when off duty, while in others they are required to leave all (or some) of them in storage at their station.  Some jurisdictions have special paramilitary units (such as [[SWAT]] or [[Authorised Firearms Officer|AFO]]) that carry machine guns, explosives or other military weapons, though the majority of the time these must be stored at the unit's headquarters.&lt;ref name="poli_Poli"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Police Arms and Weaponry | author =  | work = politics.co.uk | accessdate = 2015-03-20 | url = http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/police-arms-and-weaponry | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For civilians, permits can sometimes be obtained to possess or carry certain weapons if that person meets certain qualifications that show they can be trusted (such as safety training and lack of prior criminal behavior) and/or have a specific need for the weapon, for example if the nature of their job places them at high risk for assault or robbery.  The most common in the United States is a [[Concealed carry in the United States|permit to carry a concealed handgun]] for purposes of self-defense. This permit often applies to both firearms and other self-defense implements. In many states, no permit at all is needed to carry a non-concealed firearm or other weapon.  Other types of license can be obtained for collection and exhibition purposes, such as under the [[National Firearms Act]].&lt;ref name="atf.NFA"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Firearms - Frequently Asked Questions - National Firearms Act (NFA) - Firearms {{!}} ATF | author =  | work = atf.gov | accessdate = 2015-03-20 | url = https://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, a citizen can obtain a [[Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Licensing_and_legislation|firearms or shotgun certificate]] in order to legally purchase and own rifles or shotguns for the purposes of sport and hunting.

'''''Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch''''' [1941] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1941/2.html UKHL 2] is a landmark [[UK labour law]] case on the right to take part in [[collective bargaining]]. However, the actual decision which appears to allow secondary action may have been limited by developments from the 1980s.

Lord Wright famously affirmed that:

{{Cquote|Where the rights of labour are concerned, the rights of the employer are conditioned by the rights of the men to give or withhold their services. The right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining.}}

==Facts==
In the [[Harris Tweed]] industry on the island of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], several independent producers of tweed cloth were in a dispute with the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] over working conditions. The TGWU called on dockers in [[Stornoway]], also TGWU members to refuse to handle the yarn imported to the island by the producers.

==Judgment==
The House of Lords held that there was no actionable conspiracy in this case. [[Lord Chancellor Simon]] said,

{{quote|If the predominant purpose is the lawful protection or promotion of any lawful interest of the combiners (no illegal means being employed) it is not a tortious conspiracy, even though it causes damage to another person.&lt;ref&gt;[1942] AC 435, 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lord Thankerton said the following.&lt;ref&gt;[1942] AC 435, 460&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the present case the pressure was applied by means of action by the dock- ers, who were in no sense employees in, or directly connected with, the trade in Harris tweed; but employees in this trade were members of the same union, and the interest of the dockers and the trade employees in the union and its welfare were mutual, and I can see no ground for holding that it was not legitimate for the union to avail itself of the services of its docker members to promote the interests of the union.}}

Lord Wright affirmed that the union had a right to take part in collective bargaining and more than that said,

{{quote|It cannot be merely that the Appellants' right to freedom in conducting their trade has been interfered with. That right is not an absolute or unconditional right. It is only a particular aspect of the citizen's right to personal freedom, and like other aspects of that right is qualified by various legal limitations, either by statute or by common law. Such limitations are inevitable in organised societies where the rights of individuals may clash. In commercial affairs each trader's rights are qualified by the right of others to compete. Where the rights of labour are concerned, the rights of the employer are conditioned by the rights of the men to give or withhold their services. The right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;[1942] AC 435, 463&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7682">'''Custody and repatriation''' (C&amp;R; {{zh|s=收容遣送|p=shōuróng qiǎnsòng}}) was an [[administrative procedure]], established in 1982 and ended in 2003, by which the [[police in the People's Republic of China]] (usually cities) could detain people if they did not have a residence permit ([[hukou system|hukou]]) or temporary living permit (''zanzhuzheng''), and return them to the place where they could legally live or work (usually rural areas).  At times the requirement included possession of a valid [[national identity card]]. The system was abolished in 2003 after the [[death of Sun Zhigang]], a migrant worker who died from physical abuse while being detained under the C&amp;R system in [[Guangzhou]].

==Background==
In China there were reported to be some 800 detention camps in 2000 (not including [[Beijing]]), and by then several million people had been through them. As well as migrant workers, the Chinese camps usually contained vagrants, beggars, petitioners, and criminals, and the police ([[Public Security Bureau]]) earned income by this traffic and sometimes workers' unpaid labor. Often the detentions were unfairly long.&lt;ref name="hric"&gt;Nicolas Becquelin, "[http://www.hrichina.org/crf/article/4682 Enforcing the rural-urban divide: Use of Custody and Repatriation detention triples in 10 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720005911/http://www.hrichina.org/crf/article/4682 |date=July 20, 2012 }}", ''China Rights Forum'', 2002, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ostensible reason for the C&amp;R regulation in 1982 in China was to ameliorate the situation of people in the cities who were [[beggar]]s or [[homeless]]. Originally it applied to "three withouts persons," those with "no fixed place of residence, no means of livelihood and no permits to live in the city in question" but later it was applied in 1991 to others without just the residence or work permits.&lt;ref name="hric" /&gt;  It built on a 1961 Party directive implementing the hukou system of residence (traditional family registers found in several [[Asia]]n countries), work permits (issued by police on behalf of work units or employers) to prevent uncontrolled population movements, as passports and visas do internationally, and [[Resident Identity Card]]s.  In turn, this regulation extended older rules that were used to enforce extrajudicial movements of [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] troops away from liberated cities.  But as the [[economic development]] of cities in the [[East China|east]] later required increased domestic migrant workers, the regulations were not adequately adapted or were unfairly enforced, by the Public Security Bureau (police, supposed to be in charge of deportation) instead of the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] (supposed to be in charge of detention).  These abuses became apparent in years before 2003 and there were internal and external warnings and discussion, with some improvements but little effect overall. There were some unpublicized deaths similar to what later occurred.&lt;ref name="hric" /&gt;

==Debate and abolition==
{{main|Sun Zhigang incident}}
The legal procedure of C&amp;R for migrant workers was ended by the central government in 2003 after the [[death of Sun Zhigang]], a migrant worker who died from physical abuse while being detained under the C&amp;R system in [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref name="chinaorg"&gt;"[http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/69317.htm 84 Days and Nights in Guangzhou]", China.org.cn, 8 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to Sun's death, two groups of senior Chinese legal scholars wrote to the [[National People's Congress]], questioning the constitutionality of the custody and repatriation regulation.  One particular problem with the regulations was said to be that they had been adopted as regulations by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] and not as a law by the full Congress.  As a result, it was argued, the C&amp;R law for migrant workers was unconstitutional, on the grounds that it violated citizens' rights articles of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution]]. As in many other countries, Chinese law does not provide for constitutional judicial review, and — as in systems without a constitution, such as the UK — the legislature or administration instead of judges must change laws deemed unconstitutional. There has been some movement by [[legal reform]]ers to use courts and bureaucracy to experiment with [[constitutionalism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/china/beijing08/voices.htm Human Rights Watch - Sun Zhigang]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E Kellogg and Keith Hand, "[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA25Ad01.html China crawls slowly towards judicial reform]", Asia Times Online, 25 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar argument was that the custody and repatriation regulations "violate the 1996 Administrative Punishment Law, which states that administrative punishments which restrict [[personal freedom]] may only be authorized by laws passed by the [full] Congress."  Both criticisms echoed statements published in earlier years by lawyers and legal scholars.&lt;ref name="hric"&gt;Nicolas Becquelin, "[http://www.hrichina.org/crf/article/4682 Enforcing the rural-urban divide: Use of Custody and Repatriation detention triples in 10 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720005911/http://www.hrichina.org/crf/article/4682 |date=July 20, 2012 }}", ''China Rights Forum'', 2002, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the legal arguments, some reports by those with contact with the detention centers (including an official report) indicated that not only were the conditions worse than prisons  or [[Re-education through labor|reeducation]] camps (including beatings and prolonged detentions without trial), but also sometimes the police used the system to kidnap and extort more than expenses from the families of the accused.  These reports echoed earlier ignored warnings.&lt;ref&gt;Tong Yi, [http://hrichina.org/sites/default/files/oldsite/PDFs/CRF.2.2003/tongyi.pdf Kidnapping by Police: Custody &amp; Repatriation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031223923/http://hrichina.org/sites/default/files/oldsite/PDFs/CRF.2.2003/tongyi.pdf |date=October 31, 2011 }}", ''China Rights Forum'', 2003, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2003, [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] announced that the abolition of the custody and repatriation system, effective August 1. The detention centers would be replaced by service stations to care for poor beggars or homeless persons under the new ''Measures for Assisting Vagrants and Beggars with No Means of Support in Cities''. The centers for vagrants are not allowed to collect fees from families nor require them to work.  The legal system of hukou and residency and work permits for migrant workers was unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/12/china18244_txt.htm China: Beijing’s Migrant Construction Workers Abused]", Human Rights Watch, 12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dawkins v.

The case involved a defendant with a right to lawfully protect where he stood, but who used an illegal weapon with deadly force to stand his ground. 

The court wrote:
::''"[T]he 'stand your ground' law... provide[s] that a person has a right to expect absolute safety in a place they have a right to be, and may use deadly force to repel an intruder... for a person to be justified in using deadly force, the person must not be 'engaged in unlawful activity".''

In Brazil, the Doctor of Laws degree, known in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as '''''Doutor em Direito''''' or '''''Doutor em Ciências Jurídicas''''', is the highest academic degree in law available.

In some of the country's most important universities there is a higher title known as '''''livre docência''''', like the [[habilitation]] in some European countries. However, this higher title is not a degree in the strict sense, because ''livre docência'' nowadays is an internal title, that applies solely within the institution granting it.

In the past, ''livre docência'' was a degree in the fullness of the term, and a professor bearing the title would enjoy the privileges of ''livre docência'' if he transferred from one institution to another; there are still living professors who hold the "old" ''livre docência'' degrees; but all new titles of that name only confer privileges within the institution granting it.

The doctoral degree is awarded upon the completion and the successful defense of a [[thesis]] prepared by the doctoral candidate under the supervision of a tutor. The thesis must be examined by a board of five professors, holders of the title of doctor or of a ''livre docência''. Two of the members of the board must be professors from another institution. In most Brazilian Law Schools, the candidates are also required to earn a minimum number of credits.

Unlike the rules of other countries, the Brazilian norms governing the grant of doctoral titles do not require the publication of the thesis as a precondition for the award of the degree. Nevertheless, copies of the thesis must be delivered to the institution's library. Usually, doctoral thesis are published by specialized editors after the grant of the doctoral title.

If one obtains a doctoral title in a foreign country, one cannot enjoy the academic privileges of the title in Brazil unless the title be first validated by a Brazilian University. In that case, the doctor asking for the validation of the title will present his thesis and other documents relating to his foreign doctoral course to a board examiners of the Brazilian University and the examiners will then pass judgement on whether the work done by the candidate adheres to the minimum standards of quality that are usually required by a Brazilian university when granting doctoral degrees.

Admission to doctoral courses is almost universally reserved to holders of a master's degree (the Master's in Brazil is a graduate degree and is not the first professional degree). Therefore, a bachelor of Laws (a bearer of the first professional degree), seeking the degree of doctor must usually complete a postgraduate course to attain the degree of Master of Laws (to attain that degree one must write and defend a dissertation before a panel of three professors, bearing the title of master, doctor or a "livre docência, and also complete credits), and only then, after being a Master of Laws, one will apply for admission to a doctoral course.

There are, however, a few universities that allow "direct" admission to the doctoral course without previous completion of the Master's course in exceptional circumstances. Thus, in rare cases, a bachelor of Laws (i.e., a holder of the first professional degree), can be admitted directly to a doctoral course.

Usually, one is allowed three years time to complete a Master of Laws degree, and four years time to complete the doctoral course. So, if one were to graduate from Law School and immediately enter a Master of Laws course and a Doctor of Laws course in immediate succession, that person would become a doctor about seven years after graduating from the Law School. On the other hand, in the rare cases in which a bachelor of Laws is allowed to pursue a "direct" doctorate, he is usually allowed five years time to complete the doctoral course.

Unlike the Master of Laws dissertation, the Doctoral Thesys must contain an original contribution to the field of Law under study.

===Canada===

In Canada, there are several academic law-related doctorates: the Doctor of Laws (LL.D.); Doctor of Juridical Science or Doctor of Legal Science (J.S.D./S.J.D); Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.); and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).
The Doctor of Jurisprudence (Juris Doctor or J.D.) is the professional doctorate degree that is usually required for admissions to post-graduate studies in law.

The first law degree was known until recently as the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.). However, since law schools in Canada generally insist on a prior degree or some equivalent in order to grant admission, it was a more advanced degree than the LL.B. degrees awarded by programs abroad, which would accept high school graduates.&lt;ref name=G&amp;M&gt;{{cite web|last=Belford|first=Terrence|title=Why Change To A JD Degree?|url=http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/globecampusreport/why-change-to-a-jd-degree/|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=5 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620002834/http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/globecampusreport/why-change-to-a-jd-degree|archivedate=20 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Canadian universities now grant that degree rather than the LL.B.;&lt;ref name="osgoode.yorku.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osgoode.yorku.ca/media2.nsf/83303ffe5af03ed585256ae6005379c9/ef8025cc6549271e852574200056fcc8!OpenDocument|title=Osgoode Law School "Dean Patrick Monahan on the Growing Number of Canadian Law Schools Switching from the LLB to JD Degree Designation"|author=|date=|website=yorku.ca|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610142423/http://osgoode.yorku.ca/media2.nsf/83303ffe5af03ed585256ae6005379c9/ef8025cc6549271e852574200056fcc8%21OpenDocument|archivedate=10 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Saskatchewan]] replaced its LL.B. with a J.D. in 2010, because the Canadian LL.B. is equivalent to the J.D.&lt;ref name="U of S"&gt;{{cite web|title=Become A Juris Doctor|url=https://www.usask.ca/law/admissions/program_information/index.php|publisher=University of Saskatchewan Law School|accessdate=5 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510074112/http://www.usask.ca/law/admissions/program_information/index.php|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Canadian J.D. programs are three years, and all (except those in [[Quebec]]) have similar mandatory first-year courses: In "public", "constitutional," or "state" law; [[tort law]]; [[contract law]]; [[criminal law]], and some sort of "[[Practice of law|professional practice]]" course. Beyond first year and the minimum requirements for graduation, course selection is elective, with various concentrations such as business law, international law, natural resources law, criminal law, and Aboriginal law.

After the first law degree, one may pursue a second, the Masters of Laws (LL.M.) and after that, the Doctor of Law (LL.D.), at some Canadian universities. (The LL.D. is awarded by several universities only as an [[honorary degree]], but when awarded by a law school is an earned degree).

===Czech Republic and Slovakia (former Czechoslovakia)===
In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] the Doctor is a postgraduate degree in two types - as a traditional  doctorate (JUDr) and the PhD doctorate.

JUDr (Juris Utrisque Doctor) is a degree with a tradition of several centuries, originally the highest possible degree. Nowadays, its scholar importancy is quite limited, but it serves as a traditional and popular badge degree, especially useful for attorneys. In older times with no master's degree, JUDr. served as the only law degree (and was roughly equivalent to the today's master's degree, plus a special exam).  Requirements for obtaining a JUDr degree are a highly rated Master (Mgr.) degree in law, the compilation of a thesis (including successful defense) and passing an oral exam called ''[[Rigorosum]]''. The thesis itself is also sometimes called ''Rigorosum''. Many JUDr. theses are based on the students previous Master theses; however, nowadays universities require that the dissertation work is completely new.

Doctoral studies leading to PhD degree are  different from the JUDr exam. PhD studies are internal (PhD student is at the same time teacher at the University), which lasts 3–5 years, and external up to 8 years long. PhD. students are obliged to pass some exams during the studies and mainly to work on their dissertation. The PhD is intended basically for candidates interested in an academic career, and it gives them the right to teach at a university.

The Czech system is in many ways similar to the German and Austrian systems. Therefore, a PhD degree is necessary for habilitation procedure. Through habilitation, the doctor of law who submits his habilitation work (similar to German Habilitationsschrift) can be given a capacity and title of Docent (Doc.), similar to German Dozent, Privatdozent or US Assistant Professor. Docent is not a degree, but a scholar title.

Only a docent can be appointed a professor through a special procedure. Unlike Germany (and unlike the traditional Czech practice), a professor is not a function (a seat, Cathedra) at a University, but a scholarly title. This leads to many problems, especially the phenomenon of so-called "flying professors", who are teaching at two or three universities at the same time and to the decline of academic life.

===European and Commonwealth usage===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Europe]], the degree is a [[higher doctorate]] usually awarded on the basis of exceptionally insightful and distinctive [[publication]]s that contain significant and original contributions to the study of law. Some universities, such as the [[University of Oxford]], award a Doctor of Civil Law degree instead.  In [[South Africa]] the LL.D. is awarded based upon research and completion of a Ph.D. equivalent dissertation; the LL.D. may also be awarded as an honorary degree based upon contributions to society; see [[#South_Africa|below]].

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], the Doctor of Laws ({{lang-fi|Oikeustieteen tohtori}}, OTT) ({{lang-sv|Juris doktor}}, JD) is the highest academic degree in law, based on 60 credits of course studies and, most importantly, successful completion of a doctoral dissertation. The dissertation usually takes the form of a [[monograph]] at least of 250 pages in length, or of a series of published articles. A successful oral disputation is also required. It usually takes at least four years to complete the degree.

The degree of the Doctor of Laws does not qualify its holder for judicial offices. Instead, the degree of the Master of Laws ({{lang-fi|Oikeustieteen maisteri}}) ({{lang-sv|Juris magister}}) is the requirement for the membership of the [[Finnish Bar Association]] and for judicial offices. As the doctoral programs for the doctoral degree are, in principle, open for the holders of all master's degrees, the possession of the degree of the Doctor of Laws is not a guarantee for the possession of the Master of Laws -degree. However, it is very seldom that someone who has not graduated in law graduates for a doctor of law.

===France===

In France, the Doctor of Law degree (''doctorat en droit'') is a PhD. The PhD in law is required to teach at the university level as a ''maître de conférences'' (lecturer). To become Professor of Law, holders of a PhD in law have yet to pass an additional competitive exam: the ''[[agrégation de droit]]''. Only the first year (''master 1'') of the [[master’s degree#Comparable European degrees|master's degree]] in law is necessary to pass the bar exam.

===Germany===
The Doctor of Laws (''Doktor der Rechte'') is the terminal degree in law, abbreviated as '''Dr. iur.''' ''(Doctor iuris)'' or '''Dr. jur.''' ''(Doctor juris)''. The terminology varies: while most universities refer to the degree as Doctor of Laws (''Doktor der Rechte'' (pl.), e.g. [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Münster|Münster]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin (HU)]], [[University of Cologne|Cologne]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]), some others refer to it either as Doctor of Jurisprudence (''Doktor der Rechtswissenschaft'', e.g. [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]]) or Doctor of Law (''Doktor des Rechts'' (sg.), e.g. [[Free University of Berlin|Berlin (FU)]]). It is conferred based on a thesis consisting of a suitable body of original academic research, and an oral examination (''Rigorosum'' or ''Disputation''). The thesis must have been published as a book or - less common - as a series of articles in a peer reviewed law journal before the degree can be formally conferred. Admission usually requires the grade of "Fully Satisfactory" (approximately top quintile of class) in the student's first ''[[Staatsexamen]]'' (the Master's level first professional degree). Having successfully passed the second ''Staatsexamen'' (the German equivalent to the [[bar exam]]) is not required.

The Doctor of Both Laws (''Doktor beider Rechte''), awarded as '''Dr. iur. utr.''' (''[[JUD|Doctor iuris utriusque]]'', conferred e.g. in Würzburg) is rare, since it means considering both Civil Law and Canonical Law. A doctorate solely in the latter area is the degree of '''Dr. iur. can.''' ''(Doctor iuris canonici)''.

Approximately ten percent of German law graduates hold a doctoral degree. However, the Doctor of Laws is still only the first step to tenure at German law schools. Despite the initiative to establish a junior professorship with tenure option after five to seven years, and special professorships  specializing in teaching (''Lehrprofessur''), to become a university professor of law a ''habilitation'' (de iure not an academic degree) is still mandatory at most German law schools.

===Italy===
In Italy, the title of "Magister Doctor of Law" (''Dottore magistrale in Giurisprudenza'') is the title given to students who complete the five-year ''[[Laurea]] magistrale'' degree.

Despite the adoption of the [[Bologna process]], in Italy law remains a field that retains the traditional Italian system.

Once a prospective lawyer has been awarded the Magister Doctor of Law and worked 18 months as a trainee lawyer, he or she is required to pass a state bar examination in order to be licensed to practice as an attorney at law (''Avvocato''). Previously, ''dottore in giurisprudenza'' was the title given to the students that completed the old (four-year) course of studies in law.
After the five-year degree, it is possible to enroll in a Ph.D. course in a specific field of law ("Dottorato"), and the title obtained is "Dottore di ricerca" (Ph.D.).

===Malta===
In [[Malta]], the [[European Union]]'s smallest member state, the LL.D. is a doctorate-level academic degree in law requiring at least three years of post-graduate full-time study at the [[University of Malta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.um.edu.mt/laws/courses/ |title=Faculty of Laws - Faculty of Laws - University of Malta |publisher=Home.um.edu.mt |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123032456/http://home.um.edu.mt/laws/courses/ |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta's national university. At least three years of previous law study are required for entry. Students are required to complete coursework in a number of core areas of law, as well as to submit a thesis which is to be "an original work on the approved subject or other contribution to the knowledge showing that he/she has carried out sufficient research therein".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.um.edu.mt/laws/courses/lld.html |title=Faculty of Laws - Faculty of Laws - University of Malta |publisher=Home.um.edu.mt |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123032545/http://home.um.edu.mt/laws/courses/lld.html |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It confers the title of [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]], which in Malta is rigorously used to address a holder of the degree. The LL.D. is one of the requirements for admission to the profession of [[advocate]] in Malta (an advocate, as opposed to a legal procurator, has rights of representation in superior courts).

In Malta, practising lawyers are of three designations – notaries, legal procurators and advocates. The Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree is an [[undergraduate degree]] that of itself is not sufficient for admission into any of the legal professions. A one-year full-time taught post-graduate diploma of Notary Public (N.P.) is required after the LL.B. for admission to the profession of [[notary public]], while a taught post-graduate diploma of Legal Procurator (L.P.) is required for admission to the profession of [[legal procurator]]. A legal procurator is a lawyer in Malta that has rights of audience in the lower courts, a profession that was existent in Malta as early, and even prior to 1553.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjha.gov.mt/justice/lpchamber.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417022803/http://mjha.gov.mt/justice/lpchamber.html|date=April 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three professions also require members to be holders of a warrant issued by the President of Malta, obtainable after a minimum of one year of work experience in that profession, and examination. It is not possible for a Maltese lawyer to hold a warrant in more than one of the professions at a time.

Notable holders of the LL.D. degree include Dr. [[Ugo Mifsud Bonnici]] (former President of Malta), Prof. [[Guido de Marco]] (former President of the United Nations General Assembly and former President of Malta), Dr. [[George Borg Olivier]] (first post-independence Prime Minister of Malta), Dr. [[Edward Fenech Adami]] (former Prime Minister and former President of Malta) and Dr. [[Lawrence Gonzi]] (former Prime Minister of Malta).

As of 2014 changes to the law course resulted from the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], will remove the Doctorate of Laws (LLD) title and replace it with Master of Laws (LLM). This means that prospective lawyers will not be honored with a doctorate degree and can no longer use the title "Dr". This was met by some contempt from prospective Law students mainly because the title "Dr" is seen to be of higher esteem in Maltese society.  Students of other disciplines, however, welcomed the change. The program had always been in essence only a master's degree and was therefore viewed as discriminatory, especially by medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/32958/law-students-want-to-retain-dr-title-20140108#.U1zJofldVQQ|title=Law students want to retain ‘Dr’ title|work=MaltaToday.com.mt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427170309/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/32958/law-students-want-to-retain-dr-title-20140108#.U1zJofldVQQ|archivedate=2014-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis will demonstrate evidence of in-depth [[independent research]] and understanding of the topic, and constitute an original scientific contribution. Admission is usually on the basis of an [[Master of Laws#South Africa|LLM]], and in some cases an [[Bachelor of Laws#South Africa|LLB]].

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], the Doctor of Laws (LLD) is the highest academic degree in law. It is a research degree, which combines 240 credit hours (or equivalent of four full-time years of work). Candidates have the option to complete a dissertation or a monograph of a series of published articles. Although not required to practice law, the LLD is a prerequisite for an academic career.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], the degree of Doctor of Laws is a higher doctorate, ranking above the [[Ph.D.]], awarded upon submission of a portfolio of advanced research.  It is also often awarded ''honoris causa'' to public figures (typically those associated with politics or the law) whom the university wishes to honour.  In most British universities, the degree is styled "Doctor of Laws" and abbreviated LL. D.; however, some universities award instead the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, abbreviated DCL.

In former years, Doctors of Law were a distinct form of lawyer who were empowered to act as advocates in civil law courts. The Doctors had their own Society called [[Doctors' Commons]], but following reforms in the nineteenth century their exclusive rights of audience were shared with barristers and the last Doctor of Law died in 1912. Due to the possession of a Doctorate, the Doctors of Law had precedence equal to that of a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] and for this reason the convention remains that advocates holding junior doctorates (such as Doctors of Philosophy) should not be addressed as "doctor" in an English court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law]]'', Entry "Doctor of Law" &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, a case was brought under long-dormant law in the [[High Court of Chivalry]]. The opening arguments in that case were by [[George Drewry Squibb]] who argued, to the satisfaction of the court, that since the modern class of Doctors of Laws were no longer trained as advocates, their role must necessarily be performed by barristers.&lt;ref&gt;Squibb, G.D. ''The High Court of Chivalry''. Oxford University Press, London. {{ISBN|0-19-825140-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because Victorian reforms, which had unified the other classes of court attorney into the single profession of Barrister, had overlooked the Doctors of Law.

===United States===
{{Legal education in the United States}}

In the United States, the most common Doctor of Law degree is the [[Juris Doctor]] (or Doctor of [[Jurisprudence]]), abbreviated as J.D.  It is the [[professional degree]] for lawyers, having replaced the [[Bachelor of Laws]] in the 20th century after [[law schools]] began to require a [[Bachelor's degree]] before admission to a J.D. program to study law for three years.  A research [[dissertation]] is not required for the J.D., but the [[American Bar Association]] issued a Council Statement stating that the J.D. should be considered equivalent to the Ph.D. for educational employment purposes.&lt;ref name="ABAStatement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Statement by the American Bar Association|url=https://www.abanet.org/legaled/accreditation/Council%20Statements.pdf|publisher=ABA|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726103926/http://www.abanet.org/legaled/accreditation/Council%20Statements.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, some universities also have developed other new interdisciplinary professional doctorates that may combine law and other specialized or applied fields. One example of this is Northeastern University's Doctor of Law and Policy (D.L.P.) degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cps.northeastern.edu/academics/program/doctor-law-and-policy|title=Doctor of Law and Policy {{!}} Northeastern College of Professional Studies|website=cps.northeastern.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, other universities award a higher postdoctoral research degree in law, the [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] (or Scientiae Juridicae Doctor), abbreviated as S.J.D. or D.J.S.  Applicants for S.J.D. programs must first earn a J.D., and some programs require both a J.D. and an LL.M. before admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.gwu.edu/ACADEMICS/DEGREES/Pages/sjd.aspx |title=Doctor of Juridical Science Degree |publisher=Law.gwu.edu |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105143245/http://www.law.gwu.edu/Academics/degrees/Pages/sjd.aspx |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/graduate/sjd_general.html |title=Georgetown Law&amp;nbsp;– Doctor of Juridical Science (Admissions) |publisher=Law.georgetown.edu |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016011751/https://www.law.georgetown.edu/Graduate/sjd_general.html |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Ph.D., the S.J.D. is a research doctorate and has been described as the "highest degree in law" by the University of Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/prospectives/grad/graduate.htm |title=LL.M. and S.J.D.

The '''Erika''' legislative packages of the [[European Union]] are [[maritime law]]s intended to improve safety in the shipping industry and thereby reduce environmental damage to the [ocean]s.

The packages are named after the oil tanker ''[[MV Erika|Erika]]'', which broke apart in a storm in the [[Bay of Biscay]] off the coast of France in 1999, spilling over 10,000 [[tonnes]] of heavy fuel oil, polluting {{convert|400|km|mi}} of coastline. This incident prompted the EU to pass the first two measures addressing maritime safety.&lt;ref name="erika-i-sum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="erika-i-com"/&gt; The third package was spurred in part by the 2002 sinking of the oil tanker ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' off the coasts of Spain and France. That accident, the largest environmental disaster in Spain's history, was caused in part because Spanish authorities denied the distressed vessel entry to a safe harbour.&lt;ref name="stormy"/&gt; [[European Council]] officials claim that the ''Prestige'' disaster would not have been possible if the first two Erika packages had been fully implemented and enforced at the time.&lt;ref name="sunken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="euronews"/&gt;

The Erika packages comprise modifications of the existing legislation ('''Erika I'''), innovations in the EU law ('''Erika II'''), and integrate international standards with the Community legislation ('''Erika III'''). The laws reinforce certification requirements for shipping and establish inspection and verification controls. They also imply greater responsibilities for the shipping companies. Each EU country was required to install appropriate authorities and new or reinforced methods of control.

==Erika I==
In March 2000, the [[European Commission]] presented three proposals for "immediate actions" to modify the standards in force relating to tankers and ships transporting dangerous or polluting material.&lt;ref name="erika-i-com"/&gt; These regulations entered into force on 22 July 2003.&lt;ref name="erika-i-sum"/&gt;

===Port state control===
The first proposal amended Directive 95/21/EC to control the entry of ships into EU ports. Ships older than 15 years that have been detained more than twice in the previous two years are added to a "blacklist" published by the Commission, and are denied entry to any EU port. As ships get older, they are subject to increasing levels of inspection. Inspections must target one of the ballast tanks. Ships are required to communicate certain information before entering ports to facilitate inspection.&lt;ref name="erika-i-sum"/&gt;

===Classification societies===
The second proposal, related to Directive 2001/105/EC, more strictly monitors the [[Classification society|classification societies]] that inspect ship quality on behalf of EU member states. It places more stringent criteria on the societies, and gives the Commission the right to suspend or withdraw recognition from socieities that fail to comply with the Directive using a simplified procedure.&lt;ref name="erika-i-sum"/&gt;

===Double-hull oil tankers===
The last proposal speeds up the replacement of single-hull oil tankers with double-hull designs, which are less likely to leak.  {{As of|2010|1|1}}, single-hull crude oil tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight, or product carriers of 30,000 tons deadweight, are banned from the ports and internal waters of EU member states. Single-hull oil tankers of both types of 600 tons deadweight or more will be banned by 2015,{{Update after|2015|1|1}} or when they reach 25 to 30 years of age depending upon the tanker's regulatory status.&lt;ref name="erika-i-com"/&gt;

===Enactment of Erika I===
The European Union Directives required member states to enact national laws enabling these rules by 22 July 2003. As of 25 July 2003, only [[Denmark]], France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom had done so, leading the European Commission to initiate legal proceedings against 10 other member states that had failed to do so.&lt;ref name="e1-action"/&gt;

In June 2004, France was found to have failed to fulfil its inspection duties under Erika I by the European Court of Justice. France blamed the failure on personnel shortages.&lt;ref name="perils"/&gt;

==Erika II==
Following the first series of regulations, the Commission proposed a second set of legislation consisting of one Directive and two Regulations. These measures were intended to bring lasting improvements in the protection of European waters against accidents at sea and marine pollution.&lt;ref name="erika-ii-dir2002-84"/&gt;

===Maritime traffic monitoring and control===
Directive 2002/59/EC&lt;ref name="erika-ii-dir2002-59"/&gt; established a maritime-vessel monitoring, control, and information system. Because 90 percent of the EU's external trade is seaborne, and the ocean trade routes with Europe have notable geographic chokepoints like the [[Strait of Dover]] and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], heavy oceangoing traffic can occur, increasing the risk of an environmental accident. Therefore, a traffic monitoring and control system reduces the risk of accidents.&lt;ref name="erika-ii-sum"/&gt;

All ships of 300 gross tonnage and upwards, regardless of cargo, are covered. Exceptions are made for warships; fishing vessels, traditional ships, and recreational craft less than {{convert|45|m|ft}} in length, and [[barge|bunkers]] below 5,000 tons.

Ships bound for EU ports must notify the port authority 24 hours in advance, when feasible. Ships must have an [[Automatic Identification System]] (AIS) and a [[Voyage Data Recorder]] (VDR) system (a "[[Voyage data recorder|black box]]" for ships, used for accident investigations).

Dangerous or polluting goods on board a ship must be declared by the shipper to the master or operator of the vessel, who must then in turn provide the information to the authorities. The master of a ship is required to immediately report any incident or accident affecting the safety of the ship or other shipping, any sightings of polluting materials or drifting containers, and any situation liable to lead to pollution of EU waters or shores.

In poor weather, ships may be prevented from leaving port. EU member states are required to provide places of refuge for ships in distress.

===COPE Fund===
A proposed regulation would set up the '''COPE Fund''', a compensation fund for victims of oil spills in European waters. The fund would compensate victims with justified claims that exceed the international regieme's compensation limit of 200 million Euros. The fund's compensation limit is {{Currency|1 billion|EUR}}. It is proportionally financed by European businesses that receive more than 150,000 tonnes of crude oil and heavy fuel per year.&lt;ref name="erika-ii-sum"/&gt;

This regulation also provides financial penalties for those found guilty of grossly negiligent behaviour in the transport of oil by sea.&lt;ref name="erika-ii-sum"/&gt;

===European Maritime Safety Agency===
{{Further|European Maritime Safety Agency}}
Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 created the European Maritime Safety Agency.&lt;ref name="erika-ii-1406-2002"/&gt; The agency was created "to ensure a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships in the Community."&lt;ref name="erika-ii-emsa"/&gt;

==Erika III==
The third and final maritime safety package addressed civil liability and [[Flag State|flag states]]. The [[Prestige oil spill|''Prestige'' oil spill]] showed that the existing regulations were inadequate, according to the Parliament member that guided the legislation.&lt;ref name="euronews"/&gt;  "We could have avoided the ''Prestige'' oil spill," said Loyola de Palacio, vice-president in charge of Transport and Energy, claiming that the spill would not have happened if the European Commission's Erika I and II proposals had been fully adopted and implemented.&lt;ref name="sunken"/&gt;

The Commission proposed the package on 23 November 2005.&lt;ref name="atrisk"/&gt; The European Parliament adopted the package on 11 March 2009.&lt;ref name="adopt-third"/&gt; The laws entered into force on 17 June 2009, although the directives must then be implemented by the domestic laws of the member states before they become effective.&lt;ref name="amclub"/&gt;

===Flag States===
Directive 2009/21/EC requires that the flags of all EU countries have good standing, and not be on the black or grey list established by the [[Paris Memorandum of Understanding]] on [[Port State Control]]. It also codifies the [[International Maritime Organization]]'s flag-state audit scheme into law.&lt;ref name="e3-flag"/&gt;

===Classification societies===
The existing directive covering classification societies was split into Regulation (EC) 391/2009 (containing a recognition scheme, obligations, and penalties) and Directive 2009/15/EC (governing relations between EU countries and recognised classification societies).

The societies must set up an independent joint body to certify their quality-management systems. Organizations can be fined, or have their recognition withdrawn, if they fail to do their job properly. Approved societies must co-operate, recognising each other's classification certificates when the relevant regulations are equivalent.&lt;ref name="e3-class"/&gt;

=== Port State Control ===
Directive 2009/16/EC reformed the EU's Port State Control scheme. All ships calling on EU ports must be inspected, even if they only rarely visit the EU. A risk profile is established for each ship, based on its type, age, flag, company history, and detainment history. Depending on the risk profile, ships may be inspected as often as every six months, or as infrequently as every three years. Substandard ships are subject to a mandatory minimum ban period, and repeat offenders may be permanently banned. This provision was controversial, with some member states of the EU arguing that the costs would be too great. All five [[Malta|Maltese]] ministers of the European Parliament voted against the measures; the ''Erika'', the vessel whose oil spill spurred the creation of these laws, was a Maltese-flagged vessel.&lt;ref name="stormy"/&gt;

The directive also establishes a blacklist of companies operating substandard ships, published under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.

Increased qualification and training requirements for Port State Control inspectors are also included in the directive.&lt;ref name="e3-psc"/&gt;

=== Traffic monitoring ===
Erika II's traffic-monitoring requirements were amended by Directive 2009/17/EC, enhancing the traffic monitoring requirements. The directive sets [[SafeSeaNet]] as the standard maritime data exchange system for the EU, and establishes a European center to collect identification data and monitor shipping.

The "place of refuge" provision of the original directive was revised with more detailed rules, in response to the ''Prestige'' spill.

Under the amendments, all fishing vessels over {{convert|15|m|ft}} in length will eventually be equipped with AIS.

The amendments also provide for information and prevention measures when ice formation places shipping at risk.&lt;ref name="e3-tm"/&gt;

===Accident investigation===
Directive 2009/18/EC provides guidelines for technical investigations and dissemination of "lessons learnt" following accidents at sea. It is based on the International Maritime Organization's existing code requirements, giving the principles of that code the force of law. With this directive, maritime accidents now have rules about technical investigations similar to those for civil-aviation and railway accidents.&lt;ref name="e3-accident"/&gt;

===Passenger carrier liability===
A modern and uniform set of rules for compensating passengers who are the victim of an accident at sea was established by Regulation (EC) No 392/2009. It extends the IMO's Athens Convention, which was already part of EU law.

In the case of sinking, collision, or shipwreck, victims no longer have to prove the carrier was at fault, and may receive up to {{Currency|464000|EUR}} in damages as set by a judge. However, for accidental injuries like slips and falls, the victim must still prove fault. All carriers must be insured, and victims may apply directly to the insurance company for compensation.&lt;ref name="e3-liability"/&gt; Compensation for lost or damaged luggage is set at {{Currency|2587|EUR}}.&lt;ref name="euronews"/&gt;

These improvements will take effect by 2013,{{update after|2013}} at which time all Europeans travelling between countries will enjoy these protections. The regulation will eventually be extended to domestic travel as well.&lt;ref name="e3-liability"/&gt;

This regulation was initially opposed by some member states.&lt;ref name="stormy"/&gt;

===Shipowner insurance===
Before Directive 2009/20/EC was enacted, there was no legal requirement for European shipowners to carry insurance against damage to third parties caused by their ships. International law does not require such insurance. The directive requires European-flagged ships to carry coverage consistent with the International Maritime Organization's 1996 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC 1996) by 1 January 2012.&lt;ref name="e3-llmc"/&gt;

The trade association [[BIMCO]] called this provision "virtually toothless", noting that it generally reflects the current insurance regime.&lt;ref name="bimco"/&gt;

The '''Food and Drug Administration''' ('''FDA''' or '''USFDA''') is a [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], one of the [[United States federal executive departments]]. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting [[public health]] through the control and supervision of [[food safety]], [[tobacco]] products, [[dietary supplement]]s, [[Prescription drug|prescription]] and [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[pharmaceutical drug]]s (medications), [[vaccine]]s, [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[blood transfusion]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, [[Animal feed|animal foods &amp; feed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/AnimalFoodFeeds/default.htm |title= Animal Food &amp; Feeds |publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate= March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary products]]. As of 2017, 3/4th of the FDA budget (approximately $700 million) is funded by the pharmaceutical companies due to the [[Prescription Drug User Fee Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film |last=Knezev|first=Sasha |title=The Big Lie: American Addict 2 |date=2016 |section= Interview with Sidney Wolfe |accessdate= May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prescription drug user fee act|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/UserFees/PrescriptionDrugUserFee/default.htm|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA was empowered by the [[United States Congress]] to enforce the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], which serves as the primary focus for the Agency; the FDA also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the [[Public Health Service Act]] and associated regulations, many of which are not directly related to food or drugs. These include regulating lasers, cellular phones, condoms and control of disease on products ranging from certain household [[pet]]s to [[sperm donation]] for [[assisted reproduction]].

The FDA is led by the [[Commissioner of Food and Drugs]], appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Commissioner reports to the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]]. Scott Gottlieb, M.D. is the current commissioner, who took over in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/09/scott-gottlieb-confirmed-to-lead-food-and-drug-administration/ |title=Scott Gottlieb confirmed to lead Food and Drug Administration|last=McGinley|first=Laurie|date=May 9, 2017|website=|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has its [[headquarters]] in unincorporated [[White Oak, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="White Oak"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/BuildingsandFacilities/WhiteOakCampusInformation/ |title=White Oak Campus Information |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also has 223 field offices and 13 [[laboratories]] located throughout the 50 [[U.S. state|states]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=train&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Training/ClinicalInvestigatorTrainingCourse/UCM283299.pdf|title=FDA Overview|format=PDF|accessdate=August 30, 2012|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the FDA began to post employees to foreign countries, including China, India, Costa Rica, Chile, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm185769.htm|title=FDA's International Posts: Improving the Safety of Imported Food and Medical Products|accessdate=April 10, 2010|publisher=U.S Food &amp;  Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the agency began undertaking a large-scale effort to consolidate its 25 operations in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], moving from its main headquarters in Rockville and several fragmented office buildings to the former site of the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] in the White Oak area of [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="White Oak"/&gt;&lt;ref name=coordinates&gt;Coordinates of FDA Headquarters at White Oak, Maryland: {{coord|39.0353363|-76.9830894|region:US-MD_type:landmark|format=dms|name=FDA Headquarters at White Oak, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was renamed from the White Oak Naval Surface Warfare Center to the Federal Research Center at White Oak. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees on the campus in December 2003. Only one original building from the naval facility was kept. All other buildings are new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/business/25labs.html?pagewanted=all| title=F.D.A. Consolidates at Former Navy Site| date=February 24, 2009|last=Meyer|first=Eugene L.|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is slated to be completed by 2017, assuming future Congressional funding &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/BuildingsandFacilities/WhiteOakCampusInformation/ucm057328.htm| title=White Oak Campus Project Schedule| date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional facilities==
[[File:Toxicology Research at FDA (NCTR Campus) (6023336064).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Arkansas Laboratory in [[Jefferson, Jefferson County, Arkansas|Jefferson, Arkansas]] is the headquarters of the National Center for Toxicological Research]]
While most of the Centers are located in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area as part of the Headquarters divisions, two offices&amp;nbsp;– the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) and the [[Office of Criminal Investigations]] (OCI)&amp;nbsp;– are primarily field offices with a workforce spread across the country.

The Office of Regulatory Affairs is considered the "eyes and ears" of the agency, conducting the vast majority of the FDA's work in the field. Consumer Safety Officers, more commonly called Investigators, are the individuals who inspect production and warehousing facilities, investigate complaints, illnesses, or outbreaks, and review documentation in the case of medical devices, drugs, biological products, and other items where it may be difficult to conduct a physical examination or take a physical sample of the product.

The Office of Regulatory Affairs is divided into five regions, which are further divided into 20 districts. Districts are based roughly on the geographic divisions of the [[United States federal court system|federal court system]]. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. ORA also includes the Agency's network of regulatory laboratories, which analyze any physical samples taken.  Though samples are usually food-related, some laboratories are equipped to analyze drugs, cosmetics, and radiation-emitting devices.

The Office of Criminal Investigations was established in 1991 to investigate criminal cases. Unlike ORA Investigators, OCI Special Agents are armed, and don't focus on technical aspects of the regulated industries. OCI agents pursue and develop cases where individuals and companies have committed criminal actions, such as fraudulent claims, or knowingly and willfully shipping known adulterated goods in interstate commerce. In many cases, OCI pursues cases involving [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] violations (e.g., conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, mail fraud), in addition to prohibited acts as defined in Chapter III of the FD&amp;C Act. OCI Special Agents often come from other criminal investigations backgrounds, and work closely with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Assistant Attorney General]], and even [[Interpol]]. OCI receives cases from a variety of sources—including ORA, local agencies, and the FBI—and works with ORA Investigators to help develop the technical and science-based aspects of a case.  OCI is a smaller branch, comprising about 200 agents nationwide.

The FDA frequently works with other federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], and [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]. Often local and state government agencies also work with the FDA to provide regulatory inspections and enforcement action.

==Scope and funding==
The FDA regulates more than US${{Format price|2400000000000}} worth of consumer goods, about 25% of consumer expenditures in the [[United States]]. This includes $466 billion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in cosmetics and $18 billion in vitamin supplements. Much of these expenditures are for goods imported into the United States; the FDA is responsible for monitoring imports.&lt;ref name="NYT-2Nov08"/&gt;

The FDA's federal budget request for fiscal year (FY) 2012 totaled $4.36 billion,&lt;ref name=train/&gt; while the proposed 2014 budget is $4.7 billion.&lt;ref name=wright2013/&gt;  About $2 billion of this budget is generated by user fees. [[Pharmaceutical industry|Pharmaceutical firms]] pay the majority of these fees,&lt;ref name=wright2013&gt;{{Cite news|title = Drug Take-Back Programs – Coming To A Municipality Near You|date = October 2013|last = Wright|first = Rob|newspaper = Life Science Leader|publisher = VertMarkets at Knowledge Park|volume = 5|issue = 10|page = 6|department = Editor's Note|publication-place = Pennsylvania, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are used to expedite drug reviews.&lt;ref name="budget12"&gt;{{Cite news |work= The Washington Post |date=February 13, 2012 |author= ElBoghdady, Dina |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/fda-budget-stays-about-the-same-at-25-billion/2012/02/13/gIQAOtABBR_blog.html |title=FDA budget stays about the same at $2.5 billion |accessdate = August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA's federal budget request for fiscal year (FY) 2008 (October 2007 through September 2008) totaled $2.1 billion, a $105.8 million increase from what it received for fiscal year 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/BudgetReports/2008FDABudgetSummary/ucm082723.htm|title=FY 2008 Budget Summary|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, the FDA announced that the Bush Administration's FY 2009 budget request for the agency was just under $2.4 billion: $1.77 billion in budget authority (federal funding) and $628 million in user fees. The requested budget authority was an increase of $50.7 million more than the FY 2008 funding&amp;nbsp;– about a three percent increase. In June 2008, Congress gave the agency an emergency appropriation of $150 million for FY 2008 and another $150 million.&lt;ref name="NYT-2Nov08"&gt;{{Cite news|work=New York Times Magazine |date=November 2, 2008 |author=Gardiner Harris |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02fda-t.html |title=The Safety Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most federal laws concerning the FDA are part of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/default.htm|title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp; Act)|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (first passed in 1938 and extensively amended since) and are codified in [[Title 21 of the United States Code|Title 21, Chapter 9 of the United States Code]]. Other significant laws enforced by the FDA include the [[Public Health Service Act]], parts of the [[Controlled Substances Act]], the Federal Anti-Tampering Act, as well as many others. In many cases these responsibilities are shared with other federal agencies.

==Regulatory programs==
{{Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}

As of 2015, the agency regulates more than $1 trillion in consumer products, including:
* $466 billion in food 
* $275 billion in drugs
* $60 billion in cosmetics
* $18 billion in vitamin supplements&lt;ref&gt;''United States Food and Drug Administration.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fda.gov/&lt;/nowiki&gt; . Accessed October 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 
The programs for safety regulation vary widely by the type of product, its potential risks, and the regulatory powers granted to the agency. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections.  Inspection observations are documented on [[Form 483]].

In June 2018, the FDA released a [https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611177.htm statement] regarding new guidelines to help food and drug manufacturers "implement protections against potential attacks on the U.S. food supply".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611177.htm|title=Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new guidance to help manufacturers implement protections against potential attacks on the U.S. food supply|publisher=FDA|first1=Scott|last1=Gottlieb|date=June 19, 2018|access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the new guidelines includes the Intentional Adulteration (IA) rule, which requires strategies and procedures by the food industry to reduce the risk of compromise in facilities and processes that are significantly vulnerable.

===Canada-United States Regulatory Cooperation Council===
On February 4, 2011, [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Stephen Harper]] and [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] issued a "Declaration on a Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/04/joint-statement-president-obama-and-prime-minister-harper-canada-regul-0 |title=Joint Statement by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper of Canada on Regulatory Cooperation &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3931 |title=PM and U.S. President Obama announce shared vision for perimeter security and economic competitiveness between Canada and the United States |publisher=Prime Minister of Canada |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219142120/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3931 |archive-date=February 19, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced the creation of the Canada-United States Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) "to increase regulatory transparency and coordination between the two countries".&lt;ref name=OPM1&gt;{{cite web |date=December 7, 2011 |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4511 |accessdate= |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Canada |title=United States-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Joint Action Plan: Developing and implementing the Joint Action Plan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729152814/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4511 |archivedate=July 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health Canada]] and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the RCC mandate, undertook the "first of its kind" initiative by selecting "as its first area of alignment common cold indications for certain over-the-counter antihistamine ingredients (GC 2013-01-10)."&lt;ref name=GC20130110&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Government of Canada |series=Canada's Action Plan |title=Notice: Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Over-the-Counter (OTC) Products: Common Monograph Working Group: Selection of a Monograph for Alignment |url=http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/notice-regulatory-cooperation-council-rcc-over |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108070216/http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/rcc-ccr/notice-regulatory-cooperation-council-rcc-over |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and dietary supplements===
{{Main|Regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}
The regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is governed by various statutes enacted by the [[United States Congress]] and interpreted by the FDA. Pursuant to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] ("the Act")  and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] about both the composition and the health benefits of foods.

The FDA subdivides substances that it regulates as food into various categories—including foods, [[food additive]]s, added substances (man-made substances that are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and [[dietary supplements]]. Specific standards the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category.

===="FDA-Approved" vs. "FDA-Accepted in Food Processing"====
The FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the [[food processing industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.com/fda-acceptable-vs-fda-approved.php FDA Approved Coatings vs. FDA Acceptable Coatings – DECC Company – DECC Company]. Decc.com. Retrieved on October 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings, nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are "FDA Compliant" or "FDA Acceptable".

===Medications===
[[File:FDA Bldg 51 - Main Entrance (5161374834).jpg|thumb|FDA Building 51 houses the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.]]
The [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs.  A drug is considered "new" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different [[excipient]]s or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. The most rigorous requirements apply to ''new molecular entities'': drugs that are not based on existing medications.

====New medications====
New drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a [[new drug application]] (NDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/ | title = New Drug Application (NDA) | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, however, argue that the FDA standards are not sufficiently rigorous, allowing unsafe or ineffective drugs to be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Medical Nihilism |author=Jacob Stegenga |publisher=OUP |year=2018 |isbn= 9780198747048 | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=hr&amp;lang=en&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; New drugs are available only by prescription by default.  A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first.  A drug that is approved is said to be "safe and effective when used as directed".

Some very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols, as was the case during the 2015 Ebola epidemic with the use, by prescription and authorization, of [[ZMapp]] and other experimental treatments, and for new drugs that can be used to treat debilitating and/or very rare conditions for which no existing remedies or drugs are satisfactory, or where there has not been an advance in a long period of time. The studies are progressively longer, gradually adding more individuals as they progress from stage I to stage III, normally over a period of years, and normally involve drug companies, the government and its laboratories, and often medical schools and hospitals and clinics. However, any exceptions to the aforementioned process are subject to strict review and scrutiny and conditions, and are only given if a substantial amount of research and at least some preliminary human testing has shown that they are believed to be somewhat safe and possibly effective.

=====Advertising and promotion=====
The FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion reviews and regulates prescription drug advertising and promotion through surveillance activities and issuance of enforcement letters to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Advertising and promotion for over-the-counter drugs is regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

The drug advertising regulation&lt;ref&gt;21 CFR 202: Prescription Drug Advertising.&lt;/ref&gt; contains two broad requirements: (1) a company may advertise or promote a drug only for the specific indication or medical use for which it was approved by FDA. Also, an advertisement must contain a "fair balance" between the benefits and the risks (side effects) of a drug.

The term [[off-label]] refers to drug usage for indications other than those approved by the FDA.

=====Postmarket safety surveillance=====
After NDA approval, the sponsor must review and report to the FDA every patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref&gt;21 CFR 314.80: Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its [[MedWatch]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program]. Accessed October 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These reports are called "spontaneous reports" because reporting by consumers and health professionals is voluntary.

While this remains the primary tool of [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarket safety surveillance]], FDA requirements for postmarketing risk management are increasing.
As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional [[clinical trials]], called Phase IV trials.
In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans ("Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy" or "REMS") for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=LS|last2=Loh|first2=M|last3=Perrone|first3=J|title=Assuring safety of inherently unsafe medications: the FDA risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.|journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology : Official Journal of the American College of Medical Toxicology|date=June 2014|volume=10|issue=2|pages=165–72|doi=10.1007/s13181-013-0374-z|pmid=24414251|pmc=4057549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=WV|last2=Bramlet|first2=DA|last3=Ross|first3=JL|last4=Underberg|first4=JA|title=JCL roundtable: Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.|journal=Journal of Clinical Lipidology|date=October 14, 2016 |volume=10|issue=6|pages=1288–1296|doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2016.10.007|pmid=27919344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[thalidomide]] can cause birth defects but has uses that outweigh the risks if men and women taking the drugs do not conceive a child; a REMS program for thalidomide mandates an auditable process to ensure that people taking the drug take action to avoid pregnancy; many [[opioid]] drugs have REMS programs to avoid addiction and diversion of drugs.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt;  There is also a REMS program called [[iPLEDGE]] for the drug, [[isotretinoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovitwanichkanont|first1=T|last2=Driscoll|first2=T|title=A comparative review of the isotretinoin pregnancy risk management programs across four continents.|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1035–1046|date=6 March 2018|doi=10.1111/ijd.13950|pmid=29508918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Generic drugs====
Generic drugs are chemical equivalents of [[name-brand]] drugs whose patents have expired.&lt;ref name="TNBK"/&gt; In general, they are less expensive than their name brand counterparts, are manufactured and marketed by other companies and, in the 1990s, accounted for about a third of all prescriptions written in the United States.&lt;ref name="TNBK"/&gt;
For approval of a generic drug, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug.&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Equivalance of Generic Drugs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm073182.htm |title=Therapeutic Equivalence of Generic Drugs|accessdate=August 30, 2012|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called an "ANDA" ([[Abbreviated New Drug Application]]). As of 2012 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form.

=====Generic drug scandal=====
In 1989, a major scandal erupted involving the procedures used by the FDA to approve generic drugs for sale to the public.&lt;ref name="TNBK"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Cohen |first=Lynne |article=Government Policies and Programs&amp;nbsp;– United States&amp;nbsp;– Generic Drug Scandal |title=The New Book of Knowledge&amp;nbsp;– Medicine And Health |date=1990 |p=276–281 |isbn=978-0-7172-8244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges of corruption in generic drug approval first emerged in 1988, in the course of an extensive congressional investigation into the FDA. The oversight subcommitee of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee|United States House Energy and Commerce Committee]] resulted from a complaint brought against the FDA by [[Mylan Laboratories Inc.]] of Pittsburgh. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in [[racketeering]] and in violations of [[antitrust law]]. "The order in which new generic drugs were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications" and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies. During the summer of 1989, three FDA officials (Charles Y. Chang, David J. Brancato, Walter Kletch) pleaded guilty to criminal charges of accepting bribes from generic drugs makers, and two companies ([[Par Pharmaceutical]] and its subsidiary Quad Pharmaceuticals)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/12/business/fda-details-problems-at-drug-makers.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=F.D.A. Details Problems at Drug Makers | date=September 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; pleaded guilty to giving bribes.

Furthermore, it was discovered that several manufacturers had falsified data submitted in seeking FDA authorization to market certain generic drugs. Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of New York, which sought approval of a generic version of the drug [[Dyazide]], a medication for high blood pressure, submitted Dyazide, rather than its generic version, for the FDA tests. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. Dozens of drugs were eventually suspended or recalled by manufacturers. In the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] filed securities fraud charges against the Bolar Pharmaceutical Company, a major generic manufacturer based in Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name="TNBK"/&gt;

====Over-the-counter drugs====
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs like [[aspirin]] are drugs and combinations that do not require a doctor's prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] FDA. Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA has a list of approximately 800 approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products.
Many OTC drug ingredients had been previously approved prescription drugs now deemed safe enough for use without a [[physician|medical practitioner]]'s supervision like [[ibuprofen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/handbook/otcintro.htm | title=FDA CDER Handbook: Over-the-Counter Drug Products | accessdate=October 9, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=May 12, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512224542/http://www.fda.gov/cder/handbook/otcintro.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ebola treatment====
In 2014, the FDA added an [[Ebola]] treatment being developed by Canadian pharmaceutical company Tekmira to the [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|Fast Track program]], but halted the phase 1 trials in July pending the receipt of more information about how the drug works. This is seen as increasingly important in the face of a [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak|major outbreak of the disease in West Africa]] that began in late March 2014 and continued {{asof|2014|August|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah |title=The FDA recently halted trials on a potential Ebola treatment |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/8/3/5962381/ebola-outbreak-vaccine-fda-halted-trials |website=www.vox.com |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=August 4, 2014|date=2014-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology===
[[File:Blood Research- Saving Lives (8352) (9759352093).jpg|thumb|FDA scientist prepares blood donation samples for testing]]
The [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/ |title=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) |website=FDA |date=March 2, 2017 |access-date=May 12, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs.

The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]], with additional authority established by the 1944 [[Public Health Service Act]]. Along with these Acts, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the [[National Institutes of Health]]; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972.

The [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health]] (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all [[medical device]]s, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/ucm300639.htm CDRH Mission, Vision and Shared Values] Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&amp;C Act, and it includes products from the simple [[toothbrush]] to complex devices such as implantable [[neurostimulator]]s. CDRH also oversees the safety performance of non-medical devices that emit certain types of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Examples of CDRH-regulated devices include [[cellular phones]], [[Airport security|airport baggage screening equipment]], [[television|television receivers]], [[microwave oven]]s, [[tanning booth]]s, and [[laser|laser products]].

CDRH regulatory powers include the authority to require certain technical reports from the manufacturers or importers of regulated products, to require that radiation-emitting products meet mandatory safety performance standards, to declare regulated products defective, and to order the recall of defective or noncompliant products. CDRH also conducts limited amounts of direct product testing.

===="FDA-Cleared" vs "FDA-Approved"====
Clearance requests are for medical devices that prove they are "substantially equivalent" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate "safety and efficacy", for example it may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Both aspects need to be proved or provided by the submitter to ensure proper procedures are followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194460.htm|title=What does it mean when FDA "clears" or "approves" a medical device?|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmetics===
Cosmetics are regulated by the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]], the same branch of the FDA that regulates food. Cosmetic products are not, in general, subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless they make "structure or function claims" that make them into drugs (see [[Cosmeceutical]]). However, all color additives must be specifically FDA approved before manufacturers can include them in cosmetic products sold in the U.S. The FDA regulates cosmetics labeling, and cosmetics that have not been safety tested must bear a warning to that effect.

Though the cosmetic industry is predominantly responsible in ensuring the safety of its products, the FDA also has the power to intervene when necessary to protect the public but in general does not require pre-market approval or testing.  Companies are required to place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested.  Experts in cosmetic ingredient reviews also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on the use of ingredients, but also lack legal authority.  Overall the organization has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted, but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety and a clear definition of what is meant by 'safety' so that all chemicals are tested on the same basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ross G |title=A perspective on the safety of cosmetic products: a position paper of the American Council on Science and Health |journal=Int.

===Veterinary products===
The [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] (CVM) is the branch of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals.&lt;ref name="Modric 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Modric|first1=S|title=Regulatory framework for the availability and use of animal drugs in the United States|journal=The Veterinary Clinics of North America.

CVM's primary focus is on medications that are used in food animals and ensuring that they do not affect the human food supply. The FDA's requirements to prevent the spread of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Tobacco products===
Since the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] became law in 2009, the FDA also has had the authority to regulate [[tobacco products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194423.htm |title=Does FDA have the authority to regulate tobacco products? |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Congress passed a law requiring color warnings on cigarette packages and on printed advertising, in addition to text warnings from the U.S. Surgeon General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/09/22/cigarette-makers-fda-clash-over-new-graphic-ads/#ixzz1YmnDjVAP | work=Fox News | title=Cigarette Makers, FDA Clash Over New Graphic Ads | date=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the FDA in June 2011 and were scheduled to be required to appear on packaging by September 2012. The implementation date is uncertain, due to ongoing proceedings in the case of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/ucm259214.htm |publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |title=Overview: Cigarette Health Warnings|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R.J. Reynolds]], [[Lorillard]], [[Imperial Tobacco|Commonwealth Brands Inc.]], Liggett Group LLC and [[Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company]] Inc. have filed suit in Washington, D.C. federal court claiming that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/09/12/fda-defends-new-graphic-cigarette-labels/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Nathan | last=Koppel | title=FDA Defends New Graphic Cigarette Labels | date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] lawyer, [[Floyd Abrams]], is representing the tobacco companies in the case, contending requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/big-tobacco-gets-top-first-amendment-lawyer-new-suit-134200|title=Big Tobacco Gets Top First Amendment Lawyer for New Suit|work=AdWeek|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation have also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csnews.com/product-categories/tobacco/tobacco-cos-get-allies-warning-label-fight|title=Tobacco Cos.

The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately could decide the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204554204577024040240467970 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Mike | last1=Esterl | title=Judge Temporarily Blocks Graphic Cigarette Labels | date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/28/540088353/fda-announces-plan-to-cut-level-of-nicotine-allowed-in-cigarettes|title=FDA Announces Plan To Cut Level Of Nicotine Allowed In Cigarettes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of living organisms===
With acceptance of premarket notification 510(k) k033391 in January 2004, the FDA granted Dr. Ronald Sherman permission to produce and market [[medical maggots]] for use in humans or other animals as a prescription medical device.
[[Medical maggots]] represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device.

In June 2004, the FDA cleared ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'' (medicinal leeches) as the second living organism to be used as a medical device.

The FDA also requires milk to be [[pasteurized]] to remove [[bacteria]].

==Science and research programs==
[[File:FDA Bldg 64 - Lab (5160771733).jpg|thumb|FDA lab at Building 64 in Silver Spring, Maryland]]
In addition to its regulatory functions, the FDA [[Science policy of the United States|carries out research and development activities]] to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments.  The FDA's research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women's health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Science &amp; Research at FDA|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/AboutScienceResearchatFDA/|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=November 25, 2011|date=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data management==
The FDA has collected a large amount of data through decades. In March 2013, [[OpenFDA]] was created to enable easy access of the data for the public.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Food and Drug Administration}}

Up until the 20th century, there were few federal laws regulating the contents and sale of domestically produced food and pharmaceuticals, with one exception being the short-lived [[Vaccine Act of 1813]]. The history of the FDA can be traced to the latter part of the 19th century and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Division of Chemistry]], later its '''Bureau of Chemistry.''' Under [[Harvey Washington Wiley]], appointed chief chemist in 1883, the Division began conducting research into the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs on the American market. Wiley's advocacy came at a time when the public had become aroused to hazards in the marketplace by [[muckraker|muckraking]] journalists like [[Upton Sinclair]], and became part of a general trend for increased federal regulations in matters pertinent to public safety during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name = "FDAHist"/&gt; The 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]] was put in place after a [[diphtheria]] antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a [[Jim (horse)|horse named Jim]], who had contracted tetanus.

[[File:Portrait of Dr. Harvey W. Wiley (FDA 107) (8203830456).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harvey W. Wiley]], chief advocate of the Food and Drug Act]]

In June 1906, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed into law the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], also known as the "Wiley Act" after its chief advocate.&lt;ref name="FDAHist"/&gt; The Act prohibited, under penalty of seizure of goods, the interstate transport of food that had been "adulterated". The act applied similar penalties to the interstate marketing of "adulterated" drugs, in which the "standard of strength, quality, or purity" of the active ingredient was not either stated clearly on the label or listed in the ''United States Pharmacopoeia'' or the ''National Formulary.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/wileyact.htm|title=Laws Enforced by FDA|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such "adulteration" or "misbranding" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry.&lt;ref name="FDAHist"/&gt; Wiley used these new regulatory powers to pursue an aggressive campaign against the manufacturers of foods with chemical additives, but the Chemistry Bureau's authority was soon checked by judicial decisions, which narrowly defined the bureau's powers and set high standards for proof of fraudulent intent.&lt;ref name="FDAHist"/&gt; In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide organization. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/miles.html|title=Milestones in U.S. Food and Drug Law History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, muckraking journalists, consumer protection organizations, and federal regulators began mounting a campaign for stronger regulatory authority by publicizing a list of injurious products that had been ruled permissible under the 1906 law, including [[radioactive]] [[beverages]], the [[mascara]] Lash lure, which caused blindness, and worthless "cures" for [[diabetes]] and [[tuberculosis]]. The resulting proposed law was unable to get through the [[Congress of the United States]] for five years, but was rapidly enacted into law following the public outcry over the 1937 [[Elixir sulfanilamide|Elixir Sulfanilamide]] tragedy, in which over 100 people died after using a drug formulated with a toxic, untested solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|title=Medical Disasters and the Growth of FDA|date=February 2010|page=7|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/policy_reports/2010-02-10-fda.pdf|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signed the new [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FD&amp;C Act) into law on June 24, 1938. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. Soon after passage of the 1938 Act, the FDA began to designate certain drugs as safe for use only under the supervision of a medical professional, and the category of "[[Prescription drug|prescription-only]]" drugs was securely codified into law by the 1951 [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]]. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs.&lt;ref name="FDAHist"/&gt;

[[File:Examining New Drug Applications (067) (7184535293).jpg|thumb|upright|Medical Officer Alexander Fleming, M. D., examines a portion of a 240-volume new drug application around the late 1980s. Applications grew considerably after the efficacy mandate under the 1962 Drug Amendments.]]

In 1959, the [[thalidomide]] tragedy, in which thousands of European babies were born deformed after their mothers took that drug&amp;nbsp;– marketed for treatment of nausea&amp;nbsp;– during their pregnancies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/87th/620817.html Report of Congressman Morris Udall on thalidomide and the Kefauver hearings].&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the US was largely spared that tragedy because Dr. [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] of the FDA refused to authorize the medication for market, the 1962 [[Kefauver-Harris Amendment]] to the FD&amp;C Act was passed, which represented a "revolution" in FDA regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Temple R |year=2002 |title=Policy developments in regulatory approval |journal=Statistics in Medicine|pmid=12325110 |volume=21|issue=19 |pages=2939–2948 |doi=10.1002/sim.1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate "substantial evidence" of the drug's efficacy for a marketed indication, in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety. This marked the start of the FDA approval process in its modern form.

These reforms had the effect of increasing the time, and the difficulty, required to bring a drug to market.&lt;ref name="'70s 180"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= 180|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most important statutes in establishing the modern American pharmaceutical market was the 1984 [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]], more commonly known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act" after its chief sponsors. The act extended the patent exclusivity terms of new drugs, and tied those extensions, in part, to the length of the FDA approval process for each individual drug. For generic manufacturers, the Act created a new approval mechanism, the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), in which the generic drug manufacturer need only demonstrate that their generic formulation has the same active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] properties ("bioequivalence") as the corresponding brand-name drug. This act has been credited with in essence creating the modern generic drug industry.&lt;ref name="HatchWaxman"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Karki L |year=2005 |title=Review of FDA Law Related to Pharmaceuticals: The Hatch-Waxman Act, Regulatory Amendments and Implications for Drug Patent Enforcement |journal=Journal of the Patent &amp; Trademark Office Society |volume=87 |pages=602–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the length of the drug approval process were brought to the fore early in the [[AIDS]] epidemic. In the mid- and late 1980s, [[ACT-UP]] and other [[HIV]] activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html|title=ACT UP/NY Chronology 1988|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/SpeedingAccesstoImportantNewTherapies/ucm181838.htm | title=FDA Website: Expanded Access and Expedited Approval of New Therapies Related to HIV/AIDS | deadurl=yes | archivedate=November 1, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101115339/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/SpeedingAccesstoImportantNewTherapies/ucm181838.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through these accelerated approval mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/newdrug/speeding.html | title=FDA report on accelerated approval process | deadurl=yes | archivedate=May 25, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525082655/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/newdrug/speeding.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Young, the commissioner of the FDA was behind the Action Plan Phase II, established in August 1987 for quicker approval of AIDS medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reagan, Regulation, and the FDA: The US Food and Drug Administration's Response to HIV/AIDS, 1980–90|last = Richert|first = Lucas|date = 2009|journal = Canadian Journal of History|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two instances, state governments have sought to legalize drugs that the FDA has not approved. Under the theory that federal law passed pursuant to Constitutional authority overrules conflicting state laws, federal authorities still claim the authority to seize, arrest, and prosecute for possession and sales of these substances,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} even in states where they are legal under state law. The first wave was the legalization by 27 states of [[laetrile]] in the late 1970s. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=127773447|title=Medicinal Marijuana: A Patient-Driven Phenomenon|date=June 14, 2010|work=NPR.org|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quack-laetrile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/laetrile.html|title=The Rise and Fall of Laetrile|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave concerned [[medical marijuana]] in the 1990s and 2000s. Though Virginia passed a law with limited effect in 1979, a more widespread trend began in California in 1996.

===Historical first: FDA and Endo Pharmaceutical's Opana ER (2017)===
When the FDA requested [[Endo Pharmaceuticals]] on June 8, 2017 to remove ''[[oxymorphone hydrochloride]]'' from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=June 8, 2017 |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm562401.htm |title=FDA requests removal of Opana ER for risks related to abuse |type=Press release  |location=[[Silver Spring, Maryland]]|publisher= |agency=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |access-date=October 26, 2017 |quote="Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals remove its opioid pain medication, reformulated Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride), from the market...

===Patients' rights to access unapproved drugs===
The [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]] was created after ''Randall v. U.S.'' ruled in favor of [[Robert C. Randall]] in 1978, creating a program for [[medical marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dp3e4y/the-us-government-has-sent-this-guy-300-joints-each-month-for-34-years|title=The US Government Has Sent This Guy 300 Joints Each Month for 34 Years|date=September 9, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 court case, ''[[Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach]]'', would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The Abigail Alliance argued that the FDA must license drugs for use by terminally ill patients with "desperate diagnoses," after they have completed Phase I testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abigail-alliance.org/WLF_FDA.pdf |title=Abigail Alliance Citizen Petition to FDA }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(119&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case won an initial appeal in May 2006, but that decision was reversed by a March 2007 rehearing. The [[US Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, and the final decision denied the existence of a right to unapproved medications.

[[Criticism of the Food and Drug Administration|Critics]] of the FDA's regulatory power argue that the FDA takes too long to approve drugs that might ease pain and human suffering faster if brought to market sooner.  The AIDS crisis created some political efforts to streamline the approval process.  However, these limited reforms were targeted for AIDS drugs, not for the broader market.  This has led to the call for more robust and enduring reforms that would allow patients, under the care of their doctors, access to drugs that have passed the first round of clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Free To Choose Medicine: How Faster Access to New Drugs Would Save Countless Lives and End Needless Suffering: Bartley J.

===Post-marketing drug safety monitoring===
The widely publicized recall of [[Vioxx]], a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] now estimated to have contributed to fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] in thousands of Americans, played a strong role in driving a new wave of safety reforms at both the FDA rulemaking and statutory levels. Vioxx was approved by the FDA in 1999, and was initially hoped to be safer than previous NSAIDs, due to its reduced risk of intestinal tract bleeding. However, a number of pre- and post-marketing studies suggested that Vioxx might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, and this was conclusively demonstrated by results from the APPROVe trial in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib in a colorectal adenoma chemoprevention trial|last=Bresalier |first=RS |pmid=15713943 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa050493 |volume=352 |issue=11 |date=March 2005 |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |pages=1092–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with numerous lawsuits, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew it from the market. The example of Vioxx has been prominent in an ongoing debate over whether new drugs should be evaluated on the basis of their absolute safety, or their safety relative to existing treatments for a given condition. In the wake of the Vioxx recall, there were widespread calls by major newspapers, medical journals, consumer advocacy organizations, lawmakers, and FDA officials&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/111804dgtest.pdf |title=David Graham's 2004 testimony to Congress }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(28.3&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; for reforms in the FDA's procedures for pre- and post- market drug safety regulation.

In 2006, a congressionally requested committee was appointed by the [[Institute of Medicine]] to review pharmaceutical safety regulation in the U.S. and to issue recommendations for improvements. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicinemedical research, economics, [[biostatistics]], law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the [[drug company|pharmaceutical]], hospital, and [[health insurance]] industries. The authors found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers, funding, and independence of the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Diedtra |last=Henderson |title=Panel: FDA needs more power, funds |work=Boston Globe |date=September 23, 2006}} [https://www.webcitation.org/5NkCrjdpd?url=http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2006/09/23/panel_fda_needs_more_power_funds/ Webcitation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11750&amp;page=205 Books.nap.edu] Executive Summary of the 2006 IOM Report ''The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the committee's recommendations have been incorporated into drafts of the PDUFA IV bill, which was signed into law in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/advance/fdaaa.html|title=Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Risk Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPS) have been created to ensure risks of a drug never outweigh the benefits of that drug within the postmarketing period. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness.

Prior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. This became a major concern of [[pediatrician]]s as evidence accumulated that the physiological response of children to many drugs differed significantly from those drugs' effects on adults. Children react different to the drugs because of many reason, including size, weight, etc. There were several reasons that not many medical trials were done with children. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective.&lt;ref name = "PedReg"/&gt;

Also, because children were thought to be ethically restricted in their ability to give [[informed consent]], there were increased governmental and institutional hurdles to approval of these clinical trials, as well as greater concerns about [[legal liability]]. Thus, for decades, most medicines prescribed to children in the U.S. were done so in a non-FDA-approved, "off-label" manner, with dosages "extrapolated" from adult data through body weight and body-surface-area calculations.&lt;ref name = "PedReg"/&gt;

An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. However, this new rule was successfully preempted in federal court as exceeding the FDA's statutory authority.&lt;ref name="PedReg"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Politis P |year=2005 |title=Transition From the Carrot to the Stick: The Evolution of Pharmaceutical Regulations Concerning Pediatric Drug Testing |journal=Widener Law Review |volume=12 |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the 1997 [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act]] to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The act reauthorizing these provisions, the 2002 [[Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act]], allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a "last resort" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.&lt;ref name="PedReg"/&gt;

===Priority review voucher (PRV)===
The [[priority review voucher]] is a provision of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (HR 3580) signed by President [[George W. Bush]] signed the bill in September 2007 which awards a transferable "priority review voucher" to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a [[neglected tropical diseases]]. The system was first proposed by [[Duke University]] faculty David Ridley, Henry Grabowski, and Jeffrey Moe in their 2006 ''Health Affairs'' paper: "Developing Drugs for Developing Countries".&lt;ref name=Ridley06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ridley DB, Grabowski HG, Moe JL |title=Developing drugs for developing countries |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16522573 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.313 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16522573}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, President Obama signed into law the FDA Safety and Innovation Act which includes Section 908 the "Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Incentive Program".&lt;ref name="PLAW_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ144/pdf/PLAW-112publ144.pdf | title=Section 529 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Incentive Program, Public Law 112-144 | publisher=Public Law | date=July 9, 2012 | accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules for generic biologics===
Since the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of [[cancer]], [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]], and other conditions have been [[protein]]-based [[biologic medical product|biotechnology drugs]], regulated by the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]]. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug [[Avastin]] costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the [[enzyme replacement therapy]] drug [[Imiglucerase|Cerezyme]] costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by [[Gaucher's Disease]] patients for life.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr1038|title=To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the licensing of comparable and interchangeable biological products, and for other purposes. (2007; 110th Congress H.R. 1038) – GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology drugs do not have the simple, readily verifiable chemical structures of conventional drugs, and are produced through complex, often proprietary techniques, such as transgenic mammalian cell cultures. Because of these complexities, the 1984 [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act|Hatch-Waxman Act]] did not include biologics in the [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA) process, in essence precluding the possibility of generic drug competition for biotechnology drugs. In February 2007, identical bills were introduced into the House to create an ANDA process for the approval of generic biologics, but were not passed.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

===Mobile medical applications===
In 2013, a guidance was issued to regulate [[mobile medical apps|mobile medical applications]] and protect users from their unintended use. This guidance distinguishes the apps subjected to regulation based on the marketing claims of the apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ConnectedHealth/MobileMedicalApplications/ucm255978.htm|title=Mobile Medical Applications|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of the guidelines during the development phase of such app has been proposed for expedite market entry and clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yetisen A.

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Criticism of the Food and Drug Administration}}
{{Wikinews| Obama calls food safety system a 'hazard to public health'}}The FDA has regulatory oversight over a large array of products that affect the health and life of American citizens.&lt;ref name="FDAHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm|title=FDA History&amp;nbsp;— Part I|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the FDA's powers and decisions are carefully monitored by several governmental and non-governmental organizations. A $1.8 million 2006 [[Institute of Medicine]] report on pharmaceutical regulation in the U.S. found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the [[regulations|regulatory powers]], funding, and independence of the FDA.&lt;ref name=IOM2006&gt;{{Cite book|first=Diedtra |last=Henderson |title=Panel: FDA needs more power, funds |work= Boston Globe |date=September 23, 2006}} [https://www.webcitation.org/5NkCrjdpd?url=http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2006/09/23/panel_fda_needs_more_power_funds/ Webcitation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Assessment of the US Drug Safety System. (2006). ''The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public''. [[Institute of Medicine]]. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11750#toc Free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine FDA scientists appealed to then president-elect [[Barack Obama]] over pressures from management, experienced during the [[George W. Bush]] presidency, to manipulate data, including in relation to the review process for medical devices. Characterized as "corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk," these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report&lt;ref name=IOM2006/&gt; on the agency as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |vauthors=Mundy A, Favole JA |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123142562104564381 |title=FDA Scientists Ask Obama to Restructure Drug Agency |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. According to an analysis published on the website of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Mercatus Center]] as well as published statements by economists, medical practitioners, and concerned consumers, many feel the FDA oversteps its regulatory powers and undermines small business and small farms in favor of large corporations.  Three of the FDA restrictions under analysis are the permitting of new drugs and devices, the control of manufacturer speech, and the imposition of prescription requirements. The authors argue that in the increasingly complex and diverse food marketplace, the FDA is not equipped to adequately regulate or inspect food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Williams, Richard |author2=Robert Scharff |author3=David Bieler  |last-author-amp=yes |date=February 2010 |title=Food Safety in the 21st Century |work=Mercatus On Policy |page=71 |url=http://mercatus.org/publication/food-safety-21st-century}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=May 2013}} In addition, excessive regulation is blamed for the rising costs of health care and the creation of [[monopoly|monopolies]], as potential competitors are unable to get FDA approval to enter the market to compete and keep [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/blog/lack-epipen-competitors-fdas-fault|title=The Lack of EpiPen Competitors is the FDA's Fault - Jonathan Newman|last=Jonathan|date=August 24, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. [[Diana Zuckerman]] and Paul Brown of the [[National Research Center for Women and Families]], and Dr. Steven Nissen of the [[Cleveland Clinic]], published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for "serious health problems or death" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process.  In a few cases the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.  Of the 113 devices recalled, 35 were for cardiovascular health purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=227466|title=Medical Device Recalls and the FDA Approval Process |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=171 |issue=11 |pages=1006–11 |accessdate=March 14, 2015|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.30 |pmid=21321283 |year=2011 |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Diana M. |last2=Brown |first2=Paul |last3=Nissen |first3=Steven E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure''' ('''FFII''') is a [[non-profit organisation]] based in [[Munich, Germany]], dedicated to establishing a [[Free Information Infrastructure|free market in information technology]], by the removal of barriers to competition. The FFII played a key organisational role and was very active in the campaign which resulted in the rejection of the [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|EU software patent directive]] in July 2005.

[[CNET]] awarded the FFII the Outstanding contribution to software development award for this work, which was the result of years of research, policy, and action.&lt;ref name="GNU.org"&gt;https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/dotgnu-general/2005-09/msg00037.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the July 2005 victory, FFII has continued to defend a free and competitive software market by working towards adequate patent systems and open standards. Currently the FFII fights against [[software patent]]s lobbies, not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world.
 
== Views ==
FFII's view is that software patents present a burden, not a benefit to society.  It backs this position up citing extensive studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://swpat.ffii.org/archive/mirror/impact/index.en.html
|title=Research on the MacroEconomic Effects of Patents
}}&lt;/ref&gt; FFII is a European [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]] on this issue. Through its partnership with many other European organisations with the same goal, it has a reach across all nations of the EU.

FFII has been active on this front since 2000 when, according to the FFII, an attempt to change the [[European Patent Convention]] to legitimise software patents failed. In 2003, it strongly but indirectly lobbied the European Parliament against the proposed [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]].

The [[EuroLinux]] anti-software-patent petition, supported and promoted by FFII, was signed by more than 1,500 [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|SMEs]], many thousand [[software developer]]s, tens of thousands of software users [[system administrator]]s as well as a number of [[scientist]]s, [[academic]]s and [[economist]]s for a total of 400,000 signatories.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- dead: http://petition.eurolinux.org/index_html?NO_COOKIE=true  dead: https://web.archive.org/web/20051227032443/petition.eurolinux.org/index_html?NO_COOKIE=true --&gt;

[[File:Online-protest.en.png|frameless|right]]
FFII organises conferences about the topic, usually in [[Brussels]], such as the conference which took place on April 14, 2004 together with a demonstration of more than 400 people against software patents the one on November 9–10, 2004. In [[Karlsruhe]], FFII organised a demonstration of about 1,000 people against software patents. In 2005 FFII organised an ''online demo'' supported by 1,200 web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.ffii.org/online_supporters_allsites.en.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310230351/http://demo.ffii.org/online_supporters_allsites.en.php|title=All Registered Sites|archivedate=2005-03-10|work=demo.ffii.org/online_supporters|publisher=FFII|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The FFII was funded originally by donations from [[SuSE]] and Infomatec.  The [[Open Society Institute]] has contributed regularly, as have [[Red Hat]], and Stichting [[NLnet]]. The historical list of donors from 1999 to 2005 can be found on the FFII web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FFII |url=http://www.ffii.org/money/donors/index.en.html |title=Donors of the FFII |publisher=Ffii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Partners in Europe include [[EFFI]], [[EuroLinux]], [[FSF Europe]], and [[Ján Husár#SKOSI|SKOSI]].

The FFII exists as a mother organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|url=http://www.ffii.org/|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more or less formal chapters in many countries. The national FFII chapters (such as FFII France)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FFII France|url=http://www.ffii.fr/|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; handle national membership, media and lobbying, while the mother organisation operates at the EU level and in countries where there is no formal FFII organisation.

As of 14 December 2013, the FFII board consists of Benjamin Henrion (President), Rene Mages (Vice president), Stephan Uhlmann (Treasurer), André Rebentisch (Secretary), Hartmut Pilch.

== Campaigns ==
Besides software patents, FFII promotes various campaigns aimed at disencumbering computing and software development. These include supporting author's rights and [[Interoperability]] enforcements, such as working to improve copyright regulation by providing technical analysis, amendments and voting recommendations that may influence the European Parliament.

The '''Gaza Freedom Flotilla''', organized by the [[Free Gaza Movement]] and the Turkish [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief]] (İHH), was carrying humanitarian aid and construction materials, with the intention of breaking the Israeli-Egyptian [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)|blockade of the Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref name="FT Attack"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Buck|first1=Tobias|last2=Dombey|first2=Daniel|last3=Strauss|first3=Delphine|journal=Financial Times|title=Israel condemned after flotilla attack|date=31 May 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b09c57f6-6c80-11df-91c8-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibhsguardqa53"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Ian |last=Black |date=31 May 2010 |author2=Haroon Siddique |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/q-a-gaza-freedom-flotilla |title=Q&amp;A: The Gaza Freedom flotilla |work=The Guardian | location=London |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; In normal circumstances, aid is brought to Israel to be inspected and then transferred to Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravid|first1=Barak|title=Israel: Gaza aid convoy can unload cargo in Ashdod for inspection|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-gaza-aid-convoy-can-unload-cargo-in-ashdod-for-inspection-1.292560|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=Haaretz|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2010, Israeli forces [[Gaza flotilla raid|boarded the ships]] from speedboats and helicopters. Following resistance on one of the boats, nine activists were killed by Israeli forces. Widespread [[Reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid|international condemnation of and reaction to]] the raid followed, [[Israel–Turkey relations]] were strained, and Israel subsequently eased its blockade on the Gaza Strip.

==Overview==
The flotilla was the Free Gaza Movement's ninth attempt to break the [[2007-present blockade of the Gaza Strip#Naval blockade|naval blockade]] imposed by Israel on the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foulkes |first=Imogen |date=14 June 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10306193 |title=ICRC says Israel's Gaza blockade breaks law |work=BBC News |accessdate=3 October 2011 }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{Cite news |date=14 August 2009 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,539363,00.html |title=U.N.

===Ships===
The ships of the Gaza flotilla raid comprised three passenger ships&lt;ref name="MFASummary"/&gt; and three cargo ships:
* ''Challenger 1'' (small yacht),&lt;ref name="MFASummary"/&gt; [[United States|US]], Free Gaza Movement
* MS ''Eleftheri Mesogios (Free Mediterranean)'' or ''Sofia'' (cargo boat), [[Greece]], [[Sweden]] {{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010|p=20}} Greek Ship to Gaza

* ''Defne Y'', [[Kiribati]], İHH
Two other Free Gaza Movement ships, ''Challenger 2'' (USA flagged) and MV [[MV Rachel Corrie|''Rachel Corrie'']] ([[Cambodia]] flagged) were behind the rest of the flotilla due to mechanical problems.

====Ties with groups marked as terror organizations====
In Jun 2010 Assistant Secretary of State P.J.

The AP was quoted on msnbc ''The Turkish Islamic charity behind a flotilla of aid ships that was raided by Israeli forces on its way to Gaza had ties to terrorism networks, including a 1999 al-Qaida plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport, France's former top anti-terrorism judge said Wednesday.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=de Montesquiou |first=Alfred |date=2 June 2010 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37477182/ns/world_news-europe/t/turkish-aid-group-had-terror-ties/ |title=Turkish aid group had terror ties |work=NBC News |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jun 2012 it was reported that the IHH director [[Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım]] is reportedly being investigated by Turkish authorities for allegedly creating a financial partnership with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=17 July 2012 |url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/Data/articles/Art_20359/E_128_12_1881078791.pdf |work=Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center |title=According to the Turkish media (June 2012), IHH head Bülent Yildirim was under investigation for having clandestinely transferred funds to Al-Qaeda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel questioned the humanitarian motives of flotilla organizers. Israel said it had invited the organizers to use the land crossings but they were "less interested in bringing in aid than in promoting their radical agenda, playing into the hands of Hamas provocations. While they have wrapped themselves in a humanitarian cloak, they are engaging in political propaganda and not in pro-Palestinian aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Palmor |first=Yigal |date=24 May 2010 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/HumanitarianAid/Palestinians/MFA_Spokesman_Gaza_flotilla_24-May-2010.htm |publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=MFA Spokesman on Gaza flotilla |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flotilla organisers rejected Israel's demand, as it did not believe that Israel would transfer the cargo to Gaza,&lt;ref name="CNNWorld"/&gt; and said that, "This mission is not about delivering humanitarian supplies, it's about breaking Israel's siege on 1.5 million Palestinians...&lt;ref name="undeterred"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/05/2010528431964325.html |title=Tensions rise over Gaza aid fleet |work=Al Jazeera English |date=28 May 2010 |author=Al Jazeera and agencies |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; We want to raise international awareness about the prison-like closure of Gaza and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued Israeli occupation."&lt;ref name="CNNWorld"/&gt;

The [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] fact-finding mission noted a "certain tension between the political objectives of the flotilla and its humanitarian objectives", which came to light "the moment the Government of Israel made offers to allow the humanitarian aid to be delivered via Israeli ports but under the supervision of a neutral organization". It also announced that Gaza did not have a deep sea port capable of receiving the sort of cargo ships participating in the flotilla. It concluded that "whilst the mission is satisfied that the flotilla constituted a serious attempt to bring essential humanitarian supplies into Gaza, it seems clear that the primary objective was political, as indeed demonstrated by the decision of those on board the ''Rachel Corrie'' to reject a Government of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]-sponsored proposal that the cargo in that ship be allowed through [[Ashdod]] intact".{{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010|p=19}}

Some supporters of the flotilla said that "a violent response from Israel will breathe new life into the Palestine solidarity movement, drawing attention to the blockade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intifada-palestine.com/2010/05/gaza-freedom-march-prepares-emergency-response-for-freedom-flotilla/ |title=Gaza Freedom March Prepares Emergency Response for Freedom FLOTILLA |work=Intifada Palestine |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{Cite news |work=New York Times: Editorial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/opinion/02wed1.html |title=Israel and the Blockade |author=NY Times editors|date=1 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the activists (Ali Haydar Bengi and Ibrahim Bilgen)&lt;!-- not sure we need the names?

Former U.S. Marine [[Kenneth O'Keefe]], who was aboard the Mavi Marmara, stated that the activists knew from the outset that there would be no [[passive resistance]]. "I knew that if the Israelis boarded that ship, it would be a disaster...You have to be an idiot to board that ship and think it will be a ship of passive resistance," he told [[Haaretz]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheizaf |first=Noam |date=24 September 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/rough-passage-1.315481 |title=Rough Passage |work=Haaretz |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a public address in October 2010 on ''Al-Aqsa TV'', Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Maqri, Head of Moroccan and Algerian Delegation to the Gaza Convoy, stated, according to a translation published by [[MEMRI]], that "the mujahideen have told us that they decided not to defeat the oppressive Jews by gunfire, but instead, by daggers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2682.htm |title=Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Maqri, Head of Moroccan and Algerian Delegation to Convoy to Gaza: 'Israel Will Be Annihilated Soon' |location=Washington, DC |publisher=MEMRI |id=Clip No. 2682 |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-raid sabotage rumors===
There are claims that the IDF or the [[Mossad]] may have sabotaged three of the ships before the raid.&lt;ref name="UPI Tamper"/&gt; According to the [[National Post]], Israeli deputy defense minister [[Matan Vilnai]] hinted that Israel had exhausted covert means of stalling the vessels.

Three ships&amp;nbsp;– the ''Rachel Corrie'', the ''Challenger I'' and the ''Challenger II''&amp;nbsp;– suffered damage or malfunction. While the ''Challenger I'' was able to continue, the ''Challenger II'' had to turn back halfway through the journey and ''Rachel Corrie'' docked for repairs in [[Malta]].

[[Gaza flotilla raid#Conclusion of raid|After the raid]], the activists were detained in Israel pending release: all were deported by 6 June. The ships were towed to Israel and those claimed by their owners were returned. The aid was delivered to Gaza under United Nations supervision on 17 June.

Widespread [[Reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid|international condemnation of and reaction to the raid]] followed. Various [[Gaza flotilla raid#Investigations|investigations]] were conducted, including by the United Nations, Israel and Turkey. [[Israel-Turkey relations]] were strained, and Israel subsequently eased its blockade on Gaza.

===Freedom Flotilla West Papua===
Another movement happen in Pacific region, On 15 August 2013, at 10 pm, two peace mission yachts of 15 Aboriginal and Papuan activists in support of the West Papuan independence struggle from Indonesian leave Cairns, Australia headed to the Merauke Town, southern region of Indonesia's Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=15 August 2013 |title='Freedom flotilla' Will sail to Merauke  |url=http://www.en.papua.us/2013/08/freedom-flotilla-will-sail-to-merauke.html |work=Papua Untuk Semua |location=Jayapura, Indonesia |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian and West Papuan activists are set to sail to territory of West Papua without permission while Indonesian military has confirmed that they will raid them if they crossing the borders. The fleet is expected to make unauthorised landfall in West Papua in September.

Meanwhile, Four West Papuan pro-independence leaders were arrested by authorities on Wednesday, in Sorong - a coastal city in the western Indonesian province of West Papua - on charges of organising a congregation pray meeting at the Marantha Church in the city.

Over 2000 people had gathered at the local church to pray for the safe passage of the West Papua Freedom Flotilla, around 200 policemen surrounded the church and arrested the four leaders.

In show of global solidarity, a demonstration took place outside the Indonesian Embassy, in The Hague, calling for the safe passage of the Freedom Flotilla to West Papua. The campaigners have opened an office in the city in an effort to push for the cause of West Papua's independence and highlight the alleged human rights abuses that have taken place in West Papua since 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=31 August 2013 |title=Four West Papuan Pro-independence Leaders in Sorong Arrested for Pray to Freedom Flotilla |url=http://www.en.papua.us/2013/08/four-west-papuan-pro-independence.html |work=Papua Untuk Semua |location=Jayapura, Indonesia |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Human Rights Act 2004''''' is an Act of the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] that recognises the fundamental human rights of individuals. It was the first of its kind in [[Australia]], however Victoria has since passed the [[Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities]] and the Human Rights Consultation is currently deliberating on whether the federal government should adopt a human rights act.

The Act established an Australian Capital Territory Human Rights Commissioner. It also empowers the [[ACT Supreme Court]] to declare on compliance of legislation.

The Act was amended in 2005 by the ''Human Rights Commission Legislation Amendment Act 2005''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1687">'''Internal sin''', in Christianity, is the idea that [[sin]] may be committed not only by outward deeds but also by the inner activity of the mind, quite apart from any external manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Aquinas, Thomas|title=Summa Theologiae}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thought crime]]s were as old as [[heresy]], but the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]'s alarms received new emphasis at the [[Council of Trent]] (Session XIV, chapter. v). The session, while reiterating that all [[mortal sin]]s must be confessed, singled out the unspoken ones that "sometimes more grievously wound the soul and are more dangerous than sins which are openly committed".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Reference|year=1912|editor=Herbermann et al., Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three kinds of internal sin are usually distinguished by [[Catholicism|Catholics]]:
* ''delectatio morosa'', the pleasure taken in a sinful thought or imagination even without desiring it;
* ''gaudium'', dwelling with complacency on sins already committed; 
* ''desiderium'', the desire for what is sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14004b.htm|title=Sin|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical quotes==
* [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:28 ''But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart''.

{{Wiktionary}}
{{Italic title}}
'''{{lang|la|Ipso facto}}''' is a [[Latin]] phrase, directly translated as "by the fact itself",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dominik|first=William J.|title=Words &amp; Ideas|year=2006|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|location=Wauconda, Ill.|isbn=0-86516-485-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUlrPKNQiTMC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=%22ipso+facto%22+latin+phrases&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kc0_T9y8MYydgQe20-ijCA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that a specific phenomenon is a ''direct'' consequence, a resultant ''effect'', of the action in question, instead of being 
brought about by a previous action.  It is a [[term of art]] used in [[philosophy]], [[law]], and [[science]]. An example in law is [[money laundering]]: the act is not {{lang|la|ipso facto}} illegal{{where|date=November 2018}}{{fact|date=November 2018}} because it is an exchange but is done as a cover for something else, so the act puts the actions of an individual in question. A common English [[idiom]] with a similar meaning is "[[wikt:in and of itself#Adverb|in and of itself]]". Compare also "by itself" and "[[wikt:per se#Adverb|per se]]".

Aside from its technical uses, it occurs frequently in literature, particularly in scholarly addenda:  e.g., "Faustus had signed his life away, and was, {{lang|la|ipso facto}}, incapable of repentance" (from [[Christopher Marlowe]], ''[[The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus]]'') or "These prejudices are rooted in the idea that every tramp {{lang|la|ipso facto}} is a blackguard" (from [[George Orwell]], ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'').

==In Catholic canon law==
{{main|Latae sententiae}}
{{lang|la|Ipso facto}} denotes the automatic character of the loss of membership in a religious body by someone guilty of a specified action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dismissal ipso facto|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd02747.htm|publisher=New Catholic Dictionary|accessdate=18 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718022301/http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd02747.htm|archivedate=18 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], the phrase {{lang|la|[[latae sententiae]]}} is more commonly used than {{lang|la|ipso facto}} with regard to ecclesiastical penalties such as [[excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]]. It indicates that the effect follows even if no verdict (in Latin, {{lang|la|sententia}}) is pronounced by an ecclesiastical superior or tribunal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">An '''irreparable injury''' is, in [[equity (law)|equity]], "the type of harm which no monetary compensation can cure or put conditions back the way they were." &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1031&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The irreparable injury rule==
It has traditionally been a requirement of [[Equity (law)|equity]] that no relief can be granted unless there is irreparable injury. This requirement, commonly called the "irreparable injury rule", has been the subject of sustained academic criticism, especially by remedies scholar [[Douglas Laycock]], who has argued at length that the rule does not actually explain the decisions of courts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Laycock, The Death of the Irreparable Injury Rule (Oxford Univ. Press 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the irreparable injury rule was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in [[eBay v. MercExchange]], 547 U.S. 388 (2006), a case in which the Court announced a test for injunctive relief that required, among other things, that the plaintiff prove "that it has suffered an irreparable injury".

==The concept of irreparable injury in various jurisdictions==
The general idea that there are irreparable injuries has been recognized in various jurisdictions.

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations]] Staff Rules recognize the concept for the purpose of [[employment]] [[appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.un.org/jab/faqs.html U.N. Joint Appeals Board web site], citing, Law Dictionary, ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Virtually every [[United States|state]] recognizes the concept under [[common law]] or equity, including [[New York (state)|New York]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityinjurylawyer.com/glossary.html Private law firm's web site glossary].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=39090 Oklahoma case]&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Dakota]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.sd.us/puc/commission/dockets/telecom/2006/tc06-010/confidentialityagreement.pdf S.D.

In addition to state law, the [[Federal government]] takes note of the purpose of an '''injunction''' as being to "prevent irreparable damage or injury".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/azd/courtinfo.nsf/court/files/$file/glossary+of+terms.pdf  D.Ariz. official web site].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/publications/glossary.html N.D.Tex. official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/kidspage/glossary.html DOJ Web site, Kid's page].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish political movements''' refer to the organized efforts of [[Jew]]s to build their own [[Political party|political parties]] or otherwise represent their interest in politics outside the [[Jewish community]]. From the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Romans to the foundation of [[Israel]] the Jewish people had no territory, and, until the 19th century they by-and-large were also denied equal rights in the countries in which they lived. Thus, until the 19th century effort for the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]], almost all Jewish political struggles were internal, and dealt primarily with either religious issues or issues of a particular Jewish community. (See [[Judaism and politics]].){{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Birth of Jewish political movements==
[[Image:Moses Mendelson P7160073.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Moses Mendelssohn, the founder of the [[Haskalah]] movement]]
Since Jews were excluded as outsiders throughout Europe, they were mostly shut out of politics or any sort of participation in the wider political and social sphere of the nations in which they were involved until the Enlightenment, and its Jewish counterpart, [[Haskalah]], made popular movements possible. As long as the Jews lived in [[Religious segregation|segregated]] communities, and as long as all avenues of social intercourse with their [[gentile]] neighbors were closed to them, the [[rabbi]] was the most influential member of the Jewish community. In addition to being a religious scholar and clergy, a rabbi also acted as a civil [[judge]] in all cases in which both parties were Jews. Rabbis sometimes had other important administrative powers, together with the community elders. The rabbinate was the highest aim of many Jewish boys, and the study of the [[Torah]] (first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means of obtaining that coveted position, or one of many other important communal distinctions. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.  The example of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]  (1729&amp;ndash;1786), a [[Prussia]]n Jew and grandfather of the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]], served to lead this movement. Mendelssohn's extraordinary success as a popular philosopher and [[man of letters]] revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities of integration and acceptance of Jews among non-Jews.

The changes caused by the Haskalah movement coincided with rising revolutionary movements throughout Europe.  Despite these movements, only France, Britain, and the Netherlands had granted the Jews in their countries equal rights with gentiles after the [[French Revolution]] in 1796.  Elsewhere in Europe, especially where Jews were most concentrated in Central and Eastern Europe, Jews were not granted equal rights. It was in the revolutionary atmosphere of the mid-19th century that the first true Jewish political movements would take place.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Emancipation movements==
{{see also|Jewish Emancipation|Haskalah}}
During the early stages of [[Jewish Emancipation|Jewish emancipation movements]], Jews were simply part of the general effort to achieve freedom and rights that drove popular uprisings like the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals like [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]] were active with the general movement towards liberty and political freedom.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Still, in the face of persistent [[anti-semitic]] incidents like the [[Damascus affair|Damascus Blood Libel]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations started to form in order to push for the emancipation and protection of Jews.  The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] of Paris, and the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]] founded by [[Adolphe Crémieux]], all began working to assure the freedom of the Jews throughout the middle of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Socialist and Labor movements==
{{see also|Jewish left}}
Frustration with the slow pace of Jewish acceptance into European society, and a revolutionary [[utopianism]], led to a growing interest in proto-[[socialism|socialist]] and [[communist]] movements, especially as early socialist leaders, like [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], preached the emancipation of the Jews. [[Moses Hess]] played a role in introducing [[Karl Marx]] (who was descended from a long line of rabbis) and [[Friedrich Engels]] to [[historical materialism]].  The Jewish [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], founded the first actual workers' party in Germany, the [[General German Workers' Association]] (which ultimately merged with other parties to become the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]) and made Jewish emancipation one of his goals.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The more intellectual socialist movements of the Jews in Western Europe never gathered steam as emancipation took hold. In Eastern Europe and Russia, however, the ''Bund''{{spaced ndash}}the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labor Union]]{{spaced ndash}}founded in 1897, became a key force in organizing Jews, and, at least initially, the major opponent of another Jewish political movement of the time, [[Zionism]]. There were other Jewish socialist parties in Russia, like the ([[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]]) [[Zionist Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Jewish Socialist Workers Party]], which united their destinies in 1917 as the [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]]. Another left-wing Russian Jewish party was the [[Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion)]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Zionist movements==
{{main|Zionism}}
The aim of Zionism was to set up a secular state in the vicinity of the Biblical [[Land of Israel]]. Zionism, or the idea of a restored national homeland and common identity for the Jews, had already started to take shape by the mid-19th century, with Jewish thinkers such as [[Moses Hess]] whose 1862 work ''Rome and Jerusalem; The Last National Question'' argued for the Jews to settle in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as a means of settling the [[national question]]. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become [[agrarianism|agrarianised]] through a process of "redemption of the soil" which would transform the Jewish community into a "true" nation, in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived Jews in Europe. Hess, along with later thinkers such as [[Nahum Syrkin]] and [[Ber Borochov]], is considered a founder of ''Socialist Zionism'' and [[Labour Zionism]] and one of the intellectual forebears of the [[kibbutz]] movement. Others like Rabbi Zvi Kalischer viewed a return to the Jewish homeland as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy through natural means.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Image:Theodore Herzl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor Herzl]], a key figure in the development of Zionism]]
As the 19th century wore on, the persecution of the Jews in Eastern Europe where emancipation had not occurred to the extent it did in Western Europe (or at all) increased.  Starting with the state-sponsored massive [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]] following the assassination of [[Russian history, 1855-1892|Tsar Alexander II]], through the bloody pogroms of 1903 to 1906 who left thousands of Jews dead and many more wounded, continuing with the [[Dreyfus Affair]]  in [[France]] in 1894, Jews were profoundly shocked to see the continuing extent of [[anti-Semitism]] from Russia to France, a country which they thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Robert. ''The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa: Blood on the Steps''. 1993, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the first, [[Judah Leib Pinsker]] published the pamphlet [[Auto-Emancipation]] on January 1, 1882.  The pamphlet became influential for the ''Political Zionism'' movement. The movement was to achieve momentum under the leadership of an Austrian-Jewish journalist, [[Theodor Herzl]], who published his pamphlet ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' ("The Jewish State") in 1896. Prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl had been an assimilationist, but after seeing how France treated its loyal Jewish subjects, he proposed building a separate Jewish state. In 1897 Herzl organized the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], which founded the [[World Zionist Organisation]] (WZO) and elected Herzl as its first President.  After the state's establishment Zionism, in its various forms, would become the largest Jewish political movement, although more Jews would participate in the national politics of the countries in which they resided.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Folkists==
{{see also|Jewish Autonomism}}
In the aftermath of the 1905 pogroms in Russia, the historian [[Simon Dubnow]] founded the [[Folkspartei]] (Yiddishe Folkspartay) which had some intellectual audience in Russia, then, in independent [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] in the 1920–1930s where it was represented as well in the Parliaments ([[Sejm]], [[Seimas]]) as in numerous municipal councils (incl. [[Warsaw]]) till in the late 1930s. The party did not survive the Shoah, the Holocaust.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Territorialists==
{{main|Jewish Territorialist Organization}}
The territorialists, who had split from the Zionists after the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905, called for creation of a sufficiently large and compact Jewish territory (or territories), not necessarily in the [[Land of Israel]] and not necessarily fully autonomous. Some territorialist leaders, such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], supported the [[Socialism|Socialist]] versions of [[Zionism]], while some others, such as [[Lucien Wolf]], actively opposed [[Zionism]] and promoted anti-nationalist ideas. [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], one of the founders of the [[Freeland League]], held anti-authoritarian socialist views, as well as his close friend [[Erich Fromm]], who supported Steinberg's territorialist ideas.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Anarchists==
{{main|Jewish Anarchism}}
While the Jews in general played an important role in the international anarchist movements, many Jewish anarchists actively promoted [[Yiddish]] language and culture, focused on specifically Jewish issues. While most Jewish anarchists were irreligious or even vehemently anti-religious, some Jewish anarchist and anti-authoritarian thinkers, such as [[Martin Buber]], rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], were religious or religiously inclined and often referred to the Torah, Talmud and other traditional Judaic sources, claiming that anarchist ideas are deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition. The Jewish anarchists believe that in the stateless, free and diverse anarchist society the Jews would have more opportunities to express their individual and cultural autonomy. Many Jewish anarchists, while promoting universal [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] values, had actively participated in the development of the Yiddish culture and Jewish community life. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There was some intersection between the Jewish anarchist, [[Folkism|Folkist]] and [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|Territorialist]] movements. For example, [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], a renowned Territorialist leader, held anarchist views. Most Jewish anarchists supported [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[communist anarchism]], while a few were individualist anarchists. The small contemporary [[Anarchism in Israel|anarchist movement in Israel]] is very active in [[Israeli peace camp|peace]] and Palestinian solidarity actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Modern Jewish political movements==
Zionism continues to be the central trans-national political movement of most Jews, although it has split into a variety of branches and philosophies that span the political spectrum from left-wing to right-wing.  Jews are also active in government in many of the countries in which they live, as well as in Jewish community organizations that often take political positions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===In Israel===
{{main|Politics of Israel}}
{{see also|List of political parties in Israel}}

===Outside Israel===
In the 20th century, Jews in Europe and the Americas traditionally tended towards the [[left-wing politics|political left]], and played key roles in the birth of the [[labor movement]] as well as [[socialism]].  While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Daniel J. Elazar connects this pluralist tendency to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize, and argues that whereas [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] anticipate a single world-state, Judaism does not.[http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/jud-democ.htm]  This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in their countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed for over 2,000 years. ''(See [[List of Jews#Politics|list of Jews in politics]], which illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in politics.)''

There are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels.  These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community.  Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the [http://www.ujc.org/ United Jewish Communities], have an elected leadership.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local "Jewish Federation", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], Zionist Organization of America, Americans for a safe Israel, [[B'nai B'rith]] and [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The 21st century has brought changes in the political leanings of Jewish communities in the diaspora. In the U.S. and Canada, the two largest Jewish diaspora communities, voters are shifting from liberal to more conservative leanings. in 2011 an Ipsos Reid exit poll of voters in the federal election of Canada found that 52 per cent of Jewish voters supported the Conservatives, 24 per cent the Liberals and 16 per cent the NDP, reflecting " an enormous shift in voter preference among Canadian Jews." The shift appears to reflect an alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition government and its views on Israel’s security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/how-the-political-shift-among-jewish-voters-plays-in-canada/article4199522/ How the political shift among Jewish voters plays in Canada], The Globe and Mail, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community in Great Britain is also leaning conservative in the 21st century as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party.  This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which according to a BBC poll had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working class communities of London is in decline. The main voting bloc of poorer Jews in Britain now, made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox, votes "en masse" for the Conservatives. Attitudes toward [[Israel]] influence the vote of three out of four of British Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/133505/huge-majority-british-jews-will-vote-tory-jc-poll-reveals Huge majority of British Jews will vote Tory, JC poll reveals] The JC.com, 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/218262/how-ed-miliband-lost-britains-jewish-voters/ How Ed Miliband Lost Britain's Jewish Voters] The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, a '''joinder''' is the joining of two or more legal issues together. Procedurally, a joinder allows multiple issues to be heard in one [[hearing (law)|hearing]] or [[trial]] and is done when the issues or parties involved overlap sufficiently to make the process more efficient or more fair.  It helps courts avoid hearing the same facts multiple times or seeing the same parties return to court separately for each of their legal disputes. The term is also used in the realm of contracts to describe the joining of new parties to an existing agreement.

==Criminal procedure==
Joinder in [[criminal law]] refers to the inclusion of additional counts or additional [[defendants]] on an [[indictment]]. In [[English law]], [[indictment|charges]] for any [[offence (law)|offence]] may be joined in the same indictment if those charges are founded on the same facts or form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a similar nature. A number of defendants may be joined in the same [[indictment]] even if no single count applies to all of them if the counts are sufficiently linked. The [[judge]] retains the option to order separate trials.

==Civil procedure==
Joinder in [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] falls under two categories: joinder of claims and joinder of parties.

===Joinder of claims===
Joinder of claims refers to bringing several legal claims against the same party together. In U.S. federal law, joinder of claims is governed by Rule 18 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. These rules allow claimants to consolidate all claims that they have against an individual who is already a party to the case. Claimants may bring new claims even if these new claims are not related to the claims already stated; for example, a [[plaintiff]] suing someone for [[breach of contract]] may also sue the same person for assault. The claims may be unrelated, but they may be joined if the plaintiff desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 18. Joinder of Claims|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_18|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joinder of claims requires that the court have jurisdiction over the subject matter of each of the new claims, and that joinder of claims is never compulsory. A party who sues for breach of contract can bring his suit for assault at a later date if he chooses. However, if the claims are related to the same set of facts, the plaintiff may be barred from bringing claims later by the doctrine of [[res judicata]], e.g. if a plaintiff sues for [[assault]] and the case is concluded, he may not later sue for [[Battery (tort)|battery]] regarding the same occurrence.

===Joinder of parties===
Joinder of parties also falls into two categories: [[permissive joinder]] and [[compulsory joinder]].

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure No. 20 addresses permissive joinder. Permissive joinder allows multiple plaintiffs to join in an action if each of their claims arise from the same transaction or occurrence, and if there is a common question of law or fact relating to all plaintiffs' claims. For example, several landowners may join together in suing a factory for environmental runoff onto their property. Permissive joinder is also appropriate to join multiple defendants, as long as the same considerations as for joining multiple plaintiffs are met. This often occurs in lawsuits regarding faulty products; the plaintiff will sue the manufacturer of the final product and the manufacturers of any constituent parts. The court must have personal jurisdiction over every defendant joined in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 20. Permissive Joinder of Parties|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_20|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory joinder is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, which makes it mandatory that some parties be joined. Parties that must be joined are those necessary and indispensable to the litigation. The rule includes several reasons why this might be true, including if that party has an interest in the dispute that they will be unable to protect if they are not joined. For example, if three parties each lay claim to a piece of property and the first two sue each other, the third will not be able to protect his (alleged) interest in the property if he is not joined. Another circumstance is when a party might end up with inconsistent obligations, for example he may be required by two different courts to grant two different parties exclusive rights to the same piece of property. This is avoided by joining the parties in one lawsuit. However, while "necessary" parties must be joined if that joinder is possible, the litigation will continue without them if joinder is impossible, for example, if the court does not have jurisdiction over the party. By contrast, if [[indispensable party|"indispensable" parties]] cannot be joined, the litigation cannot go forward. Courts have some discretion in determining what parties are indispensable, though the Federal Rules provide some guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_19|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing===
Rules 18 and 20 have different effects depending on when they are invoked.  Joinder may occur as part of an original pleading.  There is a discretionary period after the initial filing, during which original pleadings may be amended as a matter of course.  Parties or claims or both may be joined during this time.  However, if the time for modifying the pleadings has passed, the pleading can be amended with the permission of the opposing party or the judge, though this permission is frequently granted.  Rule 15 describes the process for amending a claim.

Under Rule 42 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court, if actions involve a common question of law or fact, may join any or all issues, consolidate the actions or issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay. The court may also order a separate trial of one or more separate issues or claims for convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite or improve economy.

==Contract law==
Joinder agreements are commonly used in [[mergers and acquisitions]] to bind individual shareholders to the terms of an existing merger agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contribution and Joinder Agreements|url=https://www.srsacquiom.com/contribution-and-joinder-agreements/|publisher=SRS Acquiom|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or shareholder agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLC Agreement (Joinder Agreement)|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/8-383-6673?q=&amp;qp=&amp;qo=&amp;qe=|publisher=Practical Law|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[trust (law)|trust]] practice to bind a donor to the terms and conditions of the trust.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">'''Keyser's Pills''' were an 18th century patent medicine containing mercuric oxide and [[acetic acid]] used to treat [[syphilis]].

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was a [[History_of_syphilis#Historical_treatments|common, long-standing treatment for syphilis]]. Keyser's pills were marketed by and named for Jean Keyser, a surgeon in the French military.&lt;ref name="keyser1"&gt;Louis-Courvoisier M (2007)[http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/an-18th-century-controlled-trial-prompted-by-a-potential-shortage-of-hospital-beds/ An 18th century controlled trial prompted by a potential shortage of hospital beds.],  JLL Bulletin: Commentaries on the history of treatment evaluation&lt;/ref&gt;   They were a standard treatment in the French military by the 1750s.&lt;ref name="pox"&gt;Conner, Susan P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp7rsfCI5MAC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Pox in Eighteenth-Century France], in ''The Secret Malady: Venereal Disease in Eighteenth-century Britain and France'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Keyser's solution of mercury mixed with acetic acid was intended to reduce the side-effects of mercury treatments, but still proved quite dangerous.  A trial of four women at [[Bicêtre Hospital]] caused colic, diarrhea, fevers, nausea and vomiting, and [[mouth ulcers]] to the level of [[gangrene]].  One subject [[miscarried]].&lt;ref name="pox"/&gt; 

A clinical trial of the pills was performed in Geneva in 1761 and deemed successful, which led the pills to be a considered a good treatment for some time, though not without continuing controversy and debate.&lt;ref name="keyser1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watchman"&gt;(1 September 1834).

A '''letter of credit''' ('''LC'''), also known as a '''documentary credit''' or '''bankers commercial credit''', is a [[payment|payment mechanism]] used in [[international trade]] to provide an economic [[guarantee]] from a creditworthy [[bank]] to an exporter of goods. A letter of credit is extremely common within international trade and goods delivery, where the reliability of contracting parties cannot be readily and easily determined. Its economic effect is to introduce a bank as underwriting the credit risk of the buyer paying the seller for goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tfig.unece.org/contents/letters-of-credit.htm|title=Letters of credit|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Trade Facilitation Implementation Guide|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The letter of credit has been used in Europe since ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mead|first=Carl A.|date=April 1922|title=Documentary Letters of Credit|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1111302.pdf|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=22|pages=297-331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters of credit were traditionally governed by internationally recognized rules and procedures rather than by national law. The [[International Chamber of Commerce]] oversaw the preparation of the first [[Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits]] (UCP) in 1933, creating a voluntary framework for commercial banks to apply to transactions worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chadsey|first=Horace M.|date=1954|title=Practical Effect of the Uniform Commercial Code on Documentary Letter of Credit Transactions|url=https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=7792&amp;context=penn_law_review|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=102|pages=618-628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, travelers commonly carried a "circular" letter of credit issued by a relationship bank, which allowed the beneficiary to withdraw cash from other banks along their journey. This type of letter of credit was eventually replaced by [[Traveler's cheque|traveler's checks]], [[Credit card|credit cards]] and [[Automated teller machine|automated teller machines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.law.columbia.edu/CircularLetterOfCredit/|title=The Circular Letter of Credit|last=McKeever|first=Kent|last2=Ditcheva|first2=Boriana|date=October 2006|website=library.law.columbia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although letters of credit first existed only as paper documents, they were regularly issued by [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] in the late 19th century, and by [[telex]] in the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=James G.|last2=Byrne|first2=James E.|date=Spring 2001|title=E-Commerce and Letter of Credit Law and Practice|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2031&amp;context=til|journal=The International Lawyer|volume=35|pages=23-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1973 with the creation of [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]], banks began to migrate to [[electronic data interchange]] as a means of controlling costs, and in 1983 the UCP was amended to allow "teletransmission" of letters of credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozolchyk|first=Boris|date=Summer 1992|title=The Paperless Letter of Credit|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4155&amp;context=lcp|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|volume=55|pages=39-101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 21st century, the vast majority of L/Cs were issued in electronic form and entirely "paperless" L/Cs were becoming more common.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Terminology==
UCP 600 (2007 Revision) regulates common market practice within the letter of credit market. It defines a number of terms related to letters of credit which categorise the various actors within any given transaction. These are crucial to understanding the role financial institutions play within. These include:

* The ''Advising Bank'' is the bank that will inform the Beneficiary or their Nominated Bank of the credit, send the original credit to the Beneficiary or their Nominated Bank, and provide the Beneficiary or their Nominated Bank with any amendments to the letter of credit.
* The ''Applicant'' is the person or company who has requested the letter of credit to be issued; this will normally be the buyer.
* The ''Beneficiary'' is the person or company who will be paid under the letter of credit; this will normally be the seller (UCP600 Art.2 defines the beneficiary as "the party in whose favour a credit is issued").
* A ''Complying Presentation'' is a set of documents that meet with the requirements of the letter of credit and all of the rules relating to letters of credit.
*''Confirming Bank'' is a bank other than the issuing bank that adds its confirmation to credit upon the issuing bank's authorization or request thus providing more security to beneficiary.
*''Confirmation'' is an undertaking from a bank other than the issuing bank to pay the Beneficiary for a Complying Presentation, allowing the Beneficiary to further reduce payment risk, although Confirmation is usually at an extra cost.
*The ''Issuing Bank'' is the bank that issues the credit, usually following a request from an Applicant.
*The ''Nominated Bank'' is a bank mentioned within the letter of credit at which the credit is available (in this respect, UCP600 Art.2 reads: "Nominated bank means the bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of a credit available with any bank") .

==Function==
A letter of credit is an important [[payment method]] in international trade. It is particularly useful where the buyer and seller may not know each other personally and are separated by distance, differing laws in each country, and different trading customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How do Letters of Credit Work|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/finance/letter_of_credit.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a primary method in international trade to mitigate the risk a seller of goods takes when providing those goods to a buyer. It does this by ensuring that the seller is paid for presenting the documents which are specified in the contract for sale between the buyer and the seller. That is to say, a letter of credit is a payment method used to discharge the legal obligations for payment from the buyer to the seller, by having a bank pay the seller directly. Thus, the seller relies on the credit risk of the bank, rather than the buyer, to receive payment. As will be seen, and is observed in Image 2, the bank will pay the seller the value of the goods when the seller provides [[negotiable instruments]], documents which themselves represent the goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters of credit for importers and exporters|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/letters-of-credit-for-importers-and-exporters|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; Upon presentation of the documents, the goods will traditionally be in the control of the issuing bank, which provides them security against the risk that the buyer (who had instructed the bank to pay the seller) will repay the bank for making such a payment.

In the event that the buyer is unable to make payment on the purchase, the seller may make a demand for payment on the bank. The bank will examine the beneficiary's demand and if it complies with the terms of the letter of credit, will honor the demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding and Using Letters of Credit, Part I|url=http://www.crfonline.org/orc/cro/cro-9-1.html|website=Credit Research Foundation|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most letters of credit are governed by rules promulgated by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] known as [[Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hashim|first1=Rosmawani Che|title=The UCP 600 rules in Letter of Credit|url=http://eprints.um.edu.my/14424/1/0001.pdf|website=University of Malaya|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version, UCP 600, became effective July 1, 2007. Banks will typically require collateral from the purchaser for issuing a letter of credit and will charge a fee which is often a percentage of the amount covered by the letter of credit.

===Types===
Several categories of LC's exist which seek to operate in different markets and solve different issues. An example of these include:
* '''Import/export:''' &amp;mdash; The same credit can be termed an import or export letter of credit depending on whose perspective is considered. For the importer it is termed an Import LC and for the exporter of goods, an Export LC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCurdy|first1=William E.|title=Commercial Letters of Credit|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1922|volume=35|issue=5|pages=539–592|jstor=1328326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Revocable/ Irrevocable:''' &amp;mdash; Whether a LC is revocable or irrevocable determines whether the buyer and the issuing bank are able to manipulate the LC or make corrections without informing or getting permissions from the seller. According to UCP 600, all LCs are irrevocable, hence in practice this type of LC increasingly obsolete. Any changes (amendment) or cancellation of the LC (except it is expired) is done by the applicant through the issuing bank. It must be authenticated and approved by the beneficiary.
* '''Confirmed/Unconfirmed:''' &amp;mdash; An LC is said to be confirmed when a second bank adds its confirmation (or guarantee) to honor a complying presentation at the request or authorization of the issuing bank.
* '''Restricted/ Unrestricted:''' &amp;mdash; Either the one advising bank can purchase a bill of exchange from the seller in the case of a restricted LC or; the confirmation bank is not specified, which means that the exporter can show the bill of exchange to any bank and receive a payment on an unrestricted LC.
* '''Deferred / Usance:''' &amp;mdash; A credit that is not paid/assigned immediately after presentation, but after an indicated period that is accepted by both buyer and seller. Typically, seller allows buyer to pay the required money after taking the related goods and selling them.

Additionally, a letter of credit may also have specific terms relating to the payment conditions which relate to the underlying reference documents. Some of these include 
* '''At Sight:''' &amp;mdash; A credit that the announcer bank immediately pays after inspecting the carriage documents from the seller.
* '''Red Clause:''' &amp;mdash; Before sending the products, seller can take the pre-paid part of the money from the bank. The first part of the credit is to attract the attention of the accepting bank. The first time the credit is established by the assigner bank, is to gain the attention of the offered bank. The terms and conditions were typically written in red ink, thus the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlapipertradefinance.com/en/glossary/r/red-clause-letter-of-credit.html|title=Defining Trade Finance -  Red Clause Letter of Credit|last=|first=|date=|website=DLA Piper|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Back to Back''': &amp;mdash; A pair of LCs in which one is to the benefit of a seller who is not able to provide the corresponding goods for unspecified reasons. In that event, a second credit is opened for another seller to provide the desired goods. Back-to-back is issued to facilitate intermediary trade. Intermediate companies such as trading houses are sometimes required to open LCs for a supplier and receive Export LCs from buyer.
* '''Standby Letter of Credit:''' &amp;mdash; Operates like a Commercial Letter of Credit, except that typically it is retained as a "standby" instead of being the intended payment mechanism. In other words, this is a LC which is intended to provide a source of payment in the event of non-performance of contract. This is a security against an obligation which is not performed. If you present the bank with demands of non-payment it is not a guarantee - trigger isn't non-payment - it is presented by documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative Power Solutions v Central Electricity Board [2015]&lt;/ref&gt; UCP600 article 1 provides that the UCP applies to Standbys; [[Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice|ISP98]] applies specifically to Standby letters of Credit; and the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/a50r048.htm|website=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=11 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies to a small number of countries that have ratified the Convention.

====Transferability====  
The exporter has the right to make the credit available to one or more subsequent beneficiaries. 
Credits are made transferable when the original beneficiary is a "middleman", who does not supply the documents himself, but procures either goods or documents from other suppliers and arranges them to be sent to the issuing bank. A letter of credit can be transferred to the second beneficiary at the request of the first beneficiary only if it expressly states that the letter of credit is "transferable". A bank is not obligated to transfer a credit. It can further be transferred to more than one alternate beneficiary as long as it allows partial shipments.
The terms and conditions of the original credit must be replicated exactly in the transferred credit. However, to keep the workability of the transferable letter of credit, some figures can be reduced or curtailed, including:
* Amount
* Unit price of the merchandise (if stated)
* Expiry date
* Presentation period
* Latest shipment date or given period for shipment.
The first beneficiary may demand from the transferring bank to substitute for the applicant. However, if a document other than the invoice must be issued in a way to show the applicant's name, in such a case that requirement must indicate that in the transferred credit it will be free. Transferred credit cannot be transferred again to a third beneficiary at the request of the second beneficiary.

In some cases, the middleman does not want the buyer and supplier know each other. The middleman is entitled to substitute his own invoice for the supplier's and acquire the difference as profit.

==Operational function==
Typically, after a [[sales contract]] has been negotiated, and the buyer and seller have agreed that a letter of credit will be used as the method of payment, the Applicant will contact a bank to ask for a letter of credit to be issued. Once the issuing bank has assessed the buyer's credit risk – i.e. that the Applicant will be able to pay for the goods – it will issue the letter of credit, meaning that it will provide a promise to pay the seller upon presentation of certain documents. Once the Beneficiary (the seller) receives the letter of credit, it will check the terms to ensure that it matches with the contract and will either arrange for shipment of the goods or ask for an amendment to the letter of credit so that it meets with the terms of the contract. The letter of credit is limited in terms of time, the validity of credit, the last date of shipment, and in terms of how much late after shipment the documents may be presented to the Nominated Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Fortis Bank SA/NV v Indian Overseas Bank (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the goods have been shipped, the Beneficiary will present the requested documents to the Nominated Bank.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt;  This bank will check the documents, and if they comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, the issuing Bank is bound to honor the terms of the letter of credit by paying the Beneficiary.

If the documents do not comply with the terms of the letter of credit they are considered '''Discrepant'''. At this point, the Nominated Bank will inform the Beneficiary of the discrepancy and offer a number of options depending on the circumstances after consent of applicant. However, such a discrepancy must be more than trivial. Refusal cannot depend on anything other than reasonable examination of the documents themselves. The bank then must rely on the fact that there was, in fact, a material mistake.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; A fact that if true would entitle the buyer to reject the items. A wrong date such as an early delivery date was held by English courts to not be a material mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; If the discrepancies are minor, it may be possible to present corrected documents to the bank to make the presentation compliant.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; Failure of the bank to pay is grounds for a chose in action. Documents presented after the time limits mentioned in the credit, however, are considered discrepant.

If the corrected documents cannot be supplied in time, the documents may be forwarded directly to the issuing bank "in trust"; effectively in the hope that the Applicant will accept the documents. Documents forwarded in trust remove the payment security of a letter of credit so this route must only be used as a last resort.

Some banks will offer to "Telex for Approval" or similar. This is where the Nominated Bank holds the documents, but sends a message to the Issuing Bank asking if discrepancies are acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; This is more secure than sending documents in trust.

===Documents That May Be Requested For Presentation===
To receive payment, an exporter or shipper must present the documents required by the LC. Typically the letter of credit will request an original [[Bill of lading]] as the use of a title document such as this is critical to the functioning of the Letter of Credit.&lt;ref&gt;Equitable Trust Co of NY v Dawson Partners&lt;/ref&gt; However, the list and form of documents is open to negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third-party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin or place. Typical types of documents in such contracts might include:&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Financial documents''' &amp;mdash; [[Negotiable instrument|bill of exchange]], co-accepted draft
*'''Commercial documents''' &amp;mdash; [[invoice]], [[shipping list|packing list]]
*'''Shipping documents''' &amp;mdash; [[bill of lading]] (ocean or multi-modal or charter party), airway bill, lorry/truck receipt, railway receipt, CMC other than mate receipt, forwarder cargo receipt 
*'''Official documents''' &amp;mdash; license, embassy legalization, origin certificate, inspection certificate, [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures|phytosanitary certificate]]
*'''Insurance documents''' &amp;mdash; insurance policy or certificate, but not a cover note.
The range of documents that may be requested by the applicant is vast, and varies considerably by country and commodity.
Several methods of verifying the documents exist, each provides different variations of risk to the fact that the documents are legitimate. A '''Documentary Credit''' provides security for both buyer and seller. Outlined in the ''UCP 600'', the bank will give an undertaking (or promise), on behalf of buyer (who is often the applicant) to pay the beneficiary the value of the goods shipped if acceptable documents are submitted and if the stipulated terms and conditions are strictly complied with. The buyer can be confident that the goods he is expecting only will be received since it will be evidenced in the form of certain documents, meeting the specified terms and conditions. The supplier finds his confidence in the fact that if such stipulations are met, he will receive payment from the issuing bank, who is independent of the parties to the contract. 
In some cases, a letter of credit will require the documents to be collected. Subject to ICC's  URC 525, sight and [[usance]], for delivery of shipping documents against payment or acceptances of draft, where shipment happens first, then the title documents are sent to the buyer's bank by seller's bank, for delivering documents against collection of payment/acceptance. Other forms of effected payment is the '''direct payment''' where the supplier ships the goods and waits for the buyer to remit the bill, on open account terms.

===Risk Exposure===
Letters of Credit are often used in international transactions to ensure that payment will be received where the buyer and seller may not know each other and are operating in different countries. In this case, the seller is exposed to a number of risks such as [[credit risk]], and [[legal risk]] caused by the distance, differing laws and difficulty in knowing each party personally.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Chartered Bank v Dorchester LNG (2) Ltd [2015].&lt;/ref&gt; some of the other risks inherent in international trade include:

;Fraud Risks
The payment will be obtained for nonexistent or worthless merchandise against presentation by the beneficiary of forged or falsified documents.

;Legal Risks
There is the possibility that performance of a documentary credit may be disturbed by legal action relating directly to the parties and their rights and obligations under the documentary credit or performance may be prevented by government action outside the control of the parties. Alternatively, performance of a contract – including an obligation under a documentary credit relationship – could also be prevented by external factors such as natural disasters or armed conflicts. These risks, however, are often seen as secondary to the risk of non-payment.

;Applicant
Several risks could relate to the parties of the applicant themselves. These may include situations where there is a non-delivery of Goods, [[Short shipment]] the goods are of inferior quality, are damaged, or are late. The applicant is also exposed to the failure of the bank to make payment.

;Issuing Bank
The issuing bank is also exposed to risks which he may seek to mitigate through various techniques. He will be exposed to the insolvency risk of the applicant, that is, the risk the applicant runs insolvent before he is able to repay the letter of credit. Secondly, the bank will be exposed to a risk of fraud by the seller, who may provide incorrect or falsified documents to receive payment. If the bank ought to have known that the documents were a fraud, then the bank will be exposed to a fraud.

;Beneficiary
The beneficiary will be exposed to the risk of its own failure to comply with credit conditions or failure of, or delays in payment from, the issuing bank. These risks are considered remote. Crucially, the beneficiary is not exposed to the risks of [[set-off (law)|set-off]] by the applicant where the goods are damaged or are of inferior quality. While he may be sued by the applicant at a later point, the issuing bank cannot reduce the payment owed to correspond with the damage occurred. This is crucial in mitigating the risk to insolvency. Crucial to a letter of credit is the beneficiary's (the seller) attempt to isolate itself from the credit risk of the buyer. That is to say, it is concerned primarily with the ability of the buyer to pay for the goods.

===Pricing===
Issuance charges, covering negotiation, reimbursements and other charges are paid by the applicant or as per the terms and conditions of the LC. If the LC does not specify charges, they are paid by the Applicant. Charge-related terms are indicated in field 71B.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Legal principles==
The fundamental principle of all letters of credit is that letters of credit deal with documents and not with goods. The payment obligation is independent from the underlying contract of sale or any other contract in the transaction. The bank’s obligation is defined by the terms of the LC alone, and the contract of sale is not considered. So, for example, where party 'A' enters into an agreement to purchase goods from party 'B', Party 'A' will engage with their bank to create a letter of credit.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; If said bank is provided certain documents, by 'B', then he is obliged to pay, regardless of whether the contract between 'A' and 'B' is subject to set-off, or contractual issues. The specified documents are often bill of lading or other "documentary intangibles" which 'A' and 'B' have previously specified in their original contract.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Chartered Bank v Dorchester LNG (2) Ltd [2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses available to the buyer arising out of the sale contract do not concern the bank and in no way affect its liability.&lt;ref&gt;Ficom S.A. v. Socialized Cadex [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 4(a) of the UCP600 states this principle clearly. This is confirmed within the market-practice documents stated by Article 5 of UCP600. As is a core tenant of [[Financial law]], market practice comprises a substantial portion of how parties behave. Accordingly, if the documents tendered by the beneficiary or their agent are in order, then, in general, the bank is obliged to pay without further qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is the issuing bank who bears the [[financial risk|risk]] that is linked with non-payment of the buyer. This is advantageous because the issuing bank often has a personal banking relationship with the buyer. The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods that. It further does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment. However, the only exception to this may be fraud. For example, a dishonest seller may present documents which comply with the letter of credit and receive payment, only to later discover that documents are fraudulent and the goods are not in accordance with the contract, this would place the risk on the buyer, but it also means that the issuing bank must be stringent in assessing whether the presenting documents are legitimate. .&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other [[Financial law]] instruments, a Letter of Credit utilises several legal concepts to achieve the economic effect of shifting the legal exposure from the seller to the buyer. The policies behind adopting this principle of abstraction are purely commercial. Whilst the bank is under an obligation to identify that the correct documents exist, they are not expected to examine whether the documents themselves are valid. That is to say, the bank is not responsible for investigating the underlying facts of each transaction, whether the goods are of the sufficient – and specified – quality or quantity. Because the transaction operates on a negotiable instrument, it is the document itself which holds the value - not the goods to which the reference. This means that the bank need only be concerned with whether the document fulfils the requirements stipulated in the letter of credit. Documents required under the LC, could in certain circumstances, be different from those required under the sale transaction. This would place banks in a dilemma in deciding which terms to follow if required to look behind the credit agreement. Since the basic function of the credit is to provide a seller with the certainty of payment for documentary duties, it would seem necessary that banks should honor their obligation in spite of any buyer allegations of misfeasance.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1.A.C.168 at 183&lt;/ref&gt; If this were not the case, financial institutions would be much less inclined to issue documentary credits because of the risk, inconvenience, and expense involved in determining the underlying goods. Financial institutions do not act as 'middlemen' but rather, as paying agents on behalf of the buyer. Courts have emphasized that buyers always have a remedy for an action upon the contract of sale and that it would be a calamity for the business world if a bank had to investigate every breach of contract.

With the UCP 600 rules the ICC sought to make the rules more flexible, suggesting that data in a document "need not be identical to, but must not conflict with data in that document, any other stipulated document, or the credit", as a way to account for any minor documentary errors. However, in practice, many banks still hold to the principle of strict compliance, since it offers concrete guarantees to all parties. If this were not the case, the bank would be entitled to withhold payment even if the deviation is purely technical or even typographical.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Rayner &amp; Co., Ltd., and the Oil seeds Trading Company, Ltd. v.Ham bros Bank Limited [1942] 73 Ll. L. Rep. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; The general legal maxim ''[[de minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]'' (literally "The law does not concern itself with trifles") has no place in the field. However, whilst the details of the letter of credit can be understood with some flexibility the banks must adhere to the “principle of strict compliance” when determining whether the documents presented are those specified in the letter of credit. This is done to make the banks' duty of effecting payment against documents easy, efficient and quick.

===Legal basis===
Legal writers have failed to satisfactorily reconcile the bank’s obligation to pay on behalf of the applicant with any contractually-founded, academic analysis. That is to say, they have not examined legal effect of the banks obligation through a conclusive theoretical lens. This has produced several conflicting theories as to the contractual effect of a letter of credit. Some theorists suggest that the obligation to pay arises through the implied promise, [[Assignment (law)|assignment]], [[novation]], reliance, [[Agency (law)|agency]], [[estoppel]] and even [[Trust law|trust]] and the guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Herman Norman|title=Legal Aspects of Commercial Letters of Credit|date=1930|publisher=Columbia University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsgMMwEACAAJ|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although documentary credits are enforceable once communicated to the beneficiary, it is difficult to show any [[consideration]] given by the beneficiary to the banker prior to the tender of documents. In such transactions the undertaking by the beneficiary to deliver the goods to the applicant is not sufficient consideration for the bank’s promise because the contract of sale is made before the issuance of the credit, thus consideration in these circumstances is past. However, the performance of an existing duty under a contract may be a valid consideration for a new promise made by the bank, provided that there is some practical benefit to the bank&lt;ref&gt;William v Roffey Brothers &amp; Nicholls (contractors) Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; A promise to perform owed to a third party may also constitute a valid consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Scotson v Pegg&lt;/ref&gt;

It might also be feasible to typify letters of credit as a [[collateral contract]] for a [[third-party beneficiary]], because three different entities participate in the transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. [[Jean Domat]] suggests that because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity, the cause of a LC is to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller. Therefore, a LC theoretically fits as a [[collateral contract]] accepted by conduct or in other words, an [[implied-in-fact contract]] where the buyer participates as the third party beneficiary with the bank acting as the stipulator and the seller as the promisor. The term "[[beneficiary]]" is not used properly in the scheme of an LC because a beneficiary (also, in trust law, ''[[cestui que use]]'') in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. Note that under the scheme of letters of credit, banks are neither benefactors of sellers nor benefactors of buyers and the seller receives no money in gratuity mode. Thus is possible that a “letter of credit” was one of those contracts that needed to be masked to disguise the “[[consideration]] or [[Privity in English law|privity]] requirement”. As a result, this kind of arrangement would make letter of credit to be enforceable under the action [[assumpsit]] because of its promissory connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menendez|first=Andres|title=Letter of Credit, its Relation with Stipulation for the Benefit of a Third Party|ssrn=2019474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few countries have created statutes in relation to letters of credit. For example, most jurisdictions in the [[United States]] (U.S.) have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 5 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC). These statutes are designed to work with the rules of market practice including UCP and [[Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice|ISP98]]. These rules of practice are incorporated into the transaction by agreement of the parties. The latest version of the UCP is the UCP600 effective July 1, 2007.  Since the UCP are not laws, parties have to include them into their arrangements as normal contractual provisions. However, they still form a substantial part of market practice and underpin [[Financial law]] crucially.

== National laws ==

=== Germany ===
''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', the German civil code, does not directly address letters of credit. German case law indicates that the relationship between the issuing bank and customer is a contract for execution of a transaction, while the relationship between the issuing bank and the beneficiary is a promise of a debt.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grassi|first=Paolo S.|date=1995|title=Letter of Credit Transactions: The Banks' Position in Determining Documentary Compliance-A Comparative Evaluation under US, Swiss and German Law|url=https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1297&amp;context=pilr|journal=Pace International Law Review|volume=7|pages=81-127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[Swiss Civil Code]] of 1911 did not directly address letters of credit, which were still rare in the country at the time. Courts eventually dealt with the device by treating it as a hybrid of a mandate (''Auftrag'') and authorization-to-pay contract (''Anweisung'').&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== United States ===
Letters of credit came into general domestic use in the United States during [[World War I]], although they had been used in American foreign trade for some time prior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has historically had the most substantial and consistent body of case law in the United States with regard to letters of credit, due to the prominence of New York banks in international trade.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harfield|first=Henry|date=Fall 1962|title=Code Treatment of Letters of Credit|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2391&amp;context=clr|journal=Cornell Law Quarterly|volume=48|pages=92-107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Bankers Commercial Credit Conference of 1920 provided the first set of voluntary L/C regulations for major banks in the United States, but these banks transitioned to the international UCP standard by 1938.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Article 5 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], drafted in 1952, provided a basis for codifying many UCP principles into state law&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and created one of the only extensive specific legal regulations of letters of credit worldwide, although the UCC rules do not cover all aspects of letters of credit.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; New York effectively subjugated the UCC rules to the existing UCP rules, and as a result the UCP rules continued to govern letters of credit under New York law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Article 5 was revised in 1995 to reflect the latest international practices as codified in the UCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=James G.|date=1995|title=Internationalization of Revised UCC Article 5 (Letters of Credit)|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1428&amp;context=njilb|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business|volume=16|pages=215-223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in fraud ==
Letters of credit are sometimes used to defraud banks through presentment of false documentation indicating that goods were shipped when they actually were not. Letters of credit are also sometimes used as part of fraudulent investment schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/letter-of-credit-fraud|title=Letter of Credit Fraud|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macaca nigra self-portrait large.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the monkey selfies at issue in the dispute]]
The '''monkey selfie copyright dispute''' is a series of disputes about the copyright status of [[selfie]]s taken by [[Celebes crested macaque]]s using equipment belonging to the British nature photographer David Slater. The disputes involve [[Wikimedia Commons]] and the blog ''[[Techdirt]]'', which have hosted the images following their publication in newspapers in July 2011 over Slater's objections, and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), who have argued that the macaque should be assigned the copyright.

Slater has argued that he has a valid copyright claim based on the fact that he engineered the situation that resulted in the pictures, by travelling to Indonesia, befriending a group of wild macaques, and setting up his camera equipment in such a way that a "selfie" picture might come about. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s 2014 refusal to remove the pictures from its Wikimedia Commons image library was based on the understanding that copyright is held by the creator, that a non-human creator (not being a [[legal person]]) cannot hold copyright, and that the images are thus in the [[public domain]].  Slater stated in August 2014 that as a result of the pictures being available on Wikipedia, he had lost "£10,000 or more in income" and that it was "killing [his] business" as a [[Wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]].&lt;ref name="bbc-selfie" /&gt;  In December 2014, the [[United States Copyright Office]] stated that [[animal-made art|works created by a non-human]], such as a photograph taken by a monkey, are not [[copyright]]able. A number of legal experts in the US and UK have nevertheless argued that Slater's role in the photographic process may have been sufficient to establish a valid copyright claim, though this decision would have to be made by a court.&lt;ref name=PolicyReview /&gt;&lt;ref name="El Reg, Cracking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollo" /&gt;

In a separate dispute, PETA tried to use the monkey selfies to establish a legal precedent that animals should be declared copyright holders. Slater had published a book containing the photographs through self-publishing company [[Blurb, Inc.]] In September 2015, PETA filed a lawsuit against Slater and Blurb, requesting that the monkey be assigned copyright and that PETA be appointed to administer proceeds from the photos for the endangered species' benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/Complaint.pdf|title=NARUTO, a Crested Macaque, by and through his Next Friends, PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS, INC., and ANTJE ENGELHARDT, Ph.D. Plaintiff, vs. DAVID JOHN SLATER, an individual, BLURB, INC., a Delaware corporation, and WILDLIFE PERSONALITIES, LTD., a United Kingdom private limited company, Defendants.|date=21 September 2015|publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dismissing PETA's case, the court ruled that a monkey cannot own copyright, under U.S. law.&lt;ref name="AT-20160106"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kravets |first=David |title=Judge says monkey cannot own copyright to famous selfies |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/judge-says-monkey-cannot-own-copyright-to-famous-selfies/ |date=6 January 2016 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=7 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PETA appealed, and in September 2017, both PETA and the photographer agreed to a settlement in which Slater would donate a portion of future revenues on the photographs to wildlife organizations. However, the court of appeals declined to dismiss the appeal and declined to vacate the lower court judgment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Streit-um-Affen-Selfie-geht-weiter-Vergleich-hinfaellig-Urteil-angekuendigt-4024493.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2018, the appeals court affirmed that animals can not legally hold copyrights and expressed concern that PETA's motivations had been to promote their own interests rather than to protect the legal rights of animals.

==Background==
[[File:Macaca nigra self-portrait full body.jpg|thumb|upright|The other disputed image, a full-body "selfie"]]
Since 2008, British nature photographer David Slater had traveled to [[Indonesia]] to take photographs of the critically endangered [[Celebes crested macaque]]s. In 2011 he licensed several images to the Caters News Agency who released them, along with a written promotional press release with quotes from Slater, for publication in the British media.&lt;ref name="newsweek wmf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newsweek.com/lawyers-dispute-wikimedias-claims-about-monkey-selfie-copyright-265961 | title = WIKIMEDIA SAYS WHEN A MONKEY TAKES A SELFIE, NO ONE OWNS IT | first = Louise | last = Stewart | date  = 21 August 2014 | accessdate = 15 November 2017 | work = [[Newsweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/monkey-selfie-copyright-lessons-originality-photographs-and-internet-jurisdiction|title=The monkey selfie: copyright lessons for originality in photographs and internet jurisdiction|first=Andrés|last=Guadamuz|date=21 March 2016|publisher=|journal=Internet Policy Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 2011 several publications including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'',&lt;ref name="newsweek wmf"/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/travel-news/monkeys-take-photos-with-camera-stolen-from-photographer-david-slater/news-story/3c394d07d25c58cdea268e870dba1c70|title=Taking a photo is monkey business|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; picked up the story and published the pictures along with articles that quoted Slater as describing the photographs as self-portraits taken by the monkeys: "Monkey steals camera to snap himself" (''The Telegraph''),&lt;ref name=Telegraph_04_Jul_11&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8615859/Monkey-steals-camera-to-snap-himself.html|title=Monkey steals camera to snap himself|work=The Telegraph|date=4 July 2011|access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a camera on a tripod" triggered by the monkeys (''The Guardian''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/shutter-happy-monkey-photographer Steven Morris, Shutter-happy monkey turns photographer, theguardian.com  Monday 4 July 2011 14.34 EDT]&lt;/ref&gt; and a camera started by a monkey "Fascinated by her reflection in the lens". (''Daily Mail'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2011051/Black-macaque-takes-self-portrait-Monkey-borrows-photographers-camera.html | title = Cheeky monkey!

The following day ''[[Amateur Photographer]]'' reported Slater gave them further explanation as to how the photographs were created downplaying the way newspaper articles had described the photographs; Slater said reports that a monkey ran off with his camera and "began taking self-portraits" were incorrect and that the portrait was shot when his camera had been mounted on a tripod, with the primates playing around with a remote cable release as he fended off other monkeys.&lt;ref name=Amateur_Photographer_5_July_2011&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Cheesman|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/ape-rture-priority-photographer-plays-down-monkey-reports-16224|title=Ape-rture priority photographer plays down monkey reports|work=[[Amateur Photographer]]|date=5 July 2011|access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slater gave further description in his website and other media accounts saying he and a guide followed the monkeys for three days, gaining their trust on the second day.&lt;ref name=DJ_Sphotography_16_Aug_2014 /&gt; According to Slater, in his attempts to get photographs of the monkeys, he found the they were fascinated with the camera and the camera gear and kept playing with it, but they also kept trying to run off with the camera. Slater further stated in a August 7, 2014 ''Amateur Photographer'' follow up article that "I wanted a close-up image but I couldn't do it. They were too nervous so I had to get them [the monkeys] to come to the camera without me being there and get them to play with the release, which they did".  He added: "They were looking at the reflection in the lens which they found amusing".&lt;ref name=Amateur_Photographer_7_August_2014&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Cheesman|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/photographer-goes-ape-over-monkey-selfie-who-owns-the-copyright-5054|title=Photographer goes ape over monkey selfie: Who owns the copyright?|work=[[Amateur Photographer]]|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to get a portrait of the monkeys' faces, Slater said he set the camera on a tripod with a large [[wide angle lens]] attached, and set the camera's settings to optimize the chances of getting a facial close up, using [[Autofocus#AI servo|predictive autofocus]], [[motor drive]], and a [[Flash (photography)|flashgun]]. Slater further stated that he set the camera's [[Remote control#Photography|remote shutter trigger]] next to the camera and, while he held onto the tripod, the monkeys spent 30 minutes looking into the lens and playing with the camera gear, triggering the remote multiple times and capturing many photographs. The session ended when the "dominant male at times became over excited and eventually gave me a whack with his hand as he bounced off my back".&lt;ref name=DJ_Sphotography_16_Aug_2014 /&gt;  Slater also said in a 28 July 2017 ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine interview that some news outlets were misreporting how he obtained the selfie, but he went along with it because it was "a bit of fun and some good publicity for the conservation cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/3knmnv/im-a-human-man-being-sued-by-a-monkey|title=I'm a Human Man Being Sued By a Monkey|date=29 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright issues==
On 9 July 2011, an editor on [[Wikimedia Commons]], a site that only accepts media available under a [[free content license]], in the [[public domain]], or otherwise [[threshold of originality|ineligible for copyright]], uploaded the selfie photographs from ''The Daily Mail''.&lt;ref name="newsweek wmf"/&gt; The uploader asserted that the photographs were in the public domain as "the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested".&lt;ref name=Wikipedia_9_Jul_2011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Macaca_nigra_self-portrait.jpg#filehistory|title=Macaca nigra self-portrait|work=Wikimedia Commons|date=9 July 2017|access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater discovered this a few days later and requested that the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] remove the photos. Initially, an administrator at Commons removed the images, but they were later restored after a community discussion on their copyright nature. Slater continued to challenge the Foundation to remove the image.&lt;ref name="newsweek wmf"/&gt; The Foundation reviewed the situation, but made the determination that the images were in the public domain and denied Slater's request; in its transparency report for August 2014, the Foundation stated "copyright cannot vest in non-human authors" and "when a work's copyright cannot vest in a human, it falls into the public domain".&lt;ref name="newsweek wmf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-selfie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-reject"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28672121| title = Wikipedia reveals Google 'forgotten' search links| date = 6 August 2014| accessdate = 8 August 2014| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slater's conflict with the Wikimedia Foundation was covered by the blog ''[[Techdirt]]'' on 12 July 2011. ''Techdirt'' posted the photograph with a public domain license, arguing that the photograph was in the [[public domain]] because the monkey was not a [[legal person]] capable of holding a copyright, and Slater could not hold copyright to the photo because he was not involved in its creation.&lt;ref name=techdirt-monkeysdontdofairuse&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|title=Monkeys Don't Do Fair Use; News Agency Tells Techdirt To Remove Photos|date=12 July 2011|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110712/01182015052/monkeys-dont-do-fair-use-news-agency-tells-techdirt-to-remove-photos.shtml|website=Techdirt|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metro-monkeyright&gt;{{cite web|title=Can monkey who took grinning self-portrait claim copyright?|url=http://metro.co.uk/2011/07/14/can-monkey-who-took-grinning-self-portrait-claim-copyright-77773/|website=Metro|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techdirt-supoenathemonkey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|title=Can We Subpoena The Monkey?

Slater counterargued in response to both the Wikimedia Foundation and ''Techdirt'' that he had made significant creative contributions to the monkey selfie photographs that would make the public domain argument moot.&lt;ref name="newsweek wmf"/&gt; Slater told the BBC "I became accepted as part of the troop, they touched me and groomed me&amp;nbsp;... so I thought they could take their own photograph.

===Expert opinions===
American and British [[intellectual property]] lawyers Mary M. Luria and Charles Swan said that because the creator of the photograph is an animal and not a person, there is no copyright on the photograph, regardless of who owns the equipment with which the photograph was created.&lt;ref name="Laurent2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/08/06/monkey-selfie/?iid=lfaround#1|title=Monkey Selfie Lands Photographer in Legal Quagmire|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Olivier|last=Laurent|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=no|archivedate=14 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814172455/http://lightbox.time.com/2014/08/06/monkey-selfie/|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, British [[Entertainment law|media lawyer]] Christina Michalos said that on the basis of [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988|British law]] on [[computer-generated art]], it is arguable that Slater may own copyrights on the photograph, because he owned and presumably had set up the camera.&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2014-08-06/wikipedia-refuses-to-delete-photo-as-monkey-owns-it/|title=Monkey 'selfie' picture sparks Wikipedia copyright row|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=no|archivedate=13 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813141113/http://www.itv.com/news/2014-08-06/wikipedia-refuses-to-delete-photo-as-monkey-owns-it/|publisher=[[ITV plc]]|work=[[ITV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Serena Tierney, of London lawyers BDB, stated "If he checked the angle of the shot, set up the equipment to produce a picture with specific light and shade effects, set the exposure or used filters or other special settings, light and that everything required is in the shot, and all the monkey contributed was to press the button, then he would seem to have a passable claim that copyright subsists in the photo in the UK and that he is the author and so first owner."&lt;ref name="El Reg, Cracking" /&gt; Furthermore, Andres Guadamuz, a lecturer in IP law at Sussex University, has written that existing European case law, particularly ''[[Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening]]'', makes it clear that the selection of photographs would be enough to warrant originality if the process reflects the personality of the photographer.&lt;ref name=PolicyReview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guadamuz|first1=Andres|title=The monkey selfie: copyright lessons for originality in photographs and internet jurisdiction|journal=Internet Policy Review|date=2016|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.14763/2016.1.398|url=http://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/monkey-selfie-copyright-lessons-originality-photographs-and-internet-jurisdiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2014 the United States Copyright Office published an opinion, later included in the Office's ''[[Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices]], Third Edition'', released on 22 December 2014, to clarify that "only works created by a human can be copyrighted under United States law, which excludes photographs and artwork created by animals or by machines without human intervention" and that "Because copyright law is limited to 'original intellectual conceptions of the author,' the [copyright] office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work. The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants."&lt;ref name = Axelrad&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech-Culture/2014/0822/US-government-Monkey-selfies-ineligible-for-copyright | date = 22 August 2014 | accessdate = 23 August 2014 | first = Jacob | last = Axelrad | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | title = US government: Monkey selfies ineligible for copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Compendium313.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf |title=Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, § 313.2 |page=22 |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=27 April 2015 |quote=To qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being.... Works that do not satisfy this requirement are not copyrightable.

According to [[University of Michigan]] law professor, [[Jessica Litman]], "No human author has rights to a photograph taken by a monkey," ... "The original monkey selfie is in the public domain". She said that the US Copyright Office was clarifying existing practice, and not creating a new policy.&lt;ref name = Axelrad/&gt;

Art lawyer Nicholas O'Donnell of Sullivan &amp; Worcester LLP commented that "even if 'a photograph taken by a monkey' cannot be copyrighted by the monkey, it is not clear why that would categorically rule out any copyright for a human author in a work in which cameras are intentionally left in a place where some natural force or animal will cause them to snap a photo".&lt;ref name="Apollo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/is-the-monkey-selfie-case-making-a-monkey-out-of-the-law/ | title=Is the 'monkey selfie' case making a monkey out of the law? |author=Nicholas O'Donnell | work = [[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo Magazine]] | date=28 July 2017 | accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokeswoman for the UK [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]] similarly said, "The IPO indicates that under UK law animals cannot own copyright. However the question as to whether the photographer owns copyright is more complex. It depends on whether the photographer has made a creative contribution to the work and this is a decision which must be made by the courts."&lt;ref name=Guardian2014-08-22&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/22/monkey-business-macaque-selfie-cant-be-copyrighted-say-us-and-uk|title=Monkey business: macaque selfie can't be copyrighted, say US and UK|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=The Guardian|date=22 August 2014|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wikimania 2014 ==
The "Monkey-selfie selfie" became a theme at [[Wikimania 2014]] at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wikimania Gets Social|date=11 August 2014|website=Barbican Centre|url=http://blog.barbican.org.uk/2014/08/wikimania-gets-social/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conference attendees, including Wikipedia co-founder and Wikimedia Foundation board member [[Jimmy Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite twitter|title=So this just happened... @jimmy_wales selfie with a #monkeyselfie #wikimania2014|user=WikimaniaLondon |number=497445491387691008|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; posed for selfies with printed copies of the macaque photograph. Reaction to these selfies and to pre-printed monkey posters was mixed. According to Wikipedia contributor Andreas Kolbe, writing in [[Wikipediocracy]], Wales' action was criticized by some users on [[Twitter]] and Wikipedia "for what appeared like tactless gloating".&lt;ref name="El Reg, Cracking"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cracking copyright law: How a simian selfie stunt could make a monkey out of Wikipedia|date=24 August 2014|first=Andrew|last= Orlowski|authorlink=Andrew Orlowski|newspaper=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/24/wikipedia_monkey_selfie_backfire/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Naruto et al v. David Slater''==
The macaque photographs appeared in a book titled "Wildlife Personalities" that Slater had published via San Francisco-based self-publishing company [[Blurb, Inc.]] On 22 September 2015, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) filed a lawsuit against Slater and Blurb in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] to request that the monkey, whom they named Naruto, be assigned copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/peta-files-suit-on-behalf-of-grinning-selfie-monkey/a-18730953 |title=PETA files suit on behalf of grinning 'selfie monkey' |date = 22 September 2015 | accessdate = 22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that PETA be appointed to administer proceeds from the photos for the benefit of Naruto and other crested macaques in the reserve on Sulawesi.&lt;ref name=USN20160106/&gt;&lt;ref name=The_Guardian_12_Sep_2017&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/monkey-selfie-warring-parties-reach-settlement-over-court-case|title=Monkey selfie: warring parties reach settlement over court case |work=The Guardian|date=12 September 2017|access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PETA did so by using the [[next friend]] principle, which allows persons to sue in the name of another person who is unable to do so. In November, Angela Dunning, the attorney for Blurb, noted that PETA may have been suing on behalf of the wrong monkey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/will-the-real-monkey-who-snapped-those-famous-selfies-please-stand-up/ Will the real monkey who snapped those famous selfies please stand up?], by David Kravets, at ''[[Ars Technica]]''; published 10 November 2015; retrieved 2 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During a hearing in January 2016, US District Judge [[William Orrick III]] said that the [[Copyright law of the United States#Copyright limitations, exceptions, and defenses|copyright law]] does not extend its protection to animals.&lt;ref name="AT-20160106" /&gt;&lt;ref name=USN20160106&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2016-01-06/judge-rules-monkey-cannot-own-selfie-photos-copyright A macaque monkey who took now-famous selfie photographs cannot be declared the copyright owner of the photos], ''Associated Press'', 7 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Orrick dismissed the case on 28 January, ruling that "if Congress and the president intended to take the extraordinary step of authorizing animals as well as people and legal entities to sue, they could, and should, have said so plainly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Iovino |first1=Nicholas |title=Judge Dismisses PETA's 'Monkey Selfie' Lawsuit |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/01/29/judge-dismisses-petas-monkey-selfie-lawsuit.htm |accessdate=30 January 2016 |agency=Courthouse Naws Service |date=29 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131082259/http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/01/29/judge-dismisses-petas-monkey-selfie-lawsuit.htm |archivedate=31 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Naruto, et al. v.

The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] filed an amicus brief on 13 September 2017, urging the court to deny vacatur. The brief argues, that since Naruto is not a party to the settlement, PETA does not have standing to move for vacatur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sophie Duffy|author2=Dori Ann Hanswirth|title=Monkey See, Monkey Do… Monkey Own?

The judges noted that their decision had to be considered in light of ''Cetacean Community v.

==Impact on Slater==
Slater told [[BBC News]] that he had suffered financial loss as a result of the pictures being available on Wikimedia Commons, "I made £2,000 [for that picture] in the first year after it was taken. After it went on Wikipedia all interest in buying it went. It's hard to put a figure on it but I reckon I've lost £10,000 or more in income. It's killing my business."&lt;ref name="bbc-selfie"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28674167| title = Photographer 'lost £10,000' in Wikipedia monkey 'selfie' row| date = 7 August 2013| accessdate = 7 August 2014| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater was quoted by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as saying, "What they don't realise is that it needs a court to decide [the copyright]."&lt;ref name="Telegraph-2014-08-6"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sparkes |first=Matthew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11015672/Wikipedia-refuses-to-delete-photo-as-monkey-owns-it.html |title=Wikipedia refuses to delete photo as 'monkey owns it' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=2014-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Slater stated his intention to sue Wikipedia for copyright infringement of his works.&lt;ref name="southwalesargus"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/14191777.Gwent__monkey_selfie__photographer_to_sue_Wikipedia/ | date = 8 January 2016 | accessdate = 8 January 2016 | publisher = [[South Wales Argus]] | title = The Gwent photographer who won a legal battle over a 'monkey selfie' is to sue Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|April 2018|post=,}} no lawsuit has been filed.

By July 2017, Slater was reported to be broke and unable to pay his attorney.&lt;ref name=Guardian2017-07-12&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/monkey-selfie-macaque-copyright-court-david-slater|title=Monkey selfie photographer says he's broke: 'I'm thinking of dog walking'|author=Julia Carrie Wong|work=The Guardian|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph2017-07-13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/photographer-being-sued-by-a-monkey-over-its-selfie-is-now-broke/|title=Photographer Being Sued By A Monkey Over Its "Selfie" Is Now Broke|work=IFLScience|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he had originally made a few thousand pounds from the images, enough to recoup his travel costs to Indonesia, this income reduced to about "£100 every few months" when the Wikimedia Foundation refused to stop making the images available without his permission.&lt;ref name="bbc-selfie" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph2017-07-13 /&gt;

Slater was unable to travel to the July 2017 court hearing in the United States for lack of funds and said he was considering alternative careers as a dog walker or tennis coach.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2017-07-13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/13/photographer-centre-bizarre-court-battle-reveals-sued-monkey/|title=Photographer in bizarre selfie court battle reveals that being sued by a monkey has left him broke|work=The Telegraph|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This would be a new venture for me. It would pay peanuts, but at least it would be more than photography. I am just not motivated to go out and take photos any more. I've had outlays of several thousand pounds for lawyers, it is losing me income and getting me so depressed. When I think about the whole situation I really don't think it's worth it."&lt;ref name=Telegraph2017-07-13 /&gt; Slater added, "Everything I did to try and highlight the plight of the monkeys has backfired on my private life. I've had my life ruined."&lt;ref name=Telegraph2017-07-13 /&gt;

However, Slater still said he felt "absolutely delighted" with the impact of the photo shoot itself: "It has taken six years for my original intention to come true which was to highlight the plight of the monkeys and bring it to the world. No one had heard of these monkeys six years ago, they were down to the last thousands. ... The locals used to roast them, but now they love them, they call it the 'selfie monkey'. Tourists are now visiting and people see there is a longer-term benefit to the community than just shooting a monkey."&lt;ref name=Telegraph2017-07-13 /&gt;

In May 2018, [[Condé Nast Entertainment]] acquired the rights from Slater to make a documentary-style film related to the monkey selfie dispute. The project is being overseen by [[Dawn Ostroff]] and Jeremy Steckler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/monkey-selfie-film-works-at-conde-nast-1109061 | title = 'Monkey Selfie' Film in the Works at Conde Nast  | first = Tatiana | last = Siegel | date = 7 May 2018 | accessdate = 8 May 2018 | work =[[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest''', or '''The Nauru Agreement''' is an Oceania subregional agreement between the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Kiribati]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Tuvalu]].&lt;ref name=radioaustralia&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Pacific Nations Extend Fishing Ban |url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2010/October/10-06-01.htm|work=[[Radio Australia]] |publisher=[[East West Center]] |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eight signatories collectively control 25–30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply.&lt;ref&gt;http://klima-tuvalu.no/2011/04/13/pacific-islands-fighting-for-their-tuna/&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Nauru Agreement and other joint fishery management Arrangements made by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (usually referred to as ''PNA'') have been concerned mainly with the management of tuna [[purse-seine fishing]] in the tropical western Pacific.

==Institutional arrangements==
From its initial enactment in 1982, the implementation of the Nauru Agreement was coordinated by the [[Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency]] (FFA). However a separate PNA Office was created in 2010, based in Majuro, Marshall Islands. The current (2017) PNA chief executive officer is [[Ludwig Kumoru]] of Papua New Guinea, who succeeded Dr [[Transform Aqorau]] of Solomon Islands in 2016.&lt;ref name="PNA_341"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnatuna.com/node/341 |title=PNA names new Chief Executive Officer |date=15 April 2016 |work=pnatuna.com |accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fishing rules==
In October 2010, the eight member states Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) extended their prohibition on tuna [[purse-seine fishing]] in approximately 4.5 million square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean high seas by purse-seine vessels licensed to fish in their combined [[Exclusive Economic Zones]].&lt;ref name=radioaustralia/&gt; The extension was unveiled at the 6th meeting of the Technical and Compliance Committee of the [[Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission]] (WCPFC).

Other recent actions by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement include a prohibition on setting purse-seine nets around whale sharks, a ban on fishing near fish aggregation devices during the months of July, August and September (with an option to extend this for up to an additional three months if scientific advice suggests that tuna stocks would benefit), a requirement for 100% observer coverage aboard purse-seiners, a minimum mesh-size, and a requirement for retention of all catch of tuna on board (no discards).

The full range of fishery management instruments&lt;ref name=PNA_ARR&gt;{{cite web|title=PNA Fisheries Management Arrangements|url=http://sites.google.com/site/naurufisheries/home/regional-laws|work=Nauru Fisheries and Marine Resources website Regional Laws section}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement includes:

*The Federated States of Micronesia Arrangement: which defines a multilateral licensing arrangement providing annual access to all PNA EEZs by purse-seine vessels which contribute significantly to the enhancement of a PNA country's (the ''Home Party'') economic involvement in the fishery.
*The Palau Arrangement: which formerly set an agreed, binding, limit on the number of purse-seine vessels allowed to operate in PNA waters. The Palau Arrangement, through the Palau Arrangement Purse-seine Vessel Days Management Scheme, now limits the amount of effort (in terms of number of fishing days) that can be exercised by purse-seine vessels in PNA waters during any one calendar year. A Longline Vessel Days Management Scheme is currently under trial and is planned to be introduced on 1 January 2013.
*The Implementing Arrangements of the Nauru Agreement: There have been three of these, defining the measures that have been agreed by all Parties that will be implemented in the management of the activities of purse-seine vessels in their own EEZs, either through Regulations or licensing conditions. These include the measures highlighted above, such as the requirement not to license any purse-seine vessel which also fishes in certain defined High Seas areas.

These PNA-specific measures are also supplemented by the ''Harmonized Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access to FFA member EEZs by Foreign Fishing Vessels'', agreed by all [[Forum Fisheries Agency|FFA]] member countries including the Parties to the Nauru Agreement. These terms and conditions apply to all foreign fishing vessels, not just purse-seiners, and include a requirement for an Automatic Location Communicator to be switched on at all times and reporting to the regional Vessel Monitoring System, minimum standards for reporting to national authorities, and a requirement for annual regional vessel registration.

In May 2012 the PNA Fisheries Ministers met in Alotau, Papua New Guinea, and through a Resolution on Marine Animals.&lt;ref name=Alotau&gt;{{cite web|last=PNA|title=PNA celebrates first World Tuna Day in Alotau, PNG &amp; releases Resolution on Marine Animals|url=http://pnatuna.com/pna-celebrates-first-world-tuna-day-alotau-png-releases-resolution-marine-animals|accessdate=25 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131111218/http://pnatuna.com/pna-celebrates-first-world-tuna-day-alotau-png-releases-resolution-marine-animals|archivedate=31 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave their commitment to implement even stronger management measures in their joint EEZs order to maintain sustainable tuna fisheries and minimise impact on bycatch species&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title= Nauru Agreement praised| date =24 May 2012|url=http://www.fishnewseu.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8267:nauru-agreement-praised&amp;catid=46:world&amp;Itemid=56|publisher= The Scottish White Fish Producers' Association|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new commitments include:

* Establishing a PNA Observer Agency by 1 January 2013 to improve efficiency of national observer programmes in maintaining 100% independent observer coverage aboard purse-seine fishing vessels in PNA waters;
* Adopting the MSC Implementation Plan, including fast-tracking an agreement on Precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules for the PNA free-school skipjack purse-seine fishery, as required to maintain MSC Certification (see below);
* Approving work on developing a FAD registration and tracking scheme to be trialled in 2013, in collaboration with the [[The Pew Charitable Trusts|Pew Environment Group]]
* Agreeing an amendment to the Palau Arrangement Purse-seine Vessel Days Management Scheme that provides a clear and unambiguous definition of the Fishing Day. In particular, clarifying that any calendar day in which any fishing activity takes place will be counted as a full fishing day, with limited exemptions for days in which the only activities during that day are bona-fide emergencies, breakdowns, refuelling, repairs, or expeditious transit with fully stowed fishing gear. 
* Continuing to advocate within the WCPFC for more effective conservation and management measures to be implemented across the whole Western and Central Pacific region, including the Conservation and Management Measure on Marine Mammals that was proposed in 2010 and 2011.

==PNA Fisheries Ministers meetings==
At the May 2012 meeting in Alotau, [[Papua New Guinea]], the Fisheries Ministers also approved a PNA Office Business Plan, and welcomed [[Tokelau]] as a party to the Palau Arrangement Purse-Seine Vessel Days Management Scheme.

In June 2015 the PNA Fisheries Ministers met in Palikir, [[Pohnpei]], under the chairmanship of [[Elisala Pita]] of [[Tuvalu]],&lt;ref name="RNZI_120615"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/276096/tuvalu-irked-by-big-power-fishing-stance |title=Tuvalu irked by big power fishing stance |date=12 June 2015 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2015 has refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked Tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery.&lt;ref name="PAC_120615"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=309639 |title=Tuvalu refuses to sell fishing days |date=13 June 2015 |work=The Fijian Times Online (PNA/PACNEWS) |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT_160615"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/89428|title=Tuvalu to stop selling fishing days to nations |date=12 June 2015 |work=The National|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisala Pita also said that Tuvalu was disappointed with the outcomes of recent meetings of the WCPFC as some fishing nations had tried to avoid their responsibilities and commitment to sustainable fishing.&lt;ref name="NAT_160615"/&gt;

==MSC certification==
In December 2011,&lt;ref name=MSC_cert&gt;{{cite news|last=Hough|first=Andrew|title=Issuance of Public Certification Report|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/pacific/pna_western_central_pacific_skipjack_tuna/assessment-downloads-1/20111221_PCR_Announcement.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2012|date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the PNA purse-seine free-school skipjack fishery was certified according to [[Marine Stewardship Council]] standards as being sustainable.&lt;ref name=MSC_docs&gt;{{cite web|last=Marine Stewardship Council|title=Assessment Documents|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/pacific/pna_western_central_pacific_skipjack_tuna/assessment-downloads|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that products made from skipjack tuna caught from free schools (without setting near [[Fish Aggregation Device]]s or other floating objects) by PNA-licensed and product-chain-certified [[Seine fishing|purse-seiners]] will be eligible for the MSC label. The PNA free-school skipjack purse-seine fishery is one of the largest fisheries certified by the MSC.

Like all such certificates, this approval is issued according to the fulfilment of certain conditions and requirements over the course of its duration.&lt;ref name=MSC_report&gt;{{cite web|last=Marine Stewardship Council|title=Final Report and Determination|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/pacific/pna_western_central_pacific_skipjack_tuna/assessment-downloads-1/12.06.2011_PNA_Skipjack_Tuna_Fishery_v4_Final_Report.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PNA Chairpersons==
Because the PNA is a member-driven institution, the PNA Chair plays a fundamental role, both as spokesperson and as arbiter of consensus within the group. Unlike some other regional organisations, where Chairs are actively occupied only during annual governing council meetings, chairing the PNA requires a significant investment of time throughout the year. The catches taken by the fisheries that are controlled by the standards, rules and decisions agreed between the Parties to the Nauru Agreement are worth several billion US dollars per annum, and decisions may need to be made at any time to sustain these fisheries as new challenges arise. The PNA Chair is selected by Parties annually.

'''''North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet''''', 286 U.S. 417 (1932)&lt;ref name="Burnet"&gt;{{ussc|name=North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet|link=|volume=286|page=417|pin=|year=1932}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, was a landmark decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] that established the [[claim of right doctrine]].

==Background==
===Facts===
This case involved the North American Oil Consolidated (hereinafter North American Oil) company which operated several properties in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the properties was a section of [[oil]] land, and the [[United States]] held the legal title to the property.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt; The income earned from the property in 1916 was recorded in North American Oil's books as income.

In 1915, the United States government filed a suit to remove North American Oil from the property, and on February 2, 1916, the court appointed a receiver to operate the property and hold the income derived from the property while [[litigation]] ensued.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 420-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, North American Oil was paid the 1916 profits which were acquired during the [[receivership]] by order of the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 421.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government appealed, but it was not until 1920 that the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;  Finally, in 1922, a further appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] was dismissed by stipulation.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;

In 1918, North American Oil filed an amended tax return including the profits from the receivership in its 1916 taxable income. The IRS filed a deficiency, claiming that the income North American Oil gained from receivership should have been taxed in 1917 when they achieved control of it. The Board of Tax Appeals found that the money was taxable to the receiver in 1916. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the profits were taxable to the company as income in 1917. North American Oil appealed on the basis that the income was taxable either in 1916 when it was earned, or 1922 when the final decision regarding the land was made, and was granted a writ of certiorari.

===Issue===

Whether the profits paid to North American Oil in 1917 were taxable income for that particular year.

===Analysis===
The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) argued that the 1916 profits should be included in the 1917 taxable year.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;  North American Oil had not entered the profit as income in 1916 but did include it in an amended return for 1916 in 1918.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;

North American Oil appealed the IRS’ decision, and the Board of Tax Appeals held that the profits were taxable to the receiver as income in 1916 and made no finding whether the company’s accounts were kept on the cash receipts and disbursements basis or on the [[Accrual method|accrual basis]].&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;  The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the profits were taxable to North American Oil as income in 1917 regardless of whether the company’s returns were made on the cash or on the accrual basis.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 421-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name="Id. at 424"&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court analyzed the facts and arrived at three main conclusions:

# The 1916 profits received by the receiver in 1916 were not income to the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 422-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The 1916 profits were not taxable to North American Oil as income in 1916 because it did not know, at that point, whether it would ever actually receive the money.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 423.&lt;/ref&gt;  North American Oil had no accession to wealth, or control of the income at that point.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court would later articulate its position on what constitutes income. See {{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.|link=|volume=348|page=426|pin=431|year=1955}} (noting that income is determined by: (1) undeniable accession to wealth; (2) clearly realized; (3) over which the taxpayer has complete dominion).&lt;/ref&gt;  Through 1916, it was uncertain who was entitled to the profits.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet'', 286 U.S. at 423.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The 1916 profits were not income in the year 1922—when the final judgment was entered and the litigation was finally terminated.&lt;ref name="Id. at 424"/&gt;  North American Oil had a right to the 1916 profits in 1917, by order of the District Court.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt; The Court held, “If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.”&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt; It was in 1917 that the profits became entitled to them, and they achieved access to and control of the gains. If the 1922 decision had ruled in favor of the government, North American Oil would have been entitled to a deduction in the amount of those lost profits.

==Holding==
The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name="Burnet"/&gt;  The 1916 profits were taxable income to North American Oil in 1917 when the District Court determined that the company had a claim of right to the profits, even though litigation was ongoing at that time.

==Impact==
This case is significant for all taxpaying individuals, even in today’s world, because the court articulated a [[Claim of right doctrine|“claim of right” doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Federal Income Taxation of Individuals:  Cases, Problems and Materials |last=Donaldson |first=Samuel A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=Thomson/West |location=St. Paul, MN |isbn=0-314-14429-3 |pages=144–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This doctrine generally states that when a taxpayer receives income for which they have a “claim of right” it is then included as income in that year, when that “claim of right” is established.&lt;ref name="Segal2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segal |first=Mark A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |month= |title=Factors and Considerations in the Claim of Right Doctrine |journal=The CPA Journal |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/1004/essentials/p42.htm |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, if it turns out that the taxpayer must return the income, then the taxpayer will generally be entitled to take a deduction for the returned amount.&lt;ref name="Segal2004" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16240">A '''patent examiner''' (or, historically, a '''patent clerk'''&lt;ref&gt;The title "''patent clerk''" is used for instance in Gary Stix, [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0007DCB9-91CE-111A-BAF583414B7F4945 ''The Patent Clerk's Legacy''], [[Scientific American]], September 2004 (an article about [[Albert Einstein]]).&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[employee]], usually a [[civil service|civil servant]] with a scientific or engineering background, working at a [[patent office]]. Major employers of patent examiners are the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] (EPO), the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO), the [[Japan Patent Office]] (JPO), and other patent offices around the world.

==Duties==
Patent examiners review [[patent application]]s to determine whether the [[invention]](s) [[claim (patent)|claimed]] in each of them should be granted a [[patent]] or whether the application should instead be refused. One of the most important tasks of a patent examiner is to review the disclosure in the application and to compare it to the [[prior art]]. This involves reading and understanding a patent application, searching the prior art (including prior patent applications and patents, [[scientific literature]] [[database]]s, etc.) to determine what contribution the invention makes over the prior art, and issuing [[office action]]s to explain to the applicants and their representatives (i.e., [[patent attorney]]s or [[patent agent|agents]]) any objections that may exist against the grant of a patent. In other words, an examiner reviews a patent application substantively to determine whether it complies with the legal requirements for granting of a patent.  A claimed invention must meet patentability requirements of [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step or non-obviousness]], [[industrial application]] (or utility) and [[sufficiency of disclosure]].

Examiners are expected to be efficient in their work and to determine patentability within a limited amount of time.  Some patent applications are easy for an examiner to assess, but others require considerably more time.  This has given rise to controversy:  On April 13, 2007, a "Coalition of Patent Examiner Representatives" expressed concern that {{quote|in many [[patent office]]s, the pressures on examiners to produce and methods of allocating work have reduced the capacity of examiners to provide the quality of examination the peoples of the world deserve [and that] the combined pressures of higher productivity demands, increasingly complex patent applications and an ever-expanding body of relevant patent and non-patent literature have reached such a level that, unless serious measures are taken, meaningful protection of [[intellectual property]] throughout the world may, itself, become history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |url=http://www.popa.org/pdf/misc/epocipo2007.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075750/http://www.popa.org/pdf/misc/epocipo2007.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-27 |recipient=Mr. [[Jon Dudas]], Director, [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]], Prof. [[Alain Pompidou]], President, [[European Patent Office]], Dr. [[Jürgen Schade]], President, [[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt]], Mr. [[David Tobin]], Commissioner of Patents, Registrar of Trademarks and Chief Executive Officer, [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]], Dr. [[Friedrich Rödler]], President, [[Österreichisches Patentamt]] |subject=Re: The Future of the Patent System |date=April 13, 2007 |via=www.popa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Offices ==

=== European Patent Office ===
Patent examiners at the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) carry out examination and opposition procedures for patent applications originating anywhere in the world and seeking protection in any of the member states of the [[European Patent Organisation]]. The process involves a search for existing documentation in the technical area of the application (prior art) and communication with the applicant in order to bring the application in line with the legal requirements of the [[European Patent Convention]]. For every patent application, a division formed by three examiners must decide whether the application is granted or not, and in which scope.

EPO examiners are organized in a branched structured by their technical field of expertise and examine patent applications in three official languages, [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]]. They are recruited among nationals of the member states and work in one of the EPO offices in Munich, The Hague and Berlin.

Candidates for examiner positions must meet certain minimum requirements:
* EPO member state nationality;
* degree in engineering or in science;
* good knowledge of two languages out of German, English and French with a willingness to learn the third.&lt;ref name="patex"&gt;"''[http://www.epo.org/about-us/jobs/examiner/profile.html Required profile for an EPO patent examiner]''". European Patent Office (EPO), retrieved on June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examiners have work experience in industry, but such experience is not required.&lt;ref name="patex"/&gt; EPO examiners are also reportedly required to speak three languages fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egagenerics.com/doc/ega_position_patentquality_2008-10-01.pdf |title=Better Patents, Better Medicines: Recommendations on How to Improve The European Patent System |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710172946/http://www.egagenerics.com/doc/ega_position_patentquality_2008-10-01.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-10 |author=European Generic Medicines Association |date=October 2008 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Pressman |title=Patent it yourself |publisher=Nolo |edition=13th |year=2008 |p=313 |isbn=1-4133-0854-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most EPO examiners are represented by SUEPO, a [[trade union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tageblatt.lu/nachrichten/story/Wir-haben-ein-Auge-darauf-13892881|title="Wir haben ein Auge darauf"|trans-title="We keep an eye thereon"|date=28 December 2016|work=Tageblatt Lëtzebuerg|language=German|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States Patent and Trademark Office ===
Patent examiners at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) examine patent applications for claims of new inventions. Examiners make determinations of patentability based on policies and guidance from this agency, in compliance with federal laws ([[Title 35 of the United States Code]]), rules, judicial precedents, and guidance from agency administrators.  These determinations are appealable through the U.S. Courts.  An appeal of these determinations is three steps away from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. Responsibilities for a patent examiner at the USPTO include:
* reviewing patent applications to determine if they comply with basic format, rules and legal requirements;
* determining the scope of the invention claimed by the inventor;
* searching for relevant technologies to compare similar prior inventions with the invention claimed in the patent application; and
* communicating findings as to the patentability of an applicant's invention via a written action to inventors/patent practitioners.

[[Image:Production report.jpg|right|thumb|Biweekly Production Report]]
Examiners are hired at the GS-5, GS-7, GS-9 or GS-11 grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;GS-5, GS-7, or GS-9 grade levels are part of the [[General Schedule]] employee classification scheme within the US government.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the examiner [http://apps.opm.gov/SSR/tables/StaticFiles/SrText/0576_20070101.txt salary table as of January 1, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Patent examiners in the U.S. have responsibilities that are commensurate with their GS level. Promotions from GS-7 to GS-14 are non-competitive. At GS-13 they are eligible to start the "Partial Signatory Authority" program, a testing phase to see if an examiner can apply patent concepts (e.g. [[obviousness]] and [[novelty]]) and laws ([[Title 35 of the United States Code|35 USC]]). Upon passing the "Partial Signatory Program", a patent examiner is given signatory authority to sign all of their own non-final rejections and other non-final communications to applicants.  After a waiting period a patent examiner may take part in an additional testing phase known as the "Full Signatory Authority" (FSA) program. When a patent examiner has passed the FSA program, they are given "Full Signatory Authority" and can sign all of their own "office actions" (e.g. allowances, rejections) without review and approval by a supervisor.  Such examiners are also able to review and sign actions of "junior examiners" (patent examiners without signatory authority). Upon completion of the "Full Signatory Authority program", an examiner is advanced from GS-13 to GS-14 and is referred to as a "primary examiner".&lt;ref name="Tu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tu |first1=Shine |title=Patent Examiners and Litigation Outcomes |journal=STAN. TECH. L. REV. |date=2014 |volume=17 |pages=507–517 |url=https://journals.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/stanford-technology-law-review/online/patentexaminers.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812073422/https://journals.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/stanford-technology-law-review/online/patentexaminers.pdf |archive-date=August 12, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Supervisors at the USPTO are GS-15 employees who are necessarily primary examiners now called Supervisory Patent Examiners (formerly Supervisory Primary Examiners) (SPE, colloquially called "spee"). They apply for positions competitively and receive management training inside the office. They are responsible for an '''Art Unit''' of patent examiners, typically 8-15 examiners who examine cases in the same area of technology (e.g. GPS devices and aircraft are handled by different art units). Responsibilities include training new examiners, reviewing and signing office actions of junior examiners and acting as an advocate of the examiners they are responsible for to a variety of parties (e.g. other managers in the office, patent applicants and their attorneys). They are the lowest rung of the USPTO's management chain of command, and the only part of management that is paid as part of the general schedule (GS). Higher paid managers are part of the [[Senior Executive Service]] and are technically political appointees. For example, a primary examiner (GS-14) and her SPE (GS-15) are part of the general schedule and cannot be fired as part of an administration change, but the SPE's boss (a "technology center" director paid at SES-1), can be asked to resign by the president, [[Powers of the President of the United States#Powers of Appointment|at his pleasure]].

According to the USPTO, an examiner is measured entirely by his own performance, without regard to the performance of others.&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.uspto.gov/go/ac/ahrpa/ohr/jobs/exam.htm What makes the USPTO a great place to work?]''", USPTO Patent Examiner Recruitment, United States Patent and Trademark Office, retrieved on June 12, 2006. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important performance statistics are referred to as "production" (the number of applications processed in the allotted time) and "docket management" (compliance with goals for responding to applicant communications within the allotted time). [[Legal]], [[Vocational education|technical]] and [[automation]] training is provided to examiners at the USPTO.

To work as an examiner at the USPTO, a person must be a [[U.S. citizen]] and pass a background investigation.&lt;ref name="dillon"&gt;Tamara Dillon, [http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2009/fall/art03.pdf "Patent work: The other side of invention"], Occupational Outlook Quarterly, Fall 2009, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Examiners also must have a college degree in engineering or science.&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt; The Technology Centers at the USPTO are divided into chemistry (or chemical engineering), electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, so college degrees in these areas are typically preferred.  In recent years, however, new technologies have been important areas of innovation, so the USPTO employs people with training in biotechnology, business methods, geology, mathematics, and many other disciplines.

Experienced examiners have an option of working primarily from home through a hoteling program implemented in 2006 by the USPTO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/go/com/advisory/reports/ppac_2007annualrpt.pdf#page=10 USPTO Patent Public Advisory Committee 2007 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Binding-price-ceiling.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Pricing, quantity, and welfare effects of a binding price ceiling]]

A '''price ceiling''' is a government-imposed [[price control]], or limit, on how high a price is charged for a product. Governments use price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation, in the event of an investment bubble, or in the event of  [[monopoly]] ownership of a product,  all of which can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing, leading to [[shortage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953710348|title=Principles of macroeconomics|last=Gregory,|first=Mankiw, N.|isbn=1305971507|edition=Eighth|location=Australia|oclc=953710348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further problems can occur if a government sets unrealistic price ceilings, causing business failures, stock crashes, or even economic crises. In unregulated [[market economy|market economies]], price ceilings do not exist.

== Real-world examples ==
=== Rent control in New York City ===
[[File:"Help Me Keep Prices Down" - NARA - 513811.jpg|thumb|right|"Pay no more than Ceiling Price," US poster during World War II]]
[[File:"New ceiling price lists are here" - NARA - 515063.jpg|thumb|upright|"New ceiling price lists are here," US [[Office of Price Administration]] during World War II]]
[[Rent control]] is a price ceiling on rent. When soldiers returned from World War II and started families, which increased demand for apartments, but stopped receiving military pay, many of them could not deal with higher rents. The government put in price controls so that soldiers and their families could pay their rents and keep their homes. However, it increased the quantity demand for apartments and lowered the quantity supplied, and so the number of available apartments rapidly decreased until none were available for latecomers. Price ceilings create shortages when producers may to abdicate market share or go unsubsidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871178833|title=Macroeconomics : a contemporary introduction|last=A.|first=McEachern, William|isbn=1133188133|edition=10e [edition]|location=Mason, Ohio|oclc=871178833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apartment price control in Finland ===
According to professors Niko Määttänen and Ari Hyytinen, price ceilings on [[Helsinki]] City [[Hitas]] apartments are highly inefficient economically. They cause queuing and discriminate against the handicapped, single parents, elderly, and others who are not able to queue for days. They cause inefficient allocation, as apartments are not bought by those willing to pay the most for them. Also, those who get an apartment are unwilling to leave it, even when their family or work situation changes, as they may not sell it at what they feel the market price should be. The inefficiencies increase apartment shortage and raise the market price of other apartments.&lt;ref name=atb&gt;[http://blog.hse-econ.fi/?p=2246 Onko Hitas-järjestelmässä mitään järkeä?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508195053/http://blog.hse-econ.fi/?p=2246 |date=2013-05-08 }}, professor Niku Määttänen 16.4.2010 &amp; professor Ari Hyytinen 17.4.2010, Akateeminen talousblogi (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Coulter law" in Australian rules football ===
Uniform [[wage ceiling]]s were introduced in [[Australian rules football]] to address uneven competition. In the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) a declining competitive balance followed a 1925 expansion that had admitted [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]], [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otemon.ac.jp/cas/pdf/30/anne.pdf Daly Anne and Akira Kawaguchi; ''Competitive Balance in Australian and Japanese Sport''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143012/http://www.otemon.ac.jp/cas/pdf/30/anne.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/eco/research/papers/2005/0205competitivebalancesports.pdf Booth, Ross; Comparing Competitive Balance in Australian Sports Leagues, The AFL, NBL and NRL: Does The AFL's Team Salary Cap and Player Draft Measure Up?; p. 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005161335/http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/eco/research/papers/2005/0205competitivebalancesports.pdf |date=2009-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects on financially-weaker clubs were exacerbated in 1929 by the beginning of the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]]. In 1930, a new ceiling system, formulated by VFL administrator George Coulter, stipulated that individual players were to be paid no more than [[Australian pound|A£]]3 (approximately [[Australian dollar|A$]]243 in 2017) for a regular home-and-away match, that they must also be paid if they were injured, that they could be paid no more than A£12 (approximately A$975 in 2017) for a finals match, and that the wages could not be augmented with other bonuses or lump-sum payments. The "Coulter law", as it became known, remained a strictly-binding price ceiling through its history.

During its early years, the Coulter law adversely affected only a minority of players, such as stars and players at wealthier clubs. Those individuals experienced, in effect, a drastic cut in wages. For instance, from 1931 the ceiling payment of £3 per game fell below the legal minimum [[award wage]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fwc.gov.au/waltzing-matilda-and-the-sunshine-harvester-factory/historical-material/the-australian-minimum-wage&lt;/ref&gt; While players at the more successful clubs of the day, such as [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], had previously paid significantly higher average wages, clubs that were struggling financially often could not meet the ceiling under the Coulter law. Clubs with a longstanding [[amateur sports|amateur]] ethos became significantly more competitive under the Coulter law, such as [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]], which had long attracted and retained players by indirect or non-financial incentives (such as finding players employment not related to football). The Coulter law led to at least one VFL star of the 1930s, [[Ron Todd (footballer)|Ron Todd]], moving to the rival [[Victorian Football Association|VFA]], because he was dissatisfied with the maximum pay that he could receive at [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]],&lt;ref&gt;Main, Jim and Holmesby, Russell (editors); ''The Encyclopedia of League Footballers'' (1st edition); p. 438. {{ISBN|1-86337-085-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of World War II, the wage for a regular game was halved (to £1 and 10 shillings) for the 1942–45 seasons. After the war, the ceilings were modified several times in line with [[inflation]]. During the 1950s, the "Coulter law"  was also blamed for shortening the careers of star players such as [[John Coleman (Australian footballer)|John Coleman]] and [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]], as they and their clubs could not pay for the private [[surgery]] that the players required to continue their careers.
  
The Coulter law was abolished in 1968. However, in 1987 a club-level [[AFL salary cap|salary cap]] was introduced by the VFL and has been retained by its successor, the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL).

On January 10, 2006, a BBC article reported that since 2003, [[Venezuela]] President [[Hugo Chávez]] had been setting price ceilings on food and that the price ceilings had caused [[shortages]] and [[Hoarding#Human Behavior|hoarding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4599260.stm Venezuelan shoppers face food shortages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521164332/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4599260.stm |date=2014-05-21 }}, BBC, January 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A January 22, 2008, article from [[Associated Press]] stated, "Venezuelan troops are cracking down on the smuggling of food... the National Guard has seized about 750 tons of food.... Hugo Chavez ordered the military to keep people from smuggling scarce items like milk.... He's also threatened to seize farms and milk plants...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whotv.com/Global/story.asp?S=7759008&amp;nav=2HAB Venezuelan troops crack down on border smuggling]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Theinstantmatrix |fix-attempted=yes }}, Associated Press, January 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2009, Chávez ordered the military to seize control of all the rice processing plants in the country temporarily and to force them to produce at full capacity.

On January 3, 2007, an ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' article reported that Chávez's price ceilings were causing shortages of materials used in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/03/business/chavez.php Venezuelan businesses say Chávez's price controls create shortages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228223855/http://iht.com/articles/2007/01/03/business/chavez.php |date=2009-02-28 }} International Heralrd Tribune, January 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to an April 4, 2008, article from [[CBS News]], Chávez ordered the nationalization of the cement industry, which had been exporting its products to receive higher prices outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090228223855/http://iht.com/articles/2007/01/03/business/chavez.php Hugo Chavez Nationalizes Cement Industry], CBS News, April 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Price ceilings that lead to higher prices==

There is a substantial body of research showing that under some circumstances price ceilings can, paradoxically, lead to higher prices. The leading explanation is that price ceilings serve to coordinate collusion among suppliers who would otherwise compete on price.

More precisely, forming a [[cartel]] becomes profitable by enabling nominally-competing firms to act like a [[monopoly]], limiting quantities and raising prices. However, forming a cartel is difficult because it is necessary to agree on quantities and prices, and because each firm will have an incentive to "cheat" by lowering prices to sell more than it agreed to. Antitrust laws make collusion even more difficult because of legal sanctions.

Having a third party, such as a regulator announce and enforce a maximum price level, can make it easier for the firms to agree on a price and to monitor pricing. The regulatory price can be viewed as a [[focal point (game theory)|focal point]], which is natural for both parties to charge.

One research paper documenting the phenomenon is Knittel and Stangel,&lt;ref&gt;RK Knittel and V Stango ‘Price Ceilings as Focal points for Tacit Collusion: Evidence from Credit Cards’ (2003) 93 American Economic Review 1703–29.&lt;/ref&gt; which found that in the 1980s United States, states that fixed an [[interest rate ceiling]] of 18 percent had firms charing a rate only slightly below the ceiling. However states without an interest rate ceiling had interest rates that were significantly lower. (The authors did not find any difference in costs that could explain the result.)

Another example is a paper by Sen et al.&lt;ref&gt;A Sen, A Clemente, and L Jonker ‘Retail Gasoline Price Ceilings and Regulatory Capture: Evidence from Canada’ (2011) 13(2) American Law and Economics Review 532–64.&lt;/ref&gt; that found that gasoline prices were higher in states that instituted price ceilings. Another example is the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]'s decision regarding fixing a ceiling price for sugar at 45 [[Pakistani rupees]] per kilogram. Sugar disappeared from the market because of a cartel of sugar producers and the failure of the Pakistani government to maintain supply even in the stores that it owned. The imported sugar required time to reach the country, and it could be sold at the rate fixed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Eventually, the government went for a review petition in the Supreme Court and obtained the withdrawal of the earlier decision of the apex court. Eventually, the market equilibrium was achieved at 55 to 60 rupees per kilogram.

'''''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''''', 553 U.S. 617 (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.|volume=553|page=617|year=2008}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in which the Court reaffirmed the validity of the patent [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]], and in doing so made uncertain the continuing precedential value of a line of decisions in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] that had sought to limit Supreme Court exhaustion doctrine decisions to their facts and to require a so-called “[[rule of reason]]” analysis of all post-sale restrictions other than tie-ins and price fixes.&lt;ref&gt;See section below captioned '''''Mallinckrodt''''' '''background'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of restating the patent exhaustion doctrine, the Court held that the exhaustion doctrine is triggered by, among other things, an authorized sale of a component when the only reasonable and intended use of the component is to practice the patent and the component substantially embodies the patented invention by embodying its essential features. The Court also overturned, in passing, the part of decision below that held that the exhaustion doctrine was limited to product claims and did not apply to method claims.

==Factual background==
[[LG Electronics]] (LGE) owned several patents on methods and systems for processing information. It entered into two contracts with Intel. In the License Agreement, LGE authorized Intel to make and sell microprocessor products using the patented inventions. Moreover, the License Agreement expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products (for example, for combining Intel microprocessor products with other parts of a computer). The License Agreement also provided, however, “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.”

In the Master Agreement, LGE required Intel to give its customers notice that the patent license does not extend to any product made by combining a licensed Intel microprocessor product with any other product (for example, a computer containing the Intel microprocessor products). The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would have no effect on the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel's customers to combine the microprocessor products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This point is not discussed in the Court's opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect [[trade secret]]s.

[[Quanta Computer]] purchased licensed Intel microprocessor products and proceeded to manufacture computers containing them. In doing so, Quanta followed Intel's specifications, which in turn led to practice of the patented methods and making the patented systems that LGE licensed to Intel––since that was the way Intel had designed its microprocessor products. (The trial court found that the Intel microprocessor products were without any reasonable noninfringing use.) LGE then sued Quanta for [[patent infringement]].

Quanta prevailed in the district court under the exhaustion doctrine, but on appeal the Federal Circuit held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply because of the statement in the Master Agreement that combination products were not licensed, given the Federal Circuit's 1992 ruling in ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name="976 F.2d 700 Fed. Cir. 1992"&gt;976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; that a seller of patented goods could by notice impose a [[post-sale restraint]] on its customer's use of the goods. Additionally, the Federal Circuit held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply, in any event, to method patents.

==''Mallinckrodt'' background==
In ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]] '',&lt;ref&gt;976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Circuit had held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of antitrust law violations, such as [[Price fixing|price-fixing]] and [[tie-in]] restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Stern]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/EIPR'Quanta.pdf ''Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc—Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States''], [2008] {{smallcaps|Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev.}} 527.&lt;/ref&gt; or violations of "some other law or policy." &lt;ref&gt;"Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 708.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the ''Mallinckrodt'' court had said, “Unless the condition violates some other law or policy (in the patent field, notably the misuse or antitrust law),” patent owners, licensees and downstream purchasers "retain the freedom to contract concerning conditions of sale."&lt;ref&gt;"Mallinckrodt'', 976 F.2d at 708.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Federal Circuit went on to say that "[t]he appropriate criterion” in determining whether "a restriction or condition .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. placed upon the sale of a patented article" is valid "is whether [the patentee's or licensor's] restriction is reasonably within the patent grant, or whether the patentee has ventured beyond the patent grant and into behavior having an anticompetitive effect not justifiable under the rule of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;''Mallinckrodt'', 976 F.2d at 708–09.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the court, the tests for restrictions and misuse were alike, outside the tie-in and price fixing area: “To sustain a misuse defense involving a licensing arrangement not held to have been per se anticompetitive by the Supreme Court, a factual determination must reveal that the overall effect of the license tends to restrain competition unlawfully in an appropriately defined relevant market.”&lt;ref&gt;''Mallinckrodt'', 976 F.2d at 706 (quoting ''Windsurfing Int’l, Inc. v. AMF, Inc.'', 782 F.2d 995, 1001–02 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).&lt;/ref&gt;

But this Federal Circuit test is contrary to many decisions of both the Supreme Court and other courts of appeals. For example, in ''[[Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;395 U.S. 100 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court addressed the legality of licenses under which royalties were paid on total sales of all products, irrespective of whether the licensor's patents covered all products. The Court held that such licensing was permissible when the licensor and licensee adopted it for mutual convenience to simplify administration of the license,&lt;ref&gt;''Zenith'', 395 U.S. at 136 (“If convenience of the parties rather than patent power dictates the total-sales royalty provision, there are no misuse of the patents and no forbidden conditions attached to the license.”).&lt;/ref&gt; but it was impermissible for the licensor to insist upon it over the licensee's opposition.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 139 (“But we do not read ''Automatic Radio'' to authorize the patentee to use the power of his patent to insist on a total-sales royalty and to override protestations of the licensee that some of his products are unsuited to the patent or that for some lines of his merchandise he has no need or desire to purchase the privileges of the patent. In such event, not only would royalties be collected on unpatented merchandise, but the obligation to pay for nonuse would clearly have its source in the leverage of the patent. We also think patent misuse inheres in a patentee's insistence on a percentage-of-sales royalty, regardless of use, and his rejection of licensee proposals to pay only for actual use.”).&lt;/ref&gt; Such conduct was misuse, the Court held, but not an antitrust violation unless the other elements of an antitrust violation were also shown, such as market power.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 140 (“if there was such patent misuse, it does not necessarily follow that the misuse embodies the ingredients of a violation of either § 1 or § 2 of the Sherman Act, or that Zenith was threatened by a violation so as to entitle it to an injunction under § 16 of the Clayton Act.”).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Earlier, in ''Brulotte v. Thys Co. '',&lt;ref&gt;379 U.S. 29 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that it was patent misuse if, without more, a patentee charged royalties that extended beyond the statutory term of the patent. In ''[[National Lockwasher Co. v. George K. Garrett Co.]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] held that a patentee misused its patent by requiring licensees to agree not to deal in the technology of the patentee's competitors.&lt;ref&gt;137 F.2d 255, 256-57 (3d Cir. 1943) (patentee misused patent because patentee was “attempting by means other than that of free competition to extend the bounds of its lawful monopoly to make, use and vend the patented device to the extent where such device would be the only one available to a user of such an article. This monopoly is obviously not covered by the patent.”); accord ''McCullough v. Kammerer Corp.'', 166 F.2d 759 (9th Cir. 1948).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in these cases, among many others, the Supreme Court and other federal courts had found misuse in cases not involving price fixing or tie-ins, and had not required any rule-of-reason or relevant-market analysis.

Other Federal Circuit decisions&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''U.S. Philips Corp. v. International Trade Comm'n'', 424 F.3d 1179, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (“If the particular licensing arrangement in question is not one of those specific practices that has been held to constitute per se misuse, it will be analyzed under the rule of reason. We have held that under the rule of reason, a practice is impermissible only if its effect is to restrain competition in a relevant market.") (citations omitted); ''Monsanto Co. v. McFarling'', 363 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; followed the ''Mallinckrodt'' approach, which was, at the very least, divergent from Supreme Court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;One commentator at the time of the ''Mallinckrodt'' decision referred to it as inaugurating the demise of the exhaustion doctrine in the United States, Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/DemiseExh.htm ''The Unobserved Demise of the Exhaustion Doctrine in US Patent Law: Mallinckrodt v. Medipart''], 15 {{smallcaps|Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev.}} 460 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, when ''certiorari'' was granted in ''Quanta'', it was widely surmised that the Supreme Court would overturn ''Mallinckrodt'', which many (including the [[United States Solicitor General]] [[Jeffrey Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States Solicitor General]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief on the merits stating, "The test adopted by the Federal Circuit in ''Mallinckrodt'' thus reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role and scope of the patent-exhaustion doctrine. ... The court of appeals’ approach cannot be reconciled with those [Supreme Court] precedents." Brief for United States as ''amicus curiae'' in ''Quanta'', at 23; see also ''id''. at 6 ("In recent years, the [[first-sale doctrine]] has evolved in the Federal Circuit in a manner that is at odds with this Court’s precedents."); ''id''. at 22 ("The Federal Circuit misreads ''Univis'' as standing only for the proposition that restrictions that have been found to be unlawful restraints on trade in the patent context, such as “price-fixing or tying” arrangements, cannot be enforced in a patent-infringement suit."); ''id''. at 30 ("The judgment below rests on the same erroneous understanding of patent exhaustion that infuses the Federal Circuit’s approach to this area of the law.").&lt;/ref&gt; viewed as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, [http://holmansbiotechipblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/quanta-and-its-impact-on-biotechnology.html ''Holman's Biotech IP Blog''] said: "Many people viewed Quanta as an important opportunity for the Supreme Court to address the viability of ''Mallinckrodt'' (976 F.2d 700), a 1992 Federal Circuit decision which held that the doctrine of patent exhaustion applies only to unconditional sales, and that a patent owner is thus permitted to impose post-sale restrictions on purchasers of a patented product by providing purchasers with notice to that effect, and enforce those restrictions under the patent laws. Many, including the Solicitor General, argue that Mallinckrodt should be overruled, and that the decision conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, particularly the 1942 Univis decision, which they interpret as mandating a doctrine of patent exhaustion that bars the enforcement of such restrictions by means of a patent enforcement action." &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; An [http://www.omm.com/newsroom/publication.aspx?pub=557  O'Melveny &amp; Myers] commentary advised the law firm's clients: "As set out by the Solicitor General, the Federal Circuit has once again adopted a formalistic rule that does not advance the interest of patent law as articulated by Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, there seems little doubt that the Solicitor General's views will prevail on the merits, and that the Supreme Court will again reverse the Federal Circuit."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court opinion==
The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, in an opinion by Justice Thomas.

===Method claims===
First, the Court said, the distinction between method and product [[claim (patent)|claim]]s is insupportable. In ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;316 U. S. 241 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;  the most recent decision of the Court on exhaustion, some of the patents held exhausted were method patents. Earlier, in ''[[Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;309 U. S. 436 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; some patents covered a method of combusting gasoline in an automobile engine––and the exhaustion doctrine was held applicable. Furthermore, because it is easy to write patent claims for the same invention either in method format or apparatus format, the exhaustion doctrine could easily be evaded if reliance on method claims was sufficient to avoid exhaustion:  By “including a method claim for the machine’s patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.”&lt;ref&gt;128 S. Ct. at 2118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhaustion and related patents===
The Court then turned to the extent, if any, to which exhaustion of the patent rights on the microprocessor products exhausted patent rights relating to the combination products on which LGE had patents. In the ''Univis'' case the sale that exhausted patent rights was a sale of an unpatented semifinished lens blank, which subsequent processing turned into a patented finished lens.  The Intel microprocessor products were finished commercial articles of commerce, but in this case the trial court had found as a fact that the microprocessor products had no noninfringing use, just as in the ''Univis'' case the semifinished lens blanks had no use but to be finished into the patented finished lens blanks.  Therefore, the Court found ''Univis'' dispositive. In the ''Quanta'' Court's language, in ''Univis'' “exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they ‘embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention.’”

LGE did not challenge the claim that the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.

A further reason why sales of the microprocessor products exhausted LGE's patent rights was that “everything inventive about each patent is embodied in” the licensed Intel products, which “embody the essential features of the [licensed] patents because they carry out all the inventive processes when combined, according to their design, with standard components.” Any point of novelty—that is, respect in which the claimed invention departs from the prior art—is found in the licensed microprocessor products rather than in the combination product of which they are components.

This last aspect of the ''Quanta'' opinion is very similar to the [[doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case]], a doctrine that the Federal Circuit had previously held to be no longer authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;See Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Supreme Court's ''Lincoln Engineering'' doctrine, the combination of a newly invented device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated is unpatentable as an “exhausted combination” or “old combination.” Thus, when the ''Quanta'' Court said that “everything inventive about each patent is embodied in” the licensed Intel products, which “embody the essential features of the [licensed] patents," the Court was, in effect, saying that the combination of a novel Intel microprocessor in a conventional manner with an old personal computer is an exhausted combination. Accordingly, no weight would be put on the fact that separate patents had issued to LGE on the inventive device and on the old combination that included it.

===Licensing a limited field===
LGE's argument for non-exhaustion sought to invoke the doctrine of ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;304 U.S. 175, 182 (1938) (upholding legitimacy of [[field-of-use]] limitations on scope of patent licenses to make and sell amplifiers only in “non-commercial” field), aff'd on reh’g, 305 U.S. 124 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the patentee had granted no license for “commercial” amplifiers.  Therefore, when a manufacturer licensed only in the “non-commercial” [[field of use]] sold an amplifier to an accused infringer, who knowingly resold it in the commercial market, the manufacturer “could not convey to [the accused infringer] what both knew it was not authorized to sell.” By parity of reasoning, LGE said, it had licensed Intel only in the field of manufacturing microprocessor products for combination with specified products and not with other products.  But the Court said that was not how LGE had drafted its license to Intel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
LGE overlooks important aspects of the structure of the…transaction. Nothing in the License Agreement restricts Intel’s right to sell its microprocessors…to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-Intel parts. It broadly permits Intel to make, use, or sell products free of the patent claims. To be sure, LGE did require Intel to give notice to its customers, including Quanta, that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents. But neither party contends that Intel breached the agreement in that respect.

LGE points out that the License Agreement specifically disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents by combining licensed products with other components. But the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns only on Intel’s own license to sell products practicing the…patents.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court appears to be saying that LGE simply licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did ''not'' say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel's manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.”  LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.”

That this was a critical error (for LGE) is confirmed by the Court's final statements in its opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the patents. No conditions limited Intel’s authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. …Intel’s authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, the exhaustion doctrine governed what Quanta could lawfully do with what it bought from Intel.  The failure to give third parties a license to combine Intel microprocessor product with other products had no legal significance, because the exhaustion doctrine obviated any need for such a license. Having bought the products from an authorized seller, Quanta didn't need any license.

===No contract issue===
Just before closing, the Court added a final note pointing out that the case did not raise, and the Court did not rule on, whether LGE could have enforced a contractual restriction. In footnote 7, the Court commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We note that the authorized nature of the sale to Quanta does not necessarily limit LGE’s other contract rights. LGE’s complaint does not include a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on whether contract damages might be available even though exhaustion operates to eliminate patent damages.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the same token, the Court said nothing as to specific performance or whether contract rights, if any, could be enforced against Quanta.

==Impact and issues that the court did not consider==
The impact of ''Quanta'' is problematic, largely because the decision avoided deciding many issues, presumably in the interest of maintaining consensus. (The decision was unanimous.) One academic commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a very disappointing decision from the Court. It decided so little, and it was such an important case. You are left reading tea leaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidecounsel.com/Issues/2008/September%202008/Pages/Patent-Predicament-.aspx?PrintPreview Professor Josh Sarnoff] of American University Law School, quoted in ''Inside Counsel'', Sept. 2008. ''Inside Counsel'' adds, "Businesses and their counsel are left scouring the court's ruling for clues as to what might happen next."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's failure to approve or reject the precedent on which the Federal Circuit had relied in its decision in ''Quanta'', ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]'', which had limited the applicability of the exhaustion doctrine when a sale was made "conditional," further contributed to business uncertainty about permissible license restrictions. But, as one commentator observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Supreme Court, in ''Quanta'', was widely expected to rule on whether ''Mallinckrodt'' was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. ...Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions on downstream purchasers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidecounsel.com/Issues/2008/September%202008/Pages/Patent-Predicament-.aspx?PrintPreview ''Inside Counsel''], Sept. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To be sure, in ''Quanta'', the Court held that “[t]he longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.” But what constitutes "authorization"? The Court did not address the issue of "constructive" authorization—that is, authorization as a matter of law in certain circumstances, whether or not the patentee or licensor likes it or even tries very hard to avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;In contract law, certain binding promises are implied by law irrespective of the unwilling promisor's desire not be so bound. Thus, a husband "constructively" promises to pay for his wife's necessities or often for medical care that is given him. The common law entertained a legal fiction, ''[[indebitatus assumpsit]]'', that a person owing a debt promised to pay it, so that he could be sued on that imagined promise. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=CIvr-XmBRBwC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22indebitatus+assumpsit%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z7AuDbC8SR&amp;sig=rLdEe_zYyLJyEjZ0i9yoyeM1nuE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UoSoSeD8DMiLngeu5JjeDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result  Lionel D Smith, et al., ''The Law of Restitution in Canada: Cases, Notes, and Materials''], pp. 72-75 (Emond Montgomery Publications 2004) (avail. Google Books). Some of the language in the ''Univis'' decision points in this direction. As discussed below, in at least one case the House of Lords, in effect, imposed a compulsory copyright license on automobile manufacturers as to repair parts, where the effect was the same as constructive authorization under the exhaustion doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is uncertain to what extent ''Quanta'' undoes ''Mallinckrodt''. That seems to be the unstated message in ''Quanta'', but the Federal Circuit may take an impenitent view, in defiance of the Solicitor General's views as ''amicus''.

===Other transactional forms===
There are a number of important issues that the Court did not address in ''Quanta''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Richard H. Stern]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/EIPR'Quanta.pdf ''Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc—Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States''], [2008] EUR. INTELL. PROP. REV. 527, 531-34. (Cited hereafter as ''Quanta--EIPR''.)&lt;/ref&gt; One such omission is the Court's failure to say anything about the other possible formats that this transaction might have used—such as a sale by a manufacturing licensee with a limitation on its grant, or (alternatively) a sale by the patentee or its licensee with explicit restrictions imposed on the buyer's freedom to dispose of the product. The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.&lt;ref&gt;"The huge omission in ''Quanta'' is the Court's failure to say anything about the other possible forms of this transaction...." ''Quanta--EIPR'' at 531.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these possible formats follows the pattern of the ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.|General Talking Pictures]]'' case. The second format follows the pattern of the ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.|Mallinckrodt]]'' case. Under the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine, a patentee may limit the scope of a manufacturer-licensee's license to a defined field—such as microprocessors not incorporated into computers—and then the use of those micropressors as computer components is a patent infringement. This is the format that LGE mistakenly thought it was using.&lt;ref&gt;By the same token, LGE thought that its contract with Intel caused intel to use the ''Mallinckrodt'' format. The Federal Circuit opinion is clear that the court accepted LGE's argument that it had used and caused use of these two formats. See ''Quanta--EIPR'' at 531-32; [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/453/453.F3d.1364.05-1303.05-1304.05-1302.05-1264.05-1262.html LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc.], 453 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The court of appeals said, "The exhaustion doctrine...does not apply to an expressly conditional sale or license, so LGE's rights in asserting infringement of its system claims were not exhausted." (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted.)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''Mallinckrodt'' doctrine, a sale of a patented product subject to a restriction—such as you must not sell this microprocessor for use as a computer component—is a "conditional," rather than "unconditional," sale. If the condition is violated the conduct is patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2007/11/reestablishing.html  Mark L. Patterson, ''Reestablishing the Doctrine of Patent Exhaustion''].&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaustion doctrine does not apply under the rule stated in ''Mallinkrodt''. However, as ''Quanta'' seemingly holds, when a restriction is not ''clearly and explicitly stated'' the exhaustion doctrine applies.

===Resolving the "anomaly"===
In a brief to the Supreme Court (at its request) when the petition for [[Certiorari|writ of certiorari]] was pending, the US Solicitor General observed that a curious "anomaly" existed between the exhaustion doctrine and ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]here is a seeming anomaly in allowing a patentee to achieve indirectly –- through an enforceable condition on the licensee –– a limitation on use or resale that [because of the exhaustion doctrine] the patentee could not itself impose on a direct purchaser, [yet] the distinction is a necessary and explicable result of the Court’s decision in ''General Talking Pictures''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For reasons that so far have not been explained in any publicly available document, the Government deleted this passage from its subsequent brief on the merits.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Brief of Solicitor General in support of certiorari in ''Quanta'' at pp. 13-14 with Brief of Solicitor General on merits in ''Quanta'' at 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Government brief suggested, on the one hand, the exhaustion doctrine prohibits post-sale restraints on a patentee's (or its licensee's) sale of goods, while on the other hand ''General Talking Pictures'' permits a patentee to place post-sale limitations on its manufacturing licensee's sale of goods ''if the license to manufacture uses the right, magic words''.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Quanta'' case, LGE failed to use them in its license to Intel, according to the Supreme Court, although the Federal Circuit (perhaps reasonably, see ''Quanta--EIPR'' at 531; LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2006)) had thought that LGE did.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing in the ''Quanta'' opinion addresses this "seeming anomaly," much less attempts to resolve it or synthesize the competing doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;"The Court, in indicating what LGE had neglected to put into its License Agreement, did not opine on what would have happened if LGE had written its licence differently." ''Quanta--EIPR'' at 532.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Can contract trump the exhaustion doctrine?===
The Court, in a footnote quoted above (the Court's note 7), expressly refrained from stating any of the following: whether contractual language could overcome, or prevent triggering, the exhaustion doctrine; if so, what language would be effective to do so; and whether the surrounding circumstances would be relevant.

To the extent that the exhaustion doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to the extent that the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the ''Quanta'' case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts may be more likely to place limits on whether the parties can by contract make the doctrine inapplicable to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts may be more likely to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law.

The Court explicitly refused to consider this issue in ''Quanta''.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief consideration of such issues, see ''Quanta--EIPR'' at 532-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Quanta'' court did make clear, however, that it recognized the fundamental difference in law between a sale of patented goods by a patentee and a patentee's license of another to manufacture the patented goods, which the Supreme Court had explained in ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;272 U. S. 476 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Court made it clear that LGE had failed to license Intel (the seller to Quanta) in language that invoked the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine, which could have changed the outcome, as discussed above in the section of this article captioned “Licensing a limited field.”

The House of Lords considered whether contract could trump the similar [[non-derogation doctrine|doctrine against derogation from title]] in ''[[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]''. This is the doctrine that a seller may not successfully take actions, such as enforcing an intellectual property right, that decrease the value of what the seller has sold to a purchaser. The House of Lords ruled that contract could not be used to lessen the rights of end user purchasers, at least purchasers of consumer products such as motor cars.

==Subsequent decisions==

===''Static Control''===
In ''Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc.'', 615 F.Supp.2d 575 (E.D. Ky, 2009), the district court reconsidered its former decision in this case and granted a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) in favor of the accused infringer. The court said that the Supreme Court's ''Quanta'' decision “has changed the landscape of the doctrine of patent exhaustion generally, and specifically” required a reversal of the judgment, so that SCCI was not liable to Lexmark for patent infringement.

Lexmark had sought to restrict the refilling of its toner cartridges by relying on the ''Mallinckrodt'' doctrine. However, it did not enter into any conventional bilateral contract selling the toner cartridges to the public on a “conditional sale” basis.&lt;ref&gt;The district court found: “Sales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional. Anyone could walk into a store carrying Lexmark Prebate cartridges and purchase one. Anyone could purchase Lexmark Prebate cartridges directly from Lexmark through its website. No potential buyer was required to agree to abide by the Prebate tenns before purchasing a cartridge. Thus, sales of Lexmark's Prebate toner cartridges were authorized and unconditional, just like sales of LGE's patented products in Quanta. As such, sales of Lexmark cartridges exhausted Lexmark's patent rights in them, stripping Lexmark of the ability to control post-sale use of the cartridges through patent law.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Lexmark relied on “shrinkwrap licenses,” and restrictive notices accompanying the products. The court considered these ineffective to prevent application of the exhaustion doctrine, despite ''Mallinckrodt''’s approval of their use.

The court acknowledged that, “[a]s Lexmark points out, the Supreme Court did not expressly overrule ''Mallinckrodt'' in its ''Quanta'' opinion.” Nonetheless, the court concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After reviewing ''Quanta'', ''Mallinckrodt'', and the parties' arguments, this Court is persuaded that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt sub silentio''. The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the ''Quanta'' holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on ''Mallinckrodt'' in reaching its decision in ''LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc''., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in ''Quanta''. It is also worth noting that the ''Quanta'' decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, the court did not consider ''Quanta'' to have foreclosed the enforcement of the shrinkwrap restrictions under state contract law. The contract law aspects of the case became moot, however, because Lexmark voluntarily dismissed its claims based on Static Control's tortious interference with contract.

===''Impression Products''===

In April 2015, the Federal Circuit ''sua sponte'' called for briefing and ''amicus curiae'' participation in an ''en banc'' consideration of whether ''Mallinckrodt'' should be overruled in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the ''Quanta'' case. The court ordered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In light of ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.'', 553 U.S. 617 (2008), should this court overrule ''Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.'', 976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to the extent it ruled that a sale of a patented article, when the sale is made under a restriction that is otherwise lawful and within the scope of the patent grant, does not give rise to patent exhaustion?&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc.'', Order of April 14, 2015 (Fed. Cir.).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Raynor, Nicholas &amp; Truesdell''' was a [[New York City|New York]] brokerage based on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in the 1920s. It was a member of the [[Consolidated Stock Exchange]],&lt;ref name=book-stock/&gt; before failing on April 29, 1922.&lt;ref name=nyt-owes/&gt; The failure resulted in a highly publicized lawsuit over whether the firm committed mail fraud and bucketing before failing.

==History==
===Founding and failure===
The brokerage firm was founded in 1920 in New York.&lt;ref name=nyt-stands/&gt; According to records, as early as November 21, 1921, Consolidated had discussed the firm's methods, as it was known for [[bucketing]].&lt;ref name=nyt-asked&gt;{{cite news |date=November 18, 1924 |title=RRaynor Firm Asked Time to Recover; Partner, on Stand, Admits That It Was Not Possible to Save Brokerage House. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/11/18/archives/raynor-firm-asked-time-to-recover-partner-on-stand-admits-that-it.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=The New York Times, New York City, United States |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1922, it was based at 42 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and 30 East [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], and were members of the [[Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York]]. Firm members included D. C. Raynor, E. H. Truesdell, and B. J. Nicholas.&lt;ref name=book-stock&gt;{{cite news|date=1922 |title=Brokers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCkJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=%22Raynor,+Nicholas+%26+Truesdell%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KzoAaYmYXR&amp;sig=c-kSO5sqiUPGjUQFuov3mVHb77Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA-7Hx5uLZAhVXzGMKHaLlDDMQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Raynor%2C%20Nicholas%20%26%20Truesdell%22&amp;f=false | work=  |location=  |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm soon ran into financial difficulties. In November 1923 at the bankruptcy hearing, speculator Louis B. Appleton told that he and his brother Charles put up $50,000 before the failure as an advance to the firm, to help keep it afloat.&lt;ref name=nyt-sumptuous&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=November 2, 1923 |title=Speculator Tells of Loan to Brokers; Louis B.

The firm failed on April 29, 1922.&lt;ref name=nyt-owes/&gt; In October 1923, testimony about the firm revealed that it failed in April 1922 for $4,000,000, and that the committee of the Consolidated Exchange had been aware of its failing condition six weeks before that.&lt;ref name=nyt-report&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=October 10, 1923 |title=Insolvent Brokers Allowed to Go On; Condition of Raynor, Nicholas &amp; Truesdell Reported to Consolidated Before Crash. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1923/10/10/archives/insolvent-brokers-allowed-to-go-on-condition-of-raynor-nicholas.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=The New York Times, New York City, United States |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure amount was in 1924 reported as "more than $2,000,000."&lt;ref name=nyt-surrender/&gt;

===Bucketing and fraud charges===
In December 1923, De Witt C. Raynor was indicted by the Federal Grand Jury in connection with the failure, after testifying that May. When the hearing resumed the following June, he had disappeared, failing to answer to a [[subpoena]]. He was still missing by July 1923, when he should have surrendered for his arrest.&lt;ref name=nyt-surrender/&gt; On January 23, 1924, it was revealed after an examination of the books that Raynor, Nicholas Truesdell owed $1,250,000 to be divided among 2,500 customers, and had $80,000 in assets. That day, several [[curb broker]]s were called in to testify on their dealings with the firm's check history.&lt;ref name=nyt-owes&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=January 23, 1924 |title=Raynor Has $80,000 And Owes $1,250,000; Small Pickings Left for 2,500 Customers of the Failed Consolidated Firm. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/01/23/archives/raynor-has-80000-and-owes-1250000-small-pickings-left-for-2500.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=The New York Times, New York City, United States |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 1924, De Witt Raynor walked into the office of the United States Marshal in [[Havana]] and surrendered himself, disclaiming any voluntary violation of the law.&lt;ref name=nyt-surrender&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=February 2, 1924 |title=Raynor Surrenders on Fraud Charges; New York Broker Involved in $2,000,000 Failure Gives Self Up in New Orleans. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/02/03/archives/raynor-surrenders-on-fraud-charges-new-york-broker-involved-in.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=The New York Times, New York City, United States |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 1924, De Witt C. Raynor plead guilty before a federal judge on charges of conspiracy and using the mails to defraud. Other co-defendants at the time included [[William Sylvester Silkworth|William Silkworth]], [[Louis Gilbough]] of Consolidated, Blaine J. Nicholas and Earl H. Truesdell, and several others including Peter Owens, office manager of the Raynor firm. Lawyer [[Peter McCoy]] was prosecutor.&lt;ref name=nyt-rguilty&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=November 7, 1924 |title=Raynor is Guilty; Silkworth Fights; Broker, Whose Plea Is Accepted, May Become a Witness for the Government. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/11/07/archives/raynor-is-guilty-silkworth-fights-broker-whose-plea-is-accepted-may.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=The New York Times, New York City, United States |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 1924, Silkworth and five others also found guilty of bucketing,&lt;ref name=nyt-stands/&gt; with Silkworth convicted of [[mail fraud]] relating to his brokerage and Raynor, Nicholas and Truesdell in 1922.&lt;ref name=nyt-accused-theft&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the appeal process, McCoy gave testimony before the Circuit Court of Appeals that Raynor, Nicholas &amp; Truesdell had engaged in extensive bucketing operations since its founding late 1920. McCoy further testified that Silkworth had provided the firm's bucketing operations with the protection of Consolidated. The Judge ruled against the motion raised by defendants, which was that bucketing did not have a Federal statute against it at the time, and ruled in favor of McCoy on February 1, 1926 with the November conviction upheld.&lt;ref name=nyt-stands&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Silkworth Loses; Conviction Stands; Sentence of Former President of Consolidated Exchange for Fraud Is Affirmed.

The first '''[[revenue stamp]]s''' in the '''[[United States]]''' were used briefly during colonial times, among the most notable usage involved the [[Stamp Act]]. Long after independence, the first revenue stamps printed by the United States government were issued in the midst of the [[American Civil War]], prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. After the war ended however, revenue stamps and the taxes they represented still continued. Revenue stamps served to pay tax duties on items that came under two main categories, ''Proprietary'' and ''Documentary''. Proprietary stamps paid tax duties on goods like alcohol and tobacco, and were also used for various services, while Documentary stamps paid duties on legal documents, mortgage deeds, stocks and a fair number of other legal dealings. ''Proprietary'' and ''Documentary'' stamps often bore these respective designations, while in several of the issues they shared the same designs, sometimes with minor variations.  Beginning in 1862 the first revenue stamps were issued, and would continue to be used for another hundred years and more. For the first twelve years George Washington was the only subject featured on U.S. revenue stamps, when in 1875 an allegorical figure of ''Liberty'' finally appeared. Revenue stamps were printed in many varieties and denominations and are widely sought after by collectors and historians. Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967.

==History of revenue stamp usage==
[[File:1765 one penny stamp.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Galley proof|proof]] copy of a stamp prepared for the [[1765 Stamp Act]]]]
The first revenue stamps appeared in the years leading up to the [[American Revolution]] as a result of the [[1765 Stamp Act]], the taxes of which were not well received by the colonists of the day. These were the British colonial issues and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on specially prepared stamped paper produced in London which carried an embossed revenue stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dalessandris.net/embossed.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317232703/http://dalessandris.net/embossed.aspx |archivedate=2011-03-17 |df= }} Retrieved 15 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War era, first issue===
In August 1862, while the [[American Civil War]] was being waged, the United States (Union) government began taxing a variety of goods, services and legal dealings. To confirm that taxes were paid a 'revenue stamp' was purchased and appropriately affixed to the taxable item, which would in turn pay the tax duty involved.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue took bids for the printing and production of the first U.S. revenue stamps in an effort to raise revenue for the great costs of the war.&lt;ref name=SNPM5000&gt;[[#SNPM'5K|Smithsonian National Postal Museum, article]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Linns&gt;[[#Linns|Linn's Stamp News article: Miller, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Internal Revenue awarded Butler &amp; Carpenter of Philadelphia the printing contract who were  paid $19,080 to produce one hundred and six printing plates, including the rolls, dies and all  material necessary to maintain stamp production.&lt;ref name=Toppan6-7&gt;
[[#Toppan|Toppan, Deats &amp; Holland, 1899]], pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Butler &amp; Carpenter soon began producing the first revenue stamps which were issued for use beginning Oct. 1, 1862.&lt;ref name=Scotts453&gt;[[#Scotts82|Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982]], p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;

For reasons unknown the bill from Butler &amp; Carpenter was never settled by the U.S. government until some years later, but not after Butler and Carpenter wrote and appealed numerous times to the commissioner of Internal Revenue, Hon. J.J. Lewis, about the matter. Because of the long wait involved one of the major points of contention was the appreciable amount of increase for materials between the time the agreement was made and when the bill was finally settled.&lt;ref name=Toppan6-7/&gt;

The new stamps were printed in several colors and depicted a portrait of [[George Washington]] on all thirty [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]]s from one-cent to $200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McKinney |first=W. Arthur |title=About Stamps:  |journal=[[Boys' Life]] |volume=LVI |issue=11 |pages=81 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |location=New Brunswick, NJ |date=November 1962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_Me401WGAwC&amp;pg=PA81 |issn=0006-8608 |accessdate=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engraved image of Washington was modeled after a painting by [[Gilbert Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#McKinney|McKinney, BSA Journal, 1962]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first issues were printed on hard brittle paper and later printed on soft woven paper of varying thicknesses. Colors were generally dull for stamps printed before 1868. The stamps were issued in sheets perforated with 12 gauge perforations or 'imperforate', i.e.solid sheets with no perforations.&lt;ref name=Scotts453/&gt; Washington remained the only figure on the dozens of varieties issued up until 1874.&lt;ref name=Scotts453-460&gt;[[#Scotts82|Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982]], pp. 453–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The new revenue stamps were used to pay tax on proprietary items such as playing cards, patent medicines and luxuries, and for various legal documents, stocks, transactions and various legal services. The cancellation of these stamps were usually done in pen and ink, while hand stamped cancellations were seldomly used and subsequently are more rare.&lt;ref name=Scotts453/&gt; When the Civil War ended it did not mean an end to revenue taxes as the federal government still had not paid the $2.7 billion debt it had acquired until 1883, at which time it finally repealed the excise tax. Three distinct revenue stamp series were produced to pay the taxes during that twenty one-year period.&lt;ref name=SNPM5000/&gt;

[[File:Washington revenue playing cards 2c 1862.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Playing card revenue stamps, often used for the photograph tax]]
Among the more notable instances of tax stamp usage occurred in the photography trade. As the Civil War progressed, the demand for photographs of family members, soldiers going off to war and returning war heroes increased dramatically, but not without the notice from the Federal government who saw the advent as an opportunity to raise much needed revenue for the war. On August 1, 1864 the Internal Revenue department passed a 'photograph tax' requiring photographers to pay a tax on the sale of their photographs. By 1864 there were no 'photography tax' stamps issued, so other stamps were substituted, typically, the proprietary or playing card revenue stamps was used, usually affixed to the back of the photograph. Already burdened with high overhead costs and scarcity of materials because of the war, large photograph companies organized and petitioned Congress, complaining that they were shouldering too much of the tax burden placed on the public. After exactly two years their constant efforts resulted in the tax being repealed on August 1, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baryla|Baryla, 2010]], Frame 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Several other widely used products, such as  cotton, tobacco and alcohol, were also charged a ''proprietary'' tax which appreciably contributed to the revenues generated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baryla|Baryla, 2010]], Frame 1, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===First issue design types===
----
The first series of revenue stamps have two distinctive design types with each stamp designating the tax 'duty'. Designs for denominations 1-cent through 20-cents were simple, bearing a portrait of George Washington, while stamps with denominations 25-cents through 1-dollar are larger and have a more elaborate design and also designate the tax duty in a lower banner. Stamps with denominations of $1.30 were used to pay the tax duty for foreign exchange only, $1.50 for Inland exchange only while the stamps with denominations of $1.60 and $1.90 were for Foreign exchange only and oddly bear no duty designations in the stamp design.

Various tax duties were only served by certain revenue stamps as some duties were only found on lower or higher denomination revenue stamps as the case may be. For example, revenue stamps with a  designation for ''Playing cards'' occur only on denominations of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cents, while the 25-cent denomination revenue stamp is the only one whose designation specifies [[:File:Washington revenue 25c 1862 issue R43a.jpg|''Bond'']]. A specialized stamp catalog is needed to see the different occurrences of tax-designation to denomination combinations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scotts|Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982]], pp. 457–459&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second issue===
----

The second issue of revenue stamps were ''Documentary'' stamps and issued in 1871. After the Internal Revenue received many reports of the fraudulent re-use of revenue stamps, typically with cancellation ink washed or otherwise removed from the face of the stamp,&lt;ref name=Scotts458&gt;[[#Scotts82|Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982]], pp. 458–460&lt;/ref&gt;  a letter of  May 31, 1867 from government officials in Wall Street was sent to Internal Revenue commissioner E.A. Rollins expressing the concern that "''The U.S. government loses thousands of dollars daily by stamps being used a second time.''" The ordinary stamps in use at this time did not receive the cancellation ink very well, unless it was heavily applied.&lt;ref name=Toppan1&gt;[[#Toppan|Toppan, Deats &amp; Holland, 1899]], pp. 8, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; The letter advised that all stamps be printed in a pale yellow color. This particular suggestion however was not taken up by Butler &amp; Carpenter, but instead, after a period of experimentation, they responded to the problem by producing stamps of a lighter shade and on a paper that more readily absorbed cancellation ink.&lt;ref name=Toppan1/&gt; The Internal revenue was frequently sending stamps suspected of having cancellation ink washed to the engravers and printers for inspection to determine if they had been tampered with.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Toppan|Toppan, Deats &amp; Holland, 1899]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The new paper was finally employed in stamp production in early 1869&lt;ref name=Toppan1/&gt; and by 1871 a second series of stamps were issued, printed on a special patented "chameleon" paper containing silk fibers which can be seen in the paper with the naked eye.&lt;ref name=Scotts458/&gt; Still produced by Butler &amp; Carpenter of Philadelphia, the entire second series, with the exception of the 200-dollar issue, were printed in the same bi-color combination, with the portrait of Washington printed in black and with the frame work in blue with various ornate and elaborate designs, popular during that period.

;"Persian rug" stamps
[[File:Washington revenue stamp $200 persian rug 1871.jpg|thumb|left|190px|"Small Persian rug", $200]]
[[File:Washington revenue $500 1871 issue.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Large Persian rug", $500]]
The highest values in the second issue of revenue stamps are 200-dollar (left) and the 500-dollar (right) stamps and are commonly referred to by collectors as the Small and Large ''Persian rug'' revenue stamps respectively, which are considered by many to be among the most colorful and elaborately engraved stamps in all of philately. Both the 200 and 500-dollar stamps were printed in very limited quantities. The 200-dollar small ''Persian Rug'' had a printing of 446 copies, with approximately 125 known surviving examples. The stamps were printed one to a 'sheet', with margins on all four sides with inscriptions on the two side margins. The only surviving full sheet of the small ''Persian rug'', was used to pay tax duties on the will of Erastus Corning, Sr. in 1872. The 500-dollar large ''Persian rug'' is indeed larger, measuring {{frac|2|1|8}} by 4 inches with only 204 stamps of this denomination ever issued. Because of their relatively large sizes and the subsequent large number of perforations on each stamp, and the fact that they were used on documents which were typically folded across the stamps, most examples exist with some sort of flaw(s) about the stamp paper. Printed by the Carpenter Printing company of Philadelphia, a 5,000-dollar design was also proposed and a trial color essay was printed, but it was never issued for revenue use so there only exists a [[:File:Washington $5,000 Documentary trial color essay.JPG|die proof]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Persianrug|Siegel Auction Galleries, NY]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Swain|Swain, essay, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol revenue stamps===
----
Taxes were commonly levied on alcohol and tobacco products and a variety of such stamps were printed for this purpose. Typically, the stamp would be affixed to a given product when the taxes were paid in such a way as to seal a given container, where upon opening, the stamp would be damaged. For example, revenue stamps for beer tax were issued to brewers in sheet form, where an individual stamp was cut from it and used as a seal over the opening in a barrel of beer. To access the beer the stamp would have to be punctured, thus prohibiting its reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=$2 Beer revenue stamp proof single |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=5 October 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=73909&amp;img=1&amp;pg=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third issue===
----
Because the second issue of revenue stamps were all printed in the same blue and black colors they were often difficult to distinguish at a glance by Internal Revenue employees. Subsequently, a third issue of stamps with similar designs and some variations as the second issue but with distinctive colors assigned to the various denominations was released between 1871 and 1872. Production of the third issue employed  many of the same printing plates, engraved by J.R. Carpenter of Philadelphia, and were printed on the same special  "chameleon" paper with silk fibers used in the  printing of the second issue, with perf' 12 [[commons:Perforations US1940 issues-2c.jpg|perforations]]. Unlike many of the stamps in the second issue, the third issue does not designate any duty type in the stamp designs. Double transfers and inverted centers occur in nearly all the different denomination designs.&lt;ref name=Scotts460&gt;[[#Scotts|Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982]], p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1875 the Internal Revenue awarded the contract to print for revenue stamps to the National Bank Note Company who prepared a second  series of proprietary stamps. The new revenue stamps are commonly referred to as the "second proprietary issue," and occur in 1-cent, 2-cent, 3-cent, 4-cent, 5-cent, and 6-cent denominations. Use of revenue stamps to pay proprietary taxes ended on July 1, 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Issues  |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=6 October 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=73270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liberty revenue 2c 1875 R152 pair.jpg|thumb|324px|{{center|Liberty revenue, 2c, 1875 issue&lt;br&gt;stamp (at left) and plate proof}}]]
In 1875, the Internal revenue department issued a 2-cent revenue, depicting an allegory of ''Liberty''. Printing of this issue continued into 1878. This was the first U.S. Revenue stamp to be issued that did not bear the portrait of George Washington. The Liberty issue was printed on silk bluish paper. Two types of perforations were added, standard perforations with punctured holes, and rouletted. Stamps produced in 1878 were printed on double-lined watermarked paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scotts|Scotts Specialized Catalogue, 1982]], p.460&lt;/ref&gt; Quantities printed for this issue were great, totaling 228,351,689 stamps, which include both standard and rouletted perforations. The quantities of stamps issued with each type of perforation are not known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toppan|Toppan, Deats &amp; Holland, 1899]], p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overprints of 1898==
On June 13, 1898, Congress passed the [[War Revenue Act of 1898]] to provide badly needed funding for the [[Spanish–American War]]. The law was to become effective on July 1, 1898, leaving only seventeen days to produce the badly needed revenue stamps. In anticipation of the law's passage the Bureau of Engraving and Printing had already commenced work on the dies and printing plates for the new revenue stamps, however they were unable to issue the stamps when the law went into effect. To meet the demand for revenue stamps, existing stocks of [[Definitive stamp|standard postage stamps]] (issued in 1895–1898) were overprinted with the initials ''I.R.'' (i.e., Internal Revenue) for use as revenue stamps. Initials are faint on issues with denominations of 8, 10 and 15-cents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Siegel-OP|Siegel Auction Galleries, NY, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of shortages of revenue stamps two shipping firms operating along the Erie Canal used the existing 1c Trans-Mississippi stamp issue which was approved by the Federal District Revenue Collector who commissioned the Purvis Printing Company to do the overprinting. They were ordered by L. H. Chapman of the Chapman Steamboat Line, which operated freight-carrying steamboats along the Erie Canal, making stops at Syracuse, Utica, Little Falls and Fort Plain. Only 250 stamps were produced. In addition 250 were printed reading "I.R./P.I.D. &amp; Son", for P.I. Daprix &amp; Son, which served different ports along the same waterway. In each case five panes of 50 stamps were overprinted with the initials ''I.R.''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ASDA|Lester, ASDA essay]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:Argonaut Oil &amp; Mining Co stock 1900 and rev stamps.jpg|thumb|286px|Common use of ''Documentary'' Revenue stamps (upper left) affixed to stock certificate]]
In the continuation of providing funding for the Spanish–American War Congress authorized a tax on a wide range of goods and services including various alcohol and tobacco products, tea and other amusements and also on various legal and business transactions (such as [[Stock certificates]], [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], [[Manifest (transportation)|manifests]], and [[marine insurance]]). To pay these tax duties

These three designs were also used in the [[:File:Hamilton revenue $500 1917 issue R249a.JPG|1914]], 1917 printings and much later in 1940 issues, with slight modifications in the design. i.e.The inscription ''Series of 1898'' was removed. As an added security measure each of these high value stamps was given its own unique serial number.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scotts|Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982]], pp. 462-64&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] the issues of 1898 were printed on white wove paper and watermarked with the initials  ''U.S.I.R.''

Almost all of the issues of this period were printed in "carmine" red. The higher denominations of 30-dollars to 10,000-dollars bore a unique serial number as an added security measure.

After the tax laws were passed in 1862, private proprietors were allowed to furnish their own stamps, subject to the approval of the Internal Revenue and subsequently were granted a discount on the taxes paid for the goods they sold. Private stamps offered the advantage of having the proprietor's name depicted on the stamp.&lt;ref name=private&gt;{{cite web |title=Private Die Proprietary Stamps |url=http://www.rdhinstl.com/mm/mma1.htm |accessdate=October 21, 2014 |publisher=R.D.Hinstl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proprietor paid the cost of engraving the die and the printing plates which in the beginning varied considerably. Some proprietors paid as little as $60 while others paid as much as $750. After June 1, 1863 a uniform cost of $350 was adopted for all dies with a couple of exceptions for large ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Toppan|Toppan, Deats &amp; Holland, 1899]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these stamps were printed by Butler &amp; Carpenter of Philadelphia who also printed revenue stamps for the government. Since many stamps would be used to seal a container or packet they were often long in configuration and would be destroyed upon opening. Four types of paper were used to print private die proprietary stamps. They were printed on white, unwatermarked paper up until September, 1871, commonly referred to as "old paper." Some of this paper contained sparsely scattered silk threads and is considered a minor variety or as "experimental silk." The full "silk paper" contains numerous silk threads and was used between 1871 and 1878. "Pink paper" was also used for a brief period between 1877 and 1878. Watermarked paper, bearing the initials USIR was used from late 1877 to the end of the tax period in 1883. To help provide funding for the Spanish–American War the use of private stamps resumed again from July 1, 1898 until July 1, 1902. A variety of patent medicines, wines and other goods like perfumery and cosmetics were taxed, but only a comparatively small number of companies used private die stamps during this period.&lt;ref name=private/&gt;

{{About|the U.S. laws prohibiting mandated union membership and dues|the human right concept|right to work|the Indian law|National Rural Employment Guarantee Act}}

In the context of [[United States labor law|US labor politics]], '''"right-to-work laws"''' refers to laws (currently effective in 27 [[U.S. state|states]]) that prohibit [[union security agreement]]s between companies and [[Trade union|labor unions]]. Under these laws, employees in unionized workplaces are banned from negotiating contracts which require all members who benefit from the union contract to contribute to the costs of union representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employer/Union Rights and Obligations|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/employerunion-rights-and-obligations|website=National Labor Relations Board|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Legal Defense Foundation]], right-to-work laws prohibit [[union security agreement]]s, or agreements between [[Employment|employers]] and [[labor union]]s, that govern the extent to which an established union can require employees' membership, payment of [[union dues]], or fees as a condition of employment, either before or after hiring. Right-to-work laws do not aim to provide  general [[Right to work|guarantee of employment]] to people seeking work, but rather are a government ban on contractual agreements between employers and union employees requiring workers to pay for the costs of union representation.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Charles W. "Right to work before and after 14 (b)." Journal of Labor Research 19.3 (1998): 471-493.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-to-work laws (either by [[statutes]] or by [[State constitution (United States)|constitutional]] provision) exist in 27 [[U.S. state]]s, mostly in the [[Southern United States|Southern]], [[Western United States|Western]], and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Business interests represented by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] have lobbied extensively to pass right-to-work legislation.&lt;ref name="Botsch_SCGP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=349–66|jstor=2524814|last1=Miller|first1=Berkeley|last2=Canak|first2=William|title=From 'Porkchoppers' to 'Lambchoppers': The Passage of Florida's Public Employee Relations Act|volume=44|issue=2|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|year=1991|doi=10.2307/2524814}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|pages=127–39|doi=10.1023/A:1025657412651|year=1997|last1=Partridge|first1=Dane M.|title=Virginia's New Ban on Public Employee Bargaining: A Case Study of Unions, Business, and Political Competition|journal=Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal|volume=10|issue=2}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|pages=258–71|jstor=2523703|last1=Canak|first1=William|last2=Miller|first2=Berkeley|title=Gumbo Politics: Unions, Business, and Louisiana Right-to-Work Legislation|volume=43|issue=2|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|year=1990|doi=10.2307/2523703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such laws are allowed under the 1947 federal [[Taft–Hartley Act]]. A further distinction is often made within the law between people employed by state and municipal governments and those employed by the private sector, with states that are otherwise [[union shop]] (i.e., workers must pay for union representation in order to obtain or retain a job) having right to work laws in effect for government employees; provided, however, that the law also permits an "agency shop" where employees pay their share for representation (less than union dues), while not joining the union as members.

==History==
===Origins===
According to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]],
right-to-work laws are derived from legislation forbidding unions from forcing strikes on workers, as well as from legal principles such as [[freedom of contract|liberty of contract]], which as applied here sought to prevent passage of laws regulating workplace conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Palmer |first=Brian |date=December 12, 2012 |title=Why Are Anti-Union Laws Called "Right To Work"? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/12/right_to_work_laws_why_do_union_busters_use_the_orwellian_phrase_right_to.html |work=Slate |access-date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[PandoDaily]]'' and ''NSFWCORP'', the term itself was coined by [[Vance Muse]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] operative who headed an early right-to-work group, the "Christian American Association", to replace the term "American Plan" after it became associated with the anti-union violence of the [[First Red Scare]].&lt;ref name="pando"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ames |first=Mark |date=March 13, 2015 |title=As "Right To Work" becomes law in Wisconsin, a reminder of its inventor's racist past |url=https://pando.com/2015/03/13/as-right-to-work-becomes-law-in-wisconsin-a-reminder-of-its-inventors-racist-past/ |magazine=PandoDaily |access-date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsfwcorp"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ames |first=Mark |date=December 12, 2012 |title=You Hate "Right To Work" Laws More Than You Know. Here's Why |url=https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/right-to-work/ |magazine=NSFWCORP |access-date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muse used racist rhetoric in his defense of "right-to-work" laws.&lt;ref name="pando"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsfwcorp"/&gt;

According to the Conservative think tank, the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the term "right to work" was coined by ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' editorial writer William Ruggles.&lt;ref name=aei-alternative-facts-coined-term&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aei.org/publication/dallas-morning-news-editorial-writer-william-ruggles-coined-the-term-right-to-work-on-labor-day-in-1941 |title=Dallas Morning News editorial writer William Ruggles coined the term “right to work” on Labor Day in 1941 |last=Perry |first=Mark J. |date=September 1, 2014 |website=AEIIdeas |publisher=American Enterprise Institute |access-date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(An [[right to work|unrelated use of term "right to work"]] had been coined by French socialist leader [[Louis Blanc]] before 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Priscilla Smith |date=1952 |title=Revolutions of 1848: A Social History |url=https://books.google.pt/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;id=SX-ectAexEoC&amp;q=Louis+Blanc#v=snippet&amp;q=Right%20to%20work&amp;f=false |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=69 |isbn=9780691007564}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Wagner Act (1935)===
The [[National Labor Relations Act]], generally known as the Wagner Act, was passed in 1935 as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s "[[Second New Deal]]." Among other things, the Act provided that a company could lawfully agree to be any of the following:
* A [[closed shop]], in which employees must be members of the union as a condition of employment. Under a closed shop, an employee who ceased being a member of the union for whatever reason, from failure to pay dues to expulsion from the union as an internal disciplinary punishment, was required to be fired even if the employee did not violate any of the employer's rules.
* A [[union shop]], which allows for hiring non-union employees, provided that the employees then join the union within a certain period.
* An [[agency shop]], in which employees must pay the equivalent of the cost of union representation, but need not formally join the union.
* An [[open shop]], in which an employee cannot be compelled to join or pay the equivalent of dues to a union or be fired for joining the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sojdN0hrku0C&amp;pg=PT67|title=American Labor, Congress, and the Welfare State, 1935-2010|last=Roof|first=Tracy|page=73|publisher=JHU Press|year=2011|ISBN=9781421400877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act tasked the [[National Labor Relations Board]], which had existed since 1933, with overseeing the rules.

===Taft–Hartley Act (1947)===
In 1947 [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]], generally known as the Taft–Hartley Act, over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto. The Act repealed some parts of the Wagner Act, including outlawing the closed shop. Section 14(b) of the Taft–Hartley Act also authorizes individual states (but not [[local government]]s, such as cities or counties) to outlaw the union shop and agency shop for employees working in their jurisdictions. Any state law that outlaws such arrangements is known as a "right-to-work state."

In the early development of the right-to-work policy, segregationist sentiment was used as an argument, as many people in the South felt that it was wrong for blacks and whites to belong to the same unions. [[Vance Muse]], one of the early developers of the policy in Texas, used that argument in the development of anti-union laws in Texas in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gerard|last=Colby|chapter=Decade of Despair|title=Du Pont Dynasty: Behind the Nylon Curtain|location=Secaucus|publisher=Lyle Stewart|year=1984}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernstudies.org/2012/12/the-racist-roots-of-right-to-work-laws.html|title=The racist roots of 'right to work' laws|website=Southernstudies.org|date=December 13, 2012|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|last=Ames|first=Mark|url=http://pando.com/2015/03/13/as-right-to-work-becomes-law-in-wisconsin-a-reminder-of-its-inventors-racist-past/|title=As 'Right To Work' becomes law in Wisconsin, a reminder of its inventor's racist past|website=Pando.com|date=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|first=Vance|last=Muse|title=Making Peace with Grandfather|journal=Texas Monthly|volume=14|issue=2|year=1986|page=142}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirer|first=J.|year=2013|title=Right-to-Work Laws: History and Fightback|journal=National Law. Guild Rev.|volume=70|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current status===
The federal government operates under open shop rules nationwide, but many of its employees are represented by unions. Unions that represent professional athletes have written contracts that include particular representation provisions (such as in the [[National Football League]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.nflplayers.com/mediaResources/files/PDFs/General/NFL%20COLLECTIVE%20BARGAINING%20AGREEMENT%202006%20-%202012.pdf NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement 2006-2012]: Art. V, Sec. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but their application is limited to "wherever and whenever legal," as the Supreme Court has clearly held that the application of a right-to-work law is determined by the employee's "predominant job situs."&lt;ref&gt;''Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, Int'l Union v. Mobil Oil Corp.'', 426 U.S. 407, 414 (1976) (Marshall, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Players on professional sports teams in states with right-to-work laws are thus subject to those laws and cannot be required to pay any portion of union dues as a condition of continued employment.&lt;ref&gt;''Orr v. National Football League Players Ass'n'', 145 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2224, 1993 WL 604063 (Va.Cir.Ct. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-three states, as well as the [[District of Columbia]], do not have right-to-work laws.  

On November 18, 2016, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the right of local governments to enact local right-to-work laws in [[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], and the other states of its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442372/kentucky-right-work-law-sixth-circuit-upholds-local-ordinances|title=Appeals Court Upholds Local Right-to-Work Laws in Kentucky and Ohio|publisher=National Review|date=November 21, 2016|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, 67% of Missouri voters rejected a right-to-work law with 33% voting in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin S.

==Arguments for and against==

===Minority rights and due process===
The first arguments concerning the right to work centered on the rights of a dissenting minority with respect to an opposing majoritarian collective bargain. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] had prompted many U.S. Supreme Court challenges, among which were challenges regarding the constitutionality of the [[National Industry Recovery Act|National Industry Recovery Act of 1933]] (NIRA). In 1936, as a part of its ruling in ''[[Carter v. Carter Coal Co.]]'' the Court ruled against mandatory [[collective bargaining]], stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effect, in respect to wages and hours, is to subject the dissentient minority ... to the will of the stated majority .... To 'accept' in these circumstances, is not to exercise a choice, but to surrender to force. The power conferred upon the majority is, in effect, the power to regulate the affairs of an unwilling minority.  This is legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form; for it is not even delegation to an official or an official body ... but to private persons .... [A] statute which attempts to confer such power undertakes an intolerable and unconstitutional interference with personal liberty and private property. The delegation is so clearly arbitrary, and so clearly a denial of rights safeguarded by the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to decisions of this Court which foreclose the question.&lt;ref&gt;Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, at 311 (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Freedom of association===
Besides the U.S. Supreme Court, other proponents of right-to-work laws also point to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the right to [[freedom of association]]. They argue that workers should both be free to join unions or to refrain, and thus, sometimes refer to states without right-to-work laws as forced unionism states. These proponents argue that by being forced into a collective bargain, what the majoritarian unions call a fair share of collective bargaining costs is actually financial coercion and a violation of [[freedom of choice]]. An opponent to the union bargain is forced to financially support an organization they did not vote for, in order to receive monopoly representation they have no choice over.&lt;ref name="stopteacherstrikes_201211"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopteacherstrikes.org/Forced_Unionism.php|title=Right-to-Work vs Forced Unionism|publisher=StopTeacherStrikes, Inc.|accessdate=November 14, 2012|author=Campbell, Simon|quote=Fair share is compulsory dues. A non-union employee is forced to financially support an organization they did not vote for, in order to receive monopoly representation they have no choice over. It is financial coercion and a violation of freedom of choice. Money is forcibly withheld from non-union employees' paychecks and sent to a private organization. When an agency-shop agreement exists in a school district or county, every employee must pay dues to the union as a condition of their employment. They must pay-up or leave. Should anyone's ability to get or keep a job depend on whether they pay dues to a union? Non-union teachers have struggled in court to try and stop their forced dues from being used for political activity by the union.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] discourages the joining of unions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perspectives.adventist.org/en/questions-answers/questions/go/2016-06-13/what-is-the-adventist-churchs-stance-on-trade-unions/|title=What is the Adventist Church's stance on trade unions?|date=October 4, 2016|website=perspectives.adventist.org|language=en|access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gleanernow.com/feature/adventist-labor-unions|title=Adventist Labor Unions|first=Diana|last=Justice|date=June 1, 2003|newspaper=GleanerNow|access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=https://text.egwwritings.org/publication.php?pubtype=EGWLetter&amp;bookCode=Lt26-1903&amp;lang=en&amp;collection=2&amp;section=all&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;paragraphnumber=5&amp;QUERY=unions&amp;resultId=10|title=Lt 26, 1903 -  Ellen G.

===Unfairness===
Proponents such as the [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] contend that it is unfair that unions can require new and existing employees to either join the union or pay fees for collective bargaining expenses as a condition of employment under [[union security agreement]] contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rae|first=La|url=http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=1395|title=Improvement #3: Remove Union Security Clauses [Mackinac Center&amp;#93;|publisher=Mackinac.org|date=August 1, 1998|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents contend that unions may still be needed in new and growing sectors of the economy, for example, the voluntary and third party sectors, to assure adequate benefits for new immigrant, "part-time" aides in America (e.g., US Direct Support Workforce).

===Political contributions===
Right-to-work proponents, including the [[Center for Union Facts]], contend that political contributions made by unions are not representative of the union workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Dues for Politics|url=https://www.unionfacts.com/article/political-money/|website=Center for Union Facts|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency shop portion of this had previously been contested with support of [[National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation]] in ''[[Communications Workers of America v. Beck]]'', resulting in "Beck rights" preventing agency fees from being used for expenses outside of collective bargaining if the non-union worker notifies the union of their objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I cut off the use of my dues for politics and other nonbargaining activities?|url=http://www.nrtw.org/a/a_4_p.htm|website=National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to challenge the fees must include the right to have it heard by an impartial fact finder.&lt;ref name="Gregory"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/prvw24&amp;div=93&amp;id=&amp;page=|first1=David L.|last1=Gregory|title=1997-1998 Preview U.S. Sup.

AFSCME]]'' in 2018.

===Cost of living===
States enforcing union security provisions in union collective bargaining agreements generally have a higher cost of living,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/business/what-100-can-buy-state-by-state.html|title=What $100 Can Buy, State by State|last=Chokshi|first=Niraj|date=August 8, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nlihc.org/oor|title=Out Of Reach|work=National Low Income Housing Coalition|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, no systematic analysis identifies union security agreements as a significant cause of this variance.

===Free riders===
Opponents such as [[Richard Kahlenberg]] have argued that right-to-work laws simply "gives employees the right to be [[Free-rider problem|free riders]]—to benefit from collective bargaining without paying for it".&lt;ref name=civil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/111055/civil-rights-need-trump-right-work|title=Right to Work" Isn't a Civil Right.

Detroit Board of Education|Abood v. Detroit BoE]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] permitted public-sector unions to charge non-members [[Agency shop|agency fees]] so that employees in the public sector could be required to pay for the costs of representation, even as they opted not to be a member, as long as these fees are not spent on the union's political or ideological agenda. This decision was reversed, however, in ''[[Janus v. AFSCME]]'', with the Supreme Court ruling that such fees violate the first amendment in the case of public-sector unions, since all bargaining by a public-sector union can be considered political activity.

===Freedom of contract and association===
Opponents argue that right-to-work laws restrict [[freedom of association]], and limit the sorts of agreements individuals acting collectively can make with their employer, by prohibiting workers and employers from agreeing to contracts that include [[Agency shop|fair share fees]].  Moreover, American law imposes a [[duty of fair representation]] on unions; consequently non-members in right to work states can and do force unions to provide without compensation grievance services that are paid for by union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/employerunion-rights-and-obligations|title=Employer/Union Rights and Obligations|publisher=National Labor Relations Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2012,  [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] writer [[J.D. Tuccille]], in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider the restrictions right-to-work laws impose on bargaining between unions and businesses to violate [[freedom of contract]] and [[Freedom of association|association]]. ... I'm disappointed that the state has, once again, inserted itself into the marketplace to place its thumb on the scale in the never-ending game of playing business and labor off against one another. ... This is not to say that unions are always good. It means that, when the state isn't involved, they're private organizations that can offer value to their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=J.D.|last=Tuccille|url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/12/when-right-to-work-is-wrong-and-un-liber|title=When Right-To-Work Is Wrong and Un-Libertarian - Hit &amp; Run|publisher=Reason.com|date=2012-12-12|accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Corporate interests===
The unions also contend that the [[National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation]] and National Right to Work Committee have received millions of dollars in grants from foundations controlled by major U.S. industrialists like the New York-based [[John M. Olin Foundation|Olin Foundation, Inc.]], which grew out of a family manufacturing business, but now funds primarily conservative think tanks, media outlets, and university law programs.&lt;ref name="UAW_FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uawlocal3520.org/right%20to%20workfliner.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about the National Right to Work Committee and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation|publisher=[[United Auto Workers]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906091419/http://www.uawlocal3520.org/right%20to%20workfliner.pdf|archivedate=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teamster&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the billionaires behind No Rights At Work|url=http://teamsternation.blogspot.com/2013/01/meet-billionaires-behind-no-rights-at.html|date=January 27, 2013|publisher=Teamster Nation|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlenberg and Marvit also argue that, at least in efforts to pass a right-to-work law in Michigan, excluding police and firefighter unions—traditionally less hostile to Republicans—from the law caused some to question claims that the law was simply an effort to improve Michigan's businesses climate, not to seek partisan advantage.&lt;ref name=civil/&gt;

==Studies of economic effect==
According to Tim Bartik of the [[W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research]], studies of the effect of right-to-work laws abound, but are not consistent. Studies have found both "some positive effect on job growth," and no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/news/michigan/studies-mixed-on-right-to-works-impact|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213120316/http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/news/michigan/studies-mixed-on-right-to-works-impact|archivedate=December 13, 2012|title=Studies mixed on right-to-work's impact|date=December 12, 2012|first=Susan|last=Samples|publisher=WOOD Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Holmes argues that it is difficult to analyze right-to-work laws by comparing states due to other similarities between states that have passed these laws. For instance, right-to-work states often have some strong pro-business policies, making it difficult to isolate the effect of right-to-work laws.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/250026|title=The Effect of State Policies on the Location of Manufacturing: Evidence from State Borders|year=1998|last1=Holmes|first1=Thomas J.|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=106|issue=4|pages=667–705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the growth of states in the Southeast following World War II, Bartik notes that while they have right-to-work laws they have also benefited from "factors like the widespread use of air conditioning and different modes of transportation that helped decentralize manufacturing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wmuk.org/post/upjohn-institute-economist-right-work-laws|title=Upjohn Institute economist on right to work laws|first=Gordon|last=Evans|publisher=WMUK|date=December 10, 2012|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Thomas Holmes compared counties close to the border between states with and without right-to-work laws (thereby holding constant an array of factors related to geography and climate). He found that the cumulative growth of employment in manufacturing in the right-to-work states was 26 percentage points greater than that in the non-right-to-work states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barro|first=Robert|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704150604576166011983939364|title=Opinion: Unions vs. the Right to Work|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the study design, Holmes points out "my results do not say that it is right-to-work laws that matter, but rather that the 'probusiness package' offered by right-to-work states seems to matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv23n1/holmes.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Location of Industry : Do States' Policies Matter?|publisher=Cato.org|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as noted by [[Kevin Drum]] and others, this result may reflect business relocation rather than an overall enhancement of economic growth, since "businesses prefer locating in states where costs are low and rules are lax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/02/unions-and-growth|title=Unions and Growth|publisher=Motherjones.com|date=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2011 study by the [[Economic Policy Institute]] found:&lt;ref name="Gould_Shierholz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper299.pdf|author1=Gould, Elise|author2=Shierholz, Heidi|title=The Compensation penalty of "right-to-work" laws"|format=PDF|year=2011|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wages in right-to-work states are 3.2% lower than those in non-RTW states, after controlling for a full complement of individual demographic and socioeconomic variables as well as state macroeconomic indicators. Using the average wage in non-RTW states as the base ($22.11), the average full-time, full-year worker in an RTW state makes about $1,500 less annually than a similar worker in a non-RTW state. The study goes on to say "How much of this difference can be attributed to RTW status itself? There is an inherent [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogeneity]] problem in any attempt to answer that question, namely that RTW and non-RTW states differ on a wide variety of measures that are also related to compensation, making it difficult to isolate the impact of RTW status."&lt;ref name="Gould_Shierholz"/&gt;
* The rate of employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is 2.6 percentage points lower in RTW states compared with non-RTW states, after controlling for individual, job, and state-level characteristics. If workers in non-RTW states were to receive ESI at this lower rate, 2 million fewer workers nationally would be covered.
* The rate of employer-sponsored pensions is 4.8 percentage points lower in RTW states, using the full complement of control variables in [the study's] regression model. If workers in non-RTW states were to receive pensions at this lower rate, 3.8 million fewer workers nationally would have pensions.
A 2008 editorial in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' comparing job growth in [[Ohio]] and [[Texas]] stated that from 1998 to 2008, Ohio lost 10,400 jobs, while Texas gained 1,615,000. The opinion piece suggested right-to-work laws might be among the reasons for the economic expansion in Texas, along with the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and the absence of a [[state income tax]] in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120450306595906431 Texas v.

==Polling==
In January 2012, in the immediate aftermath of passage of Indiana's right-to-work law, a [[Rasmussen Reports]] telephone survey found that 74% of Likely U.S. Voters disagreed with the question, "Should workers who do not belong to a union be required by law to pay union dues if the company they work is unionized?" but "most also don't think a non-union worker should enjoy benefits negotiated by the union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/jobs_employment/january_2012/74_favor_right_to_work_law_eliminating_mandatory_union_dues|title=74% Favor Right-to-Work Law Eliminating Mandatory Union Dues - Rasmussen Reports™|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24221">A trial which is observed by trial judge or by jury without being partial is a fair trial.
Various rights associated with a fair trial are explicitly proclaimed in Article 10 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], and Article 6 of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]]&lt;!-- same as Article 47 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]? --&gt;, as well as numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the world. There is no binding [[international law]] that defines what  is not a fair trial; for example, the right to a [[jury trial]] and other important procedures vary from nation to nation.&lt;ref&gt;Doswald-Beck, Louise. [http://www.mpepil.com/sample_article?id=/epil/entries/law-9780199231690-e798&amp;recno=20&amp; Fair Trial, Right to, International Protection], ''Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition in international human rights law ==
The right to fair trial is very helpful{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2015}} in numerous declarations which represent [[customary international law]], such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doebbler| first = Curtis| title = Introduction to International Human Rights Law| publisher = CD Publishing| year = 2006| page = 108| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GEC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;q=right%20to%20fair%20trial| isbn = 978-0-9743570-2-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the UDHR enshrines some fair trial rights, such as the [[presumption of innocence]] until the accused is proven guilty, in Articles 6, 7, 8 and 11,&lt;ref name="bare_url_b"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| page = 225 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the key provision is Article 10 which states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Universal declaration of Human Rights| publisher = United Nations| url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some years after the UDHR was adopted,{{When|date=September 2015}} the right to a fair trial was defined in more detail in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). The right to a fair trial is protected in Articles 14 and 16 of the ICCPR which is binding in international law on those states that are party to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doebbler| first = Curtis| title = Introduction to International Human Rights Law| publisher = CD Publishing| year = 2006| page = 107| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GEC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;q=right%20to%20fair%20trial| isbn = 978-0-9743570-2-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 14(1) establishes the basic right to a fair trial, article 14(2) provides for the [[presumption of innocence]], and article 14(3) sets out a list of minimum fair trial rights in criminal proceedings. Article 14(5) establishes the right of a convicted person to have a higher court review the conviction or sentence, and article 14(7) prohibits [[double jeopardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 225–226 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 14(1) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights| publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights| url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm| archivedate = 2008-07-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Geneva Conventions – International right to a fair trial when crimes aren't alleged===
The [[Geneva Conventions]] guarantee [[combatants]] the right not to be put on trial for fighting in a war – unless they commit a [[war crime]] (a [[Geneva Conventions#Grave breaches|grave breach]]) or other [[crime]] (e.g., captured behind enemy lines out of proper uniforms or insignia while carrying out [[espionage]] or [[sabotage]] operations). Most held under the Geneva Conventions are not accused of a crime and therefore it would be a war crime under the Geneva Conventions to give them a trial. This protection against getting a trial is fully consistent with [[International human rights law|human rights law]] because human rights law prohibits putting people on trial when there is no crime to try them for. The Geneva Conventions however guarantee that anyone charged with a war crime or other crime must get a fair trial.

== Definition in regional human rights law ==
The right to a fair trial is enshrined in articles 3, 7 and 26 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR).&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

The right to a fair trial is also enshrined in articles 5, 6 and 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and articles 2 to 4 of the 7th Protocol to the Convention.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

The right to a fair trial is furthermore enshrined in articles 3, 8, 9 and 10 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

== Relationship with other rights ==
The [[right to equality before the law]] is sometimes regarded as part of the right to a fair trial. It is typically guaranteed under a separate article in [[international human rights instruments]]. The right entitles individuals to be recognised as subject, not as object, of the law. International human rights law permits no derogation or exceptions to this human right.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doebbler| first = Curtis| title = Introduction to International Human Rights Law| publisher = CD Publishing| year = 2006| page = 110| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GEC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;q=right%20to%20fair%20trial| isbn = 978-0-9743570-2-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Closely related to the right to a fair trial is the prohibition on [[ex post facto law]], or retroactive law, which is enshrined in human rights instrument separately from the right to fair trial and can not be limited by states according to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

==Fair trial rights==
The right to a fair trial has been defined in numerous regional and [[international human rights instruments]]. It is one of the most extensive human rights and all international human rights instruments enshrine it in more than one article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doebbler| first = Curtis| title = Introduction to International Human Rights Law| publisher = CD Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 107–108| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GEC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;q=right%20to%20fair%20trial| isbn = 978-0-9743570-2-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to a fair trial is one of the most litigated human rights and substantial case law that has been established on the interpretation of this human right.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; Despite variations in wording and placement of the various fair trial rights, international human rights instrument define the right to a fair trial in broadly the same terms.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt; The aim of the right is to ensure the proper administration of justice. As a minimum the right to fair trial includes the following fair trial rights in [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] proceedings:&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;
* the right to be heard by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal
* the right to a [[hearing (law)|public hearing]]
* the right to be heard within a reasonable time
* the [[right to counsel]]
* the right to interpretation&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

States may limit the right to a fair trial or derogate from the fair trial rights only under circumstances specified in the human rights instruments.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

=== In the United States ===
In the United States the right to a fair trial is sometimes illusory. For example, the [[United States Supreme Court]] said in [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/480/386/ ''Town of Newton v. Rumery'', 480 U.S. 386] that a prosecutor may threaten a person that he will take or withhold an official act and prosecute that person for crime unless that person disposes or parts with their right to peacefully and orderly petition the courts for a redress of grievances.  For example, the ''Rumery'' court said when talking about an accused ″the public interest opposing involuntary waiver of constitutional rights is no reason to hold the agreement here invalid.″  Rumery did not receive nor waive their right to a trial during a criminal cause.

=== In civil proceedings ===
The [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] have clarified that the right to a fair trial applies to all types of judicial proceedings, whether [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]]. According to the European Court of Human Rights, Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the fair trial rights apply to all civil rights and obligations created under domestic law and therefore to all civil proceedings (see ''Apeh Uldozotteinek Szovetsege and Others v. Hungary'' 2000).&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

=== In administrative proceedings ===
Both the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] have clarified that the right to a fair trial applies not only to judicial proceedings, but also administrative proceedings. If an individual's right under the law is at stake, the dispute must be determined through a fair process.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

=== In special proceedings ===
In Europe special proceeding may also be subject to Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;The immunity could not be an obstacle: on the one hand , following a immunity resolution of the Senate, the judicial proceeding may raise jurisdictional dispute before the Constitutional Court ( ... ); on the other side (….) the citizen may submit an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = L'Italia "difende" il Regno Unito in nome del procuratore Cordova |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89332670}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mills v. the United Kingdom'' 2001 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held that a [[court-martial]] was subject to Article 6 because of the defendants had been accused of what the court considered to be serious crime, assault with a weapon and wounding.

The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) frequently deals with instances where [[civilians]] are tried by [[military tribunals]] for serious crimes. The ACHPR has held that on the face of it military courts to do not satisfy civilians' right to a fair trial (see ''Constitutional Rights Project v. Nigeria''). In this respect the ACHPR has reaffirmed the [[right to counsel]] as essential in guaranteeing a fair trial. The ACHPR held that individuals have the right to choose their own counsel and that giving the military tribunal the right to veto a counsel violates the right to a fair trial.&lt;ref name="bare_url_c"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doebbler| first = Curtis| title = Introduction to International Human Rights Law| publisher = CD Publishing| year = 2006| page = 109| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GEC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;q=right%20to%20fair%20trial| isbn = 978-0-9743570-2-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impeding a fair trial ==
A fair trial might be impeded by:
* [[Contempt of court]] (typically by the [[News media|media]] or [[juror]]s)
* [[Witness intimidation]]
* Non-disclosure of evidence, through malice or through use of [[state secrets privilege]] (in the USA) or [[public-interest immunity]] (in the UK)

==In Spain==
In the Spanish legal justice system the examining magistrate is the head of the investigation of a specific crime and any other matters that may relate to that particular offence. The magistrate can be aided by the judicial and national police and can also, at the request of the prosecution and defence attorney, follow any number of leads regarding the case. The magistrate can also, when deemed appropriate, restrict the access the defence and prosecution have to the primary evidence and case information, which can include allowing witness statements to be introduced without the actual witness having to be in attendance. An extension of this power is the ability for the judge to declare, under special circumstances, the trial wholly or partially confidential.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/139600/legal-procedures-criminal-cases.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is only when information and evidence presented during the trial could pose a threat to an individual, a group of individuals or even the general interest of the public.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
Between 1971 and 1975, the right to a fair trial [[Operation Demetrius|was suspended in Northern Ireland]]. Suspects were simply imprisoned without trial, and interrogated by the British army for information. This power was mostly used against the Catholic minority. The British government supplied deliberately misleading evidence to the European Court of Human Rights when it investigated this issue in 1978.&lt;ref name=ministers-sanctioned&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/british-ministers-sanctioned-torture-of-ni-internees-1.1820882 'British ministers sanctioned torture of NI internees'] (5 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish government and human rights group [[Amnesty International]] requested that the ECHR reconsider the case in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-30296397|title=Bid to reopen NI 'torture' case|author=|date=2 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three court cases related to the Northern Ireland conflict that took place in mainland Britain in 1975 and 1976 have been accused of being unfair, resulting in the false imprisonment of the [[Birmingham Six]], [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven]]. These convictions were later overturned, though an investigation into allegations that police officers perverted the course of justice failed to convict anyone of wrongdoing.

The United Kingdom created an act – the Special Immigration Appeals Act in 1997, which then led to the creation of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/68/contents|title=Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997|work=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allowed for secret evidence to be stated in court; however, it provides provisions for the anonymity of the sources and information itself. The judge has the power to clear the courtroom of the public and press, and the appellant if need be, if sensitive information must be relayed. The appellant is provided with a Special Advocate, who is appointed in order to represent their interests, however no contact can be made with the appellant after seeing the secret evidence. SIAC is mostly used for deportation cases, and other cases of public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/special-immigration-appeals-commission|title=Apply to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission|work=justice.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secret evidence has seen increased use in UK courts. Some argue that this undermines the British criminal justice system, as this evidence may not come under proper democratic scrutiny. Secret evidence can now be used in wide range of cases including deportations hearings, control orders proceedings, parole board cases, asset-freezing applications, pre-charge detention hearings in terrorism cases, employment tribunals and planning tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/33/secret-evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Juries and a fair trial==
The rationale for a jury was that it offers a check against state power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Under Article 6 of the [[ECHR]], the right to a fair trial implies that accused and public must be able to understand the verdict. Trials decided by jury, as they do not provide reasons for their decision, therefore do not allow for this.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmens, P. (2014). The right to a fair trial and its multiple manifestations. In E. Brems &amp; J. Gerards (Eds.), Shaping Rights in the ECHR: The Role of the European Court of Human Rights in Determining the Scope of Human Rights (pp. 294-314). Cambridge Books Online: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taxquet v Belgium &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-101739|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|work=coe.int|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a violation of article 6(1) was found. The court also implied a right to a reasoned verdict, irrespective of whether that was given by a judge or a jury.

Under ECHR case law, jury decisions can also be problematic in circumstances where juries draw adverse inferences from trial judges' directions in contravention of Article 6(3) (b) and (c).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58798|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|work=coe.int|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member states that do not have a jury system or any other form of lay adjudication in criminal matters or have abolished it include: Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Romania. In these countries, criminal courts are composed exclusively of judges.

EU member states with a collaborative jury system which comprises a combination of jurors and judge include{{clarify|date=December 2014}} Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway (in most cases), Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Sweden. The collaborative system, which can also be employed alongside the traditional jury model, is characterised by the professional judges and the jurors collectively determining all questions of law and fact, the issue of guilt and the sentence.

Within the EU, the traditional jury system exists within Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Malta, Norway (only in serious appeal cases), Spain and the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland).

With the expansion of the EU, It is seen{{By whom|date=September 2015}} as problematic that juries are used, given that their use cannot ensure all the guarantees set out under Article 6, particularly in the ever-expanding landscape and corpus of European law.

==Children and the trial process==
{{POV section|date=September 2015}}
The issue of children and juvenile engagement with court proceedings and the criminal justice system is a contemporary issue when dealing with the human right of a fair trial. Juveniles need to be competent to stand trial and be able to comprehend the proceedings for their criminal trial to be considered a fair trial. This stands as a contentious issue because many argue that it may never be fair for children to have a role in trial or be involved in criminal justice proceedings due to their age, inability to grasp legal concepts etc.&lt;ref&gt;Junger-Tas, J. (2004) ''Youth Justice in the Netherlands'', pp. 330-331. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-226-80865-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

In discussing children in the legal system, the Netherlands and Sweden provide for an intriguing contrast,{{According to whom|date=September 2015}} which assists in understanding of the different punitive measures applicable. In Sweden, children under the age of 15 are not held accountable for the crimes, which they may have committed. Young people aged between 15 and 18 are generally sentenced to a fine or placed in a social services care agreement by order of the court. This care can often be in combination with fines or additional community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/BriefingPapers/Pages/BPPdfDownload.aspx?bp-id=sn05278|title=www.parliament.uk Home page|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a rare occurrence for young people to be sentenced to imprisonment. For the most serious crimes, such as murder and manslaughter, the penalty may be institutionalisation at a specialised youth home. The National Board of Institutional Care is responsible to enforce these sentences. This punishment is for a fixed term, and its focus is on care, treatment and the rehabilitation of young offenders. By contrast, the age of criminal responsibility in the Netherlands is 12. A specialised youth police and courts system was reintroduced in the Netherlands, in order to provide for a specialised task force to deal with youth crime. At the age of 16, an offender who commits crime may be tried in an adult court. The ‘stop and halt’ program is also aimed at punishing young offenders. Younger children under the age of 12 can be ‘stopped’ when they offend, with the main aim at confronting the onset of delinquency. Older children (over the age of 12) can be ‘halted’, with successful completion meaning no criminal record and no prosecution for the young offender in the hope of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.nl/issues/sentences-and-non-punitive-orders/penalties-juvenile-offenders|title=Penalties for juvenile offenders|work=government.nl|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference{{According to whom|date=September 2015}} between the Netherlands and Sweden in terms of children in court revolves around how the Netherlands tailors its law around its juvenile offence framework, meaning that each case is directly measured against that offender's individual circumstances. In Sweden, the court system for children is not tailored towards their individual needs, rather the framework of the juvenile court system is based on the adult court system. However, in Sweden, unlike in the Netherlands, the mitigating circumstance of youth applies in order to provide for a young offender's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthpolicy.nl/yp/Youth-Policy/Youth-Policy-subjects/Child-protection-and-welfare/Juvenile-justice-policy|title=Juvenile justice policy|work=youthpolicy.nl|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanours''''' or '''''Russell on Crime''''' is a book originally written by [[William Oldnall Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin. pp. 36 and 624.&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of citation, its name may be abbreviated to '''Russ Cr'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]''. 1999. p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell's ''Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanours'', which appeared in 1819 in two volumes in [[octavo]], was pronounced by Warren (Law Student, 2nd edit. p.&amp;nbsp;620) "the best general treatise in criminal law". A second edition appeared in 1827; a third, edited by [[Charles Sprengel Greaves|C. S. Greaves]], in 1843, with a supplement in 1851; a fourth, in 3 volumes, in 1865; and a fifth, edited by S. Prentice, Q.C., in 1877. The American editions, of which seven were issued between 1824 and 1853, do not reproduce the whole work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Russell, William Oldnall|first=Gerald le Grys|last=Norgate|volume=49|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, J G Marvin said of the third London and fifth American editions:&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanors''. 3d ed. By C. S. Greaves. 5th American from the 3d London ed.; with the Notes and References, of Daniel Davis and Theron Metcalf, Esq'rs., and additional Notes and References, by George Sharswood. 2 vols. 8vo. Philadelphia. 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|The American editions, excepting the last, do not contain the whole of Russell on Crimes, from the supposed inapplicability, on the part of the editors, of certain parts of the work to this country. Its appreciation among us is best shown by the number of American editions. The notes of American Cases are numerous and able, and no English law book has received more careful and excellent editorial care than ''Russell on Crimes''. Professor Whiteside remarks, that the second volume contains the best summary of the leading principles of the Law of Evidence, especially relating to Criminal Jurisprudence, he has ever met with. It is said to have been drawn up by Mr. Williams, the learned author of the work on Executors. Mr. Warren says, it is the best general Treatise on Criminal Law. 1 Leg. Reporter, 298; [[Hoffman's Course of Legal Study|Hoff. Leg.

A '''safeguard''', in [[international law]], is a restraint on [[international trade]] or [[economic development]] to protect communities from [[development aggression]] or home industries from foreign [[competition]].

In the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), a member may take a safeguard action, such as restricting imports of a product temporarily to protect a domestic industry from an increase in imports causing or threatening to cause injury to domestic production.

In the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], safeguards are intended to protect [[indigenous peoples]] and other [[local communities]] with [[traditional knowledge]] of [[natural resource management]] within efforts towards [[reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= REDD Web Platform Safeguards|url=https://unfccc.int/methods/redd/redd_web_platform/items/7282.php |publisher=The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO and UNFCCC concepts are related within international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= World Bank Safeguard Policies and the UNFCCC REDD+ Safeguards |url=https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/sites/fcp/files/2013/june2013/FMT%20Note%20CF-2013-3_FCPF%20WB%20Safeguard%20Policies%20and%20UNFCCC%20REDD%2B%20Safeguards_FINAL.pdf |publisher=Institute of Green Economy |issue= IGREC‐19:2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= A Guide to Understanding and Implementing the UNFCCC REDD+ Safeguards|url=http://www.clientearth.org/reports/a-guide-to-understanding-and-implementing-unfccc-redd+-safeguards.pdf |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= REDD: Addressing the Drivers – A case for the WTO?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/briefings/forests/2013/20130604-REDD-Drivers.pdf |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
With UNFCC processes, safeguards became of concern in the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= The REDD Safeguards of Cancun |url=http://www.igrec.in/The_REDD_Safeguards_of_Cancun.pdf |publisher=The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the WTO, safeguard measures were available under the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) (Article XIX). However, they were infrequently used, and some governments preferred to protect their industries by "grey area" measures ("voluntary" export restraint arrangements on products such as cars, steel and semiconductors). As part of the WTO deal, members gave up the "grey area" measures and adopted a specific WTO Safeguards Agreement [http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/safeg_e/safeg_e.htm] to discipline the use of safeguard measures.

Safeguards are usually seen as responses to economic development and trade processes that align with [[international law]], as opposed to negative practices, such as [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] or [[subsidies]].

In the context of world trade, they are supposed to be used only in very specific circumstances, with compensation, and on a universal basis. For example, a member restricting imports for safeguard purposes would have to restrict imports from all other countries. However, exceptions to the nondiscriminatory rule are provided for in the Agreement on Safeguards itself as well as in some [[ad hoc]] agreements. In the last respect, it is worthwhile to note that the [[People's Republic of China]] accepted that discriminatory safeguards may be imposed on its exports to other WTO members until 2013.

Regional trading arrangements have their own rules relating to safeguards. Some safeguard measures can be resorted to in the area of services, as provided for in the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS).

The doctrine of the '''separation of powers in Australia''' divides the institutions of government into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. The legislature makes the laws; the executive put the laws into operation; and the judiciary interprets the laws. The doctrine of the separation of powers is often assumed to be one of the cornerstones of fair government. A strict separation of powers is not always evident in Australia;&lt;ref name=Hilton&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Hilton v Wells]]|court=HCA|num=16|year=1985|parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 57 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; instead the Australian version of separation of powers combines the basic democratic concepts embedded in the [[Westminster system]], the doctrine of "''responsible government''" and the United States version of the separation of powers. The issue of separation of powers in Australia has been a contentious one and continues to raise questions about where power lies in the [[Politics of Australia|Australian political system]].

Although it is assumed that all the branches under the separation of powers do not overlap, for example like the US, there is sometimes a 'common ground' between all three levels. In Australia there is little separation between the executive and the legislature, with the executive required to be drawn from, and maintain the confidence of, the legislature. In Victorian Stevedoring &amp; General Contracting Co Pty Ltd &amp; Meakes v Dignan the [[High Court of Australia]] held that a strict division between these two levels was not practical and re-affirmed the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to outline this (German, 2012).

The first three chapters of the [[Australian Constitution]] are headed respectively "The Parliament", "The Executive Government", and "The Judicature". Each of these chapters begins with a section by which the relevant "power of the Commonwealth" is "vested" in the appropriate persons or bodies. The historical context in which the Constitution was drafted suggests that these arrangements were intended to be connected with federal ideas along American lines.

On the other hand, the Constitution incorporates [[responsible government]], in which the legislature and the executive are effectively united. This incorporation is reflected in sections 44, 62 and 64 of the Constitution.

==Legislative and executive powers==

Currently, there is no constitutional system where there is a complete separation of powers. The strict doctrine exists only in a theory – in reality, some overlap is inevitable, though a system of checks and balances has developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carney, G |title=Separation of Powers in the Westminster System |url=https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/aspg/papers/930913.pdf |publisher=ASPG (Qld Chapter) |year=1993 |access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Westminster system, ministers (executive) are required to sit in Parliament (legislative). This is to adhere with the concept of Responsible Government. This is also present in the Australian system, being a requirement of [[Section 64 of the Constitution of Australia|section 64 of the Constitution]].&lt;ref name="s64"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|64}} Ministers of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific requirement for ministers to sit in Parliament established the connection between executive and legislative, effectively preventing an American-style separation of the two. Strictly speaking, any person may be appointed a Minister, but their appointment lapses if they do not gain a seat in either house of the Parliament within three months.  This provision was necessary in 1901, as the first government was sworn in on 1 January but the first parliament was not elected until late March (see [[Australian federal election, 1901]]).  No non-parliamentarian was appointed a Minister since then, until the appointment of Bob Carr as Foreign Minister in 2012.  However, the provision is still relevant.  It applies when a minister in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] loses their seat at a general election; despite no longer being a member of parliament, the Minister will typically retain their portfolio for some days after the election, until the new government is sworn in.  It also applied when [[John Gorton]] became Prime Minister in 1968; he was sworn in while a member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], then he resigned to contest a by-election for a lower house seat, which he won, but between his resignation from the Senate and being elected to the House of Representatives, he remained Prime Minister without holding any seat in Parliament.

In ''[[Victorian Stevedoring &amp; General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan]]'', the [[High Court of Australia]] held that it was impossible, consistent with the British tradition, to insist upon a strict separation between legislative and executive powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Victorian Stevedoring &amp; General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan]]|court=HCA|num=34|year=1931|parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/34.pdf (1931) 467 CLR 73] |courtname=auto}}, see also {{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Roche v Kronheimer]]|court=HCA|num=25|year=1921|parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/25.pdf (1921) 29 CLR 329] |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that legislative power may be delegated to the executive, and as a result upheld the validity of [[delegated legislation]]. By contrast, in its insistence on a strict separation of "judicial power", the High Court has been less willing to compromise.&lt;ref name=Kable&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]]|court=HCA|num=24|year=1996|parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the role of the courts was discussed in ''[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]]'', whereby a NSW statute was invalidated since it purported to confer not-judicial functions to court.{{r|Kable}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW]]|court=HCA|num=1|year=2010|parallelcite=(2010) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 531 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle that a State Court cannot be assigned powers that are incompatible with its constitutionally protected independence was extended to Territory Courts in ''Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy]]|court=HCA|num=63|year=2000|parallelcite=(2000) 205 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive is not only physically part of the legislature, but the legislature can also allocate it some of its powers, such as of the making of regulations under an Act passed by Parliament. Similarly, the legislature could restrict or over-rule some powers held by the executive by passing new laws to that effect, though these could be subject to [[judicial review]].

The exceptionally strong [[party discipline]] in Australia, especially in the lower house, has had the effect of weakening scrutiny of the executive by the legislature since within the lower house, every member of the numerically larger party will almost always support the executive and its propositions on all issues.

On the other hand, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] has had the effect of restraining the power of the executive through its ability to query, amend and block government legislation. The result of the adoption of a proportional system of voting in 1949 has been that the Senate in recent decades has rarely been controlled by governments. Minor parties have gained greater representation and Senate majorities on votes come from a coalition of groups on a particular issue, usually after debate by the Opposition and Independents.

The Constitution does, moreover, provide for one form of physical separation of executive and legislature. Section 44, concerning the disqualifications applying to membership of Parliament, excludes from Parliament government employees (who hold "an office of profit under the crown" (iv)) along with people in certain contractual arrangements with the Commonwealth. This was demonstrated in 1992 after Independent MP, Phil Cleary, had won the Victorian seat of Wills. Cleary, on leave without pay from the Victorian Education Department at the time of his election, was held in ''[[Sykes v Cleary]]'' to be holding an office of profit under the Crown and disqualified. The Court noted that that Section 44's intention was to separate executive influence from the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Sykes v Cleary]]|court=HCA|num=60|year=1992|parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 77 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation of federal judicial power==
{{Main article| Chapter III Court}}

As early as [[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|New South Wales v Commonwealth]] (''The Wheat Case''), the High Court decided that the strict insulation of judicial power was a fundamental principle of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Wheat Case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|New South Wales v Commonwealth]]|court=HCA|num=17|year=1915|parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 CLR 54] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boilermakers"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]]|year=1956|court=HCA|num=10|parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to tribunals and commissions set up by Federal Parliament which, unlike some of their equivalents in the states, can only recommend consequences. The Federal Parliament itself has the rarely used privilege of being able to act as a court in some circumstances, primarily where it may regard a non-member as acting "in contempt" of parliament.

The reasoning in the ''Wheat Case'' was taken further in ''[[Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd]]'' where a decisive distinction between judicial and arbitral functions was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd]]|court=HCA|num=56|year=1918|parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/56.pdf (1918) 25 CLR 434] |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court made reference to the separation of powers again in [[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] (''Boilermakers' Case''), highlighting that only a Chapter III Courts can exercise judicial powers and, that a Chapter III Court is only permitted to exercise judicial power.&lt;ref name="Boilermakers"/&gt;

A consequence of the Australian version of the separation of powers is its role in encouraging judicial deference to the "political" arms of government. The normal propensity of the High Court is to recognise that separation of powers requires not only that the "political branches" should not interfere with judicial activity, but also that the judiciary should leave politicians and administrators alone. The importance of deference has been acknowledged in extrajudicial writings, and in decisions such as [[Drake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs|''Drake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (No 2)'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|AATA|179|1979|litigants=Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No 2) |link=Drake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs |parallelcite=(1979) 11 {{abbr|FLR|Federal Law Reports}} 203 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a manifestation of the separation of powers, a '[[Chapter III Court]]' cannot make administrative decisions. In administrative law this means that the courts cannot substitute an original decision of the executive, but can only decide on its correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp]] |court=EWCA|num=1|year=1947|parallelcite=[1948] 1 KB 223 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''[[persona designata]]'' permits non-judicial functions to be conferred on judges in their personal capacity, as opposed to their judicial capacity.{{r|Hilton}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Grollo v Palmer]]|court=HCA|num=26|year=1995|parallelcite=(1995) 184 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 348 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Wainohu v New South Wales]]|court=HCA|num=24|year=2011|parallelcite=(2011) 243 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 181 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Affairs|Hindmarsh Island Bridge case]]'', it was held that this is subject to the compatibility of the conferred non-judicial function with judicial office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Affairs]] |court=HCA |num=18 |year=1996 |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation of powers in the States==

While there are strong textual and structural bases for the independence of the judiciary in the Commonwealth Constitution, the same is not true of the State constitutions. State courts, unlike their federal counterparts, are therefore capable of exercising non-judicial functions.{{r|Kable}} For example, the [[District Court of South Australia]], through its Administrative and Disciplinary Division, conducts merits review of administrative decisions, a function which at Commonwealth level can only be exercised by Executive tribunals.  Nevertheless, a degree of judicial independence is maintained at State level by convention.

The federal separation of powers also has implications for State courts, due to the fact that State courts may be invested with federal judicial power under section 71 of the ''Commonwealth Constitution''.  On this basis it was held in ''Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)'' that a State court could not be given a function inconsistent with its status as a potential repository of federal judicial power.{{r|Kable}} The doctrine was rarely applied in the early years following Kable, leading Justice Kirby to describe it as "a constitutional guard-dog that would bark but once."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Baker v R |year=2004 |court=HCA |num=45 |parallelcite=(2004) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 513 at [54] per Kirby J  |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a revival in the High Court's application of the doctrine since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Appleby, G |title=The High Court and Kable: A Study in Federalism and Rights Protection |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/2014/27.html}} (2015) 40 [[Monash University Law Review]] 673.&lt;/ref&gt; One recent case was ''[[South Australia v Totani]],''&lt;ref name="totani"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[South Australia v Totani]]|court=HCA|num=39|year=2010|parallelcite=(2010) 242 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which involved a challenge to the validity of the ''Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008'' (SA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|num_act|saoca200813o2008398|Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14(1) of the Act required members of the [[Magistrates' Court of South Australia]] to make control orders on application by the Commissioner of Police, provided only that the Magistrate was satisfied that the person subject to the control order was a member of a declared organisation.  Even though the functions of the Magistrates' Court under the Act are purely a matter of South Australian law, the fact that the Court is also capable of exercising federal jurisdiction was held to require that it maintain certain standards of independence and impartiality so that it retain the character of a court.

Parliamentary scrutiny of the executive and, in particular, by the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was tested in the 1990s when Treasurer [[Michael Egan (Australian politician)|Michael Egan]], on behalf of [[Executive Council of New South Wales|Cabinet]], refused to table documents in the Legislative Council of which he was a member. The Council, determined to exercise its scrutiny of the executive, pressed the issues and eventually adjudged the Treasurer in contempt, suspending him from the house twice. The matters were disputed in three cases in the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] and the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]]. The results upheld that principle that the Legislative Council does have the power to order the production of documents by a member of the House, including a minister, and can counter obstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Egan v Willis and Cahill|court=NSWCA|num=583|year=1996|parallelcite=(1996) 40 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 650 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Egan v Willis]]|court=HCA|num=71|year=1998|parallelcite=(1998) 95 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Egan v Chadwick|court=NSWCA|num=176|year=1999|parallelcite=(1999) 46 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 563 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent of the Legislative Council's power in relation to [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] documents remains unclear.

In 2018 the High Court held that all matters falling within [[Section 75 of the Constitution of Australia|section 75]],&lt;ref name="s75"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|75}} Original jurisdiction of High Court.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Section 76 of the Constitution of Australia|section 76]],&lt;ref name="s76"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|76}} Additional original jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitution formed part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, including a dispute between the residents of different States. It followed that the federal separation of powers meant that a State tribunal was unable to determine a dispute between residents of different States.&lt;ref name="Burns v Corbett"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2018|litigants=Burns v Corbett |parallelcite=}} {{citation |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2018/hca-15-2018-04-18.pdf |title=Judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation of powers in the Territories==

One of the bases for the separation of powers in the Constitution is that the powers of the Parliament are found in [[Chapter I of the Constitution of Australia|Chapter I]], executive powers are in [[Chapter II of the Constitution of Australia|Chapter II]] and judicial powers are in [[Chapter III Court|Chapter III]]. In 1915 it had been held that the separation of powers precluded the exercise of judicial power by the [[Inter-State Commission]], provided for at [[Section 101 of the Constitution of Australia|section 101]],&lt;ref name="s101"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|101}} Inter‑State Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; in Chapter IV Finance and Trade.&lt;ref name="Wheat Case"/&gt; The power to make laws for the government of the territories is found in [[Section 122 of the Constitution of Australia|section 122]],&lt;ref name="s122"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|122}} Government of territories.&lt;/ref&gt; located in Chapter VI New States. How section 122 relates to Chapter III is "a problem of interpretation ... which has vexed judges and commentators since the earliest days of Federation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|44|1999|litigants=Re The Governor, Goulburn Correctional Centre; Ex parte Eastman |parallelcite=(1999) 200 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 at p. 332 [9] |date=2 September 1999 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the six judges in the ''[[Kruger v Commonwealth|Stolen Generations case]]'',&lt;ref name="1997 HCA 27"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1997|litigants=[[Kruger v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1997) 190 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}} per Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ.&lt;/ref&gt; held that the separation of powers doctrine did not apply to the power to make laws for a territory under section 122 of the Constitution. The High Court went on to hold in 2004 that federal jurisdiction can be invested by the Australian Parliament in a Territory court as well as in a State court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|2004|litigants=North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service Inc v Bradley |parallelcite=(2004) 218 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 146 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the question was again considered by the High Court where Gageler J,&lt;ref name="2015 HCA 41"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|2015|litigants=North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency Limited v Northern Territory |parallelcite=(2015) 256 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 569 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at [118]}} and Keane J,&lt;ref name="2015 HCA 41"/&gt;{{rp|at [161]}} held that the power under section 122 was not constrained by the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in Chapter III of the Constitution. Keane J similarly held . The other members of the Court, French CJ, Kiefel and Bell JJ,&lt;ref name="2015 HCA 41"/&gt;{{rp|at [46]}} and Nettle and Gordon JJ,&lt;ref name="2015 HCA 41"/&gt;{{rp|at [194]}} found it was unnecessary to answer the question.

{{Taxation}}
'''Taxation in the British Virgin Islands''' is relatively simple by comparative standards; photocopies of all of the tax laws of the [[British Virgin Islands]] would together amount to about 200 pages of paper.&lt;ref&gt;Compared to, for example, the [[Internal Revenue Code|tax code of the United States]], which is approximately 70,000 pages.  {{cite web|url=http://politics.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/mary-kate-cary/2010/4/21/how-confusing-is-the-tax-code-even-the-irs-chief-gets-help.html|title=How Confusing is the Tax Code? Even the IRS Chief Gets Help|date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tax]]ation in the British Virgin Islands is mostly notable for what is ''not'' subject to taxation.  The British Virgin Islands has:
* no [[capital gains tax]],
* no [[gift tax]],
* no [[sales tax]] or [[value added tax]],
* no [[profit tax]],
* no [[inheritance tax]] or [[estate duty]], and
* no [[corporate tax|corporation tax]].

There is technically still [[income tax]] assessed in the British Virgin Islands for companies and individuals, but the rate of taxation has been set at zero.&lt;ref&gt;Income Tax Act (Cap 206); income tax was reduced to zero when the payroll tax was introduced.  Foreign earned income was previously taxed on a remittance basis.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, individuals are subject to a [[Taxation in the British Virgin Islands#Payroll tax|payroll deduction]] made of up to 8% for employees with 12% paid by employers, in relation to all salaries over US$10,000 per annum.

The absence of most major forms of taxation in the Territory has led to the country being included on most recognised lists of [[tax haven]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[Oecd#OECD List of Unco-operative Tax Havens|OECD list of uncooperative tax havens (2000)]], the [[Tax haven#Modern developments|Dorgan-Levin-Feingold bill]], and [http://www.internationalmonetaryfund.com/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm#table1 the official IMF list] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201811/http://www.internationalmonetaryfund.com/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm#table1 |date=27 September 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; although the jurisdiction prefers to style itself as a modern [[offshore financial centre]].

There are a number of forms of taxation and revenue collection in the British Virgin Islands, but the majority of the Government's revenues are obtained directly from annual licence fees for [[offshore company|offshore companies]] incorporated in the jurisdiction.

==Payroll tax==
In 2005 the British Virgin Islands introduced a [[payroll tax]] in relation to employment and "deemed employment"&lt;ref&gt;"Deemed employment" broadly encompasses (i), partners in a [[partnership]], (ii) [[board of directors|directors]] or (iii) [[stockholder|shareholders]] of a [[Company law|company]] who are actively involved in running the business and are not solely passive investors.&lt;/ref&gt; within the British Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Payroll Taxes Act 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was brought in at the same time as income tax in the Territory was reduced to zero.  The numbers were not in fact a perfect balance, and the Government (deliberately) reduced the amount of tax revenue it received by moving to the payroll tax system.

The tax is paid at a graduated rate depending upon the size of the employer.  The current rates (as at June 2007) are 10% for small employers&lt;ref&gt;A small employer (defined in the Act as a "class 1 employer" is one which has a payroll of less than US$150,000, a turnover of less than US$300,000 and fewer than 7 employees or "deemed employees" in total.&lt;/ref&gt; and 14% for larger employers.  8% of the total remuneration is deduction from the employee, the remainder of the liability is met by the employer.  The first US$10,000 of remuneration are free from payroll tax.

==Stamp duty==
Certain limited transactions in the British Virgin Islands are still subject to [[stamp duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Stamp Act (Cap 202)&lt;/ref&gt;  The main application of the stamp duty legislation relates to transfers of [[real estate]], or transfers of [[stock|shares]] in companies which own real estate.  The rate of stamp duty on such transactions varies according to the status of the transferee; if the transferee is a [[Belonger]], then stamp duty on land transfers is assessed at 4%; if the transferee is a Non-Belonger, it is assessed at 12%.

The legislation also includes a number of "rump" taxes that were imposed many years ago and subsist only due to a lack of attention in relation to updating legislation; the amounts involved are tiny, and are never enforced in practice.  For example, [[charterparty|charterparties]] are technically subject to stamp duty at a rate of 50¢ in the British Virgin Islands, but despite the flourishing [[bareboat charter]] industry stamp duty is rarely if ever paid by charterers.

Separately, the British Virgin Islands also imposes various documentary duties which are described as being distinct from stamp duty on various classes of instrument:
*Cheque duty is assessed at 10¢ on each [[negotiable instrument]] (including [[traveller's cheque]]s) presented for payment within the Territory.&lt;ref&gt;Cheque Duty Act (Cap 201)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Trust instrument]]s are assessed with trust duty of US$200 (unless they are [[charitable trust]]s or [[bare trust]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Trustee Act (Cap 303)&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for not referring to these documentary taxes as stamp duty was that under the old [[International Business Companies Act]] (Cap 291), companies incorporated under that Act were exempt from stamp duty, and so to retain the payment obligations for those companies, they were referred to as 'cheque duty' and 'trust duty' respectively.

==Land tax and house tax==
Real estate in the British Virgin Islands is subject to nominal taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Land and House Tax Act (Cap 207)&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the amounts payable are so small, it is not uncommon for householders to not pay the tax at all, and then discharge all back taxes and penalties when they come to sell their property.  The total tax on residential properties rarely exceeds US$100 per annum.  The tax costs more to collect than it raises. During the Territory's last review of taxation, considerations were made to amend the law to ''reduce'' the amount of taxation collection due to a perception that it penalised second home owners (but not to abolish the taxes).

As with stamp duty, land tax rates are considerably higher for foreigners than for Belongers.
*Belongers pay annually:
**US$10.00 for the first [[acre]], or part thereof, and
**US$3.00 for each subsequent acre, or part thereof.
*Non-Belongers pay annually:
**US$50 for the first half acre, or part thereof,
**US$150 for the second half acre, or part thereof, and
**US$50 for each subsequent half acre.

House tax is paid at the same rate for all persons, and is it assessed at 1.5% of the annual [[rental value]] of the house.  There is a general perception that rental values for owner-occupied homes tend to be assessed as being lower than their actual true market rental value.

==Customs duties==
[[Imports]] into the British Virgin Islands are, subject to certain limited exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Computer equipment being one notable one.&lt;/ref&gt; subject to [[import tariff|import duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Customs Duties Act (Cap 105)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this raises a modest amount of government revenue, it tends to be used as a political tool, and to prevent excessive competition with local retailers from the nearby [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].

==EU Withholding tax==
{{see also|European Union withholding tax}}
In common with most [[British Overseas Territories]], the British Virgin Islands had the EU [[withholding tax]] imposed upon it in relation to interest payments in the jurisdiction which are payable to [[natural person]]s who are resident within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Mutual Legal Assistance (Tax Matters) (Amendment) Act 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The withholding tax was not mandatory; depositors can elect not to pay it by agreeing to full disclosure of their account information to the revenue authorities in their country of residence.  The implication is that the withholding tax is only applied to those who are not properly declaring their income in their home countries.  However, payment of the withholding tax does not exempt the income from any applicable income taxes in the home jurisdiction; there is no [[double taxation]] relief under the relevant legislation.

The amounts raised by the EU withholding tax to date have been extremely modest.&lt;ref&gt;The amounts collected have never exceeded US$100,000 in total; it is not clear whether it actually costs more to collect and police the tax than it actually raises.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two likely reasons for this; firstly, for an Offshore Financial Centre, the British Virgin Islands has an underdeveloped banking infrastructure compared to (for example) the [[Cayman Islands]] or [[Jersey]] and so comparatively modest sums are deposited in the Territory's banks; secondly, the withholding tax only affects deposits held by natural persons - because most offshore tax structuring involves the use of either an [[offshore company]] or an [[offshore trust]], this usually takes it outside the scope of the tax.

The EU Withholding tax was abolished in favour of disclosure of information with effect from 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Mutual Legal Assistance (Tax Matters) (Automatic Exchange of Information) Order, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous other taxes==
The British Virgin Islands has a number of other minor taxes and levies.  These include:
* Car tax, under the Self-Drive vehicles (Rentals) (Taxation) Act (Cap 210)
* Hotel tax, under the Hotel Accommodation Taxation Act (Cap 205)
* Petroleum income tax, under the Petroleum Income Tax Act (Cap 209)
* Passenger tax, under the Passengers Tax Act (Cap 208)
* A tax is assessed on charterers, although it is characterised as a "permit" under the Cruising Permits Act (Cap 207)

In addition there are a huge number of miscellaneous Governmental fees and charges which are levied pursuant to the Statutory Rates, Fees and Charges Act, 2005.

[[File:Zonmar-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Schematic map of maritime zones (aerial view).]]

The term "territorial waters" is  sometimes used informally to refer to any area of water over which a state has [[jurisdiction]], including  [[internal waters]], the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the [[exclusive economic zone]] and potentially the [[continental shelf]].

== Baseline ==
{{main|Baseline (sea)}}

Normally, the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state.  This is either the low-water mark closest to the shore, or alternatively it may be an unlimited distance from permanently exposed land, provided that some portion of elevations exposed at low tide but covered at high tide (like mud flats) is within {{convert|12|nmi}} of permanently exposed land.  Straight baselines can alternatively be defined connecting fringing islands along a coast, across the mouths of rivers, or with certain restrictions across the mouths of bays.  In this case, a bay is defined as "a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation".  The baseline across the bay must also be no more than {{convert|24|nmi}} in length.

== Internal waters ==
[[File:Ph Territorial Map.png|thumb|300px|Internal and external territorial waters of the [[Philippines]] prior to the adoption of new baselines in 2009.]]
{{main|Internal waters}}

Waters landward of the baseline are defined as [[internal waters]], over which the state has complete sovereignty: not even innocent passage is allowed without explicit permission from said state. Lakes and rivers are considered internal waters. All "archipelagic waters" within the outermost islands of an [[archipelagic state]] such as [[Indonesia]] or the [[Philippines]] are also considered internal waters, and are treated the same with the exception that innocent passage through them must be allowed. However, archipelagic states may designate certain sea lanes through these waters.

== Territorial sea ==

'''Territorial sea''', as defined by the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm|title=UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a belt of [[coast]]al waters extending at most {{convert|12|nmi|1|lk=on}} from the [[baseline (sea)|baseline]] (usually the mean low-water mark) of a coastal state.  The territorial sea is regarded as the sovereign territory of the state, although foreign ships (military and civilian) are allowed [[innocent passage]] through it, or [[transit passage]] for [[strait]]s; this sovereignty also extends to the airspace over and seabed below. Adjustment of these boundaries is called, in international law, [[maritime delimitation]].

A state's territorial sea extends up to {{convert|12|nmi|1}} from its baseline.  If this would overlap with another state's territorial sea, the border is taken as the median point between the states' baselines, unless the states in question agree otherwise.  A state can also choose to claim a smaller territorial sea.

Conflicts have occurred whenever a coastal nation claims an entire gulf as its territorial waters while other nations only recognize the more restrictive definitions of the UN convention. Claims which draw baseline in excess of 24 nautical miles (two 12 nm limits) are judged excessive by the U.S.  Two conflicts occurred in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] where Libya drew a line in excess of 230 nm and claimed the entire enclosed gulf as its territorial waters. The U.S. exercised [[freedom of navigation]] rights twice, in the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|1981]] and [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)|1989]] Gulf of Sidra incidents.

In the U.S. federal system, individual states exercise ownership (subject to federal law) up to 3 nautical miles (9 nautical miles for Texas and Florida) from shore, while the federal government exercises sole territorial jurisdiction further out (see [[Tidelands]]).

== Contiguous zone ==

The '''contiguous zone''' is a band of water extending farther from the outer edge of the territorial sea to up to {{convert|24|nmi|1}} from the baseline, within which a state can exert limited control for the purpose of preventing or punishing "infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea".  This will typically be {{convert|12|nmi}} wide, but could be more (if a state has chosen to claim a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles), or less, if it would otherwise overlap another state's contiguous zone.  However, unlike the territorial sea, there is no standard rule for resolving such conflicts and the states in question must negotiate their own compromise.  The [[United States]] invoked a contiguous zone out to 24 nmi from the baseline on 29 September 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/CEQ/990902a.html|title=New Action to Protect &amp; Preserve U.S. Shores &amp; Oceans|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusive economic zone ==
{{main|Exclusive economic zone}}

An [[exclusive economic zone]] extends from the baseline to a maximum of {{convert|200|nmi|1}} , thus it includes the contiguous zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm|title=PREAMBLE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coastal nation has control of all economic resources within its exclusive economic zone, including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and any pollution of those resources. However, it cannot  prohibit passage or loitering above, on, or under the surface of the sea that is  in compliance  with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of the UN Convention, within that portion of its exclusive economic zone beyond its territorial sea. Before the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, coastal nations arbitrarily extended their territorial waters in an effort to control activities which are now regulated by the exclusive economic zone, such as offshore [[oil exploration]] or fishing rights (see [[Cod Wars]]). Indeed, the exclusive economic zone is still popularly, though erroneously, called a coastal nation's territorial waters.

==Continental shelf==

=== Definition ===

Article 76&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part6.htm|title=PREAMBLE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the legal definition of '''continental shelf''' of coastal countries. For the physical geography definition, see the [[continental shelf]] 

The continental shelf of a coastal nation extends out to the outer edge of the [[continental margin]] but at least {{convert|200|nmi}} from the baselines of the territorial sea if the continental margin does not stretch that far. Coastal states have the right of exploration and exploitation of the seabed and the natural resources that lie on or beneath it, however other states may lay cables and pipelines if they are authorised by the coastal state. The outer limit of a country's continental shelf shall not stretch beyond {{convert|350|nmi}} of the baseline, or beyond {{convert|100|nmi}} from the {{convert|2500|m}} [[isobath]], which is a line connecting the depths of the seabed at 2,500 meters.

The outer edge of the continental margin for the purposes of this article is defined as:
: *a series of lines joining points not more than {{convert|60|nmi}} apart where the thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1% of the height of the continental shelf above the foot of the continental slope; or
: *a series of lines joining points not more than 60 nautical miles apart that is not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental margin.
The foot of the continental slope is determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base.

The portion of the continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit is also known as the '''extended continental shelf'''. Countries wishing to delimit their outer continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles have to submit scientific information for the basis of their claim to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The Commission then validates or makes recommendations on the scientific basis for the extended continental shelf claim. The scientific judgement of the Commission shall be final and binding.  If validated extended continental shelf claims overlap any demarcation between two or more parties are decided by bilateral or multilateral negotiation, not by the Commission.

Countries have ten years after ratifying UNCLOS to lodge their submissions to extend their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, or by 13 May 2009 for countries where the convention was ratified before 13 May 1999. As of 1 June 2009, 51 submissions have been lodged with the Commission, of which eight have been deliberated by the Commission and have had recommendations issued. The eight are (in the order of date of submission): Russian Federation; Brazil; Australia; Ireland; New Zealand; the joint submission by France, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom; Norway and Mexico.

For full list, see [[#Extended continental shelf claims|below]]

=== Rights over the continental shelf ===

Articles 77 to 81 define the rights of a country over its continental shelf.

A coastal nation has control of all resources on or under its continental shelf, living or not, but no control over any living organisms above the shelf that are beyond its exclusive economic zone. This gives it the right to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and drilling works.

From the eighteenth century until the mid twentieth century, the territorial waters of the [[British Empire]], the [[United States]], [[France]] and many other nations were [[Three-mile limit|three nautical miles (5.6 km) wide]]. Originally, this was the length of a [[cannon]] shot, hence the portion of an ocean that a sovereign state could defend from shore. However, [[Iceland]] claimed two nautical miles (3.7&amp;nbsp;km), [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] claimed four nautical miles (7.4&amp;nbsp;km), and [[Spain]] claimed {{convert|6|nmi}} during this period. During incidents such as nuclear weapons testing and fisheries disputes some nations arbitrarily extended their maritime claims to as much as fifty or even two hundred nautical miles. Since the late 20th century the "12 mile limit" has become almost universally accepted. The [[United Kingdom]] extended its territorial waters from three to twelve nautical miles (22&amp;nbsp;km) in 1987.

During the [[League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930|League of Nations Codification Conference]] in 1930, the issue of establishing international legislation on territorial waters was raised, but no agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1949'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims by legislation to the adjacent continental shelf and fishing was first made by the United States government immediately following the [[Second World War]]. On September 28, 1945, US President [[Harry S. Truman]] issued two proclamations that established government control of natural resources in areas adjacent to the coastline. One of these proclamation was titled "Policy of the United States With Respect to the Natural Resources of the Subsoil and
Sea Bed of the Continental Shelf", and stipulated in its operative clause:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Government of the United States regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining to the United States, subject to its jurisdiction and control.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', September 30, 1945, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second proclamation was titled "Policy of the United States With Respect to Coastal Fisheries in Certain Areas of the High Seas", and stated in its operative clause:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Government of the United States regards it as proper to establish conservation zones in those areas of the high seas contiguous to the coasts of the United States wherein fishing activities have been or in the future may be developed and maintained on a substantial scale.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', September 30, 1945, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the US Presidential proclamation, the issue of legally determining territorial waters by international agreement was raised, and in its first session in 1949, the [[International Law Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] added the subject to its agenda.

The important issue of the breadth of territorial waters could not be resolved at either the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS I]] (1956-1958) or UNCLOS II (1960) conferences, with neither the two major contenders of a 3-mile or 12-mile limit reaching the required two-thirds support. This lack of agreement had the potential to lead to serious international disputes.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt; It was only at the UNCLOS III (1973-1982) conference, whose provisions did not come into force until 1994, that this issue was resolved at twelve nautical miles.

== Miscellaneous ==

[[Pirate radio]] broadcasting from artificial marine fixtures or anchored ships can be controlled by the affected coastal nation or other nations wherever that broadcast may originate, whether in the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf or even on the [[high seas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm|title=PREAMBLE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus a coastal nation has total control over its internal waters, slightly less control over territorial waters, and ostensibly even less control over waters within the contiguous zones. However, it has total control of economic resources within its exclusive economic zone as well as those on or under its continental shelf.

Throughout this article, distances measured in nautical miles are exact legal definitions, while those in kilometres are approximate conversions that are not stated in any law or treaty.

Federal nations, such as the United States, divide control over certain waters between the federal government and the individual states.  (See [[tidelands]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">The '''Treaty of Reichenbach''' was signed on July 27, 1790 in Reichenbach (present-day [[Dzierżoniów]]) between [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] under [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]]. The two countries tried to settle their differences, specifically Leopold attempted to be conciliatory toward Prussia, as Austria and Russia had recently made gains against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Terms==
Based on the terms of the treaty, Austria agreed to restore all conquered territories to the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, Austria agreed to grant the [[Belgians]] both amnesty and their old constitution. The Prussian statesman, [[Ewald Friedrich, Count von Hertzberg|Count Ewald Friedrich of Hertzberg]], managed to insert a clause whereby Austria would be able to make small acquisitions of Ottoman territory. However, Austria must first receive permission from the [[Sublime Porte]] and must also allow Prussia to acquire an equivalent amount of Ottoman territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 466. ''By the treaty of Reichenbach (27 July, 1790) Austria engaged to restore all her conquests to Turkey and to grant an amnesty and their old constitution to the Belgians. Hertzberg, who was completely disconcerted at the turn which affairs had taken, could only secure the insertion of a clause by which, if Austria did make any small acquisition of Turkish territory, it should be with the free will of the Porte, and Prussia was to get an equivalent.''&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Austria had to relinquish its conquered territories to the Ottoman Empire, it was allowed to retain its garrison in [[Chotín|Chotin]]. Moreover, the accord guaranteed protection of the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] frontier. In return for these concessions, Prussia made herself responsible for several stipulated compensations. In another aspect of the treaty, Austria was not allowed to overtly or covertly support Russia in its campaigns against the Sublime Porte.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 497. "The ''status quo'' was accordingly accepted. Austria engaged herself to return to the Sublime Porte all acquisitions derived from the late war; only Chotin for the time being was to remain garrisoned, and the Bosnian frontier was to be protected. Prussia, in return, made herself responsible for several stipulated compensations. In a declaration commenting upon the arrangement, the expectation was expressed that during the continuance of the Russo-Austrian war Austria would hold herself aloof from any interference, and would refrain from giving direct or indirect assistance to Russia against the Porte. As to Belgian affairs, she declared that in the direction of subjugation as well as constitution she would be willing to throw her lot with the maritime powers."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Due to Leopold's diplomatic skill and sense of moderation, Austria attained a diplomatic victory through the treaty. In other words, the Treaty of Reichenbach helped to strengthen the level of respect Leopold received from foreign powers. Moreover, the accord helped Austria to focus on establishing peace within its own territories. Prussia, on the other hand, was forced to abandon its plans for expansion, as well as any attempts to acquire strategic benefits from Austria's losses.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 497. "This Treaty of Reichenbach, signed July 27, 1790, is a great and most diplomatic victory for Austria, which is due to Leopold's skill and moderation. With one stroke the situation was adjusted, the respect for Leopold among foreign powers strengthened, action in relation to the Netherlands and Hungary freed from all outside restraints, and the way was cleared for concentrating all Austria's strength on establishing conditions of peace throughout the country itself. That, moreover, Prussia was compelled to withdraw from her wide-reaching plans, and obliged to give up the idea of turning Austria's embarrassment to her own profit, was a very decided advantage, obvious to all observers."&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty of Reichenbach is seen by historians as a significant marker representing a Prussian retreat from the policies of [[Frederick the Great]], as well as the beginning of Prussia's decline&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 466. ''The treaty of Reichenbach, as competent observers saw at the time, marks the first retreat from the policy of Frederick the Great and the first step in the decline of Prussia.''&lt;/ref&gt; that found its nadir at the [[Battle of Jena]].

'''Victim blaming''' occurs when the victim of a [[crime]] or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Victim Blaming|url = http://crcvc.ca/docs/victim_blaming.pdf|website = Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate = 2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[victimology]] seeks to mitigate the perception of victims as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0886260511403752 |title=Is Knowledge Power?

L. |journal=[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] |volume=26 |pages=3407–3427}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a greater tendency to blame victims of [[rape]] than victims of [[robbery]] if victims and perpetrators know each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1785–97 |doi=10.1177/0886260510372945 |title=Blaming the Victim and Exonerating the Perpetrator in Cases of Rape and Robbery: Is There a Double Standard? |year=2010 |last1=Bieneck |first1=S. |last2=Krahe |first2=B. |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=26 |issue=9 |pmid=20587449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coining of the phrase==
Psychologist [[William Ryan (psychologist)|William Ryan]] coined the phrase "blaming the victim" in his 1971 book of that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9780394417264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole07"&gt;Cole (2007) pp.111, 149, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dows98p24"&gt;Downs (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"&gt;Kirkpatrick (1987) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent03"&gt;Kent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Ryan described victim blaming as an [[ideology]] used to justify [[racism]] and [[social injustice]] against [[African American|black people]] [[Racism in the United States|in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"/&gt; Ryan wrote the book to refute [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]'s 1965 work ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action'' (usually simply referred to as the [[Moynihan Report]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackpast.org/primary/moynihan-report-1965 The Moynihan Report (1965)]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318203932/http://www.blackpast.org/primary/moynihan-report-1965 |date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan had concluded that three centuries of oppression of black people, and in particular with what he calls the uniquely cruel structure of [[American slavery]] as opposed to its Latin American counterparts, had created a long series of chaotic disruptions within the black family structure which, at the time of the report, manifested itself in high rates of unwed births, absent fathers, and [[single mother household]]s in black families. Moynihan then correlated these familial outcomes, which he considered undesirable, to the relatively poorer rates of employment, educational achievement, and financial success found among the black population.  Moynihan advocated the implementation of government programs designed to strengthen the black [[nuclear family]].{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}

Ryan objected that Moynihan then located the [[proximate cause]] of the plight of black Americans in the prevalence of a family structure in which the father was often sporadically, if at all, present, and the mother was often dependent on government aid to feed, clothe, and provide medical care for her children. Ryan's critique cast the Moynihan theories as attempts to divert responsibility for poverty from [[Social class in the United States|social structural]] factors to the behaviors and cultural patterns of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilt.ilstu.edu/gmklass/pos334/archive/ryan.htm Illinois state U. archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904104748/http://lilt.ilstu.edu/gmklass/pos334/archive/ryan.htm |date=4 September 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, William |title=Blaming the Victim |publisher=Vintage |year=1976 |isbn=0-394-72226-4 }}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although Ryan popularized the phrase, other scholars had identified the phenomenon of victim blaming.&lt;ref name="Robinson02p141"&gt;Robinson (2002) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1947 [[Theodor W. Adorno]] defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the [[Fascism|Fascist]] character".&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' Vol.ix (1), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
James Martin Harding (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OT8yfsEUcw8C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Adorno and "A writing of the ruins": essays on modern aesthetics and Anglo-American literature and culture''], p.143 quotation: "The mechanisms of this ideological affinity between Baraka and Wagner can be seen in a short critique of Wagner that Adorno wrote directly after the Second World War—at a time when Adorno was perhaps his most direct in singling out the proto-fascist tendencies in Wagner's corpus and character. Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him. This, for Adorno, is a classic example of blaming the victim. The anti-Semitic sub-text to the dismissal, viz., that as a Jew Levi supposedly desired and brought the dismissal upon himself, "bears witness to the existence of one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character even in Wagner's time: the paranoid tendency of projecting upon others one's own violent aggressiveness and then indicting, on the basis of this projection, those whom one endows with pernicious qualities" (Adorno "Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler" 158)."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter Adorno and three other professors at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] formulated their influential and highly debated ''[[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]'' (F for fascist), published in ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950), which included among the [[fascist]] traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA63 Adorno and the political] By Espen Hammer p.63&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical expression of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicky Ali Jackson|title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcDBZ0uNNVIC&amp;pg=PA715|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=22 February 2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-94221-5|pages=715–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary victimization of sexual assault victims==
[[File:Marcha das Vadias.jpg|thumb|Hundreds gathered at the Alberta Legislature grounds in [[Edmonton]] to protest against victim blaming]]
{{See also|Slut shaming}}
Secondary victimization is the re-[[Psychological trauma|traumatization]] of the [[sexual assault]], abuse, or rape victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming, disbelieving the victim's story, minimizing the severity of the attack, and [[medical ethics|inappropriate]] post-assault treatment by medical personnel or other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of [[Drug facilitated sexual assault|drug-facilitated]], [[date rape|acquaintance]], [[military sexual trauma]] and [[statutory rape]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Sexual assault]] victims experience stigmatization based on [[rape myth]]s.{{cn|date=February 2018}} A female rape victim is especially [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] in [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cultures with strong customs and [[taboo]]s regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a society may view a female rape victim (especially one who was previously a [[virgin]]) as "damaged". Victims in these cultures may suffer [[silent treatment|isolation]], physical and psychological [[Psychological abuse|abuse]], [[slut-shaming]], public humiliation rituals, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svfreenyc.org/survivors_factsheet_49.html#6 |title=Factsheets: Trauma of Victimization – Secondary Injuries |publisher=Svfreenyc.org |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in many developed countries, including some sectors of United States society, [[misogyny]] remains culturally ingrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Power in Structured Misogyny: Implications for the Politics... : Advances in Nursing Science|url = http://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Abstract/1980/02030/Power_in_Structured_Misogyny__Implications_for_the.3.aspx|website = LWW|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Male Hegemony through Education: Construction of Gendered Identities|url = http://hipatiapress.info/hpjournals/index.php/generos/article/view/316|website = hipatiapress.info|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YlWcBQAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2014-12-03|isbn = 9781317675440|first = Sheila|last = Jeffreys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a [[sexism|sexist]] allegation against female victims of sexual assault is that ''wearing [[Provocation (legal)|provocative]] clothing stimulates [[sexual assault|sexual aggression]] in men'' who believe that women wearing body-revealing clothes are ''actively trying to [[seduction|seduce]]'' a sexual partner. Such accusations against victims stem from the assumption that sexually revealing clothing conveys [[consent]] for sexual actions, irrespective of willful verbal [[consent]].  Research has yet to prove that attire is a significant causal factor in determining who is assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moor|first=Abigail|title=She Dresses to Attract, He Perceives Seduction: A Gender Gap in Attribution of Intent to Women's Revealing Style of Dress and its Relation to Blaming the Victims of Sexual Violence|journal=[[Journal of International Women's Studies]]|date=2010|volume=11|issue=4|pages=115–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beiner 2007 125–152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beiner|first=Theresa|title=Sexy Dressing Revisited: Does Target Dress Play a Part in Sexual Harassment Cases?|journal=[[Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy]]| date=2007| volume=14| pages=125–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming is also exemplified when a victim of sexual assault is found at fault for ''performing actions which reduce their ability to resist or refuse consent'', such as consuming alcohol.&lt;ref name="Don't blame women's drinking for rape"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=Matthew|title=Don't blame women's drinking for rape|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/06/opinion/whitaker-women-drinking-rape/|website=CNN Opinion|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victim advocacy groups and medical professionals are educating young adults on the definition of consent, and the importance of refraining from victim blaming.  Most institutions have adopted the concept of [[Consent#Affirmative consent|affirmative consent]] and that refraining from sexual activity while under the influence is the safest choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Myths and Facts About Sexual Assault and Consent|url = https://www.stsm.org/myths-and-facts-about-sexual-assault-and-consent|website = Sexual Trauma Services of the Midlands|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to discredit alleged sexual assault victims in court, a defense attorney may ''delve into an accuser's personal history'', a common practice that also has the purposeful effect of making the victim so uncomfortable they choose not to proceed. This attack on character, especially one pointing out promiscuity, makes the argument that women who lead "high risk" lifestyles (promiscuity, drug use) are not real victims of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Randall|first1=M.|title=Sexual Assault Law, Credibility, and "Ideal Victims": Consent, Resistance, and Victim Blaming|journal=Canadian Journal of Women and the Law|date=2010|volume=2|issue=22|page=397&lt;!--|pages=434--&gt;|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/409075/pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings on Rape Myth Acceptance have supported feminist claims that [[sexism]] is at the root of female rape victim blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stop Blaming the Victim: A Meta-Analysis on Rape Myths|url = http://m.jiv.sagepub.com/content/25/11/2010.short|journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence|pages = 2010–2035|volume = 25|issue = 11|doi = 10.1177/0886260509354503|first = E.|last = Suarez|first2 = T.

A 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence of male victims of sexual assault concludes that male rape victim blaming is usually done so because of [[social constructs]] of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Rape Victim and Perpetrator Blaming|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/25/6/969.abstract|website=Sage Journal of Interpersonal Violence|publisher=Sage Journal Publications|quote=A man who fails to physically overcome his attacker is likewise seen as contributing to his own victimization; he must have secretly wanted it.|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some effects of these kind of rape cases include a loss of masculinity, confusion about their sexual orientation, and a sense of failure in behaving as men should.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sexual Preference, Gender, and Blame Attributions in Adolescent Sexual Assault|last = Davies|first = Michelle|date = 2011|journal =[[Journal of Social Psychology]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Austen|first2 = Kerry|issue = 151.5|last3 = Rogers|first3 = Paul|pages = 592–607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of an unwanted sexual encounter usually develop psychological problems such as depression or sexual violence specific [[PTSD]] known as [[rape trauma syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual Preference, Gender, and Blame Attributions in Adolescent Sexual Assault|last = Davies|first = Michelle|date = 2011|journal = Journal of Social Psychology|last2 = Austen|first2 = Kerry|issue = 151.5|pages = 592–607|last3 = Rogers|first3 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eLSfxOiTsTkC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9781593850616|language = en|first = B.

===Ideal victim===

An ideal victim is one who is afforded the status of victimhood due to unavoidable circumstances that put the individual at a disadvantage. One can apply this theory to any crime including and especially sexual assault. Nils Christie, a Norwegian criminology professor, has been theorizing about the concept of the ideal victim since the 1980s. In his research he gives two examples, one of an old woman who is attacked on her way home from visiting her family and the other of a man who is attacked at a bar by someone he knew. He describes the old woman as an ideal victim because she could not avoid being in the location that she was, she did not know her attacker, and she could not fight off her attacker. The man, however, could have avoided being at a bar, knew his attacker, and should have been able to fight off his attacker, being younger and a man.&lt;ref name="Christie 1986 17–30"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Nils|title=The Ideal Victim|publisher=Macmillian Press|date=1986|location=London|pages=17–30|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When applying the ideal victim theory to sexual assault victims, often judicial proceedings define an ideal victim as one who resists their attacker and exercises caution in risky situations, despite law reforms to extinguish these fallacious requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gotell|first=Lise|title=Rethinking Affirmative Consent in Canadian Sexual Assault Law: Neoliberal Sexual Subjects and Risky Women|journal=Akron Law Review|volume=41|issue=4|pages=865–898|publisher=Akron University Press|location=Akron|date=2008|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com.echo.louisville.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/?shr=t&amp;csi=156180&amp;sr=TITLE(Rethinking+Affirmative+Consent+in+Canadian+Sexual+Assault+Law%3A+Neoliberal+Sexual+Subjects+and+Risky+Women)+and+DATE+IS+2008+and+AUTHOR(gotell)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When victims are not ideal they are at risk for being blamed for their attack because they are not considered real victims of rape. Because they do not fit the criteria being laid out in the rape law, they cannot be considered real victims and thereby their attacker will not be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stringer|first=Rebecca|title=Vulnerability after Wounding: Feminism, Rape Law, and the Differend|journal=SubStance|volume=42|issue=132|pages=148–168|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A victim who is not considered an ideal, or real victim, is one who leads a "high risk" lifestyle, partaking in drugs or alcohol, or is perceived as promiscuous. A victim who intimately knows their attacker is also not considered an ideal victim. Examples of a sexual assault victim who is not ideal is a prostitute because they lead a high risk lifestyle. The perception is that these behaviors discount the credibility of a sexual assault victim's claim or that the behaviors and associations create the mistaken assumption of consent. Some of or all of the blame of the assault is then placed on these victims, and so they are not worthy of having their case presented in court. These perceptions persist in court rulings despite a shift in laws favoring affirmative consent- meaning that the participants in a sexual activity give a verbal affirmation rather than one participant who neither answers negatively nor positively. In other words, affirmative consent is yes means yes and no means no.&lt;ref name="Randall 2010 397–434"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Melanie|title= Sexual Assault Law, Credibility, and "Ideal Victims": Consent, Resistance, and Victim Blaming|journal=Canadian Journal of Women and the Law|volume=22|pages=397–434|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|date=2010|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/409075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to an ideal victim, there must be an ideal perpetrator for a crime to be considered ideal. The ideal attacker does not know their victim and is a completely non-sympathetic figure- one who is considered sub-human, an individual lacking morals. An attacker that knows their victim is not considered an ideal attacker, nor is someone who seems morally ordinary.&lt;ref name="Christie 1986 17–30"/&gt; Cases of intimate partner violence are not considered ideal because the victim knows their attacker. Husbands and wives are not ideal victims or perpetrators because they are intimately familiar with each other.&lt;ref name="Randall 2010 397–434"/&gt;

== Global situation ==
Many different cultures across the globe have formulated different degrees of victim blaming for different scenarios such as rape, hate crimes, and domestic abuse. Victim blaming is common around the world, especially in cultures where it is socially acceptable and advised to treat certain groups of people as lesser. For example, in Somalia victims of sexual abuse consistently endure social [[Ostracism|ostracization]] and harassment.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} One specific example is the kidnapping and rape of 14-year old Fatima: when the police arrived, both Fatima and her rapist were arrested. While they did not detain the offender for long, the officers held Fatima captive for a month and a prison guard continually raped her during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rape victims are still being blamed for sexual violence in Somalia|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/rape-victims-still-blamed-for-sexual-violence-in-somalia-10229605.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-12-09|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the organisations [[International Alert]] and [[UNICEF]] published a study revealing that girls and women released from captivity by [[Nigeria]]'s insurgency group [[Boko Haram]] often face rejection by their communities and families. Their children born of sexual violence faced even more discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/16/women-freed-boko-haram-rejected-for-bringing-bad-blood-back-home-nigeria |title=Women freed from Boko Haram rejected for bringing 'bad blood' back home |publisher=The Guardian |author=Liz Ford |date=16 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acid attacks on South Asian women, when people throw acid on women in an attempt to punish them for their perceived wrongdoings, are another example of victim-blaming. For instance, in New Delhi in 2005, a group of men threw acid on a 16-year-old girl because they believed she provoked the advances of a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asfi.in/webpage.php?title=The+challengers&amp;p_type=1&amp;parent=96&amp;catid=97|title = Laxmi's Story |accessdate=26 September 2016 |website = Acid Survivors Foundation India|publisher = Acid Survivors Foundation India|last = Laxmi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese culture, victim blaming is often associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force. Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the women’s fault and her virtue is inevitably called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

&lt;!--this bit is non-sequitur and makes more sense in the previous section--&gt;
In western culture victim blaming has been largely recognized as a problematic way to view a situation, however this does not exempt westerners from being guilty of the action. A recent example of western victim blaming would be a civil trial held in 2013 where the Los Angeles School District blamed a 14-year-old girl for the sexual abuse she endured from her middle school teacher. The District's lawyer argued that the minor was responsible for the prevention of the abuse, putting the entire fault on the victim and exempting the perpetrator of any responsibility. Despite his efforts to convince the court that the victim must be blamed, the ruling stated that no minor student that has been sexually assaulted by his or her teacher is responsible for the prevention of that sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = JUDGE: School district 'wrong' to blame student for having sex with teacher EAGnews.org|url = http://eagnews.org/judge-school-district-wrong-to-blame-student-for-sex-with-teacher/|website = eagnews.org |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing views==
[[Roy Baumeister]], a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim's possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of "the myth of pure evil," the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident shouldn't be immediately taken as objective truths.

In context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the "victim" than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their "moral complexity". This usually stems from an "excessive sensitivity" to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999|publisher=Holt|isbn=0-8050-7165-2}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horseshoe theory and nonpolarized views==
Some scholars make the argument that some of the attitudes that are described as victim blaming and the victimologies that are said to counteract them are both extreme and similar to each other, an example of the [[horseshoe theory]]. For instance, they argue that the claim that "women wearing provocative clothing cause rape" is as demeaning to men as it is to women as depicting men as incapable of controlling their sexual desire is misandrist and denies men full agency, while also arguing that the generalization that women do not lie about rape (or any generalization about women not doing some things because of their gender) is misogynist by its implicit assumption that women act by simple default action modes which is incompatible with full agency. These scholars argue that it is important to impartially assess the evidence in each criminal trial individually and that any generalization based on statistics would change the situation from one where the control of evidence makes false reporting difficult to one where lack of individual control of the alleged crime makes it easier to file false reports and that statistics collected in the former situation would not be possible to apply to the latter situation. While the scholars make a distinction between actual victim blaming and [[rule by law]] that they consider to be falsely lumped with victim blaming in radical feminist rhetorics, they also advocate more protection from ad hominem questions to alleged victims about past life history and that the questions should focus on what is relevant for the specific alleged crime. They also cite examples that they consider to be cases of the horseshoe theory applied to the question of victim blaming. This includes cases in which psychologists who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in trials in which breast size have been used as a measure of female age when classifying pornographic cartoons as child pornography and been praised praised by feminists for it, and later the same psychologists have used the same psychological arguments when testifying on behalf of the defense in statutory rape cases and getting the defendant acquitted by claiming that the victim's breasts looked like those of an adult woman (considered by these scholars to be victim blaming based on appearance) and been praised by men's rights groups for it. It also includes the possibility that biopsychiatric models that consider sexual criminality hereditary and that are advocated by some feminists may blame victims of incest abuse for being genetically related to their abusers and thereby dissuading them from reporting abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline B. Helfgott - 2008 - Criminal Behavior: Theories, Typologies and Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Gavrielides - 2017 - Restorative justice: Ideals and realities &lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts of victim blaming discourse who neither support most of the phenomena that are described as victim blaming nor most of the measures that are marketed as countermeasures against such point at the existence of other ways of discovering and punishing crimes with victims besides the victim reporting the crime. Not only are there police patrols and possible eyewitnesses, but these analysts also argue that neighbors can overhear and report crimes that take place within the house such as [[domestic violence]]. For that reason along with the possibility of many witnesses turning up over time if the crime is ongoing long term as domestic abuse is generally said to be which would make some of the witnesses likely to be considered believable, analysts of this camp of thought argue that the main problem that prevent crimes from being successfully prosecuted is offender profiling that disbelieve the capacity and/or probability of many criminals to commit the crime, rather than disbelief or blaming of victim reports. These analysts cite international comparisons that show that the percentage of male on female cases in the statistics of successfully prosecuted domestic violence is not higher in countries that apply gender feminist theories about patriarchal structures than in countries that apply supposedly antifeminist evolutionary psychology profiling of sex differences in aggressiveness, impulse control and empathy, arguing that the criminal justice system prioritizing cases in which they believe the suspect most likely to be guilty makes evolutionary psychology at least as responsible as gender feminism for leaving domestic violence cases with female offenders undiscovered no matter if the victim is male or female. The analysts argue that many problems that are often attributed to victim blaming are instead due to offender profiling, and suggest randomized investigations instead of psychological profiling of suspected offenders.&lt;ref&gt;PJ Brantingham, PL Brantingham - 2017 - Notes on the geometry of crime&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DJ Ward - 2015 - A Hopeful Rubicon: The Logic within Criminal Profiling&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Murder of Leigh Leigh|Leigh Leigh]], born Leigh Rennea Mears, was a 14-year-old girl from [[Fern Bay]], Australia, who was murdered on November 3, 1989. While attending a 16-year-old boy's birthday party at [[Stockton Beach]], Leigh was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non-consensual. After being kicked and spat on by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull. Leigh's murder received considerable attention in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more on the lack of parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of victim blaming.&lt;ref name=carrington&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrington |first=Kerry |date=24 July 1998 |title=Who Killed Leigh Leigh?

In a case that attracted worldwide coverage, when [[2012 Delhi gang rape|a woman was raped and killed in Delhi]] in December 2012, some Indian government officials and political leaders blamed the victim for various things, mostly based on conjecture. Many of the people involved later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/01/04/amid-rape-fiasco-indias-leaders-keep-up-insensitive-remarks/ |author= |title=Amid rape fiasco, India's leaders keep up insensitive remarks |publisher=Washington Post |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the issue of victim blaming has gained notoriety and become widely recognized in the media, particularly in the context of feminism, as women have often been blamed for behaving in ways that encourage harassment. 

In 2016, in the wake of [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]], the [[mayor of Cologne]] [[Henriette Reker]] came under heavy criticism, as her response appeared to blame the victims. She called for women to follow a "[[code of conduct]]," including staying at an "arm's length" from strangers.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor of Cologne says women should have code of conduct to prevent future assault |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mayor-of-cologne-says-women-should-have-code-of-conduct-to-prevent-future-assault-a6798186.html |access-date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the evening of January 5, ''#einearmlänge'' ("an arm's length") became one of Germany's top-trending hashtags on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=DW2&gt;{{cite news |title=Twitter storm as Cologne mayor suggests women stay at 'arm's length' from strangers |url=http://www.dw.com/en/twitter-storm-as-cologne-mayor-suggests-women-stay-at-arms-length-from-strangers/a-18962430 |access-date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reker called a crisis meeting with the police in response to the incidents.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm|publisher=''BBC News''|title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy'|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news |title=A 'new dimension' of sexual assault in Cologne| url=http://www.dw.com/en/a-new-dimension-of-sexual-assault-in-cologne/a-18959299 |access-date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reker called it "completely improper" to link the perpetrators to refugees.&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news|title=Cologne sex attacks: Merkel disgust at New Year gang assaults|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35237173|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coverage of the 2016 [[Murder of Ashley Ann Olsen]], an American murdered in Italy during a sexual encounter with a Senegalese immigrant, focused on the victim blaming in cross-cultural encounters.&lt;ref name="GrisafiGoodVictim"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grisafi|first1=Patricia|title=The myth of the good victim: As an American facing street harassment abroad, I wondered what it meant to be a "good victim"|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/03/25/the_myth_of_the_good_victim_as_an_american_facing_street_harassment_abroad_i_wondered_what_it_meant_to_be_a_good_victim/|accessdate=8 January 2017|publisher=Salon.com|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NadeauvictimBlamed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nadeau|first1=Barbie Latza|title=Ashley Olsen Didn't Deserve to Die, No Matter How Hard She Partied|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1779933235/DF1DAFF84CDC4DD4PQ/6?accountid=10226|accessdate=9 January 2017|publisher=Daily Beast|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the hashtag #AintNoCinderella took over the media in response to a national instance of victim-blaming occurring in India. After Varnika Kundu was stalked and harassed by two men on her way home late at night, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party|BJP]] Vice President Ramveer Bhatti addressed the viral story with a claim that Kundu was somehow at fault for being out late by herself. He essentially blamed the a woman for an incident of which she was merely a victim; and social media users took to Twitter and Instagram to challenge this idea that women should not be out late at night, and if they do, they are somehow "asking for it". Hundreds of women shared photos of themselves staying out past midnight, dressing boldly, and behaving in (harmless) ways that tend to be condemned in old-fashioned, anti-feminist ideology in order to make the statement: ''I am not a child. I am not someone's property. I am not a [[Cinderella|seventeeth-century fantastical damsel in distress]]. I am a woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, Geeta. "#AintNoCinderella: Why Indian women are posting midnight photos." BBC, Delhi. https://www.bbc.com/news/40872788&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volcker Rule''' refers to [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/html/PLAW-111publ203.htm § 619]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/volckerrule.htm |title=Notice Regarding Volcker Rule |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228204520/http://sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/volckerrule.htm |archivedate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|12|1851}}). The rule was originally proposed by American economist and former United States [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]] to restrict United States banks from making certain kinds of [[speculation|speculative]] investments that do not benefit their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/21/AR2010012104935.html |title= Obama's 'Volcker Rule' shifts power away from Geithner|author=David Cho, and Binyamin Appelbaum |date=22 January 2010|work= |publisher= [[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcker argued that such speculative activity played a key role in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. The rule is often referred to as a ban on [[proprietary trading]] by commercial banks, whereby deposits are used to trade on the bank's own accounts, although a number of exceptions to this ban were included in the Dodd-Frank law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/04/prop-trading-and-volcker-rule|accessdate=2011-09-28|title=Prop Trading and the Volcker Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Floyd Norris]] |coauthors= |title=Bank Rules That Serve Two Masters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/business/new-dodd-frank-rules-muddled-by-congress-that-wants-it-both-ways.html?_r=1&amp;src=recg |quote=The Volcker Rule, as enacted, 'generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading,' as the regulators stated in their opus this week.

==Background==
Volcker was appointed by [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] as the chair of the [[President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board]] on February 6, 2009. President Obama created the board to advise the Obama Administration on economic recovery matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/perab/about|accessdate=2010-09-14|title=About the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcker argued vigorously that since a functioning commercial banking system is essential to the stability of the entire financial system, for banks to engage in high-risk speculation created an unacceptable level of systemic risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/opinion/31volcker.html?pagewanted=all |title= How to Reform Our Financial System|author=Paul Volcker |date=January 30, 2010 |work= |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that the vast increase in the use of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], designed to mitigate risk in the system, had produced exactly the opposite effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/financial-reform-unfinished-business/ |title= Financial Reform: Unfinished Business|author=Paul Volcker |date=October 27, 2011 |work= |publisher= [[New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal==
The Volcker Rule was first publicly endorsed by President Obama on January 21, 2010.&lt;ref name="Reuters-1"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61L3UL20100224 | date=2010-02-23 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | title=White House Recommits to "Volcker Rule" Bank Trade Ban | work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=515 Obama takes on Wall Street?]'', January 22, 2010, [[The Real News]]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was to specifically prohibit a bank or institution that owns a bank from engaging in [[proprietary trading]], and from owning or investing in a [[hedge fund]] or [[private equity fund]], and also to limit the liabilities that the largest banks could hold.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse-1"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-calls-new-restrictions-size-and-scope-financial-institutions-rein-e|accessdate=2010-02-27|title=President Obama Calls for New Restrictions on Size and Scope of Financial Institutions to Rein in Excesses and Protect Taxpayers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220232336/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-calls-new-restrictions-size-and-scope-financial-institutions-rein-e|archive-date=2010-02-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also under discussion was the possibility of placing restrictions on the way market-making activities are compensated; traders would be paid on the basis of the spread of transactions rather than any profit that the trader made for the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-26/trader-pay-may-face-restrictions-under-dodd-frank-s-volcker-rule.html |accessdate=2011-09-28 |title=Trader Pay May Face Restrictions Under Volcker Rules Mandated by Dodd-Frank | publisher=Bloomberg.com |first1=Cheyenne |last1=Hopkins |first2=Phil |last2=Mattingly |date=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2010, under the same initiative, President Obama announced his intention to end the mentality of "[[Too big to fail]]".&lt;ref name="Whitehouse-1"/&gt;

In a February 22, 2010 letter to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', five former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretaries of the Treasury]] endorsed the Volcker Rule proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-21/former-u-s-treasury-secretaries-endorse-volcker-rule-in-wsj.html|accessdate=2010-02-22 | title=Former U.S. Treasury Secretaries Endorse Volcker Rule | work= [[WSJ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of February 23, 2010, the U.S. Congress began to consider a weaker bill allowing federal regulators to restrict proprietary trading and hedge fund ownership by banks, but not prohibiting these activities altogether.&lt;ref name="Reuters-1" /&gt;

Senators [[Jeff Merkley]], Democrat of Oregon, and [[Carl Levin]], Democrat of Michigan, introduced the main piece of the Volcker Rule – its limitations on proprietary trading – as an amendment to the broader [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation]] that was passed by the [[United States Senate]] on May 20, 2010. Despite having wide support in the Senate, the amendment was never given a vote. When the Merkley-Levin Amendment was first brought to the floor, Senator [[Richard Shelby]], Republican of Alabama, objected to a motion to vote on the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/18/gop-blocks-two-key-anti-w_n_580747.html|accessdate=2010-05-21 | title=GOP Blocks Three Key Anti-Wall Street Amendments | work=Huffington Post |first=Ryan |last=Grim |date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkley and Levin responded by attaching the amendment to another amendment to the bill put forth by Senator [[Sam Brownback]], Republican of Kansas. Shortly before it was due to be voted upon, Brownback withdrew his own amendment, thus killing the Merkley-Levin amendment and the Volcker Rule as part of the Senate bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/business/21regulate.html?adxnnl=1&amp;hpw=&amp;adxnnlx=1274468424-GxWfvYMJmc8KDay0IN32jQ|accessdate=2010-05-21 | title=Bill Passed in Senate Broadly Expands Oversight of Wall St. | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | date=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite that vote, the proposal made it into the final legislation when the House–Senate conference committee passed a strengthened version of the rule that included the language prepared by Senators Merkley and Levin. The original Merkley-Levin amendment and the final legislation both covered more types of proprietary trading than the original rule proposed by the administration. It also banned conflict of interest trading. Senator Levin commented on the importance of that aspect: "We are also pleased that the conference report includes strong language to prevent the obscene conflicts of interest revealed in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing with [[Goldman Sachs]]. This is an important victory for fairness for investors such as pension funds and for the integrity of the financial system. As the Goldman Sachs investigation showed, business as usual on [[Wall Street]] has for too long allowed banks to create instruments which are based on junky assets, then sell them to clients, and bet against their own clients by betting on their failure. The measure approved by the conferees ends that type of conflict which Wall Street has engaged in."&lt;ref&gt;[http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=325947 Merkley, Levin: Ban on High Risk Trades Victory for Workers and Businesses], Press release, [[Carl Levin]], US Senate.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, conferees changed the proprietary trading ban to allow banks to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds at the request of Senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] (R-Mass.), whose vote was needed in the Senate to pass the bill. The Volcker rule was further amended to allow banks to invest 3% of [[Tier 1 capital]] into hedge funds and private equity funds, an amount that would exceed $6 billion a year for Bank of America alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/wall-streets-big-win-20100804 |accessdate=2010-08-04 | title=

Following the passage of the Financial Reform Bill, many banks and financial firms indicated that they did not expect the Volcker Rule to have a significant effect on their profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10860335/1/bofa-ceo-says-volcker-rule-wont-be-too-tough.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEFI|accessdate=2010-07-07 | title=BofA Says Volcker Rule Won't Be Too Tough | work=[[TheStreet.com]] | first=Lauren | last=Tara LaCapra | date=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Public comments to the Financial Stability Oversight Council on how exactly the rule should be implemented were submitted through November 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/the-volcker-rule-after-the-midterm-elections/|accessdate=2010-11-15 | title=The Volcker Rule After the Midterm Elections | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Johnson | date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial firms such as Goldman Sachs, [[Bank of America]], and [[JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.]] posted comments expressing concerns about the rule.&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-19/derivatives-volcker-rules-may-be-house-republican-targets.html|accessdate=2010-11-23 | title=Derivatives, 'Volcker' Rules May Be House Republican Targets | work=[[Bloomberg.com]] | first=Phil | last=Mattingly | date=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representatives to Congress also expressed concern about the Volcker Rule,&lt;ref name="Drawbaugh"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A403220101105|accessdate=2010-12-01 | title=Rep Bachus warns Geithner on "Volcker rule" | work=Reuters | first=Kevin | last=Drawbaugh | date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying the rule's prohibitions may hamper the competitiveness of American banks in the global marketplace, and that they may seek to cut funding to the federal agencies responsible for its enforcement.&lt;ref name="Mattingly"/&gt; The Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative [[Spencer Bachus]] (R-Alabama), stated that he was seeking to limit the effect of the Volcker Rule, although Volcker himself stated that he expected backers of the rule to prevail over such critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/volcker-worried-about-mega-bank-failure-rules-2010-12-10?reflink=MW_news_stmp|accessdate=2010-12-13 | title=Volcker: Worried about mega-bank failure rules | work=[[MarketWatch]] | first=Ronald | last=Orol | date=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcker himself stated that he would have preferred a simpler set of rules: "I'd write a much simpler bill. I'd love to see a four-page bill that bans proprietary trading and makes the board and chief executive responsible for compliance. And I'd have strong regulators. If the banks didn't comply with the spirit of the bill, they'd go after them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/business/volcker-rule-grows-from-simple-to-complex.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2011-10-28 | title=Volcker Rule, Once Simple, Now Boggles | work=New York Times | first=James | last=Stewart | date=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulators gave the public until February 13, 2012 to comment on the proposed draft of the regulations (over 17,000 comments were made).&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-1" &gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/bernanke-says-dodd-frank-s-volcker-rule-won-t-be-ready-by-july-21-deadline.html | accessdate=2012-02-29 | title=Bernanke Says Dodd-Frank's Volcker Rule Won't Be Ready by July 21 Deadline | work=[[bloomberg.com]] | first=Craig | last=Torres | date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the regulations went into effect on July 21, 2012.

On December 10, 2013, the Volcker Rule regulations were approved by all five of the necessary financial regulatory agencies. It was set to go into effect April 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; The final rule had a longer compliance period and fewer metrics than earlier proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Volcker Shrugged  |url=http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/dodd-frank-volcker-rule-shrugged.jhtml| format=[http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-dodd-frank-volker-rule-shrugged.pdf PDF] |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the final rule put the onus on banks to demonstrate that they are operating their trading activities in compliance with the rule and required CEO certification of the effectiveness of the compliance program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/dodd-frank-volcker-rule-top-10-observations.jhtml|title= Volcker first take: You no longer need "a lawyer and a psychiatrist" to comply with the rule – just strong, well-documented processes |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after a lawsuit was filed to stay the effect of the Volcker Rule regulations over whether banks could be required to sell or divest [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) backed by [[trust-preferred security|trust-preferred securities]] (TruPS), on December 27, 2013 the [[Federal Reserve Board]], FDIC, OCC, CFTC and SEC all announced they were reviewing whether it would be appropriate to exempt a small subset of securities from the rule, on which they would rule by January 15, 2014, at the latest.&lt;ref name=stay&gt;{{cite news|title=Monday Morning Regulatory Review – 12/30/13: Obamacare Fractal Geography; Volcker Rule Stay &amp; Reconsideration; OSHA Interpretations &amp; Ripeness; and Rearview Mirrors &amp; Cameras|first=Leland E.|last=Beck|date=December 30, 2013|work=fedregsadvisor.com|url=http://www.fedregsadvisor.com/2013/12/30/monday-morning-regulatory-review-123013-obamacare-fractal-geography-volcker-rule-stay-osha-interpretations-and-rearview-mirrors-cameras/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2014, interim final regulations were adopted to permit certain banking entities to retain those investments.&lt;ref name=ease/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USFedReg|79|5223}} (January 31, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensions continued for banks to exit illiquid investments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve extended the Volcker Rule's conformance period for "legacy covered funds" (a defined term) until July 21, 2016, and indicated it would likely extend the period further to July 21, 2017. The extension to 2016 is the second of three possible one-year extensions the Federal Reserve may issue under the Dodd-Frank Act (regulators provided an initial one-year extension when the Volcker Rule was finalized in December 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20141218a1.pdf|title= Federal Reserve Order Approving Extension of Conformance Period Under Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act |website= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141218a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/2014-volcker-rule-covered-funds.pdf|title= First take: Ten key points from the Fed's Volcker Rule covered funds extension |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/2014-volcker-rule-covered-funds.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European scholars and lawmakers also discussed the necessity of banking reform in light of the crisis, recommending the adoption of specific regulations limiting proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates, notably in France where [[SFAF]] and [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council]] banking experts argued that, beyond fragmented national legislations, such rules should be adopted and implemented within the broader context of [[statutory law]]s valid across the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bank_Regulation_and_Financial_Orthodoxy__RAF__Jan_2010.784613.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-08 |author=M Nicolas Firzli (January 2010) |title=Bank Regulation and Financial Orthodoxy: the Lessons from the Glass-Steagall Act |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215105738/http://www.canadianeuropean.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bank_Regulation_and_Financial_Orthodoxy__RAF__Jan_2010.784613.pdf |archive-date=2010-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Parisien "&gt;{{Cite news|author=M.

The [[Liikanen report|Liikanen Report]], or "Report of the European Commission's High-level Expert Group on Bank Structural Reform", is a set of recommendations published in October 2012 by a group of experts led by [[Erkki Liikanen]], governor of the [[Bank of Finland]] and [[European Central Bank|ECB]] council member.

On July 25, 2012, former Citigroup Chairman and CEO [[Sandy Weill]], considered one of the driving forces behind the considerable financial [[deregulation]] and "mega-[[merger]]s" of the 1990s, surprised financial analysts in Europe and North America by "calling for splitting up the commercial banks from the investment banks. He called for the return of the [[Glass-Steagall Act of 1933]], which he said had effectively led to half a century free of financial crises.&lt;ref name="Forbes "&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steve |last=Denning|title= Rethinking Capitalism: Sandy Weill Says Bring Back Glass-Steagall|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/07/25/rethinking-capitalism-sandy-weill-says-bring-back-glass-steagall| work=[[Forbes]] |date= July 25, 2012  |accessdate= 25 July 2012 }} Quoting interview on CNBC's Squawk-Box.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2017, citing "no foreseeable agreement" in sight on criteria, the [[European Commission]] scrapped the draft legislation that would have permitted the [[European Banking Authority|EBA regulator]] to order "[[too big to fail]]" banks to split off their [[Trader (finance)|trading activities]]. The draft was supposed to be the [[European Union|EU]]'s answer to the [[United States]]' Volcker Rule.&lt;ref name="Reuters "&gt;{{Cite news|first=Huw |last=Jones|title= EU scraps its answer to U.S. Volcker Rule for banks|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-banks-regulations/eu-scraps-its-answer-to-u-s-volcker-rule-for-banks-idUSKBN1CT285?il=0| work=[[Reuters]] |date=October 24, 2017 |accessdate= October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The proposal of the Volcker Rule led to an exodus of top proprietary traders from large banks to form their own [[hedge funds]] or join existing hedge funds including Todd Edgar and Roger Jones from [[Barclays]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Volcker Rule to Curb Liquidity, Boost Independent Trader Talent|journal=Energy Intelligence Finance|date=20 June 2012|volume=XXXV|issue=25|url=http://www.optionsgroup.com/Portals/0/Documents/EnergyIntell_June2012.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sutesh Sharma from [[Citigroup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f080c3c8-cc08-11e0-9176-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3nRBJRqRH |date=August 22, 2011 |first=Sam |last=Jones |title=Sutesh Sharma to go it alone |publisher=[[Financial Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; George "Beau" Taylor and Trevor Woods from [[Credit Suisse]], Pablo Calderini, [[Nelson Saiers]] and [[Boaz Weinstein]] from [[Deutsche Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kearns|first=Jeff|title=Deutsche Bank Loses Option Trader Saiers to Hedge Fund Alphabet Management|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-14/deutsche-bank-loses-option-trader-saiers-to-hedge-fund-alphabet-management.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pierre-Henri Flamand, Bob Howard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LaCapra|first=Lauren Tara|title=Volcker Rule Who's Who|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10980944/4/volcker-rule-whos-who.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Street|date=21 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morgan Sze, Darren Wong and Mathew McClean from [[Goldman Sachs]], Deepak Gulati and Mike Stewart from [[JP Morgan]], Peter Muller from [[Morgan Stanley]], and Jean Bourlet from [[UBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Touryalai|first=Halah|title=Top JP Morgan Prop Trader Leaves to Launch Hedge Fund|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2013/02/15/top-jpmorgan-prop-trader-leaves-to-launch-hedge-fund/|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=15 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Touryalai|first=Halah|title=Volcker Rule Refugees|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2012/03/21/volcker-rule-refugees/|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the rule pointed to the subsequent [[brain drain]] of top talent, however the trading expertise thus lost would only relate to the activity to be curtailed by the new framework, and would only be lost to the banks rather than the economy as a whole, and may be understood as precisely the sort of cultural change within taxpayer-supported banks that the rule was intended to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;ssrn=2639332&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control''' ('''WHO FCTC''') is a [[treaty]] adopted by the 56th [[World Health Assembly]] held in Geneva, Switzerland on 21 May 2003.&lt;ref name="who-fctc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/ |title=WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) |accessdate=2008-04-30 |publisher=[[WHO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first [[World Health Organization]] treaty adopted under article 19 of the WHO constitution.&lt;ref name="ajil"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Adoption of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |journal=[[American Journal of International Law]] |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=689–691 |date=July 2003 |jstor=3109859 |doi=10.2307/3109859 |publisher=The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 97, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty came into force on 27 February 2005.&lt;ref name="who-fctc-p"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/signatories_parties/en/ |title=Updated status of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |accessdate=2008-04-30 |publisher=[[WHO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been signed by 168 countries and is legally binding in 181 [[ratifying]] countries.&lt;ref name="who-fctc-p"/&gt; There are currently 15 [[United Nations member states]] that are non-parties to the treaty (nine which have not signed and six of which have signed but not ratified).&lt;ref name="who-fctc-np"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/non_parties/en/index.html |title=WHO Member States (by regions) that are NOT parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |accessdate=2008-04-30 |publisher=[[WHO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCTC, one of the most quickly ratified treaties in United Nations history,&lt;ref name="Nikogosian, Haik 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nikogosian |first1= Haik |year= 2010 |title= WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control: a key milestone |journal= Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume= 88 |issue= 2 |page= 83 |doi=10.2471/blt.10.075895 |pmid=20428359 |pmc=2814489}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a supranational agreement that seeks "to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to [[tobacco smoke]]" by enacting a set of universal standards stating the dangers of tobacco and limiting its use in all forms worldwide.&lt;ref name="who-fctc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandt, Allan M 2007"&gt;Brandt, Allan M. The Cigarette Century: the Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America. New York: Basic, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the treaty's provisions include rules that govern the production, sale, distribution, advertisement, and taxation of tobacco. FCTC standards are, however, minimum requirements, and signatories are encouraged to be even more stringent in regulating tobacco than the treaty requires them to be.&lt;ref name="Brandt, Allan M 2007"/&gt;

The FCTC represents a watershed moment for international [[public health]]; not only was the treaty the first to be adopted under WHO's Article 19, but it also marks one of the first multilateral, binding agreements regarding a chronic, [[non-communicable disease]].

The FCTC was furthermore a watershed moment for the European Union. According to Mamudu and Studlar, since the adoption of the FCTC in 2003, "shared sovereignty through multilevel governance has become the norm in the tobacco control policy area for EU members, including having one international organization negotiate within the context of another."&lt;ref name="MamuduStudlar2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamudu|first1=Hadii M.|last2=Studlar|first2=Donley T.|title=Multilevel Governance and Shared Sovereignty: European Union, Member States, and the FCTC|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=1|year=2009|pages=73–97|issn=09521895|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2008.01422.x|url=http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2900849;jsessionid=0DDFB7390B5438CEFDB904AC45D06219|pmid=20622934|pmc=2900849||id=NIHMSID 164599|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide [[tobacco control]] set a precedent for EU Commission participation and negotiation in multilateral treaties, and further defined the powers and capabilities of the EU as a supranational entity.

The perceived success of the FCTC has fueled calls for many other global health treaties, although a recent review of 90 quantitative impact evaluations of international treaties broadly raises questions about their real-world impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|title=Assessing the Expected Impact of Global Health Treaties: Evidence from 90 Quantitative Evaluations|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=1|pages=26–40|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2014.302085|pmid=25393196|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2014.302085|accessdate=8 July 2015|pmc=4265908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four criteria have been put forward to guide the development of follow-on global health treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|last3=Frenk|first3=J|title=Assessing Proposals for New Global Health Treaties: An Analytic Framework|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=2015|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302726|pmid=26066926|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302726|accessdate=8 July 2015|volume=105|pages=1523–30|pmc=4504317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The WHO has long been active in preventing the myriad health issues that result from tobacco consumption. As the leading cause of preventable death globally, tobacco has seen an upsurge in both its consumption and its fatality rate worldwide with the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tobacco dependence treatment and the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|journal=Addiction|volume=104|issue=4|year=2009|pages=507–509|issn=09652140|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02488.x|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/19335649|pmid=19335649|pmc=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while tobacco related-diseases differ from the communicable diseases that have traditionally been the concern of the WHO, the effects of globalization have made tobacco increasingly relevant for such intergovernmental authorities.

Under the auspices of tobacco activist and [[UCLA]] professor [[Ruth Roemer]], the WHO urged individual countries throughout the 1980s and 1990s to adopt national laws that have been shown to reduce tobacco use. The FCTC, however, marked the first time that the WHO went so far as to enact its international legal powers to address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fidler |first1=David P. |title=World Health Organization's Framework Convention for Tobacco Control |journal=ASIL Insights |volume=8|issue=6|date=March 28, 2003 |url=https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/8/issue/6/world-health-organizations-framework-convention-tobacco-control |accessdate=3 June 2018 |publisher=The American Society of International Law |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Roemer herself was among the original group of academics and tobacco activists who supported the idea of a framework-convention protocol approach (the rest of the group included Allyn Taylor, [[Derek Yach]], and Judith Mackay).&lt;ref name="RoemerTaylor2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roemer|first1=Ruth|last2=Taylor|first2=Allyn|last3=Lariviere|first3=Jean|title=Origins of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|journal=American Journal of Public Health|publisher=American Public Health Association|volume=95|issue=6|year=2005|pages=936–938|issn=0090-0036|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2003.025908|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/15914812|pmid=15914812|pmc=1449287|access-date=|publication-date=22 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea for a multilateral treaty regarding tobacco control gained traction in 1994 at the Ninth World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Paris, France, when Roemer and Taylor presented their strategy for international legal action. Roemer and Allyn, along with Judith Mackay, were successful, and their proposal was adopted as one of the conference's first resolutions.&lt;ref name="RoemerTaylor2005"/&gt;

In 1995, the World Health Assembly (WHA), in Resolution 48.11, requested that the director general "report to the 49th World Health Assembly on the feasibility of developing an international instrument, such as guidelines, a declaration or an international convention on tobacco control to be adopted by the United Nations."&lt;ref name="RoemerTaylor2005"/&gt; In compliance with Resolution 48.11, the WHO employed Roemer and Taylor to draft a background paper on the various mechanisms available to the WHO in effectively controlling tobacco use worldwide.&lt;ref name="RoemerTaylor2005"/&gt; This background paper provided a concrete recommendation for a framework convention, as opposed to alternative international legal action. According to it proponents, a framework convention would "promote global cooperation and national action for tobacco control."&lt;ref name="RoemerTaylor2005"/&gt;

Roemer and Taylor's proposal was met with some skepticism. [[Allan M. Brandt]], the esteemed Harvard University historian of the tobacco industry, reports, "some considered it unrealistic, impractical, and overly ambitious, and preferred a nonbinding 'code of conduct."&lt;ref name="Brandt, Allan M 2007"/&gt; However, with the support of Derek {{not a typo|Yach}}, head of the Policy Coordination Committee at the WHO, the proposal gained momentum.&lt;ref name="Brandt, Allan M 2007"/&gt; Derek {{not a typo|Yach}} became the first Director of the Tobacco Free Initiative in 1998 and steered development of the FCTC from then till its adoption in March 2003. Subsequently, Gro Harlem Brundtland was elected director general of the WHO in 1998. Brundtland, a Norwegian medical doctor with a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University, threw her full support behind the idea for a binding multilateral treaty on tobacco control. Alongside malaria treatment and prevention, the nascent Framework Convention rose to the top of her agenda at the WHO.&lt;ref name="MamuduHammond2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamudu|first1=Hadii M.|last2=Hammond|first2=Ross|last3=Glantz|first3=Stanton|title=Tobacco industry attempts to counter the World Bank report curbing the epidemic and obstruct the WHO framework convention on tobacco control|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=67|issue=11|year=2008|pages=1690–1699|issn=02779536|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.09.062|url=https://sites.duke.edu/globalhealthfellows2013/files/2012/06/MamuduHadii_TobaccoCramworkConvention_SocialScienceMedicine_2008.pdf|pmid=18950924|pmc=2662513|access-date=|publication-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiation, drafting, and economic implications==
It took three years for negotiators to come to an agreement on the terms of the FCTC. After being adopted by the World Health Assembly, the policy-making arm of the WHO, it officially went into effect in February 2005.&lt;ref name="Nikogosian, Haik 2010"/&gt;

A framework convention is typically justified for problems that necessitate international cooperation to effectively formulate policy. Prior to the FCTC, the majority of framework conventions addressed "environmental issues that were outside the control of individual nations."&lt;ref name="Brandt, Allan M 2007"/&gt; Thus, in proving that a framework convention was needed for tobacco control, treaty advocates invoked tobacco-related issues that could not be resolved by the actions of individual countries, such as the smuggling of tobacco and the leakage of tobacco advertisements from countries which lacked stringent regulation to those with restrictions on where and to whom tobacco companies could market their products. This initial justification of the framework convention is manifested in the preamble of the final version of the FCTC, which states the following issues as central to the treaty's aims:&lt;ref name="Brandt, Allan M 2007"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*the dramatic increase in worldwide tobacco consumption;
*the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children and adolescents
*the impact of all forms of advertising, promotion, and sponsorship aimed at encouraging tobacco use
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The treaty is notable for its unprecedented inclusion of nongovernmental organizations throughout the negotiation and drafting processes.&lt;ref name=Lencucha&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lencucha |first1= Raphael |last2= Labonté |first2= Ronald |last3= Rouse |first3= Michael J. |year= 2010 |title= Beyond Idealism and Realism: Canadian NGO/government Relations during the Negotiation of the FCTC |url= |journal= Journal of Public Health Policy |volume= 31 |issue= Supplement 1 |pages= 74–87 |doi=10.1057/jphp.2009.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elinor Wilson, the past Vice-President of World Heart Federation, "the FCTC is an excellent example of government/non-governmental collaboration through the Framework Convention Alliance resulting in global public health gains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wilson |first1= Elinor |year= 2007 |title= S8-2 FCTC GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS AND STRATEGIES |url= |journal= International Journal of Cardiology |volume= 122 |issue= 1 |page= S10 |doi=10.1016/s0167-5273(08)70327-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collaboration between NGOs and the WHO forever changed the way that the WHO treats nongovernmental organizations, and in 2002 the WHO constitution was amended to reflect this shift in relations.&lt;ref name=Lencucha/&gt;

Much of the groundwork for the economic justification for the FCTC was laid by the World Bank. In order to counter concerns that international tobacco control legislation would unduly harm economies of which tobacco farming, manufacturing, and sale were an important part, the WHO cited a landmark World Bank publication entitled ''Curbing the Epidemic: Governments and the Economics of Tobacco Control (CTE)'', which asserted that tobacco control would not harm economies, other than a select few agrarian countries that were unusually dependent on tobacco production. Mamudu, Hammond, and Glantz reveal that "as a financial institution with substantial influence in developing countries, the Bank's publication of CTE threatened to undermine the tobacco companies' economic arguments" about the harmful effects of tobacco control.&lt;ref name="MamuduHammond2008"/&gt;

Indeed, even before the treaty was publicly released, tobacco industry representatives embarked upon a concerted effort to thwart the efforts of FCTC drafters, in addition to participating policy-makers from individual WHO member states. Unable to argue against the overwhelming scientific evidence about tobacco's harmful health effects, the tobacco industry seized upon the FCTC's potential for economic harm. In response to the World Bank's ''CTE,''the industry made a number of attempts to discredit the report, especially through the public relations efforts of the International Tobacco Growers' Association (ITGA) and by employing non-World Bank economists to release their own analyses.&lt;ref name="MamuduHammond2008"/&gt; Between 4–16 March of the year 2000, the ITGA, financed by the tobacco industry, set out on what they dubbed a "Roadshow," during which ITGA representatives spoke to policy-makers in the developing countries of India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, in addition to two "mini-Roadshows" in Argentina and Brazil, in order to voice ITGA opposition to the FCTC on the grounds that the ''CTE'' had underestimated the threat that tobacco control would pose to developing economies.&lt;ref name="MamuduHammond2008"/&gt; Once negotiations for the FCTC were underway, the tobacco industry again made attempts to lessen the blow of international legislation on their business by lobbying delegates at the convention in Geneva. According to Mamudu, Hammond, and Glantz, however, "these efforts... did not undermine acceptance of ''CTE'' during the FCTC negotiations and ''CTE'' remained an authoritative economic analysis of global tobacco control."&lt;ref name="MamuduHammond2008"/&gt;

Nevertheless, the FCTC acknowledges that its agenda will inevitably hurt farmers who currently depend on tobacco for their livelihoods. To that end, the treaty encourages Parties to help tobacco farmers make the transition from tobacco to alternative crops. Article 17 of the Framework Convention states: "Parties shall, in cooperation with each other and with competent international and regional intergovernmental organizations, promote, as appropriate, economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers, growers and, as the case may be, individual sellers."&lt;ref&gt;"WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC)". WHO. http://www.who.int/fctc/en/&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the FCTC favors sustainable development options over tobacco farming. To achieve this, Party governments and tobacco control advocates are encouraged to invest in better infrastructure, especially transportation, to ease farmers' access to new and foreign markets when making the transition, while simultaneously improving farmers' access to credit that may be necessary in converting their existing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jones |first1= Alison Snow |display-authors= 1 |last2= et al |year= 2008 |title= Tobacco Farmers and Tobacco Manufacturers: Implications for Tobacco Control in Tobacco-Growing Developing Countries |url= |journal= Journal of Public Health Policy |volume= 29 |issue= 4 |pages= 406–423 |doi=10.1057/jphp.2008.37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-parties==
The United States is a non-party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.&lt;ref name="who-fctc-np"/&gt; When the signed treaty was put up for [[ratification]], President [[George W. Bush]] failed to send the FCTC to the United States Senate for consideration, thereby preventing the full participation of the U.S in the implementation of the Framework Convention.

Furthermore, the U.S. has sought to change certain provisions of the FCTC, but with limited success.&lt;ref name="ajil"/&gt; Among the provisions opposed successfully were a mandatory ban on the distribution of free tobacco samples (which is now optional), a narrow definition of the term "minor" regarding the sale of tobacco (which now refers to domestic or national law) and broad limitations concerning the tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (which were seen as violating [[free speech]], and are now subject to constitutional limitations). Among the provisions unsuccessfully opposed by the U.S. were the requirement for warning labels to be written in the language of the country where the tobacco products are being sold, and the ban on deceptive and misleading descriptions such as "low tar" or "ultra-light", which might infringe on trademark protections.

As of December 2017, there are 15 non-party states that are members of the UN: six that have signed but not yet ratified ([[Argentina]], [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Morocco]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]); and nine that have not signed ([[Andorra]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Eritrea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Liechtenstein]]*, [[Malawi]], [[Monaco]], [[Somalia]], and [[South Sudan]]).

*''Note'': Liechtenstein, although not a WHO Member State, is eligible to become a Party to the WHO FCTC as a UN Member State.

==Governance==
The FCTC established two principal bodies to oversee the functioning of the treaty: the Conference of the parties and the permanent Secretariat. In addition, there are over 50 different intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations who are official observers to the Conference of the Parties.&lt;ref name="Nikogosian, Haik 2010"/&gt;

==Implementation, oversight, and future direction==
According to the FCTC in 2010, "most parties have now passed or are renewing and strengthening national legislation and policies to meet their obligations under the treaty" and that 80% of parties facilitated public information and/ or education programs on the dangers of tobacco and curb underage tobacco consumption through laws that forbid retailers from selling tobacco products to minors.&lt;ref name="Nikogosian, Haik 2010"/&gt;  Furthermore, 70% of parties made "large, clear and visible health warnings" mandatory for tobacco packaging.&lt;ref name="Nikogosian, Haik 2010"/&gt; However Nikogosian warns that the treaty's effectiveness hinges on how parties implement the guidelines.&lt;ref name="Nikogosian, Haik 2010"/&gt; FCTC implementation proves most difficult for developing and transition economies, due to a rift between their need for tobacco control and the resources they can access in meeting FCTC guidelines. This also proves to be difficult for the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henning|first=Peter K.|author2=Shmatenko, Leonid |title=Plain Packaging on Its Way to Europe: Competence Issues and Compatibility with European Fundamental Rights|journal=Transnational Dispute Management|date=November 2012|volume=9|issue=5|pages=1–17|ssrn=2171205|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Australia.

In 2008, the FCTC advised to introduce [[plain tobacco packaging]], which in 2012 subsequently was adopted in Australia .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Becky|last2=Chapman|first2=Simon|last3=Rimmer|first3=Matthew|title=The case for the plain packaging of tobacco products|journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]]|date=April 2008|volume=103|issue=4|pages=580–590|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02145.x|pmid=18339104|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4rz0m70k.pdf;origin=repeccitec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Recent attempts to evaluate the implementation and efficacy of FCTC showed that actual state compliance with the framework is quite low, and that its implementation infrastructure is ridden with errors.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hoffman |first1= S.J. |last2= Rizvi |first2= Z. |year= 2012 |title= WHO's Undermining Tobacco Control |url= |journal= The Lancet |volume= 380 |issue= 9843 |pages= 727–728 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61402-0 |pmid=22920746}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when Hoffman ''et al.'' compared WHO's FCTC implementation database with national implementation reports they found that 32% of country responses were misreported in the database; 3% were obvious errors, 24% were missing despite being reported by countries, and 5% were misinterpreted by the WHO staff. These findings highlighted the need for a stronger WHO infrastructure to track and record state compliance with policies.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt;

===Future direction - FCTC 2030 Project ===
In 2017, the Convention Secretariat started a new project to help parties to strengthen treaty implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/implementation/fctc2030/en/|title=FCTC 2030|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the importance of tobacco control in promoting development, including specific reference to WHO FCTC implementation in target 3.a. Given the impact of tobacco on development, the implementation of the Convention will play an important role in achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs).{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The ''FCTC 2030'' project aims to support Parties to the WHO FCTC that are eligible to receive official development assistance (ODA) to achieve the SDGs by advancing implementation of the Convention. The project will run from April 2017 until March 2021.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Through the ''FCTC 2030 ''project, technical support will be provided to national governments of these countries to:
* implement the requirements of Article 5 of the WHO FCTC, to improve tobacco control governance and protect tobacco control policies from the vested and commercial interests of the tobacco industry;
* strengthen tobacco tax;
* implement WHO FCTC time-bound measures for:
* comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship 
* effective health warnings on tobacco packaging; and
* smokefree work and public places;
* implement other Articles of the WHO FCTC according to national priorities; and
* promote overall implementation of the WHO FCTC as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to support Parties to incorporate the implementation of the WHO FCTC into their national health and development agendas.{{cn|date=July 2018}}
Through the ''FCTC 2030 ''project, the Convention Secretariat will promote WHO FCTC implementation as part of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda and provide general support and materials for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the areas set out above. This will include workshops, toolkits, online training on tobacco control, south-south and triangular cooperation, and other forms of assistance to national governments to accelerate treaty implementation.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The Convention Secretariat will also be able to provide intensive support up to 15 selected countries that are Parties to the WHO FCTC, are eligible to receive ODA and have demonstrated the motivation and commitment to advance treaty implementation. This will include the provision of direct, demand-driven expert advice, technical assistance and peer support to build domestic capacity to improve tobacco control in line with available resources.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Protocol==
In 2012, a supplementary [[Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products]] to the Convention was concluded in [[Seoul]], South Korea. The Protocol will enter into force after it has been ratified by 40 states that have ratified the Convention. In July 2017, there are 28 signatures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IX-4-a&amp;chapter=9&amp;lang=en&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Protocol is reuniting more countries every year.

==Proceedings of COP-6==
Reporters and the public were forcibly removed from the October 2014 convention which occurred in Moscow.&lt;ref name="DailyCaller201410"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/14/reporters-removed-restrained-at-world-health-organization-meeting-on-global-tobacco-tax/ |title=Reporters Removed, Restrained At World Health Organization Meeting On Global Tobacco Tax |accessdate=14 October 2014 |quote=Washington Times editorial writer Drew Johnson told The Daily Caller that he was physically escorted out of the meeting’s convention hall by a guard while another reporter was physically restrained from entering the room, even though WHO never formally voted to restrict the media from the event.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WT201410"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/13/johnson-uns-health-agency-works-global-tobacco-tax/ |title=JOHNSON: UN’s health agency boots public, press to work on a global tobacco tax in secret |accessdate=14 October 2014 |quote=After the doors were slammed shut and the meeting resumed, it became clear why the delegates chased the public away: They wanted to work on passing a global tax on tobacco in secret.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Times]]'' reported that the FCTC delegates were discussing a global tobacco tax in secret.&lt;ref name="WT201410"/&gt;
