'''Acoustiguide''' is a provider of [[interactive museum guide]]s for [[museum]]s, [[art gallery|art galleries]], [[heritage site]]s, and other public displays. In 2005 it merged with the Israeli company Espro Information Technologies.

== History ==
Acoustiguide launched an early mobile interpretation guide in  1957, with a tour of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Hyde Park]] narrated by his wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.acoustiguide.com/company-profile Company history], Acoustiguide.&lt;/ref&gt; Audioguides in museums had been available in the United States since 1954, with the Guide-A-Phone system at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.library.amnh.org/photos/ptm/catalog/desc/172235/|website=AMNH: Picturing the Museum Archive|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available on then-new portable [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel players]], the tour led visitors through the estate's public and private spaces, and told stories of day-to-day life and special visits by dignitaries.  

In 1959, the [[Phoenix Art Museum]] was the first museum to use an Acoustiguide to interpret their permanent collection, which was narrated by [[Vincent Price]].  Cassette players were used though the 1960s and infrared and radio frequency tour systems were used in the 1970s with a specific cassette model, called the M1 player. Concurrently, AM and FM wands were introduced at [[Centrepoint Tower]] in Sydney, Queen´s House ([[National Maritime Museum]]), and the [[Mary Rose Trust]].&lt;ref name="audiogids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioguides Part of an Exciting Journey |url=http://www.audiogids.lv/en/zinas/raksts/67 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080126/http://www.audiogids.lv/en/zinas/raksts/67 |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acoustiguide gained popularity in museum education with "blockbuster" exhibitions in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="acoustiguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Profile|url=http://www.acoustiguide.com/company-profile|publisher=Acoustiguide|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; P2s or Panasonic XBS cassette players were bought off-the-shelf and the company built a mass charging system with custom made charging racks, in order to satisfy the increasing needs by museums.&lt;ref name="audiogids" /&gt;

With this increase in demand, the company opened offices in Europe and Asia, which included one of the first American-based companies to be opened in Mainland China (at Beijing's [[Forbidden City]]).  In 1993, Acoustiguide created digital wands with "random access tours" which allowed visitors to choose the objects they wanted to learn more about and to go at their own pace in a sequence of their own choosing.  These players debuted at the [[Louvre]], in Paris.&lt;ref name="acoustiguide" /&gt;

== Current technology ==
Acoustiguide offers digital audio and multimedia interpretative tours via a variety of platforms including smartphones, multimedia MP3 players, radio transmission systems and the internet, as well as proprietary hardware and software guiding solutions designed and manufactured specifically for the cultural and tourism markets. Acoustiguide also offers Acoustiguide Mobile, a multimedia app for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones and tablets. Acoustiguide's products are solid state and include keypads to allow visitors to choose content appropriate to their location in the exhibit, as well as additional material such as multimedia and video vignettes. Acoustiguide technology is in use at hundreds of sites worldwide&lt;ref name="acoustiguide_a"&gt;[http://www.acoustiguide.com/about/client.html Client list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217190916/http://www.acoustiguide.com/about/client.html |date=December 17, 2007 }}, Acoustiguide.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inform ===
The first digital wand player which allowed for 'random access' tours.  Still used in some institutions throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="audiogids" /&gt;

=== Denon ===
In 1996, Acoustiguide and Denon co-created the second generation of digital players. These are used infrequently.&lt;ref name="audiogids" /&gt;

==== AG 2000 ====
The third generation of digital random access audio equipment was launched in 2000. It came with the ability to use it as a wand or with headphones, increased memory capacity, MP3 sound, customized data collection, LCD screens, features for individuals with disabilities and the ability to update via the internet.  This model is no longer available for new purchases, but can be found in a few locations throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="audiogids" /&gt;

==== exSite ====
Four models of exSite have been launched since 2000. Each exSite unit is wand-based and capable of collecting data about the use of the tour via a survey. exSite units are still sold by Acoustiguide.&lt;ref name="audiogids" /&gt;

==== Opus ====
Launched at the Museums and Heritage Show in 2007, it comes in two models: Click (with keypad) and Touch (with touch screen). Both have color screens and provide audio content, images, video, photos, animation and maps. Both can be used as a wand or a headset player.  This is the most popular unit available {{asof|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="audiogids" /&gt;

== Offices ==
Acoustiguide is owned and managed by Espro-Acoustiguide Group. The Group operates worldwide through 7 subsidiaries and a network of distributors with offices in New York, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Amsterdam, Salzburg, Madrid, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Sydney, St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico City, Shanghai, and Tokyo. The company’s list of clients include New York’s [[MoMA]] and the [[United Nations Headquarters|UN visitor center]], San Francisco’s [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]], Paris’ [[Louvre|Musèe du Louvre]], [[Musée d’Orsay]], and Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, London’s [[Westminster Abbey]] and the [[Tower of London]], Jerusalem’s [[Israel Museum]], Taipei’s [[101 Tower]], Beijing’s [[National Museum of China]], and [[Sydney Opera House|Sydney’s Opera House]].&lt;ref name="acoustiguide_a" /&gt;

== Competitors ==
Systems such as Acoustiguide's, and those of competitors [[Tour-Mate]], ArtTours [http://www.kenjun.com/arttours/], and Cuseum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cuseum.com/|title=Cuseum - Museum Engagement Platform|last=Cuseum|website=cuseum.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; are identified as providing "industrial-strength systems that can be used as audio guides in museums and other cultural heritage sites and support typically a very wide range of human languages (reaching 20 or more.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://archeoguide.intranet.gr/papers/ProgressReports/AGProgressReport02.pdf Augmented Reality based Cultural Heritage On-site Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429224829/http://archeoguide.intranet.gr/papers/ProgressReports/AGProgressReport02.pdf |date=April 29, 2006 }} project report.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among competitors, there is another company, which was set up in Italy in 1959, almost at the same time as Acoustiguide and which is still active in the digital interpretation field: D'Uva [http://www.duva.eu/ www.duva.eu].

'''''Africa Bibliography''''' is an annual guide to works in [[African studies]] published by [[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of the [[International African Institute]] (IAI). It was established in 1984 and is published as an annual print volume and simultaneously as a searchable online database. The online database consolidates the back volumes of the ''Africa Bibliography'' into a single database which can be queried using quick search, [[Boolean search|Boolean]], and [[faceted search]] options. Items included are [[monograph]]s, chapters in edited volumes, journal articles, and pamphlets. Languages included are English, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Swahili, Spanish, and Afrikaans. Subject areas covered are the [[social sciences|social]] and [[environmental science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[the arts]], alongside some items from [[Life sciences|medical, biological, and natural sciences]]. Every entry in the bibliography is categorised by region, country, and subject and newer entries are tagged with additional keywords. As an annual publication, it records the previous year's published work in its field, with provision for retrospective inclusion of earlier items.

The bibliography is currently compiled by Terry A. Barringer ([[University of Cambridge]]) and is prepared alongside the IAI's journal [[Africa (journal)|''Africa'']].

During the 2014 meeting of the US African Studies Association ''Africa Bibliography'' received the Conover-Porter Award 2014 (best africana bibliography or reference work).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/africa/ALC/ALCConoverPorterWinners.html List of winners of the Conover Porter Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

He invented a synthetic [[chicle]] and introduced [[vitamin]] capsules to grocery stores.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/10/22/archives/a-urban-shirk-sales-specialist-merchandising-authority-in-food.html |title=A.

He was also renowned as a prodigious reader. Shirk read the entire 23-volume [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] from cover to cover in four and a half years, reading on average three hours per evening, and taking two to six months per volume.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Reader |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 3, 1934 |page=17 |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1934-03-03#folio=016 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1934, he had begun reading the 14th edition, saying he found it a "big improvement" over the 11th, and saying that "most of the material had been completely rewritten".&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

Shirk did not limit himself to ''Britannica''. He also read [[Henry Smith Williams]]'s 24-volume ''[[Historians' History of the World]]'', which took him two years, as well as an 18-volume set of works by [[Alexandre Dumas]], a 32-volume set of [[Honoré de Balzac]], and a 20-volume set of [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

Shirk had other hobbies including [[painting]] and [[record collecting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10785659/a_urban_shirk/ |title=Encyclopedist Says: Read to Understand War Events |date=August 9, 1942 |work=The Sunday Times-Signal |location=[[Zanesville, Ohio]] |page=9 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=May 5, 2017}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia''''' is a reference work written by [[S. T. Joshi]] and David E. Schultz. It covers the life and work of [[American literature|American]] [[horror fiction]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. First published in 2001 by Greenwood Publishing Group, it was reissued in a slightly revised paperback edition by Hippocampus Press.

The book provides entries on all of Lovecraft's stories, complete with synopses, publication history and word counts. People from Lovecraft's life, including selected writers who influenced his work, are also included. 

Fictional characters from Lovecraft's work are given brief entries, but most [[Cthulhu Mythos]]-related subjects are not referenced. "The 'gods' themselves, with rare exceptions, do not figure as 'characters' in any meaningful sense in the tales, so there are no entries on them," the authors explain.

==Authors==
*S. T. Joshi is the author of ''Lovecraft: A Life'' and the editor of several collections of Lovecraft's work, including the corrected [[Arkham House]] editions. 
*David E. Schultz is the editor of a critical edition of Lovecraft's ''Commonplace Book'' (1987). With Joshi, he has edited several volumes of [[writings by Lovecraft]] and [[Ambrose Bierce]].

'''Arts on Film''' archive, at [[Docwest]], [[University of Westminster]], is an on-line archive to a large range of films on art produced in the United Kingdom since the 1950s. It is a record of British and international post-war art, as well as of the history of documentary film-making in the UK. The archive offers a complete database and an on-line video streaming (for UK academic users) of all 450 films made by the film department of [[Arts Council England]] between 1953 and 1998 and several films produced till 2003 by the dance Department of ACE.&lt;ref&gt;Vision On :  Film, Television and the Arts in Britain, by John Wyver, {{ISBN|9781905674398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many titles in the collection contain rare material about individual artists, while others offer definitive coverage of their subject. The archive is a primary research resource for a wide range of scholars in arts and humanities.  The archive was built with the support of the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].  Prof. Joram ten Brink - archive director; Elaine Burrows - database and catalogue; Steve Foxon - film restoration and encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts On Film|url=http://artsonfilm.wmin.ac.uk|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">The '''British Catalogue of Music Classification''' (BCM Classification)&lt;ref&gt;The British Catalogue of Music Classification / compiled for the Council of the British National Bibliography Ltd. by E. J. Coates, F.L.A.  London : Council of the British National Bibliography, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[faceted classification]] that was commissioned from E. J. Coates by the Council of the British National Bibliography to organize the content of the British Catalogue of Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/britishcatalogue001781mbp |title=Internet Archive: Details: The British Catalogue Of Music 1960 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published schedule (1960) was considerably expanded by Patrick Mills of the British Library up until its use was abandoned in 1998. Entries in the catalogue were organized by BCM classmark from the catalogue's inception in 1957 until 1982. From that year the British Catalogue of Music (which from 1974 onward was published by [[The British Library]]) was organized instead by [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] number, though BCM classmarks continued to be added to entries up to the 1998 annual cumulation.

The schedule is divided into two main parts: A–B representing Musical literature and C–Z representing Music – Scores and Parts.  There are also seven auxiliary tables dealing with various sub-arrangements, sets of ethnic/locality subdivisions and chronological reference points.

The notation is retroactive using uppercase alphabetic characters omitting I and O, with the addition of slash / and parentheses ( ) which have specific anteriorizing functions.  Retroactive notation requires that the classifier combines terms in reverse schedule order. This has the benefit of producing a compact notation by removing the need for facet indicators.

The schedule at A (Music Literature) parallels that from the Scores and Parts schedules thus Choral Music is at D while books about Choral Music are at AD; Harp Music is at TQ so books on harp music are at ATQ.  The schedule at B accommodates books about specific composers and music in non-European traditions.

As a fully faceted scheme after the ideas of [[S. R. Ranganathan]], BCM class numbers are capable of being chain-indexed, allowing index access to each step of the hierarchy.

BCM classification had a strong influence on Russell Sweeney's so-called Phoenix Dewey 780 schedule&lt;ref&gt;DDC Dewey Decimal Classification : proposed revision of 780 music / prepared under the direction of Russell Sweeney and John Clews with assistance from Winton E. Mathews, Jr. Albany N.Y. : Forest Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-910608-25-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn influenced the 780 Music schedule in the 20th edition of [[Dewey Decimal Classification]].  The music schedule of the second edition of the Bliss Classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.music.indiana.edu/tech_s/mla/facacc.rev |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512000152/http://library.music.indiana.edu/tech_s/mla/facacc.rev |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also strongly influenced by BCM.

This classification system is still in use at a number of libraries, including the [[State Library of Western Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/find/guides/music/general_information/british_catalogue_of_music_classification_scheme |title=(accessed 2015-12-17) |publisher=Slwa.wa.gov.au |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Library at [[Edith Cowan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecu.au.libguides.com/c.php?g=410622&amp;p=2797056 |title=(accessed 2015-12-17) |publisher=Ecu.au.libguides.com |date=2016-08-05 |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chatfield v Jones''' [1990] 3 NZLR 285 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the issue of notice of cancellation of a [[contract]], where a contract has been breached.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |pages=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In November 1986, the parties agreed to transfer the shares in Acorn (Fiji) Limited, which operated a tourist train, in the Coral Coast, Fiji for $875,000. When the purchasers neglected to pay for the shares the following year, the shares were resold for $100,000, and sued the purchasers for the loss.

The purchasers defended the claim, saying they were not notified of the cancellation of the contract.

==Held==
Held, the court ruled that the vendors statement of claim notified them that the contract had been cancelled.

The '''''Chronicon complutense sive alcobacense''''' ("Complutensian Chronicle, that is, [from a manuscript] of [[Alcalá de Henares]] [ancient Complutum]") is a short [[medieval Latin]] history, in the form of [[annals]], of events in [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and [[County of Portugal|Portugal]] up to the death of [[Ferdinand I of León and Castile|Ferdinand I "the Great"]], whom the anonymous chronicler lauds as an "exceedingly strong emperor" (''imperator fortissimus''), in 1065. It is the earliest "''[[chronicon]]''" dealing with Galaico-Portuguese events. The first edition (''editio princeps'') was published by [[Enrique Flórez]] in 1767. A more recent edition, incorporating the recension known as the '''''Chronicon conimbrigense''''', was published under the title '''''Annales Portugalenses veteres''''' (APV, "old Portuguese annals") by Pierre David.

A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

== Styles ==
{{styles}}
{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science. A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1123–1127 |publisher= |location= |year=2006 |url= |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl189 |id= |pmid=16987841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J. Scott Armstrong |work=Interfaces |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=125–139 |date=2008 |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |location=Catonsville, Maryland |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/45579289_Verification_of_Citations_Fawlty_Towers_of_Knowledge/links/00b7d52b08d80022a0000000.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-17 |dead-url=no |format=PDF |doi=10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |issn=0092-2102 |eissn=1526-551X |jstor=25062982 |oclc=5582131729 |ssrn=1941335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fister Jr. | first1 = I. | last2 = Fister | first2 = I. | last3 = Perc | first3 = M.| doi = 10.3389/fphy.2016.00049 | title = Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels in Citation Networks | journal = Frontiers in Physics | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MQTT]] ('''MQ Telemetry Transport''' or '''Message Queuing Telemetry Transport''') is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO standard]] (ISO/IEC PRF 20922).&lt;ref name="ISO"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/69466.html |title=ISO/IEC 20922:2016 Information technology -- Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) v3.1.1 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=June 15, 2016 |website=iso.org |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |pages= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Publish–subscribe pattern|publish-subscribe]]-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the [[TCP/IP|TCP/IP protocol]]. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The [[Publish–subscribe pattern|publish-subscribe messaging pattern]] requires a [[message broker]].

All comparison categories use the stable version of each implementation listed in the overview section. The comparison is limited to features that relate to the MQTT protocol.

== Overview ==
The following table lists MQTT both libraries and implementations, along with general information about each.

== Protocol support ==

There are several versions of the [[MQTT]] protocol currently standardized. Below is a list containing the more recent versions of the [[MQTT]] protocol, with the organization that standardized them.

* '''MQTT-SN (MQTT v1.2)''', standardized by [[IBM]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite techreport|authors=Andy Stanford-Clark, Hong Linh Truong|title=MQTT For Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN) Protocol Specification Version 1.2|date=November 14, 2013|institution=IBM}}[http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MQTT-SN_spec_v1.2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MQTT v3.1''', standardized by [[Eurotech (company)|Eurotech]] and [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html|title=MQTT V3.1 Protocol Specification|website=public.dhe.ibm.com|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MQTT v3.1.1''', standardized by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]].&lt;ref&gt;MQTT Version 3.1.1. Edited by Andrew Banks and Rahul Gupta. 29 October 2014. OASIS Standard. http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html. Latest version: http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MQTT v5.0''', standardized by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]].&lt;ref&gt;MQTT Version 5.0. Edited by Andrew Banks, Ed Briggs, Ken Borgendale and Rahul Gupta. 25 December 2017. OASIS Standard. http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html. Latest version: http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table lists the versions of MQTT that each implementation supports, and also lists their support for [[SSL/TLS]] and [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. The security provided by [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] may be desirable depending on the type traffic being sent between devices, as MQTT transmits messages [[Plaintext|in the clear]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mqtt.org/faq|title=FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} MQTT|website=mqtt.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of Service (QoS) levels offered ==
{{Main|Quality of Service}}
From the [[MQTT]] page, [[Quality of service|QoS (Quality of Service)]] is described as,&lt;blockquote&gt;Quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A description of each [[Quality of service|QoS]] level is found below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc62020_.htm|title=IBM Knowledge Center|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;li value="0&gt;At most delivery (fire and forget)&lt;/li&gt;
# At least once delivery (acknowledged delivery)
# Exactly once delivery (assured delivery)

The following table lists each implementation's support of the QoS levels.

[[File: Croyland Abbey &amp; Parish Church of Crowland.JPG|thumb|130px| Croyland Abbey.]]
The '''''Croyland''''' or '''''Crowland Chronicle''''' is an important primary source for [[England|English]] [[medieval]] history, particularly the late 15th century. It is named for its place of origin, the [[Benedictine]] [[Croyland Abbey|Abbey of Croyland]] or Crowland, in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]. It was formerly also known as the '''''Chronicle of Ingulf''''' or '''''Ingulphus''''' after its supposed original compiler, the 11th-century abbot [[Ingulf]]. As that section of the text is now known to have been a later forgery, its author is instead known as [[Pseudo-Ingulf]].

==Contents==
Several historical chronicles were written at the Abbey of Croyland, which was the wealthiest religious foundation in eastern England during the Middle Ages. [[Alison Weir]] writes that the chronicles dated before 1117 are "spurious", while the three anonymously written "continuations" that span the periods from 1144-1469, 1459-1468 and 1485-1486 are genuine.&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Fawcett| isbn = 978-0-345-39178-0| last = Alison| first = Weir| title = Princes in the Tower, the| location = New York| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first entry of the chronicle concerns 655{{nbsp}}{{sc|ad}}. A forged part of the text was formerly used to support the existence of a form of the ''[[congé d'élire]]''—royal power over [[investiture]] of [[bishop]]s—in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] prior to the [[Norman Conquest]].

The part that covers the years 1459–1486, called the Second Continuation, was written in April 1486, after Henry Tudor had become King [[Henry VII of England]]. It was written someone who had access to information from the [[Noble court|court]] of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]—described as being a doctor of [[canon law]] and member of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]'s council.  Some historians believe that author was [[John Russell (bishop)|John Russell]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]], who was Richard's [[Chancellor]] for most of his reign (until Richard dismissed him on 24 July 1485) but who now wanted to please the new king Henry. Others conclude the work was written by a monk of Crowland who has edited a secular source.

Over the years, there has been confusion between the second and third [[continuator]]s, and the fourth continuator claims not to know the identity of the third. It is, in fact, the second continuator (covering the period 1459–1486) who claims to be writing in April 1486, and, sure enough, this section ends with the marriage of [[Henry VII of England]] and [[Elizabeth of York]] and the [[Lambert Simnel|rebellion that followed]].  This date ties in with the survival of a copy of ''[[Titulus Regius]]'' in the text, and Russell is known to have been at [[Crowland]] during April, 1486.

'''Cunning folk''', also known as '''folk healers''', are practitioners of [[folk medicine]], [[folk magic]],  and [[divination]] within the context of the various traditions of [[European folklore|folklore]] in [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] (from at least the 15th up until at least the early 20th century). 

Names given to folk healers or magicians in parts of [[Europe]] include the French ''devins-guérisseurs'' (soothsayer-healers) and ''leveurs de sorts'' (curse lifters), the Italian ''[[benandanti]]'' ("''good walkers''"), the Dutch ''toverdokters'' or ''duivelbanners'', the German ''Hexenmeister'' or ''Kräuterhexen'', the Spanish ''[[curandero]]s'', the Portuguese ''curandeiros/as'', ''benzedeiros/as'' or ''mulheres de virtude'' (this last one applies only to females, translating as "women of virtue"), the Danish ''kloge folk'',&lt;ref name="Davies 2003. p. 163"&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish ''klok gumma'' ("''wise old woman''") or ''klok gubbe'' ("''wise old man''"),&lt;ref name="wordgumbo.com"&gt;http://www.wordgumbo.com/ie/ger/swe/fdsweeng.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordgumbo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Signum svenska kulturhistoria, ''Stormaktstiden''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jan-Inge Wall, Hon var engång tagen under jorden&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wicked arts: witchcraft and magic trials in southern Sweden, 1635-1754'' By Per Sörlina&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the 20th century''by Marijke Gijswijt-Hofstra, Willem de Blécourt, Brian Levack, Ronald Hutton, Jean Sybil La Fontaine and Roy Porter, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|0-485-89106-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-485-89106-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Slavic ''[[Vedmak]]''. Some historians and folklorists have opted to apply the term "cunning folk" as an [[umbrella term]] for the entire range of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Deb94|De Blécourt 1994]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies 2003. p. 163"/&gt;

==Scandinavia==
[[File:Gertrud Ahlgren.jpg|thumb|The Swedish cunning woman [[Gertrud Ahlgren]] of Gotland (1782-1874), drawing by [[Pehr Arvid Säve]] 1870.]]

In Scandinavia the ''klok gumma'' ("wise woman") or ''klok gubbe'' ("wise man"), and collectively ''De kloka'' ("The Wise ones"), as they were known in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], were usually elder members of the community who acted as folk healers and [[midwives]] as well as using [[folk magic]] such as [[spell (paranormal)|magic rhymes]].&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"&gt;Jacob Christenssen (Swedish): Signums svenska kulturhistoria. Stormaktstiden (Signum Swedish Culturhistory. The Great Power Era) (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark, they were called ''klog mand'' ("wise man") and ''klog kone'' ("wise woman") and collectively as ''kloge folk'' ("wise folk").&lt;ref&gt;''Healing by hand: manual medicine and bonesetting in global perspective'' Kathryn S. Oths, Servando Z. Hinojosa, Rowman Altamira, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7591-0393-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7591-0393-1}}. p.05&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Norwegian&lt;ref name=fol7576/&gt; and Danish&lt;ref name=fol7576/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.P. Hansen 1960"&gt;H.P. Hansen: Kloge Folk - Folkemedicin og overtro i Vestjylland (Rosenkilde og Bagger 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; practitioners of folk magic and medicine would have a copy of the "Svartebok" (or "[[Grimoire|black book]]"), a tome that, according to some, was written by ''[[Cyprianus]]'', that is, the Saint of Necromancers, [[Cyprian of Antioch]], and by others to have been the Sixth and Seventh [[books of the Bible]] (or "Books of Moses" as the [[Pentateuch]] is known in Denmark and Norway) that were left out of the official Old Testament by the learned so that the common folk would not learn the knowledge held within the text.&lt;ref name=fol7576&gt;''Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land'' by Kathleen Stokker, Minnesota Historical Society, 2007, {{ISBN|0-87351-576-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87351-576-4}}. p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt; A formulary found in a "black book" recovered from a farm near [[Elverum]] contains many formulas such as one for a [[toothache]] that commands the user of the charm to write the words "Agerin, Nagerin, Vagerin, Jagerin, Ipagerin, Sipia" on a piece of paper using a new pen, cut the paper into three small pieces, place the first piece onto the tooth in the evening and in the morning spit the piece into the fire. This should then be repeated with the other pieces.&lt;ref name=fol78&gt;''Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land'' by Kathleen Stokker, Minnesota Historical Society, 2007, {{ISBN|0-87351-576-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87351-576-4}}. p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Another charm used for helping a woman who is having a difficult labour says to take two white lily roots and give them to the mother to eat.&lt;ref name=fol78/&gt;

There is an old idea that it was "Klok gumma" who often fell victim to the Witch Trials in the 17th century, but this does not appear to be true. However, some "wise women" and "wise men" were punished, not for witchcraft but often under the indictment point of "superstition" (Swedish: ''"Vidskepelse"'').&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"/&gt; In the 1670s, the wise man Johan Eriksson of [[Knutby]] was sentenced to seven [[running the gauntlet|gauntlet]] for "superstition", and again in the 1680s to nine.&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"/&gt; Per Ericsson of Dalarna, who read the diseases in wine, was punished both in 1720 and 1726.&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"/&gt; [[Brita Biörn]] of [[Gotland]] said in court that she learned to heal the sick when she spent some time in the [[underworld]], and she was sentenced to prison terms in both 1722 and 1737.&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"/&gt; The punishment of Sweden's "cunning folk" only seemed to have the opposite effect. Ericsson said that his clients had been coming in greater numbers after the rulings against him, and that he would be forced to hide if he was to obey the court and refrain from his practice, and in the Biörn case, the vicar complained that people from throughout the country came to seek her help, and relied on her as a God after her first sentence.&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"/&gt; The sentences, in reality, had the effect of good advertising, and Brita's daughter and granddaughter's daughter were also healing women.&lt;ref name="Jacob Christenssen 2005"/&gt;

There are many examples of well-known "cunning folk" who were known far beyond their village boundaries, such as [[Ingeborg i Mjärhult]] in the 18th century and [[Kisamor]] and [[Gota-Lena]] in the 19th century. In the 16th century, [[Brigitta Andersdotter]] was often hired by Queen [[Margaret Leijonhufvud]]. In [[Norway]] some women such as [[Mor Sæther]] (1793–1851), Anna Brandfjeld (1810–1905) and Valborg Valland (1821–1903) achieved national fame, unusual for women of the time.&lt;ref name=fol23/&gt;

The customs persisted well into the 20th century, until the medical doctor became more accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In the 19th century, every neighbourhood in Norway had at least one folk-healer.&lt;ref name=fol23&gt;''Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land'' by Kathleen Stokker, Minnesota Historical Society, 2007, {{ISBN|0-87351-576-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87351-576-4}}. p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs in folk-medicine, magic, and the use of "black books" were taken by [[Scandinavian American|migrants to the Americas]]. However, many beliefs died out in [[Norwegian-American]] communities around the 1920s with many not having knowledge of the subject or of the "black book". Knowledge of these beliefs did last longer in Norway, even if they were not commonly believed in by Norwegians.&lt;ref name=fol7576/&gt;

==Britain==
{{Main|Cunning folk in Britain}}

The term "cunning man" or "cunning woman" was most widely used in southern England and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], as well as in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="Hutton 1999. p. 85"&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people were also frequently known across England as "wizards", "wise men" or "wise women",&lt;ref name="Hutton 1999. p. 85"/&gt; or in southern England and Wales as "[[Conjuration|conjurers]]"&lt;ref name="Hutton 1999. p. 85"/&gt; or as "''dyn(es) hysbys''" (knowing man or woman) in the [[Welsh language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cornwall]] they were sometimes referred to as "pellars", which some etymologists suggest originated from the term "expellers", referring to the practice of expelling evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1999. p. 85"/&gt; Folklorists often used the term "[[white witch]]", though this was infrequently used amongst the ordinary folk as the term "witch" had general connotations of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Certain [[Christianity|Christian]] theologians and [[Christian Church|Church]] authorities{{who?|date=February 2018}} believed that the cunning folk, being practitioners of magic, were in league with the [[Devil]] and as such were akin to the more overtly Satanic and malevolent [[European witchcraft|witches]]. Partly because of this, laws were enacted across [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] that often condemned cunning folk and their magical practices, but there was no widespread persecution of them akin to the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe and North America|Witch Hunt]], largely because most common people firmly distinguished between the two: witches were seen as being harmful and cunning folk as useful.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 07-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England during the [[Mediæval Britain|Early Mediaeval]] period, various forms of folk magic could be found amongst the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who referred to such practitioners as ''wicca'' (male) or ''wicce'' (female), or at times also as ''dry'', practitioners of ''drycraeft'', the latter of which have been speculated as being anglicised terms for the Irish ''drai'', a term referring to [[druid]]s, who appeared as anti-Christian sorcerers in much Irish literature of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the spells and charms that had been used in the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon polytheist]] era continued to be used following [[Christianization]]. However, as historian Owen Davies noted, "although some such pre-Christian magic continued, to label it pagan is to misrepresent the people who used it and the context in which it was used."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], cunning folk had operated throughout the latter part of the Mediaeval and into the Early Modern period. In the 15th and 16th centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private lawsuits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the first of the [[Witchcraft Acts]], the [[Witchcraft_Act#Witchcraft_Act_1542|Witchcraft Act of 1542]], enacted under the reign of [[Henry VIII]], which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 04.&lt;/ref&gt; This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry's son [[Edward VI]], something that the historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was a moral issue that was better for the Church to deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 05.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cunning Woman.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A model of a 19th-century cunning woman in her house, at the [[Museum of Witchcraft]], [[Boscastle]] in England.]]

For the following few decades, the magical practices of the cunning folk remained legal, despite opposition from certain religious authorities. It was a time of great religious upheaval in the country as Edward's successor, his sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], reimposed [[Roman Catholicism]], before [[Anglicanism]] was once again restored under [[Elizabeth I]]. In 1563, after the return of power to the Anglican [[Church of England]], a bill was passed by parliament designed to illegalise "Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts", again being aimed at both the alleged witches and the cunning folk. However, this law was not as harsh as its earlier predecessor, with the death penalty being reserved for those who were believed to have conjured an evil spirit or murdered someone through magical means, whilst those for whom the use of magic was a first offence faced a year's imprisonment and four stints in the [[pillory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 06-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, this law would have little effect on the cunning folk, as "the attention and focus of the courts shifted away from the activities of cunning-folk and towards the ''maleficium'' of supposed witches"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 07.&lt;/ref&gt; - the [[Witch Hunt]] that had been raging in Scotland and in many parts of continental Europe had finally arrived in England.

Whilst across England, many people were accused of witchcraft by members of their local communities and put on trial, the cunning folk very rarely suffered a similar fate. It was unusual for a cunning man or woman to actually be accused of witchcraft; in the county of [[Essex]] for instance, whereas around four hundred people had been put on trial for witchcraft, only four of those were identifiably cunning folk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the professional witch-hunters and theologians continued to proclaim the cunning craft as being the same as witchcraft, with them both being caused by the Devil.

With the decline in the witch trials in the latter part of the 17th and early 18th centuries, partly due to the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] amongst the educated elite, a new law was introduced, the [[Witchcraft_Act#Witchcraft_Act_1735|Witchcraft Act of 1736]]. Unlike earlier laws, this did not accept the existence of magic, and took the opinion that there never had been any witches, and it therefore came down heavier on the cunning folk, who were claiming to perform genuine magical spells. It portrayed the cunning folk as practitioners of "explicitly fraudulent practices designed to fool the credulous" in order to gain money off of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav03|Davies 2003]]. p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

The belief in ''cunning folk'' and the use of "[[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|white magic]]" to be used for healing and as protection against "[[black magic]]" was once widespread in Germany;&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lucifer ascending: the occult in folklore and popular culture'' Bill Ellis, University Press of Kentucky, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8131-2289-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, during the early modern period such practices gradually became less accepted by the authorities, partly because the belief in "white magic" was viewed by the church authorities to be contrary to Biblical teachings and partly due to the loss of revenues for certain groups such as [[barber-surgeons]] and [[physicians]], as was the case in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] in which periodical action was taken against users of "white magic". The usual punishment was banishment rather than execution as was common for others convicted of [[witchcraft]] and the use of "black magic" &lt;ref name=roth&gt;''Witchcraft narratives in Germany: Rothenburg 1561-1652''Alison Rowlands, Manchester University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-7190-5259-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-5259-0}}, p.72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]] practitioners of folk-magic were almost always female; however, by contrast the ''Hexenmeister'' (also a term for a [[warlock]]) or ''Hexenfinder''&lt;ref&gt;''Beleg laut dem [http://drw-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/drw/ Deutschen Rechtswörterbuch] in: Basler Jahrbuch 1935, Seite 41 und in: Hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde Heft 2, Band 48/1932, Seite 44''&lt;/ref&gt; who hunted witches and "neutralised" them on behalf of society was always male.&lt;ref&gt;''Lucifer ascending: the occult in folklore and popular culture'' Bill Ellis, University Press of Kentucky, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8131-2289-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2289-2}}, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
The names used for cunning-folk in [[Italy]] vary from region to region, although such names include ''praticos'' (wise people), ''guaritori'' (healers), ''fattucchiere'' (fixers), ''donne che aiutano'' (women who help) and ''mago'', ''maga'' or ''maghiardzha'' (sorcerers). At times, they were sometimes called ''streghe'' (witches), although usually only "behind their backs or by those who either are sceptical of their powers or believe they deal in [[black magic]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]]. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other parts of Europe, such as Britain, the cunning profession survived the 20th century and into the early 21st, allowing Italian-American sociologist [[Sabina Magliocco]] to make a brief study of them (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the rest of Europe, the primary role of the Italian cunning-folk was apparently in healing, both through the use of herbs and through [[spiritual healing]]. The former required knowledge about various plants and herbs on the behalf of the cunning-person, although the spiritual healing was believed to come from an inner power, known as ''la forza'' (power), ''la virtù'' (virtue) or ''il Segno'' (the sign).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]]. p.114-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Such healing was often in the form of removing the malocchio, or [[evil eye]], which had cursed someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]]. p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian cunning craft was, and continued to remain rooted in the country's [[Roman Catholicism]], which is evident from the use of charms and prayers, which often call upon the aid of saints.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]]. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Such magical practitioners also widely believed that they dealt with spirit beings, both benevolent (who would aid them) and malevolent (whom they would have to combat). The latter included the unquiet dead as well as supernatural [[witches]] who were believed to cause harm to people, whilst the former included ancestors, the helpful dead and [[saints]], who could help defeat these malevolent entities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]]. p.117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Magical tools were also utilised by Italian cunning-folk, and whilst these varied between both regions and practitioners, these commonly include fiber ropes or cords to bind, knives or scissors to cut away illness, and mirrors and weapons to reflect or scare away malevolent spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag09|Magliocco 2009]]. p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danny McShain''' (October 30, 1912 to July 14, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He competed in the [[southern United States]] from the 1930s to the 1960s.&lt;ref name="
Lentz2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M. Lentz III|title=Biographical Dictionary of Professional Wrestling, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjGSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0505-0|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oww&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Danny McShain|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/d/danny-mcshain.html|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McShain was born on October 30, 1912 in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=NWA&gt;{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|pages=226–228|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional wrestling debut in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] on October 30, 1930. McShain later joined the [[United States Navy]], where he excelled as a [[boxing|boxer]] and won several championships.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
McShain's family moved to [[Glendale, California]], where he competed for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA).&lt;ref name=cac/&gt; He won his first championship, the [[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]], on October 11, 1937. Over the next ten years, he held the title another nine times.&lt;ref name=lw&gt;{{cite web|title=National Wrestling Association World Light Heavyweight Title|work=Wrestling Titles|accessdate=2009-01-12|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nba/nba-lh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later moved to [[Alvin, Texas]], where he continued to compete for the NWA.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt; He won the [[NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship]] on ten occasions between in 1948 and 1960 by defeating such wrestlers as [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Verne Gagne]].&lt;ref name=tx&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Heavyweight Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/tx-h.html|accessdate=2009-01-12|work=Wrestling Titles}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19, 1951, he also defeated Gagne to win the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt; In 1954, McShain won the MWA American Tag Team Championship with partner [[Oyama Kato]] while competing for the Midwest Wrestling Association in Ohio.&lt;ref name=oh&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio Tag Team Title|work=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/oh/mwa/oh-t.html|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, McShain worked as a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dory-funk.com/dory-valentine.htm|accessdate=2009-01-12|title=Dory Funk Jr. vs Johnny Valentine from the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston, Texas|last=Funk|first=Dory, Jr.|work=Official Home Page of Dory Funk Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ring style==
McShain wrestled as a "tough guy"; he proudly advertised his list of injuries to demonstrate the amount of punishment his body could take. He was also known for [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]], as he often cut his own forehead during matches to draw blood.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt; McShain was a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stiff|stiff]] worker, as he put legitimate force behind his punches and made contact with his opponents rather than pretending to hit them. He used a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] as one of his ring moves, in which he would hold his opponents upside-down and then drop them head-first to the ring floor. McShain attributed the piledriver to the deaths of two opponents.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt;

McShain used a cocky strut to anger opponents and spectators. His brother-in-law Donn Lewin stated that the strut was so arrogant that it "made you want to kill him" and that he walked the same way in real life.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lentz2003/&gt; McShain was arrested once after starting a riot by spitting tobacco juice from his trademark cigar on an opponent. His behavior was considered so inappropriate that he was summoned to appear in front of the Texas Gaming Commission.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt; He was also the subject of another inquiry, as he changed the pre-planned outcome of a bout midway through the match. Because there was a championship on the line and two promoters were arguing over the wrestling territory in which the match took place, the [[United States Department of Justice]] became involved. The match was the origin of the rule used in many promotions that prevents a title belt from changing hands when the match ends with a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].&lt;ref name=cac/&gt;

==Personal life==
In a match against [[Donn Lewin]], McShain broke Lewin's nose. Shortly thereafter, Lewin's father invited McShain to dinner. McShain met Donn's sister Sallee, whom he later married.&lt;ref name=cac&gt;{{cite web|title=Arkansas Forgotten Famous – Danny McShain|work=Cauliflower Alley Club|accessdate=2010-07-25|first=Thomas|last=Kroepfl|url=http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/memory-lane/arkansas-forgotten-famous-danny-mcshain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McShain appeared in the 1949 movie [[The Inspector General (film)|The Inspector General]], as well as several other films.&lt;ref name=cac/&gt;

==Championships and accomplishments==
*'''Midwest Wrestling Association'''
**MWA American Tag Team Championship (1 time)&lt;ref name=oh/&gt;
*'''[[National Wrestling Association]]'''
**[[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]] ([[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)#Title history|10 times]])&lt;ref name=lw/&gt;

*'''[[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]]'''
**([[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame#2010|Class of 2010]])
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;McShain won the title once just briefly before the formation of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] when the title was simply referred to as the Texas Heavyweight Championship.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''drug reference standard''' is a standardized substance which is used as a [[measurement]] base for similar substances. Where the exact active substances of a new [[drug]] are not known, a reference standard provides a calibrated level of biological effects against which new preparations of the drug can be compared.
drug reference solutions and patient education materials put the best available information into the hands of clinicians and patients. They supply critical information regarding dosage, efficacy, interactivity and allergies, even suggesting alternative therapies as appropriate.
Drug reference Standards are highly characterized physical specimens used in testing by [[pharmaceutical]] and related industries to help ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of medicines (drugs, biologics, and excipients), dietary supplements, and food ingredients. All [[chromatographic]] reference standards are supplied with a certificate of analysis certifying the identification and purity of the compound.

Drug reference Standards are highly characterized specimens of drug substances, excipients, reportable impurities, degradation products, compendial reagents, and performance calibrators.
They are explicitly required in many Pharmacopeial assays and tests and are provided solely for such use. Assessment of the suitability for use in other application(s) rests with the purchaser.

'''European Reference Materials''' or '''ERM''' are certified reference materials of high quality and reliability produced by members of the European Reference Materials consortium in the [[European Union]].

European Reference Materials are a tool for improving the confidence in, and the mutual recognition of test results and certificates in the European market. The Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) comply with high metrological requirements, ensuring traceability of measurements results, and are the end-point of the traceability chain, thus being primary standards in chemistry.

The European Reference Materials concept is a collaboration between:
* The [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements]] of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Joint Research Centre]], Geel, [[Belgium]] 
* The ''[[Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung]]'' ("Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing") [[Germany]] 
* [[LGC Ltd|LGC]], [[United Kingdom]]

'''''Hellzapoppin'''''' is a 1941 [[Universal Pictures]] adaptation of the musical of the [[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|same name]] directed by [[H.C. Potter]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/94794/Hellzapoppin-/overview |title= Hellzapoppin' |accessdate=August 17, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast includes [[Ole Olsen (comedian)|Ole Olsen]] and [[Chic Johnson]] (who produced and starred in it on Broadway), [[Martha Raye]], [[Mischa Auer]], [[Shemp Howard]], [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]] and The Six Hits.

==Plot==
[[Shemp Howard]] begins the film as the projectionist of a cinema, displaying on its screen what appears to be the start of a song-and-dance number whose classily dressed performers walk down a staircase - which collapses as in a fun-house ride, sliding them all straight to hell, where they are tortured by demons. Ole and Chic arrive in the midst of the mayhem by taxi, and after a bit of funny business step back to reveal that it's a movie sound stage. They work for Miracle Pictures, a company using the slogan "If it's a good picture, it's a Miracle!" A mousy screenwriter ([[Elisha Cook, Jr.]]) outlines his script for the screen adaptation of ''Hellzapoppin''', and the rest of the movie depicts Cook's script.  Among the topical humor is Johnson picking up a sled named "Rosebud" and saying "I thought they'd burnt that" (Olsen and Johnson were friends of [[Orson Welles]], whose film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' closes with [[Charles Foster Kane]]'s childhood sled being burnt).

The film has a frenetic pace, and often breaks the '[[Fourth wall]]', including inner 'fourth walls' introduced by its nonlinear, [[metafiction|metafictional]] narrative.

==Music==
The 1942 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Song for "Pig Foot Pete," (which lost to "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]"), was attributed to ''Hellzapoppin','' but the song never appeared in the film -- it was actually performed in another Universal production from the same year, the [[Abbott and Costello]] film ''[[Keep 'Em Flying]].''

'''The House of the Future''', more recently renamed '''Ty Gwyrdd''', is a modern house located in the [[St Fagans National History Museum]] on the western edge of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. Completed in 2000, it was originally a showcase of the latest green building technologies, but was later transformed into an education centre.&lt;ref name=backtothefuture&gt;{{cite news|author=Abby Alford |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/its-back-future-st-fagans-2092627 |title=It’s back to the future at St Fagans’ hi-tech house |work=Wales Online |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=2016-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by architectural writer [[Owen Hatherley]] as "a rather ambitiuous gesture for a place devoted to reconstructing the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Owen Hatherley |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cSPUXs7GcWIC&amp;pg=PA280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain |publisher=[[Verso Books]] |year=2010 |page=280 |isbn=978-1-84467-808-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
The House of the Future project was a joint venture between the [[National Museum of Wales]], [[BBC Wales]] and [[Redrow plc|Redrow Homes]]&lt;ref name=BBCfirsttenants&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/948766.stm |title=First tenants meet house of the future |work=BBC Wales |date=30 September 2000 |accessdate=2016-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with support from [[Malcolm Parry]], head of the [[Welsh School of Architecture]].&lt;ref name=THEchalet&gt;{{cite news|author=Adrian Mourby |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/how-green-is-my-chalet/157825.article |title=How green is my chalet |work=[[Times Higher Education]] |date=2 March 2001 |accessdate=2016-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An architectural competition was launched to design an adaptable, eco-home, which received 321 expressions of interest. These were reduced to a shortlist of six finalists, from which the winner was announced in July 1999 as [[London]] firm [[Jestico &amp; Whiles]].&lt;ref name=BBCfirsttenants /&gt; 

Redrow Homes were tasked with constructing the building within a £120,000 budget, but because many of the components of the project were not widely available (for example the oak frame and the green roof) the costs spiralled.&lt;ref name=THEchalet /&gt; It was completed in December 2000 and the process also resulted in three 40 minute [[BBC]] television programmes.&lt;ref name=BBCfirsttenants /&gt; 

A competition was then held to choose a family to live in the house for a week. It was won by the Powell family from [[Bridgend]], who enjoyed the open plan kitchen, but disliked the bedrooms and had problems with the computer controls.&lt;ref name=THEchalet /&gt;

The house was officially opened by [[Welsh Assembly]] Minister for Culture, [[Jenny Randerson]], at the end of April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edie.net/news/0/Welsh-Minister-for-Culture-opens-house-of-the-future/4157/ |title=Welsh Minister for Culture opens house of the future |publisher=Edie.net |date=27 April 2001 |accessdate=2016-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It went on to win several design awards, including the National Homebuilder Design Award (2001) and the Welsh Housing Design award (2002).&lt;ref name=jestico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesticowhiles.com/projects/residential/the-house-for-the-future/ |title=The House of the Future |publisher=Jestico + Whiles |accessdate=2016-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redrow meanwhile were criticised for building houses only 10 minutes away that were the antithesis of the St Fagans house, with ''[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]'' saying they were "getting ever further away, not closer, to the house of the future it has sponsored."&lt;ref name=telegraph2001&gt;{{cite news|author=Ross Clark |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/new-homes/4813562/Moving-away-from-the-future.html |title=Moving away from the future |work=The Telegraph |date=24 March 2001 |accessdate=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
The house was designed to make a net [[carbon dioxide]] emission of zero.&lt;ref name=jestico /&gt;

==Education centre==
After ten years many of the futuristic elements had been superseded by current technology, for example [[recycling]] of refuse was now common and low wattage lightbulbs were widely used in households. Other systems, for example the solar panels and ground source heat pumps remained prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name=backtothefuture /&gt; The contents had begun to look dated and it was claimed the museum's culture did not support serious investment to keep the technology ahead of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Owen Hatherley |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cSPUXs7GcWIC&amp;pg=PA282#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain |publisher=Verso Books |year=2010 |page=282 |isbn=978-1-84467-808-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With its days numbered as a futuristic exhibit, plans were put in place in 2009 to convert the house into an educational centre, named Ty Gwyrdd ('Green House'), to host environmental courses.&lt;ref name=backtothefuture /&gt;

During refurbishment of the museum's main building during the 2010s, Ty Gwyrdd was used as the main gift shop.

"'''Inside ''Family Guy'''''" is the fourth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Family Guy]]'', and the 273rd episode overall. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 23, 2016, and is written by [[Andrew Goldberg (writer)|Andrew Goldberg]] and directed by [[Joe Vaux]]. In this episode, viewers are taken [[making-of|behind the scenes]] of what happens when the characters of ''Family Guy'' are not involved in the production of their show and what they do during their free time, hosted by [[James Woods]].

==Plot==
In this behind the scenes episode hosted by [[James Woods]], viewers get to see what happens to the characters when they're off the air. Through interviews, we see the characters acting like they do when on the show, like [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] acting stupid and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] acting pretentious. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] reveals that he dislikes the show and hosts a [[pizza]] commercial that promotes his online [[crepe]] delivery website.

As James Woods takes the people through the halls of the production offices, different props are seen like Gary the No-Trash [[Cougar]] from "[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]", the Petoria flag from "[[E. Peterbus Unum]]", the Banana Brian suit from "[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]", a cartoon version of [[The Muppets|Muppet]] [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] from "[[Foreign Affairs (Family Guy)|Foreign Affairs]]", a "What Really Grinds My Gears" poster from "[[Stewie B. Goode]]", [[Meg Griffin|Meg]]'s "[[Megatron]]" birth certificate from "[[A Fistful of Meg]]", Stewie's ray gun, Stewie's "Die Lois" needlework from "[[North by North Quahog]]", a Peter vs. the Giant Chicken fight poster, and artwork from the 2009 Emmy screener DVD. [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] is revealed to be a writer on the show as well. [[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]] is shown passing by Meg and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] during their interview, dressed as [[Batman]], doing the Batclimb from the 1960s' ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV show despite [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s deal with Adam West to not make his ''Family Guy'' counterpart be dressed as Batman as West has gained excessive attention as the '60s Batman.

The characters are interviewed as Lois' dressing room has pictures of ''Family Guy'' guest stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Ryan Reynolds]], and [[Gene Simmons]]. Due to Peter's behavior and an anonymous complaint from Stewie, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]'s [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]s [[Dana Walden]] and Gary Newman decide to fire him. Peter is oblivious to this. At a [[Read-through|table-read]], Peter slowly discovers the news when he reads a script that depicts him dying and being replaced by [[David Spade]] as a character named Uncle Ricky and other possibilities in the show that may cause him to return (like Stewie's time machine catching a virus and Chris dreaming) are thrown out of the window. When confronted by Peter about the script mentioning Peter's death, Gary tells him that the network has decided that they can't deal with his attitude anymore. When they give Peter another chance, he acts up again saying "Fuck you!" to Gary, and Gary fires him. When his family backs them up, Peter leaves the studio in a huff as everyone nods at his departure. As Peter approaches the gate, the gate guard Smitty tells Peter that his penis is out.

At a hotel, Peter tries to find acting work someplace else along with other interests. After Peter is evicted from the hotel for selling the towels and is thrown out by "their Uncle Phil" in the style of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', he decides to stay in an apartment room that has a "Brooks Was Here" carving from ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''.

Other behind-the-scenes works are shown like:

* The people who handled the Peter-based vehicles like how the Petercopter was once used by [[SEAL Team Six]] to help [[Death of Osama bin Laden|in their mission to take out]] [[Osama bin Laden]].
* James the Cameraman (who James Woods misread as [[James Cameron]]) is the director of the cutaway scenes who distributes Vicodin to the producers.
* David Spade is shown talking to the Greased-Up Deaf Guy (who speaks in a normal voice off-set) as Herbert takes a liking to David Spade.

At the tape night, the Griffins admit that they have trepidation at doing the show without Peter and Spade is revealed to be needy. At [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], Peter's attempt to blend in using an obscure character fails. Upon seeing a bus with a ''Family Guy'' logo, he decides to go back to the FOX Studio. Once at FOX Studios, Peter tries to make it past Smitty. He was only admitted after pitching an idea to FOX of a show to Dana Walden and Gary Newman that doesn't make sense and is in its third season.

On the air, Peter storms in and apologizes for his behavior and even gives Chris a t-shirt of [[Kermit the Frog]] dressed as a hip-hop star. The Griffin family are able to accept him. When he thinks it's too late since they don't have a script, Lois conveniently takes out a script for a new episode with Peter in it alive. Peter also commented that he got David Spade removed from the show by having "[[Sofía Vergara]] deported." It is then shown that David Spade is dressed as Sofía Vergara when working on ''[[Modern Family]]''.

In the interviews, it's revealed that the process of Peter being fired was staged and that the script of Peter being fired was fake. Peter has since returned to his old ways soon. So the family and crew now do this every week as an intervention for Peter, not letting him know it's already been done the week before.

James Woods then closes out the episode by showing moments where Peter was hit in the crotch with a bag full of nickels. That moment was dedicated in memory of Peter's left testicle.

==Reception==
The episode was watched by an audience of 2.49 million viewers, a decrease from [[American Gigg-olo|the previous episode]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-oct-16-2016/|title=‘NCIS: LA’ adjusts up, ‘Simpsons’ adjusts down: Sunday final ratings|date=2016-10-18|work=TV By The Numbers by zap2it.com|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making it the third most-watched show of the night, behind ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-oct-23-2016/|title=‘Bob’s Burgers’ and ‘The Simpsons’ adjust down: Sunday final ratings|date=2016-10-25|work=TV By The Numbers by zap2it.com|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JB Catalogue 2012 cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the 2012 edition of the catalogue.]]
'''''The J.B. Catalogue of Malta Stamps and Postal History''''' is [[Malta]]'s leading stamp catalogue. It was first published in 1984 and is published bi-annually by Joseph Buttigieg of Sliema Stamp Shop. It is currently in its twenty-second edition (2014). The catalogue originally used the [[Stanley Gibbons|SG]] numbering system, but from the early 1990s it had separate numbering. It is in English and the pricing was in [[Maltese pound]]s until 2006, and [[euro]]s from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buttigieg|first1=Joseph|title=The J.B.

'''Joseph Stewart''' (January 29, 1822 &amp;ndash; April 23, 1904) was an officer in the [[United States Army]] notable for serving as commander of [[Fort Alcatraz]], [[Fort Churchill State Historic Park|Fort Churchill]] and the [[Department of Alaska]].  His name is occasionally seen as ''Jasper Stewart''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ebcUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 History of Nevada p.65]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Joseph Stewart was born in Adair County, Kentucky and graduated from the [[U.S. Military Academy]] at West Point in 1842.  He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery and later the 3rd U.S. Artillery during the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]].  On January 3, 1856 he was promoted [[captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] of Company H in the 3rd Artillery.  In December 1859 Captain Stewart took command of [[Fort Alcatraz]].  In the years immediately preceding the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Stewart transformed the fort into the most powerful coastal defense in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/CA-Alcatraz.html The Long History of Alcatraz]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during Stewart's time on Alcatraz that it took on the role of a prison for the first time.  11 soldiers under Stewart's command were imprisoned there and soon other nearby forts were sending prisoners there too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-alcatraz.html Long History of Alcatraz]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyramid Lake War===
In 1860 a vigilante force was soundly defeated by [[Northern Paiute|Paiute Indians]] in a [[First Battle of Pyramid Lake|battle near Pyramid Lake]] in present-day [[Nevada]].  This defeat prompted the Federal government to dispatch a contingent of the U.S. Army to the area.  Captain Stewart took command of the so-called "Carson Valley Expedition" composed of 200 regular army soldiers from the 3rd Artillery and 6th U.S. Infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinenevada.org/pyramid_lake_war Pyramid Lake War]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart was, however, subordinated to Col. [[John C. Hays]] who was in command of a regiment of U.S. Volunteers.  Hays and Stewart defeated the Paiutes in the [[second Battle of Pyramid Lake]].

===Fort Churchill===
While Hays' volunteers disbanded shortly after the battle, Stewart's regulars remained in the area for some time.  Stewart was ordered to construct a permanent army post in the area.  Eventually, he chose a site along the [[Carson River]] which he suggested should be named in honor of General [[Sylvester Churchill]].  The U.S. Army confirmed the site and name in August and construction of [[Fort Churchill (Nevada)|Fort Churchill]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Totten p.16&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction was completed in 1861 with Stewart as the post's first commander.

===Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War]] Stewart briefly returned to command Fort Alcatraz.  In 1861 he was transferred to the defenses of Washington, DC and commanded the artillery in [[George A. McCall|George A. McCall's]] division of the [[Army of the Potomac]] from December 1861 to February 1862.  From April to October 1862 he served as recruiting officer for San Francisco and was the Inspector General of the [[Humboldt Military District]] during the Winter of 1862/1863.  He was chief of artillery for the [[Department of the Pacific]] from April to July 1863 and ended the war as recruiting officer for Salem MA from November to December 1865.  On December 11, 1865, Stewart was promoted [[Major (United States)|Major]] in the 4th U.S. Artillery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Army/USMA/Cullums_Register/1128*.html Cullum's Register: Joseph Stewart]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Civil War===
Following the Civil War Stewart commanded various forts along the eastern United States including [[Fort McHenry]] and [[Fort Macon State Park|Fort Macon]]. He served as the fifth commander of the [[Department of Alaska]], from January 4, 1873 to April 20, 1874, then returned to California in command of the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] from May 8 to June 17, 1875.  From 1876-1879 Stewart was in command of [[Fort Canby]] engaged against Native Americans during the [[Bannock War]].  On July 18, 1879, Stewart was promoted Lieutenant Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Artillery.  He retired on August 25, 1879 and died in Berkeley, CA on April 23, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Army/USMA/Cullums_Register/1128*.html Cullum's Register: Joseph Stewart]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried at the Presidio in San Francisco, CA.

The '''Justicialist Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Justicialista}}, {{IPA-es|paɾˈtiðo xustisjaˈlista|IPA}}), or '''PJ''', is a [[Peronism|Peronist]] political party in [[Argentina]], and the largest component of the Peronist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pj.org.ar/|title=Partido Justicialista|website=Pj.org.ar|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently the main opposition party. Former presidents [[Carlos Menem]], [[Eduardo Duhalde]], [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] have been elected from this party. Justicialists have been the largest party in the [[Argentine Congress|Congress]] covering nearly the entire period since 1987.

The Justicialist Party is the largest party in the Congress; however, this does not reflect the divisions within the party over the role of [[Kirchnerism]], the [[left-wing populist]] faction of the party, which is opposed by the [[Federal Peronism|dissident Peronists]], the right-wing conservative faction of the party.

==Party history==
The Justicialist Party was founded in 1947 by [[Juan Perón|Juan]] and [[Eva Perón|Evita Perón]], and superseded the [[Labour Party (Argentina)|Labour Party]] on which Perón had been elected a year earlier. Following the enactment of women's right to vote in 1948, a [[Female Peronist Party|Peronist Women's Party]], led by the First Lady, was also established. All Peronist entities were banned from elections after 1955, when the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' overthrew Perón, and civilian governments' attempt to lift Peronism's ban from legislative and local elections in 1962 and 1965 resulted in military coups.&lt;ref name=crassweller&gt;Crassweller, Robert. ''Perón and the Enigmas of Argentina.'' W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Basing itself on the policies espoused by Juan Perón as president of Argentina, the party's platform has from its inception centered around [[populism]], and its most consistent base of support has historically been the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]], Argentina's largest trade union. Perón ordered the mass [[nationalization]] of [[public services]], strategic industries, and the critical farm export sector, while enacting progressive labor laws and social reforms, and accelerating public works investment.&lt;ref name=crassweller/&gt;

His tenure also favored [[technical school]]s while harassing university staff, and promoted urbanization as it raised taxes on the [[Agriculture in Argentina|agrarian sector]]. These trends earned Peronism the loyalty of much of the working and lower classes, but helped alienate the upper and middle class sectors of society. Censorship and repression intensified, and following his loss of support from the influential [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Catholic Church]], Perón was ultimately deposed in a violent 1955 coup.&lt;ref name=crassweller/&gt;

The alignment of these groups as pro or anti-Peronist largely endured, though the policies of Peronism itself varied greatly over the subsequent decades, as did, increasingly, those put forth by its many competing figures. During Perón's exile, it became a [[big tent]] party united almost solely by their support for the aging leader's return. A series of violent incidents, as well as Perón's negotiations with both the military regime and diverse political factions, helped lead to his return to Argentina in 1973, and to his [[Argentine general election, September 1973|election]].&lt;ref name="Poneman, Daniel 1987"&gt;Poneman, Daniel. ''Argentina: Democracy on Trial''. Paragon House, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

An impasse followed in which the PJ had a place both for leftist armed organizations such as ''[[Montoneros]]'', and far-right factions such as [[José López Rega]]'s [[Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance]]. Following Perón's death in 1974, however, this tenuous understanding disintegrated, and a wave of [[political violence]] ensued, ultimately resulting in a [[March 1976 coup]]. The [[Dirty War]] of the late 1970s, which cost hundreds of Peronists (among thousands more) their lives, solidified the party's populist outlook, particularly following the failure of conservative Economy Minister [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]'s [[free trade]] and [[Big Bang (financial markets)|deregulatory]] policies after 1980.&lt;ref name="Poneman, Daniel 1987"/&gt;

In the first democratic elections after the end of the dictatorship of the [[National Reorganization Process]], in 1983, the Justicialist Party lost to the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR). Six years later, it returned to power with [[Carlos Menem]], during whose term [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|the Constitution was reformed]] to allow for presidential reelection. Menem (1989–1999) adopted [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] right-wing policies which changed the overall image of the party.&lt;ref name="Argentina's new president sworn in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1738175.stm|title=Argentina's new president sworn in|date=13 October 2017|accessdate=13 October 2017|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justicialist Party was defeated by a coalition formed by the UCR and the centre-left [[FrePaSo]] (itself a left-wing offshoot of the PJ) in 1999, but regained political weight in the [[Elections in Argentina, 2001|2001 legislative elections]], and was ultimately left in charge of managing the selection of an interim president after the economic [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|collapse of December 2001]]. Justicialist [[Eduardo Duhalde]], chosen by Congress, ruled during 2002 and part of 2003.&lt;ref name="Argentina's new president sworn in"/&gt;

The [[Argentine general election, 2003|2003 elections]] saw the constituency of the party split in three, as Carlos Menem, [[Néstor Kirchner]] (backed by Duhalde) and [[Adolfo Rodríguez Saá]] ran for the presidency leading different party coalitions. After Kirchner's victory, the party started to align behind his leadership, moving slightly to the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2937282.stm|title=Argentina hopes for new beginning|date=26 May 2003|accessdate=13 October 2017|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6802448|title=The return of populism|date=12 April 2006|accessdate=13 October 2017|newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justicialist Party effectively broke apart in the [[Argentine legislative election, 2005|2005 legislative elections]] when two factions ran for a Senate seat in [[Buenos Aires Province]]: [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] (then the [[first lady]]) and [[Hilda González de Duhalde]] (wife of former president Duhalde). The campaign was particularly vicious. Kirchner's side allied with other minor forces and presented itself as a heterodox, left-leaning [[Front for Victory]] (FpV), while Duhalde's side stuck to older Peronist tradition. González de Duhalde's defeat to her opponent marked, according to many political analysts, the end to Duhalde's dominance over the province, and was followed by a steady defection of his supporters to the winner's side.

Néstor Kirchner proposed the entry of the party into the [[Socialist International]] in February 2008. His dominance of the party was undermined, however, by the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]], when a bill raising export taxes was introduced with presidential support. Subsequent growers' lockouts helped result in the defection of numerous Peronists from the FpV caucus, and further losses during the [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|2009 mid-term elections]] resulted in the loss of the FpV absolute majorities in both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/30/elpais/p-01949361.htm|title=Tras la derrota, Kirchner renunció a la jefatura del PJ y dejó a Scioli|first=|last=Clarin.com|website=Clarin.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Nationalism sidebar}}
The Justicialist Party was, since its foundation, a [[Peronism|Peronist]] [[catch-all party]],&lt;ref name=catch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/opinion/editorial/10/29/the-death-of-nestor-kirchner/|title=The death of Néstor Kirchner|date=29 October 2010|website=Stabroeknews.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the figure of [[Juan Perón]] and his wife [[Eva Perón|Eva]].

However, another wing of the party was well more than the left-wing because of extraction, [[Socialism|socialist]] or [[Radical Civic Union|radical]], which was headed by [[Héctor José Cámpora]]. In the years '60 '70 was also very active in the movement of the [[Montoneros]], [[Marxism|Marxist]]-inspired closer to Peronism.

From 1974 to 1976, under the leadership of [[Isabel Peron]] (which was maneuvered by [[José López Rega]], leader of the internal right-wing after the death of Lastiri) the Justicialist Party is no longer characterized by [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]] tones and [[revolution]]aries, but for the rabid [[anti-communism]], which became the main bulwark in South America, and for the support to [[economic liberalism]]. This line continued even after the [[military dictatorship]] of the [[National Reorganization Process]], with the Government of [[Carlos Menem]] until that of [[Eduardo Duhalde]]. Since the return of Peron in 1973 the party actually had already moved to [[Third Position]] [[left-wing]] of Argentine political spectrum, assuming the characteristics of a [[centre-right]] party.

In 2003 the party has undergone an abrupt turnaround, with the rise of a faction, known as the "[[Front for Victory]]", led by [[Néstor Kirchner]]. These led to the coinage of the term "[[Kirchnerismo]]", to indicate a left-wing ideology that mixed of [[socialism]], [[left-wing nationalism]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]]. Néstor Kirchner was elected [[President of Argentina]], becoming popular in a short time. After his death, his wife [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Fernández]] took over the leadership of the Front for Victory, which continues to be a major faction of the Justicialist Party, with the head of the party being [[Eduardo Fellner]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13053">A '''landrush period''' is the time during which [[domain name]]s are available for registration, usually to a closed group (usually through a premium price), to entities that do not own a trademark in the name they wish to register, for example generic terms like ''loan'' or ''car'', and thus would not qualify for registration during the [[sunrise period]].&lt;ref name="MOBI"&gt;{{cite web|title=.MOBI Domain Name FAQs|url=http://www.domainpeople.com/faqs/mobi.html|publisher=DomainPeople|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Orders may or may not be treated on a first-come-first-served basis. This period follows the sunrise period just after the launch of a new top-level domain or second-level domain during which, for example, owners of [[trademark]]s may register a domain name containing the owned mark, but a landrush period precedes a period of general availability, when any qualifying entity can register any name on a first come first-served basis.

==Launch Phase==
As launches occur, gTLDs will follow a cycle of different launch phases. All launch phases start with the Sunrise Period, there is flexibility with the other stages.&lt;ref name="Launch_Phases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Phases|url=http://www.opensrs.com/site/services/new-tlds/launch-phases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunrise Period===
{{Main|Sunrise period}}

The [[Sunrise period]] is often a 30-day (or longer) phase during which trademark owners can purchase domain names before they are offered to the general public. This period of time allows for companies to keep the domain name associated with their brand before someone can publicly purchase the domain. Often domains such as  info, mobi, and eu are picked up by companies during the sunrise period that precedes the larger landrush period.&lt;ref&gt;ASCIO. (2014). Sunrise/landrush/general availibility. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.ascio.com/newgtlds/landrush |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325193519/http://www.ascio.com/newgtlds/landrush |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to participate in the sunrise period, one has to be a registered trademark holder with the Trademark Clearing House. The allowance of time for each registered domain name in the sunrise period is two years. After that, the trademark holder needs to reclaim their domain.

===Landrush Period===

[[ICANN|The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) defines the landrush period as the time between the [[Sunrise Period]] and [[General availability release|General availability]]  during which applications for a domain name may be received from any interested eligible party.&lt;ref name="ICANN"/&gt;

Registries often have the option of including a landrush period, but this process is not mandatory. In the landrush period registration is open to everyone, but the registration is sold at a higher price than the regular price. Also some domains during a landrush period could be auctioned or on a "first come, first-served" basis.&lt;ref name ="Launch_Phases"/&gt;

The only domains not offered to everyone during the landrush period are Premium Domains. Each registry reserves the right to reserve high value or "Premium" domains and to sell or auction those domains at elevated prices.&lt;ref name ="Launch_Phases"/&gt;

On average, a Landrush Period will last about 30 days and, in this period, applications for domain names may be received from any interested and eligible parties before registration is open for general availability.

In 2012 a digital land rush was expected because of a possible creation of new domain names and web addresses. [[ICANN|The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), a non-profit, is currently responsible for regulation of domain names, and ICANN predicted a landrush period for the new domain names.&lt;ref name="ICANN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Policy 2013|url=http://www.icann.org/sites/default/files/tlds/xn--ngbc5azd/xn--ngbc5azd-launch-policy-23oct13-en.pdf|publisher=The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN surveyed the public for new possible names, and the organization had a goal of trying to expand new top-level domain names. As new domain names are created, ICANN hopes for many overseers to sell their name to registrars. According to ICANN, the front-runner for a new domain name is ".shop" and the goal is to increase supply and demand for domain names. A landrush period will occur over the creation of new domain names because as the new domain names are created, overseers will sell their domain names, which will cause businesses and individuals to rush to buy new names. This increase in demand causes a landrush period and leads to increase consumption of domain names. In addition to an increase of demand in a landrush period, ICANN hopes to have a greater landrush period than ".jobs", which was a failure.&lt;ref name= "suntimes" &gt;{{cite web|title=Digital land rush expected for new Internet ‘top-level’ domain names|url=http://www.suntimes.com/9946513-418/digital-land-rush-expected-thursday-for-new-internet-top-level-domain-names.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310054746/http://www.suntimes.com/9946513-418/digital-land-rush-expected-thursday-for-new-internet-top-level-domain-names.html|archive-date=10 March 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ICANN's Procedure for Landrush====

According to The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in order to participate in a Landrush period applicants must submit an application for a domain name that was not previously allocated, not eligible for allocation, and is not subject of an application that is being currently processed by the auction provider.&lt;ref name="ICANN" /&gt; Also multiple applications for the same domain name will be settled with an auction. In addition, a claims period will be in effect during the entire duration of the Landrush period and the applicant must accept the information contained within a Claim Notice.&lt;ref name="ICANN" /&gt;

===General Availability Period===
{{Main|General availability release}}

The General Availability phase follows all Sunrise and Landrush periods. This is an open period based on the "first come, first served" policy to the public.  Typically, 90 calendar days after General Availability opens for each new gLTD, registries must provide Trademark Claims.&lt;ref name=Launch_Phases /&gt;

ICANN defines General Availability is the point in time following which requests to register a domain name may be received from any eligible part on the same "first come, first served" basis. Another name for General Availability is also General Registration.&lt;ref name="ICANN" /&gt;

==Major Landrush Periods==

===First Major Landrush===

Though [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs) were first established in 1984, the first major domain landrush was mostly centered around the [[dot-com bubble]], which took place from 1997 until 2003. With the release of the official generic top-level domains, [[dot-com companies]] began to arise. This bubble involved investors pouring money into internet startups during the 1990s with hopes that those companies would one day become profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies were solely based on the [[World Wide Web]], but usually had no strategic business model to support any revenue stream. The result was the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], which ultimately ended the first major landrush period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's Why The Dot Com Bubble Began And Why It Popped|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-the-dot-com-bubble-began-and-why-it-popped-2010-12|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of the first major landrush was [[cybersquatting]], a practice in which individuals strategically purchase high-value domain names for resale at a higher price. However, this practice was made illegal with the passage of the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] in 1999.

===Second Major Landrush===
February 4, 2014, marked the beginning of the second major domain landrush. This landrush commenced the production of new web addresses, which has not occurred since 2000, when ICANN last accepted applications for top-level domains.The process of applying for new domain names runs through ICANN, the non-profit that manages several Internet-related tasks. ICANN’s process can be an expensive one, demanding an initial fee of $185,000. Additionally, the application process is a lengthy one, in which ICANN believes could take up to a year. Furthermore, the domain names are not simply given to anyone. ICANN reviews critical details regarding applicants’ financial stability, technical abilities and their intentions with the domain.&lt;ref name="suntimes"/&gt;

Andy Vuong of the ''[[Denver Post]]'' wrote that some of these new domains will, "target specific industries, such as .attorney and .ski, or social causes, such as .hiv, which will be dedicated to sites that contribute to the fight against HIV and AIDS".&lt;ref name="denverpost"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Dot-what? Web land rush 2.0 to feature .wtf, .beer, .porn domains|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25299028/dot-what-web-land-rush-2-0-feature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential reason to create new gTLDs is due to the fact that there are not enough domain names available for businesses or individuals to create sensible and logical URLs. A vast amount of .com’s are in use already, and individuals and businesses are having difficulties in creating a fitting and simple domain. ICANN’s Cyrus Namazi told Quartz that, “We’ve gone from an average of four or five letters in a second-level domain to something in excess of 14 to find what you’re looking for”.&lt;ref name= "qz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirani|first=Leo|title=The biggest land rush in the history of the internet starts on February 4|url=http://qz.com/165238/the-biggest-land-rush-in-the-history-of-the-internet-begins-on-february-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One main argument against the creation of new domains is that the days of individuals typing in full URLs is slowly dying out. For example, internet browsers such as [[Google Chrome]]’s use an [[address bar]] which doubles as a search field.&lt;ref name= "qz"/&gt;

==Global Landrush Periods==

{{Main|.eu}}

===The .eu Landrush Period===

One of the major landrush periods that occurred was the [[.eu]] TLD (top level domain). The “.eu [domain] is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union” and it was approved in March 2005. It is currently one of the largest European ccTLD. The sunrise period for this domain was divided into two separate parts—the first opened on December 7, 2005, while the second began on February 7, 2006. The first phase was meant for “registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names” leaving the second phase open to “company, trade, and personal names”.

After the sunrise period comes the landrush, which, for .eu, occurred on April 7, 2006, when registration for the domain became possible for “non-trademark holders”. In order to request a domain, people had registrars place their requests into a long queue. Many registrars were backed up with too many requests, so registering for a domain essentially became a game. People would figure out which registrars had already completed many requests, which left these registrars with few requests, and “allow[ed] people to ‘beat the queue.’” The way that [[EURid]] (European Registry for Internet Domains) designed the land rush for the .eu domain allowed for over 700,000 domains to be registered within the first 4 hours. Four months later, in August 2006, there were 2 million registered .eu domains.

The process that EURid created for this domain was criticized for using “phantom” registrars. The difference between something known as a “phantom” registrar and a regular, official registrar, is that an official registrar has only one chance to register a specific domain, while a “phantom” registrar crowds out the .eu domain and has multiple opportunities to register the same domain. This suspicion arose due to 400 registered LLC companies that had similar addresses and contact information. Bringing this realization to the public's attention was the founder of [[Go Daddy]] who felt that these 400 companies were classified as "phantom registrars 'created to hijack the .EU land rush.'" &lt;ref name="bobparsons"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parsons|first=Bob|title=The .EU landrush fiasco. A bumbling registry allows Europe's very own domain name to be highjacked!|url=http://www.bobparsons.me/archive_article.php?entry_id=113|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was released in December 2009 and went on to break multiple [[box office]] records in various markets. Worldwide, it became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing movie of all time]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [[List of fastest-grossing films|fastest movie to gross]] $1&amp;nbsp;billion through $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref name=":58" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":59" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":61" /&gt; while also setting the records for the highest grosses in the [[3D film|3D]]&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo1" /&gt; and [[IMAX]]&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; formats, respectively. In its domestic market of the United States and Canada, it set the records for the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|highest-grossing film]]&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; and [[List of highest-grossing second weekends for films|second]] through seventh weekends,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; as well as the fastest to gross $500&amp;nbsp;million through $750&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Elsewhere, it became the highest-grossing film of all time in over 30 markets including [[List of highest-grossing films in China|China]],&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt; [[List of highest-grossing films in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]],&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; [[List of highest-grossing films in Romania|Romania]],&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo1" /&gt; [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea|South Korea]],&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; [[List of highest-grossing films in Taiwan|Taiwan]],&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo5" /&gt; and [[List of highest-grossing films in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo5" /&gt;

Box office analysts identified several factors contributing to the film's box office success. Among these were the relative lack of competition owing to the release date, a marketing strategy that emphasized the novelty of the cinematic experience leading viewers to watch it in the theater rather than at home, positive [[word of mouth]] and repeat viewings increasing the film's staying power in cinemas, an ability to attract audiences across the globe, and premium ticket prices from 3D and IMAX showings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/how-avatar-can-beat-titanic-71031|title=How 'Avatar' Can Beat 'Titanic'|date=2010-01-05|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1628513/how-will-avatar-fare-at-the-box-office-experts-weigh-in/|title=How Will 'Avatar' Fare At The Box Office?

It also exceeded the previous record for highest gross in the IMAX format by a factor of more than three&lt;!-- $243 million / $71 million = 3.42... &gt; 3 --&gt;.

The '''Lost Blue Bucket Mine''' is a [[Lost mines|lost mine]] reputed to be located along the [[Meek Cutoff|Meek Wagon Train]] trail between the present day cities of [[Vale, Oregon|Vale]] and [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] in [[Oregon]], United States. Its discovery traces back to 1845, several years before the start of the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bowmanmuseum.org/files/Newsletter_June_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100423/http://www.bowmanmuseum.org/files/Newsletter_June_2010.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legend==

===Points of agreement===

The various versions of the legend tend to agree on a few key points &lt;ref name="thegeozone.com"&gt;The Lost Blue Bucket Mine: [http://www.thegeozone.com/treasure/nevada/tales/nv002a.jsp The Lost Blue Bucket Mine], accessdate: April 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Lost Oregon-bound emigrants discovered it in summer 1845,
# The deposit is coarse [[placer gold]] in a dry [[stream bed]] or [[canyon]],
# The canyon is bottomed with [[lava]] pocked with cavities and [[potholes]].
[[File:Covered Wagon on Trail sketch.png|350px|thumb|left|border|A drawing of a pioneer [[covered wagon]]]]

===Versions of the legend===

One version states that a [[wagon train]] got lost off the [[Meek Cutoff]] of the [[Oregon Trail]], near the [[Malheur River]]. Three young men (or boys, or a single girl — accounts vary) went to fetch water, and while doing so put some shiny rocks into a blue bucket. Older members of the party said it was [[copper]]. Someone asked, "Was there much of it?" One replied, "We could have filled one of these blue buckets". This was 1845, before the [[California Gold Rush]], and back then many could not recognize [[gold]]. A Mrs. Fisher kept one [[Gold nugget|nugget]] and left the rest behind. The wagons eventually reached what is now [[The Dalles, Oregon]] in October, 1845. The single nugget was eventually recognized as gold.

Another version holds that when the [[Stephen Meek]] Wagon train stopped along the trail in present-day [[Crook County, Oregon|Crook County]] near Bear Creek, children went to gather water at some distance from the camp. They returned with a blue bucket filled with shiny pebbles. An old-timer in the party stated that the pebbles were made of copper. One of the families, however, kept several of the pebbles as souvenirs. Years later, and after having moved to California, the family came across the pebbles in a dresser drawer. By this time, the [[California Gold Rush]] had occurred, and the expertise was available to recognize that the pebbles were in fact gold. However, no-one could remember the precise location in which the pebbles had been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bowmanmuseum.org/Buybooks2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223021044/http://www.bowmanmuseum.org/Buybooks2.html |archivedate=2010-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crooked River Map.png|280px|thumb|right|border|The watershed of Oregon's [[Crooked River (Oregon)|Crooked River]]]]

==Results==

The legend sparked a [[gold rush]] to the area of modern-day [[Baker City, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="oregongold.net"&gt;Oregon Gold: [http://www.oregongold.net/tag/baker/ Baker - Oregon Gold], accessdate: April 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==

If the mine existed, its location is unknown; the area comprises perhaps {{convert|40000|sqmi|km2}}. &lt;ref name="thegeozone.com"/&gt; It is believed to be on a [[tributary]] of the [[John Day River]], or in another version, on a Bear Creek tributary of the [[Crooked River (Oregon)|Crooked River]]. There are three real [[Mining|mines]] in the U.S. named the "Blue Bucket", including one in [[Grant County, Oregon]], that are unrelated to the lost mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:2:::NO::P1_FNAME,P1_CLASS:Blue_Bucket_Mine,Mine |title=GNIS query "Blue Bucket Mine"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2370">'''The Museum of Sugar''' (in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]: ''Museu do Açúcar'') was a [[museum]] devoted to the history of the [[sugar industry in Brazil]]. It was envisioned by Gil de Methódio Maranhão and created on August 3, 1960 by Resolution 1745 of the [[Institute of Sugar and Alcohol]] (IAA).

The first exhibition was in [[Rio de Janeiro]] at IAA headquarters. The museum was relocated to [[Recife]] on January 30, 1961  and into its own building as the ''O Açúcar e o Homem'' (Sugar and Man) exhibit in October 1963. The museum was designed by [[Carlos Antônio Falcão Correia Lima]] in the Casa Forte neighbourhood. The landscaping was planned by agronomist [[Dárdano de Andrade Lima]]. [[Aloísio Magalhães]] organized sugarcane plantings in a design with a vertical [[mill-stone]] from the Vila da Rainha Plantation in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and a horizontal mill-stone from the Camaragibe Plantation in [[Pernambuco]]. The museum acquired an extensive collection of memorabilia and artifacts. Conferences and courses were hosted and the ''Revista do Museu do Açúcar'' (Museum of Sugar Magazine) was published from 1968 until 1973. Authors of articles included José Antônio Gonsalves de Mello, Ariano Suassuna, Fernando Pio, and Jayme Griz.

The Sugar Museum and its holdings were acquired by the Joaquim Nabuco Institute for Social Research, which is now the [[Joaquim Nabuco Foundation]]. The museum and all its patrimony were transferred to the Institute through Law nº 6.456 on 26 October 1977. The museum became the Joaquim Nabuco Foundation's [[Museum of the Northeast Man]], where the archives from the sugar museum are held.&lt;ref&gt;Lúcia Gaspar [http://basilio.fundaj.gov.br/pesquisaescolar_en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=973&amp;Itemid=1 Museum of Sugar] Joaquim Nabuco Foundation Librarian&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden''' is the most recent addition to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[United States]].  It is located on the [[National Mall]] between the National Gallery's West Building and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]].

Completed and opened to the public on 23 May 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting several pieces from the museum's contemporary sculpture collection.&lt;ref name="WaPost"/&gt;  The collection is centered on a fountain which, from December to March, is converted to an ice-skating rink.&lt;ref name="WaPost"/&gt;  (Such a rink predated the construction of the garden.&lt;ref name="WaPost"/&gt;)  The outdoor Pavilion Café lies adjacent to the garden.&lt;ref name="WaPost"/&gt;

[[Laurie Olin]] and his firm, OLIN, were the landscape architects who redesigned the garden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/sculptureinfo.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Nuremberg Chronicle''''' is an illustrated [[biblical paraphrase]] and world history that follows the story of human history related in the Bible; it includes the histories of a number of important Western cities. Written in Latin by [[Hartmann Schedel]], with a version in [[German language|German]], translation by Georg Alt, it appeared in 1493. It is one of the best-documented early printed books—an [[incunabulum]]—and one of the first to successfully integrate illustrations and text.

Latin scholars refer to it as '''''Liber Chronicarum''''' ('''''Book of Chronicles''''') as this phrase appears in the index introduction of the Latin edition. [[English language|English]]-speakers have long referred to it as the ''Nuremberg Chronicle'' after the city in which it was published. German-speakers refer to it as '''''Die Schedelsche Weltchronik''''' ('''''Schedel's World History''''') in honour of its author.

==Production==
Two Nuremberg merchants, Sebald Schreyer (1446–1503) and his son-in-law, Sebastian Kammermeister (1446–1520), commissioned the Latin version of the chronicle. They also commissioned George Alt (1450–1510), a scribe at the Nuremberg treasury, to translate the work into German. Both Latin and German editions were printed by Anton Koberger, in Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Digital Library, University of Cambridge, http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-INC-00000-A-00007-00002-00888/1&lt;/ref&gt; The contracts were recorded by scribes, bound into volumes, and deposited in the Nuremberg City Archives.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;WIlson, Adrian. The Making of the Nuremberg Chronicle. Amsterdam: A. Asher &amp; Co. 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract, from December, 1491, established the relationship between the illustrators and the patrons. Wolgemut and Pleydenwurff, the painters, were to provide the layout of the chronicle, to oversee the production of the woodcuts, and to guard the designs against piracy. The patrons agreed to advance 1000 ''[[Guilder|gulden]]'' for paper, printing costs, and the distribution and sale of the book. A second contract, between the patrons and the printer, was executed in March, 1492. It stipulated conditions for acquiring the paper and managing the printing. The blocks and the archetype were to be returned to the patrons once the printing was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, David and Peter Parshall. ''The Renaissance Print, 1470–1550''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Schedelsche Weltchronik d 122.jpg|thumb|A typical opening, uncoloured]]
The author of the text, [[Hartmann Schedel]], was a medical doctor, humanist and book collector. He earned a doctorate in medicine in Padua in 1466, then settled in Nuremberg to practice medicine and collect books. According to an inventory done in 1498, Schedel's personal library contained 370 manuscripts and 670 printed books. The author used passages from the classical and medieval works in this collection to compose the text of Chronicle. He borrowed most frequently from another humanist chronicle, ''Supplementum Chronicarum'', by Jacob Philip Foresti of Bergamo.  It has been estimated that about 90% of the text is pieced together from works on humanities, science, philosophy, and theology, while about 10% of the chronicle is Schedel's original composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beloit.edu/nuremberg/inside/about/author.htm "About this book - Author"], [[Beloit College]] Morse Library, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuremberg]] was one of the largest cities in the Holy Roman Empire in the 1490s, with a population of between 45,000 and 50,000. Thirty-five patrician families comprised the City Council. The Council controlled all aspects of printing and craft activities, including the size of each profession and the quality, quantity and type of goods produced. Although dominated by a conservative aristocracy, Nuremberg was a center of northern humanism. [[Anton Koberger]], printer of the ''Nuremberg Chronicle'', printed the first humanist book in Nuremberg in 1472. Sebald Shreyer, one of the patrons of the chronicle, commissioned paintings from classical mythology for the grand salon of his house. Hartmann Schedel, author of the chronicle, was an avid collector of both Italian Renaissance and German humanist works. [[Hieronymus Münzer]], who assisted Schedel in writing the chronicle's chapter on geography, was among this group, as were [[Albrecht Dürer]] and Johann and [[Willibald Pirckheimer]].&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

==Publication==
[[Image:Nuremberg chronicles - Bottom of Page (CCXVIIv).jpg|thumb|Catching a "[[lion fish]]" - a small illustration from a Latin copy.  Note the red capital done in pen and ink, and the [[doodle]] in the margin below]]
The ''Chronicle'' was first published in [[Latin]] on 12 July 1493 in the city of [[Nuremberg]].  This was quickly followed by a German translation on 23 December 1493.  An estimated 1400 to 1500 Latin and 700 to 1000 German copies were published.  A document from 1509 records that 539 Latin versions and 60 German versions had not been sold.  Approximately 400 Latin and 300 German copies survived into the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beloit.edu/~nurember/inside/about/editions.htm "About this book - Latin and German Editions"], [[Beloit College]] Morse Library&lt;/ref&gt; The larger illustrations were also sold separately as [[old master print|prints]], often hand-coloured in [[watercolour]].  Many copies of the book are coloured, with varying degrees of skill; there were specialist shops for this. The colouring on some examples has been added much later, and some copies have been broken up for sale as decorative prints.

The publisher and printer was [[Anton Koberger]], the godfather of [[Albrecht Dürer]], who in the year of Dürer's birth in 1471 ceased goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning 24 printing presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad, from [[Lyon]] to [[Buda]].&lt;ref name="Giulia Bartrum"&gt;Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', British Museum Press, 2002, pp. 94-96, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

{{See also|Six Ages of the World}}
The chronicle is an illustrated world history, in which the contents are divided into seven ages:
* First age: from [[Creation myth|creation]] to the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]]
* Second age: up to the birth of [[Abraham]]
* Third age: up to [[King David]]
* Fourth age: up to the [[Babylonian captivity]]
* Fifth age: up to the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]
* Sixth age: up to the present time (the largest part)
* Seventh age: outlook on the end of the world and the [[Last Judgment]]

The large workshop of [[Michael Wolgemut]], then Nuremberg's leading artist in various media, provided the unprecedented 1,809 [[woodcut]] illustrations (before duplications are eliminated; see below). Sebastian Kammermeister and Sebald Schreyer financed the printing in a contract dated March 16, 1492, although preparations had been well under way for several years. Wolgemut and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff were first commissioned to provide the illustrations in 1487-88, and a further contract of December 29, 1491, commissioned manuscript layouts of the text and illustrations.

[[Albrecht Dürer]] was an apprentice with Wolgemut from 1486 to 1489, so may well have participated in designing some of the illustrations for the specialist craftsmen (called "formschneiders") who cut the blocks, onto which the design had been drawn, or a drawing glued. From 1490 to 1494 Dürer was travelling.  A drawing by Wolgemut for the elaborate frontispiece, dated 1490, is in the [[British Museum]].

As with other books of the period, many of the woodcuts, showing towns, battles or kings were used more than once in the book, with the text labels merely changed; one count of the number of original woodcuts is 645.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/302147838|title=Great Collections : treasures from Art Gallery of NSW, Australian Museum, Botanic Gardens Trust, Historic Houses Trust of NSW, Museum of Contemporary Art, Powerhouse Museum, State Library of NSW, State Records NSW.|last=A.)|first=McPhee, John (John|last2=NSW.|first2=Museums and Galleries|publisher=Museums &amp; Galleries NSW|year=|isbn=9780646496030|location=|pages=37|oclc=302147838|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is large, with a double-page woodcut measuring about 342 x 500mm.&lt;ref name="Giulia Bartrum"/&gt; Only the city of Nuremberg is given a double-page illustration with no text. The illustration for the city of Venice is adapted from a much larger woodcut of 1486 by [[Erhard Reuwich]] in the first illustrated printed travel book, the ''Sanctae Perigrinationes'' of 1486.  This and other sources were used where possible; where no information was available a number of stock images were used, and reused up to eleven times.  The view of [[Florence]] was adapted from an engraving by [[Francesco Rosselli]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]/Princeton, 1971, nos 43 &amp; 173.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold''''' is a 2011 [[documentary film]] about [[product placement]], marketing and advertising directed by [[Morgan Spurlock]]. The premise behind the production is that the documentary itself would be entirely paid for by sponsors, thus being a form of [[metafilm]]. The film's slogan is "He's not selling out, he's buying in."

==Release==
The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2011. In the United States, the film had a [[limited release]], opening on April 22, 2011 in
[[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Boston]],  [[Philadelphia]], [[San Diego]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="nytreview"/&gt;  The film opened the 2011 [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] on April 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1743720|The Greatest Movie Ever Sold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received 73% positive reviews from [[film critic]] on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 6.3 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pom_wonderful_presents_the_greatest_movie_ever_sold |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film received a score of 66 out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold| url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pom-wonderful-presents-the-greatest-movie-ever-sold| publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holden]] called the film "even more amusing than ''[[Super Size Me]]''", pointing out that "more than once the movie shows Mr. Spurlock, armed with clever [[storyboard]]s, selling his ideas with an enthusiasm and skill that would put [[Don Draper]] of ''[[Mad Men]]'' to shame."&lt;ref name="nytreview"/&gt;

==Sponsors==
Spurlock signed non-[[disparagement]] clauses with most of the companies showcased in his film but retained [[final cut privilege|final cut]].&lt;ref name="nytcarr"/&gt;  [[Pom Wonderful]] agreed to pay one million dollars for above-the-title [[billing (filmmaking)|billing]]  ("POM Wonderful Presents"), though the full amount was contingent on the film grossing $10 million at the box office, selling a half-million downloads and DVDs, and generating 600 million [[Impression (online media)|media impressions]].&lt;ref name="nytreview"/&gt;  As of 26 August 2011, the film had an estimated gross of approximately US$638,476.&lt;ref&gt;POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Greatest-Movie-Ever-Sold&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold http://www.boxoffice.com/statistics/movies/pom-wonderfuls-greatest-movie-ever-sold-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mane 'n Tail]] is featured prominently in the film,&lt;ref name="nytreview"/&gt; but the film's end titles disclose that they did not pay for the promotion. Instead, Mane 'n Tail provided free products to be used in the production of the film. Many other brands only provided products or contributed to the promotion of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ozanich | first= David | url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-morgan-spurlock-talks-pom-wonderful-presents-the-greatest-movie-ever-sold | title=EXCLUSIVE: Morgan Spurlock Talks POM Wonderful Presents the Greatest Movie Ever Sold | publisher=MovieWeb | date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 60 days, beginning April 27, 2011, the city of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] (home of [[Sheetz]], one of the movie's major sponsors) officially changed its name to "POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, Pennsylvania" to help Spurlock promote the film, and received $25,000 for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110426/ap_on_en_mo/us_sponsored_city |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527141516/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110426/ap_on_en_mo/us_sponsored_city |archivedate=May 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Spurlock used Brooklyn dance-punk duo [[Matt and Kim]]'s music as the movie soundtrack and their song "Cameras" from the album ''[[Sidewalks (album)|Sidewalks]]'' for the opening credits. Band members Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino are also interviewed in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/this-headline-is-brought-to-you-by-morgan-spurlock-2271028.html |title= This headline is brought to you by Morgan Spurlock |publisher=The Independent |date=April 22, 2011 | accessdate= 2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's theme song is called "The Greatest Song I Ever Heard" by the rock band [[OK Go]]. The song was made available for download on 1 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmvdigital.com/artist/ok-go/the-greatest-song-i-ever-heard |title=Week's new releases - The Greatest Song I Ever Heard by OK Go |publisher=HMV Digital |date= May 20, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OK Go]] performed the song at the film's premiere and at promotions for the film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} They also appeared live on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' performing the song.{{Episode needed|date=August 2011}}

A soundtrack album was released to digital music stores on April 26, 2011, and on CD August 23, 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9734">In [[software engineering]], a '''Plain Old Java Object''' ('''POJO''') is an ordinary [[Java_(programming_language)|Java]] [[Object (computer science)|object]], not bound by any special restriction and not requiring any class path. The term was coined by [[Martin Fowler]], Rebecca Parsons and Josh MacKenzie in September 2000: &lt;ref name="bliki" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We wondered why people were so against using regular objects in their systems and concluded that it was because simple objects lacked a fancy name. So we gave them one, and it's caught on very nicely."&lt;ref name="bliki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/POJO.html |title=MF Bliki: POJO |work=MartinFowler.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "POJO" initially denoted a Java object which does not follow any of the major Java object models, conventions, or frameworks; nowadays "POJO" may be used as an acronym for "Plain Old ''JavaScript'' Object" as well, in which case the term denotes a [[JavaScript]] object of similar pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajaxian.com/archives/return-of-the-pojo-plain-ole-javascript |title=Return of the POJO: Plain ‘Ole JavaScript |last=Almaer |first=Dion |work=Ajaxian |date=2006-07-17 |accessdate=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term continues the pattern of older terms for technologies that do not use fancy new features, such as POTS ([[Plain Old Telephone Service]]) in [[telephony]] and Pod ([[Plain Old Documentation]]) in [[Perl]]. The equivalent to POJO on the [[.NET framework]] is [[Plain Old CLR Object]] (POCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc681329.aspx |title=POCO Support |work=microsoft.com |accessdate=2012-05-27 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; For [[PHP]], it is Plain Old PHP Object (POPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jan.kneschke.de/2007/2/19/typesafe-objects-in-php/ |title=typesafe objects in PHP |first=Jan |last=Kneschke |date=2007-02-19 |work=kneschke.de |accessdate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326195616/http://jan.kneschke.de/2007/2/19/typesafe-objects-in-php/ |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jym.sg/controller-with-bare-bone-plain-old-php-objec |title=Controller with bare-bone Plain Old PHP Object aka POPO |first=Jym |last=Cheong |date=2011-06-26 |work=jym.sg |accessdate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326195611/http://jym.sg/controller-with-bare-bone-plain-old-php-objec |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The POJO phenomenon has most likely gained widespread acceptance because of the need for a common and easily understood term that contrasts with complicated object frameworks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Definition==
Ideally speaking, a POJO is a Java object not bound by any restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification; i.e. a POJO '''should not''' have to
#Extend prespecified classes, as in&lt;source lang="java"&gt;public class Foo extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet { ...&lt;/source&gt;
#Implement prespecified interfaces, as in&lt;source lang="java"&gt;public class Bar implements javax.ejb.EntityBean { ...&lt;/source&gt;
#Contain prespecified [[Java_annotation|annotations]], as in&lt;source lang="java"&gt;@javax.persistence.Entity public class Baz { ...&lt;/source&gt;
However, due to technical difficulties and other reasons, many software products or frameworks described as POJO-compliant actually still require the use of prespecified annotations for features such as persistence to work properly.
The idea is that if the object (actually class) was a POJO before any annotations were added, and would return to POJO status if the annotations are removed then it can still be considered a POJO. Then the basic object remains a POJO in that it has no special characteristics (such as an implemented interface) that makes it a "Specialized Java Object" (SJO or (sic) SoJO).

==Contextual variations==

===JavaBeans===

A [[JavaBean]] is a POJO that is [[Serialization#Java|serializable]], has a no-argument [[Constructor (computer science)|constructor]], and allows access to properties using [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]] that follow a simple naming convention. Because of this convention, simple declarative references can be made to the properties of arbitrary JavaBeans. Code using such a declarative reference does not have to know anything about the type of the bean, and the bean can be used with many frameworks without these frameworks having to know the exact type of the bean.
The JavaBeans specification, if fully implemented, slightly breaks the POJO model as the class must implement the [[Serialization#Java|Serializable]] interface to be a true JavaBean.  Many POJO classes still called JavaBeans do not meet this requirement.  Since [[Serialization|Serializable]] is a marker (method-less) interface, this is not much of a burden.

The following shows an example of a [[JavaServer Faces]] (JSF) component having a [[Duplex_(telecommunications)|bidirectional]] binding to a POJO's property:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;h:inputText value="#{MyBean.someProperty}"/&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The definition of the POJO can be as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java"&gt;
public class MyBean {

    private String someProperty;

    public String getSomeProperty() {
         return someProperty;
    }

    public void setSomeProperty(String someProperty) {
        this.someProperty = someProperty;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Because of the JavaBean naming conventions the single "someProperty" reference can be automatically translated to the "getSomeProperty()" (or "isSomeProperty()" if the property is of [[Boolean type]]) method for getting a value, and to the "setSomeProperty(String)" method for setting a value.

===Transparently adding services===

As designs using POJOs have become more commonly used, systems have arisen that give POJOs the full functionality used in frameworks and more choice about which areas of functionality are actually needed. In this model, the programmer creates nothing more than a POJO. This POJO purely focuses on [[business logic]] and has no dependencies on (enterprise) frameworks. [[Aspect-oriented programming]] (AOP) frameworks then transparently add cross-cutting concerns like persistence, transactions, security, and so on.&lt;ref name="Martin2008"&gt;Martin, Robert C; (2008); ''Clean Code'', Chapter 11, ''Pure Java AOP Frameworks''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spring Framework|Spring]] was an early implementation of this idea and one of the driving forces behind popularizing this model.

An example of an EJB bean being a POJO:

* [[Enterprise JavaBeans]] (EJB), 
* [[Java Persistence API]] (JPA) (including [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]])
* [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=299 CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform)]

The following shows a fully functional EJB bean, demonstrating how EJB3 leverages the POJO model:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java"&gt;
public class HelloWorldService {

    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As given, the bean does not need to extend any EJB class or implement any EJB interface and also does not need to contain any EJB annotations. Instead, the programmer declares in an external [[XML]] file which EJB services should be added to the bean:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;enterprise-beans&gt;
    &lt;session&gt;
        &lt;ejb-name&gt;helloWorld&lt;/ejb-name&gt;
        &lt;ejb-class&gt;com.example.HelloWorldService&lt;/ejb-class&gt;
        &lt;session-type&gt;stateless&lt;/session-type&gt;
    &lt;/session&gt;
&lt;/enterprise-beans&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In practice, some people find annotations elegant, while they see XML as verbose, ugly and hard to maintain, yet others find annotations pollute the POJO model. &lt;ref&gt;Panda, Debu; Rahman, Reza; Lane, Derek; (2007). ''EJB 3 in action'', Manning Publications Co., Shelter Island (NY), {{ISBN|978-1-93-398834-4}} (www.manning.com/books/ejb-3-in-action). Chapter 11, ''Deployment descriptors vs. annotations''&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, as an alternative to XML, many frameworks (e.g. Spring, EJB and JPA) allow annotations to be used instead of or in addition to XML. The following shows the same EJB bean as showed above but with an annotation added. In this case the XML file is no longer needed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java"&gt;
@Stateless
public class HelloWorldService {

    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

With the annotation as given above the bean isn't a truly pure POJO anymore, but since annotations are merely passive metadata this has far fewer harmful drawbacks compared to the invasiveness of having to extend classes and/or implement interfaces.&lt;ref name="Martin2008" /&gt; Accordingly, the programming model is still very much like the pure POJO model.

'''''Practical Management of Pain''''' is a [[Medicine|medical]] [[textbook]] on [[pain management]]. First published in 1986 by Year Book Medical Publishers which subsequently became part of [[Elsevier]], the book's target audiences are medical [[Residency (medicine)|residents]], practicing [[anesthesiologist]]s, and pain research [[fellow]]s. Currently in its fifth edition, the book has been described by pain specialists as a "trusted reference source",&lt;ref name="bja"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colvin|first1=L.

== Overview ==

The current edition includes contributions from international authors, with new chapters covering [[ultrasound]]-guided techniques in regional [[anesthesiology]] and [[pain management]] procedures. 

== Reception ==

The second edition of ''Practical Management of Pain'' was described in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' as "a masterly, readable, comprehensive treatise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrante|first1=F.

{{Linguistic typology topics}}
A '''pro-drop language''' (from "pronoun-dropping") is a [[language]] in which certain classes of [[pronoun]]s may be omitted when they are [[pragmatics|pragmatically]] or grammatically [[inference|inferable]] (the precise conditions vary from language to language, and can be quite intricate). The phenomenon of "pronoun-dropping" is also commonly referred to as [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] or null [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welo|first=Eirik|year=|title=Null Anaphora|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-ancient-greek-language-and-linguistics/*-COM_00000254|journal=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greek Language and Linguistics|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1163/2214-448x_eagll_com_00000254|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of pro-drop languages, null anaphora refers to the fact that the null position has referential properties, meaning it is not a null [[dummy pronoun]]. Pro-drop is only licensed in languages that have a positive setting of the pro-drop parameter, which allows the null element to be identified by its governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9780203980057|title=Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics|doi=10.4324/9780203980057}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pro-drop languages with a highly inflected verbal morphology, the expression of the subject pronoun is considered unnecessary because the verbal inflection indicates the person and number of the subject, thus the referent of the null subject can be inferred from the grammatical inflection on the verb.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flores-Ferrán|first=Nydia|date=2007-11-01|title=A Bend in the Road: Subject Personal Pronoun Expression in Spanish after 30 Years of Sociolinguistic Research|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00031.x/abstract|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|language=en|volume=1|issue=6|pages=624–652|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00031.x|issn=1749-818X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though in everyday speech there are instances when who or what is being referred to can be inferred from context, non-pro-drop languages still require the pronoun.  However, pro-drop languages allow those referential pronouns to be omitted, or be [[phonology|phonologically]] null. Among major languages, two of which might be called a pro-drop language are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] (featuring pronoun deletion not only for subjects, but for practically all grammatical contexts). [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Slavic languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |language=German |title=Wörter im Grenzbereich von Lexikon und Grammatik im Serbokroatischen |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Words on the Border Between Lexicon and Grammar |series=Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; 18 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |year=2001 |pages=10–12 |isbn=3-89586-954-6 |lccn=2005530313 |oclc=47905097 |ol=2863539W}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6A80Mj8Bf?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Summary_Worter.pdf Summary].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Sign Language]] also exhibit frequent pro-drop features. In contrast, non-pro-drop is an [[areal feature]] of many northern European languages (see [[Standard Average European]]), including French, (standard) German, and English.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Haspelmath, [http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854 ''The European linguistic area: Standard Average European''], in Martin Haspelmath, ''et al.'', ''Language Typology and Language Universals'', vol. 2, 2001, pp. 1492-1510&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages might be considered only partially pro-drop in that they allow deletion of the subject pronoun. These [[Null-subject language|null-subject languages]] include most [[Romance language]]s ([[French language|French]] is an exception) as well as all the Balto-Slavic languages and to a limited extent [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. Colloquial and [[German dialects|dialectal German]], unlike the standard language, are also partially pro-drop; they typically allow deletion of the subject pronoun in [[main clause]]s but not in [[subordinate clause]]s.

==History of the term==
The term "pro-drop" stems from [[Noam Chomsky]]'s "Lectures on Government and Binding" from 1981 as a cluster of properties of which "[[null subject]]" was one (for the occurrence of ''pro'' as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] rather than a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in sentences with the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] see Moro 1997).{{cn|date=December 2017}} 

Thus, a one-way correlation was suggested between [[agreement (linguistics)|inflectional agreement]] (AGR) and empty pronouns on the one hand and between no agreement and overt pronouns, on the other. It is worth noting that in the classical version, languages which not only lack agreement morphology but also allow extensive dropping of pronouns—such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese—are not included, as is made clear in a footnote: "The principle suggested is fairly general, but does not apply to such languages as Japanese in which pronouns can be missing much more freely." (Chomsky 1981:284, fn 47).

The term pro-drop is also used in other frameworks in [[generative grammar]], such as in [[lexical functional grammar]] (LFG), but in a more general sense: "Pro-drop is a widespread linguistic phenomenon in which, under certain conditions, a structural NP may be unexpressed, giving rise to a pronominal interpretation." (Bresnan 1982:384).

The [[empty category]] assumed (under [[government and binding theory]]) to be present in the vacant subject position left by pro-dropping is known as ''pro'', or as "[[little pro]]" (to distinguish it from "[[big PRO]]", an empty category associated with [[non-finite verb]] phrases).&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Trask, ''A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics'', Routledge 2013, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Japanese ===

Consider the following examples from Japanese:

:{{lang|ja|このケーキは美味しい。誰が焼いたの？}}
:''Kono k&amp;#275;ki wa oishii. Dare ga yaita no?''
:This cake TOPIC tasty-PRESENT. Who SUBJECT bake-PAST EXPLAIN.?
:"This cake is tasty. Who baked '''it'''?"

:{{lang|ja|知らない。気に入った？}}
:''Shiranai. Ki ni itta?''
:know-NEGATIVE. like-PAST?
:"'''I''' don't know. Did '''you''' like '''it'''?"

The words in '''bold''' in the English translations (''it'' in the first line; ''I'', ''you'', and ''it'' in the second) appear nowhere in the Japanese sentences but are understood from context. If nouns or pronouns were supplied, the resulting sentences would be grammatically correct but sound unnatural. (Learners of Japanese as a second language, especially those whose first language is non-pro-drop like English or French, often supply personal pronouns where they are pragmatically inferable, an example of [[language transfer]].)

=== Chinese ===

The above-mentioned example from Japanese are readily rendered into Chinese:

:{{lang|zh-Hans|这块蛋糕很好吃。谁烤的?}}
:''Zhèi kuài dàngāo hĕn hăochī. Shéi kăo de?''
:This piece cake DEGREE tasty. Who bake-MODIFY?
:"This cake is tasty. Who baked '''it'''?"

:{{lang|zh-Hans|不知道。喜欢吗?}}
:''Bù zhīdào. Xĭhuan ma?''
:Not know. like QUESTION-YES/NO?
:"'''I''' don't know. Do '''you''' like '''it'''?"

Though it is worthy to note that unlike Japanese, the inclusion of the dropped pronouns does not make the sentence sound unnatural.

===Arabic===
Arabic is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:
:Arabic text: ساعد غيرك، يساعدك
:Transliteration: ''sāʻid ghayrak, yusāʻiduk''
:Literal translation: help other, helps you.
:Idiomatic translation: If you help another, he helps you.

=== Turkish ===
:''Sen-i gör-dü-'''m'''''
:2SG-[[accusative_case|ACC]] see-[[past_tense|PST]]-'''1SG'''
:'''I''' saw you.

The subject "I" above is easily inferable as the verb ''gör-mek'' "to see" is conjugated in the first person simple past tense form. The object is indicated by the pronoun ''seni'' in this case. Strictly speaking, pronominal objects are generally explicitly indicated, although frequently possessive suffixes indicate the equivalent of an object in English, as in the following sentence.

:''Gel-diğ-'''im'''-i gör-dü-'''n''' mü?''
:come-[[nominalisation|NMLZ]]-[[possessive|POS]].1SG-[[accusative_case|ACC]] see-[[past_tense|PST]]-'''2SG''' [[question|Q]]
:Did '''you''' see '''me''' coming?

In this sentence, the object of the verb is actually the action of coming performed by the speaker (''geldiğimi'' "my coming"), but the object in the English sentence, "me", is indicated here by the possessive suffix '''''-im''''' "my" on the nominalised verb. Both pronouns can be explicitly indicated in the sentence for purposes of emphasis, as follows:

:'''''Sen ben-im''' gel-diğ-im-i gör-dü-n mü?''
:'''2SG 1SG-POSS''' come-"ing"-[[possessive|POS]].1SG-[[accusative_case|ACC]] see-[[past_tense|PST]]-'''2SG''' [[question|Q]]
:Did '''''you''''' see '''''me''''' coming?

=== Swahili ===
In Swahili, both subject and object pronouns can be omitted as they are indicated by verbal prefixes.

:'''''Ni'''-ta-'''ku'''-saidia.''
:'''''SUBJ.1SG'''-[[future_tense|FUT]]-'''OBJ.2SG'''-help
:'''I''' will help '''you'''.

===English===

English is considered a non-pro-drop language. Nonetheless, subject pronouns are almost always dropped in imperative sentences (e.g., ''Come here''). In informal speech, pronouns may sometimes be dropped in other types of sentences, together with some other words, especially [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]] and [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]]:

*''&lt;nowiki&gt;[Have you]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ever been there?''
*''&lt;nowiki&gt;[I'm]&lt;/nowiki&gt; going to the shops. &lt;nowiki&gt;[Do you]&lt;/nowiki&gt; want to come?''
*Seen on signs: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[I am/We are]&lt;/nowiki&gt; out to lunch; &lt;nowiki&gt;[I/we will be]&lt;/nowiki&gt; back at 1:00 [P.M].''
*''What do you think &lt;nowiki&gt;[of it]&lt;/nowiki&gt;?'' – ''I like &lt;nowiki&gt;[it]&lt;/nowiki&gt;!'' (the latter only in some dialects and registers)

In speech, when pronouns are not dropped, they are more often [[relaxed_pronunciation|reduced]] than other words in an utterance.

Relative pronouns, provided they are not the subject, are often dropped in short restrictive clauses: ''That's the man [who] I saw.''

Note that the dropping of pronouns is generally restricted to very informal speech and certain fixed expressions, and the rules for their use are complex and vary among dialects and registers. A noted instance was the "lived the dream" section of [[George H. W. Bush]]'s speech at the [[1988 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25955|title=Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans|last=Bush|first=George W.|date=18 August 1988|work=American Presidency Project|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=22 July 2015|quote=Those were exciting days.

==Null-subject languages==
{{main article|Null-subject language}}

=== Modern Greek ===

Subject pronouns can be often omitted in modern [[Greek language|Greek]]. Example:

:''Βλέπεις εκείνο το κούτσουρο; Θα ήταν καλό για τη φωτιά. Είναι τελείως ξερό.''
:See that the log? Would be good for the fire. Is completely dried ''(literal, direct translation)''
:(Do) '''you''' see this log? '''It''' would be good for the fire. '''It''' has completely dried. ''(idiomatic translation)''

=== Romance languages ===

Most [[Romance language]]s (with the notable exception of French) are often categorised as pro-drop too, most of them only in the case of subject pronouns. Unlike in Japanese, however, the missing subject pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the verb, which inflects for person and number of the subject.

====Spanish====
In Spanish, the verb is inflected for both person and number, thus expression of the pronoun is unnecessary because it is grammatically redundant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the following example, the inflection on the verb ''ver,'' 'see', signals informal 2nd person singular, thus the pronoun is dropped. Similarly, from both the context and verbal morphology, the listener can infer that the second two utterances are referring to the log, so the speaker omits the pronoun that would appear in English as "it." 
 
:''¿Ves este tronco? Sería bueno para la fogata. Está completamente seco.'' (Spanish)
:See this log? Would be good for the campfire. Is completely dry ''(literal, direct translation)''
:(Do) '''you''' see this log? '''It''' would be good for the campfire. '''It''' is completely dry ''(English gloss)''

Although Spanish is a pro-drop language, not all grammatical contexts allow for a null pronoun. There are some environments that require an overt pronoun. In contrast, there are also grammatical environments that require a null pronoun. According to the ''Real Academia Española'', the expression or elision of the subject pronoun is not random. Rather there are contexts in which an overt pronoun is abnormal, while in other cases the overt pronoun is possible or even required.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=seEVswKc5D6y2K5WFZ|title=Pronombre Personales Tónicos|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas|publisher=Real Academia Española|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third person pronouns (''él, ella, ellos'', ''ellas'') in most contexts can only refer to persons. Therefore, when referring to things (that are not people) an explicit pronoun is usually disallowed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subject pronouns can be made explicit when used for a contrastive function or when the subject is the focus of the sentence. In the following example, the first person explicit pronoun is used to emphasize the subject.

:''Yo'' [y no tú u otra persona] ''creo que en eso estuvo mal.''
:''I [and not you or another person] think that that was wrong.''
  
Subject pronouns can also be made explicit in order to clarify ambiguities that arise due to verb forms that are homophonous in the first person and third person. For example, in the past imperfect, conditional, and the subjunctive, the verb forms are the same for first person singular and third person singular. In these situations, using the explicit pronoun ''yo'' (1st person singular) or ''él, ella'' (3rd person singular) clarifies who the subject is, since the verbal morphology is ambiguous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Italian====

:''Vedi questo tronco? Andrebbe bene da bruciare. È completamente secco.'' (Italian)
:See this log? Would go well for burning. Is completely dry ''(literal, direct translation)''
:Do '''you''' see this log? '''It''' would be fit for burning. '''It''' is completely dry. ''(English gloss)''

====Portuguese====
Examples of omitted subject:

:''Estás a ver este tronco? Seria bom para a fogueira. Secou completamente.'' (European Portuguese)
:Are to see this log? Would be good for the campfire. Dried completely  ''(literal, direct translation)''
:(Do) '''you''' see this log? '''It''' would be good for the campfire. '''It''' has completely dried. ''(English gloss)''

:''"Tá" (está) vendo esse tronco? Seria bom pra fogueira. Secou totalmente.'' (Brazilian Portuguese)
:Are seeing this log? Would be good for-the campfire. Dried totally  ''(literal, direct translation)''
:(Do) '''you''' see this log? '''It''' would be good for the campfire. '''It''' has completely dried. ''(English gloss)''

Omission of object pronouns is likewise possible when the referent is clear, especially in colloquial or informal language:

:''Acho que ele vai rejeitar a proposta, mas pode aceitar.''
:Think that he goes (to-)reject the proposal, but may accept.  ''(literally)''
:I think he is going to turn down the proposal, but '''he''' may accept '''it'''.

:''Ainda tem macarrão? Não, papai comeu.''
:Still is there pasta? No, daddy ate. ''(literally)''
:Is there pasta left? No, daddy ate '''it'''. 

The use of the object pronoun in these examples (''aceitá-la'',  ''comeu-o'') would be grammatical but rather unnatural, especially in Brazil.

:''Ela me procurou ontem e não achou.''
:She me sought yesterday and not found. ''(literally)''
:She looked for me yesterday and didn't find '''me'''. 

Here ''não me achou'' would also be possible.

:A: ''Eu te amo; você também me ama?'' B: ''Amo, sim''.
:A: I you love; you too me love?  B: Love-1-SING, yes. ''(literally)''
:A: I love you; do you love me too? B: I do.

Omission of the object pronoun is possible even when its referent has not been explicitly mentioned, so long as it can be inferred. The next  example might be heard at a store; the referent (a dress) is clear to the interlocutor. In both Brazilian and European Portuguese the pronoun is omitted.

:Viu que bonito? Não gosta? Pode comprar? (BP)
::Saw how beautiful? Don't like? Can buy? (using polite 2nd person) (BP)
:Viste que bonito? Não gostas? Podes comprar? (EP)
::Saw how beautiful? Don't like? Can buy? (using informal 2nd person) (EP)
:Have you seen how beautiful it is? Do you like it? Can you buy it? ''(English gloss)''

''Modern'' Spanish and Portuguese are also notable amongst Romance languages because they have no specific pronouns for circumstantial [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]s (arguments denoting circumstance, consequence, place or manner, modifying the verb but not directly involved in the action) or [[partitive]]s (words or phrases denoting a quantity of something).{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- I don't see what partitives have to do with anything. As for pronouns for circumstantial complements, you must be thinking of French and Italian (y, en, etc.), but as far as I know such pronouns are not common cross-linguistically. --&gt; However, Medieval language had them, e.g. Portuguese ''hi'' and ''ende''.

Compare the following examples in which Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Romanian have null pronouns for place and partitives, but Catalan, French, Occitan, and Italian have overt pronouns for place and partitive.

=== Slavic languages ===

All [[Slavic languages]] behave in a similar manner to the Romance pro-drop languages. Example:

:''Бачу [яго]. Ідзе.'' [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]
:''Виждам го. Идва.'' [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]
:''Vidim ga. Prilazi.'' [[Croatian language|Croatian]]
:''Vidím ho. Jde.'' [[Czech language|Czech]]
:''Го гледам. Доаѓа.'' [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]
:''Widzę go. Idzie.'' [[Polish language|Polish]]
:''Вижу [его]. Идёт.'' [[Russian language|Russian]]
:''Видим га. Долази.'' [[Serbian language|Serbian]]
:''Vidím ho. Ide.'' [[Slovak language|Slovak]]
:''Vidim ga. Prihaja.'' [[Slovene language|Slovene]]
:''Бачу [його]. Йде.'' [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]

:"'''I''' see him. '''He''' is coming."

Here ''he'' in the second sentence is inferred from context.
In the East Slavic languages even the objective pronoun "'''его'''" can be omitted in the present and future tenses (both imperfect and perfective). As with the Romance languages mentioned above, the missing pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb (Виж'''у''', Виж'''дам''', Widz'''ę''', Vid'''im''', etc...).  However, the past tense of both imperfective and perfective in modern East Slavic languages inflects by gender and number rather than the person due to the fact that the present tense conjugations of the copula "to be" (Russian ''быть'', Ukrainian ''бути'', Belorussian ''быць'') have practically fallen out of use. As such, the pronoun is often included in these tenses, especially in writing.

===Finno-Ugric languages===

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the verb inflection replaces first and second person pronouns in simple sentences, e.g. ''menen'' "I go", ''menette'' "all of you go". Pronouns are typically left in place only when they need to be inflected, e.g. ''me'' "we", ''meiltä'' "from us".  There are [[possessive pronoun]]s, but [[possessive suffix]]es, e.g. ''-ni'' as in ''kissani'' "my cat", are also used, as in ''Kissani söi kalan'' ("my cat ate a fish"). A peculiarity of [[colloquial Finnish]] is that the pronoun ''me'' ("we") can be dropped if the verb is placed in the passive voice (e.g. ''haetaan'', standard "it is fetched", colloquial "we fetch"). In the [[Estonian language]], a close relative of Finnish, the tendency is less clear. It generally uses explicit personal pronouns in the literary language, but these are often omitted in colloquial Estonian.

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is also pro-drop, subject pronouns are used only for emphasis, as example ''(Én) mentem'' "I went", and because of the definite conjugation, object pronouns can be often elided as well; for example, the question ''(Te) láttad a macskát?'' "Did (you) see the cat?" can be answered with just ''láttam'' "(I) saw (it)", because the definite conjugation renders the object pronoun superfluous.

===Hebrew===

Modern [[Hebrew]], like [[Biblical Hebrew]], is a "moderately" pro-drop language. In general, subject pronouns must be included in the present tense. Since Hebrew has no verb forms expressing the present tense, the present tense is formed using the present participle (somewhat like English ''I am '''guarding'''''). The participle in Hebrew, as is the case with other adjectives, declines only in grammatical gender and number (like the ''past'' tense in Russian), thus:

:I (m.) guard (''ani shomer'') = {{Hebrew|אני שומר}}

:You (m.) guard (''ata shomer'') = {{Hebrew|אתה שומר}}

:He guards (''hu shomer'') = {{Hebrew|הוא שומר}}

:I (f.) guard (''ani shomeret'') = {{Hebrew|אני שומרת}}

:We (m.) guard (''anachnu shomrim'') = {{Hebrew|אנחנו שומרים}}

Since the forms used for the present tense lack the distinction between grammatical persons, explicit pronouns must be added in the majority of cases.

In contrast, the past tense and the future tense the verb form is inflected for person, number, and gender. Therefore, the verb form itself indicates sufficient information about the subject. The subject pronoun is therefore normally dropped, except in third-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hacohen|first=Gonen|last2=Schegloff|first2=Emanuel A.|date=2006-08-01|title=On the preference for minimization in referring to persons: Evidence from Hebrew conversation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216606000804|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=Focus-on Issue: Discourse and Conversation|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1305–1312|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2006.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: I (m./f.) guarded (''shamarti'') = {{Hebrew|שמרתי}}

:You (m. pl.) guarded (''sh'martem'') = {{Hebrew|שמרתם}}

:I (m./f.) will guard (''eshmor'') = {{Hebrew|אשמור}}

:You (pl./m.) will guard (''tishm'ru'') = {{Hebrew|תשמרו}}

Many nouns can take suffixes to reflect the possessor, in which case the personal pronoun is dropped. In daily modern Hebrew usage, inflection of nouns is common only for simple nouns, and in most cases, inflected possessive pronouns are used. In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are treated mostly like adjectives and follow the nouns which they modify. In biblical Hebrew, inflection of more sophisticated nouns is more common than in modern usage.

==Generalizations across languages==
Spanish, Italian, Catalan, Occitan and Romanian can [[elision|elide]] subject pronouns only (Portuguese sometimes elides object pronouns as well), and they often do so even when the referent has not been mentioned. This is helped by person/number [[inflection]] on the verb. It has been observed that pro-drop languages are those with either rich inflection for person and number (Persian, Polish, Portuguese, etc.) or no such inflection at all (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.), but languages that are intermediate (English, French, etc.) are non-pro-drop.

While the mechanism by which overt pronouns are more "useful" in English than in Japanese is obscure, and there are exceptions to this observation, it still seems to have considerable descriptive validity. As Huang puts it, "Pro-drop is licensed to occur either where a language has full agreement, or where a language has no agreement, but not where a language has impoverished partial agreement."&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.-T. James. "On the distribution and reference of empty pronouns". ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 15: 531-574. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other language families and linguistic regions===
Among the Indo-European and [[Dravidian languages]] of India, pro-drop is the general rule though many Dravidian languages do not have overt verbal markers to indicate pronominal subjects. [[Mongolic languages]] are similar in this respect to Dravidian languages, and all [[Paleosiberian languages]] are rigidly pro-drop.

Outside of northern Europe, most [[Niger–Congo languages]], [[Khoisan languages]] of [[Southern Africa]] and [[Austronesian languages]] of the Western Pacific, pro-drop is the usual pattern in almost all [[linguistic area|linguistic regions]] of the world. In many non-pro-drop Niger–Congo or Austronesian languages, like [[Igbo language|Igbo]],  [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and [[Fijian language|Fijian]], however, subject pronouns do not occur in the same position as a nominal subject and are obligatory, even when the latter is present. In more easterly Austronesian languages, like [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], subject pronouns are often omitted even though no other subject morphemes exist. [[Pama–Nyungan languages]] of Australia also typically omit subject pronouns even when there is no explicit expression of the subject.

Many Pama–Nyungan languages, however, have [[clitic]]s, which often attach to nonverbal hosts to express subjects. The other languages of Northwestern Australia are all pro-drop, for all classes of pronoun. Also, [[Papuan languages]] of [[New Guinea]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] of [[East Africa]] are pro-drop.

Among the [[indigenous languages of the Americas]], pro-drop is almost universal, as would be expected from the generally [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and [[head-marking language|head-marking]] character of the languages. That generally allows eliding of all object pronouns as well as subject ones. Indeed, most reports on Native American languages show that even the emphatic use of pronouns is exceptionally rare. Only a few Native American languages, mostly [[language isolate]]s ([[Haida language|Haida]], [[Trumai language|Trumai]], [[Wappo language|Wappo]]) and the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] family are known for normally using subject pronouns.

===Pragmatic inference===
[[Classical Chinese]] exhibits extensive dropping not only of pronouns but also of any terms (subjects, verbs, objects, etc.) pragmatically inferable, giving a very compact character to the language. Note, however, that Classical Chinese was a written language, and such word dropping is not necessarily representative of the spoken language or even of the same linguistic phenomenon.

'''Rail Locomotive No. 220''' is an exhibition building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==Background==

In 1915 the [[American Locomotive Company]] of [[Schenectady, New York]], built the '''Rail Locomotive No. 220''', the last coal-burning, ten-wheeler steam engine used on the [[Central Vermont Railway]]. Because it possessed a medium-sized [[4-6-0]] engine (4 leading wheels, 6 driving wheels, and 0 trailing small wheels), the No. 220 served double duty pulling both freight and passenger trains. No. 220 became known as the “Locomotive of the Presidents” because of its use on special trains carrying [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].

The [[steam engine]] persisted as the only type of locomotive operating in the United States until the introduction of the electric train in 1895 and, even then, steam engines continued to dominate the rails until the 1950s when diesel came into wide use. The inscription, “28%,” on the coal tender indicates that the engine had the potential to lift or drag up to twenty-eight thousand pounds of dead weight. The Central Vermont Railway retired No. 220 from service in 1956 and presented it to the Museum for preservation. The museum built the surrounding shed soon afterward to protect the locomotive and the private car (''see [[Rail Car Grand Isle]]'') from the elements.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge''''' is a religious [[encyclopedia]]. It is based on an earlier German encyclopedia,  the '''''Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche.''''' 
Like the ''Realencyklopädie'', it focuses on [[Christianity]] from a primarily [[Protestantism|Protestant]] point of view.
The final edition, titled ''The New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', was published
1908–14 in 13 volumes, based on the third edition of the ''Realencyklopädie'' (1896—1909).

==Publishing history==
[[Image:Realenzyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche.JPG|thumb|300px|The German ''Realenzyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche,'' which Schaff-Herzog is based on.]]
The ''Realencyklopädie'''s publishing history was:{{sfn|Jackson|1908|loc=Preface}}
* 1853—1868 — 1st ed. Ed. [[Johann Jakob Herzog]] (1805—1882). 22 vols.
* c. 1877 — new ed. Ed. Herzog and G.L. Plitt (1836—1880).
* 1896—1909 — 3rd ed. Ed. Albert Hauck (1845—1918). 22 vols.

The ''Schaff-Herzog''{{'}}s publishing history was:{{sfn|Jackson|1908|loc=Preface}}
* 1882–84 – 1st ed. Ed. [[Philip Schaff]] (1819–93). (Based on the first two editions of the ''Realencyklopädie''.)
* 1891 – 3rd ed. Ed. Albert Hauck.
* 1908–14 – ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge''. 13 vols. This was a substantial update, based throughout on the ''Realencyklopädie'', 3rd ed.

[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]] has digitized the work and made it available online. [[Logos Bible Software]] is also undertaking a digitization project of it.

==Developments==
The idea of translating ''Herzog'' in a slightly condensed form occurred to [[John Henry Augustus Bomberger]], a minister of the German Reformed Church, and then president of [[Ursinus College]], [[Collegeville, Pennsylvania]], and in 1856 he brought out in Philadelphia the first volume, whose title-page reads thus: ''The Protestant Theological and Ecclesiastical Encyclopedia: Being a Condensed Translation of Herzog’s Real Encyclopedia. With Additions from Other Sources. By Rev. J. H. A. Bomberger, D.D., Assisted by Distinguished Theologians of Various Denominations. Vol. I. Philadelphia: Lindsay &amp; Blakiston, x 1856''. In this work he associated with himself twelve persons, all but one ministers. In 1860 he issued the second volume. But the [[American Civil War]] breaking out the next year put a stop to so costly an enterprise and it was never resumed. The first volume included the article "Concubinage", the second "Josiah". It had been issued in numbers, of which the last was the twelfth.{{sfn|Jackson|1908|loc=Preface}}
[[File:Appletons' Schaff Philip.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip Schaff]]]]
In 1877 Professor [[Philip Schaff]] (1819–93) was asked by Dr. Herzog himself to undertake an English reproduction of the second edition of his encyclopedia, and this work was fairly begun when, in the autumn of 1880, [[Clemens Petersen]] and [[Samuel Macauley Jackson]] were engaged to work daily on it in Dr. Schaff’s study in the Bible House, New York City. The next year Dr. Schaff’s son, the Rev. [[David Schley Schaff]], later professor of church history in the Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pa., joined the staff. The original publishers were S. S. Scranton &amp; Company, Hartford, Conn., but a change was made before the issue of the first volume and the encyclopedia was issued by Funk &amp; Wagnalls. The title-page read thus: ''A Religious Encyclopædia: or Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology. Based on the Real-Encyklopädie of Herzog, Plitt, and Hauck. Edited by Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., Professor in the Union Theological Seminary, New York. Associate editors: Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, M. A., and Rev. D. S. Schaff. Volume I. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Publishers, 10 and 18 Dey Street''. The first volume was issued Wednesday, November 1, 1882, the second Thursday, March 1, 1883, and the third Tuesday, March 4, 1884. Volume I. had pp. xix. 1-847; volume II. pp. xvii. 848-1714; and volume III. pp. xix. 1715-2631. In November, 1886, a revised edition was issued and at the same time the ''Encyclopedia of Living Divines and Christian Workers of All Denominations in Europe and America, Being a Supplement to Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Edited by Rev. Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., and Rev. Samuel Macauley Jackson, M. A. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Publishers, 18 and 20 Astor Place, 1887''. In 1891 the third edition of the encyclopedia was issued and with it was incorporated the Encyclopedia of Living Divines, with an appendix, largely the work of Rev. George William Gilmore, bringing the biographical and literary notices down to December, 1890. The entire work was repaged sufficiently to make it one of four volumes of about equal size, and it is this four-volume edition which is known to the public as the ''Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia'', the volumes being respectively of pp. xlviii. 679 and four pages unnumbered; 680-1378; 1379-2086; iv. 2087-2629, viii. 296. As the German work at its base was overtaken by the time "S" had been reached, the ''Schaff-Herzog'' from that letter on was based on the first edition of ''Herzog''. Therefore, much of its matter is now very old. Yet it has been a useful work, and in 1903 its publishers determined on a new edition based on the third edition of ''Herzog'' which had been appearing since 1896. But inasmuch as there was a space of ten years between the beginnings of the two works, it has been necessary to bring the matter from the German down to date. This end has been accomplished by two courses: first by securing from the German contributors to ''Herzog'' condensations of their contributions, in which way matter contributed to the German work has in many instances been brought down to date, and second by calling on department editors for supplementary matter.{{sfn|Jackson|1908|loc=Preface}}

''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopædia of Religious Knowledge'' followed the previous editions.  The points of similarities were:{{sfn|Jackson|1908|loc=Preface}}
*that at its base lay the ''Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie and Kirche''
*that it gave in condensed form the information in that work, and took such matter directly from the German work in most instances, although occasionally while the topic was the same the treatment was independent of the German original;
*that it had much new information contributed by the editorial staff and specially secured contributors;
*that in biblical matters it limited its titles to those of the German base, so that it should not be considered to be a Bible dictionary.
The points of dissimilarity were:{{sfn|Jackson|1908|loc=Preface}}
*The new edition contains much information furnished directly by those contributors to the German work who have kindly consented to condense their articles and bring them within prescribed limits. These limits were often narrow, but in no other way was it possible to utilize the German text;
*The new edition contains hundreds of sketches of contemporary persons derived in almost every instance from information furnished by themselves. The entries are in more detail than those in the British and American ''[[Who’s Who]]'' and from the German ''Wer ist’s'' (a similar work for Germany);
*A much more thorough bibliography was furnished than in previous editions. The attempt was made to give sources so that students could pursue a subject to its roots; second, to supply the best literature in whatever language it occurred; third, to supply references in English for those who only read that language.

'''Sex manuals''' are [[book]]s which explain how to perform [[Human sexual activity|sexual practices]]; they also commonly feature advice on [[birth control]], and sometimes on [[safe sex]] and [[sexual relationship]]s.

== Early sex manuals ==
[[File:Kamasutra5.jpg|thumb|Artistic depiction of a [[sex position]]]]

In the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
[[Philaenis|Philaenis of Samos]], possibly a [[hetaira]] ([[courtesan]]) of the [[Hellenistic period]] (3rd–1st century BC).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Erôs in Ancient Greece|last1=Sanders |first1=E.|last2=Thumiger |first2=C.|last3=Carey |first3=C. |last4=Lowe |first4=N.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199605507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt7JkvxScSkC|page=287|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved by a series of fragmentary  [[papyrus]]es which attest its popularity, it served as a source of inspiration for  [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', written around 3&amp;nbsp;BC, which is partially a sex manual, and partially a burlesque on the art of love.

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual, although only a small part of its text is devoted to sex. It was compiled by the Indian sage Vatsyayana sometime between the second and fourth centuries CE. His work was based on earlier [[Kamashastra]]s or ''Rules of Love'' going back to at least the seventh century BCE, and is a compendium of the social norms and love-customs of patriarchal Northern India around the time he lived. Vatsyayana's ''Kama Sutra'' is valuable today for his psychological insights into the interactions and scenarios of love, and for his structured approach to the many diverse situations he describes. He defines different types of men and women, matching what he terms "equal" unions, and gives detailed descriptions of many love-postures.

The ''Kama Sutra'' was written for the wealthy male city-dweller. It is not, and was never intended to be, a lover's guide for the masses, nor is it a "Tantric love-manual". About three hundred years after the ''Kama Sutra'' became popular, some of the love-making positions described in it were reinterpreted in a Tantric way. Since Tantra is an all-encompassing sensual science, love-making positions are relevant to spiritual practice.

The earliest East Asian sex manual is the ''Su Nü Jing''. Probably written during the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), the work was long lost in China itself, but preserved in Japan as part of the medical anthology ''[[Ishinpō]]'' (984). It is a Daoist text purporting to describe how one might achieve long life and immortality by manipulating the [[yin and yang]] forces of the body through sexual techniques, which are described in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%B4%A0%E5%A5%B3%E7%BB%8F&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sex manuals include the lost works of [[Elephantis]], by [[Constantine the African]]; ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'', a 12th-century collection of [[Hindu]] erotic works; and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]'', a 16th-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] work by [[Sheikh Nefzaoui]]. The fifteenth-century ''[[Speculum al foderi]]'' (The Mirror of Coitus) is the first medieval European work to discuss sexual positions. Constantine the African also penned a medical treatise on sexuality, known as ''Liber de coitu''. The medieval Jewish physician and writer [[Maimonides]] is author of a ''Treatise on Cohabitation.''

== Modern sex manuals ==
Despite the existence of ancient sex manuals in other cultures, sex manuals were banned in Western culture for many years. What sexual information was available was generally only available in the form of illicit [[pornography]] or medical books, which generally discussed either sexual physiology or sexual disorders. The authors of medical works went so far as to write the most sexually explicit parts of their texts in [[Latin]], so as to make them inaccessible to the general public (see [[Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' as an example).

A few translations of the ancient works were circulated privately, such as ''The Perfumed Garden''….

In the late 19th Century, [[Ida Craddock]] wrote many serious instructional tracts on human sexuality and appropriate, respectful sexual relations between married couples. Among her works were ''The Wedding Night'' and ''Right Marital Living''. In 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published ''[[Married Love]]'', considered groundbreaking despite its limitations in details used to discuss sex acts.

[[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]]'s book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' ''(The Perfect Marriage)'', published in 1926, was well known in [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Estonia]]. In Germany, ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 despite its being placed on the list of forbidden books, the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]], by the Roman Catholic Church. In Sweden, ''Det fulländade äktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. In English, [[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]] has 42 printings in its original 1930 edition, and was republished in new editions in 1965 and 2000.

David Reuben, M. D.'s book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'', published in 1969, was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s. Although it did not feature explicit images of sex acts, its descriptions of sex acts were  detailed, addressing common questions and misunderstandings Reuben had heard from his own patients. Most notably, Reuben dismissed popular medical-psychiatric notions of "vaginal" vs. "clitoral" orgasm, explaining exactly how female physiology works.

''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' by Dr. [[Alex Comfort]] was the first visually explicit sex manual to be published by a mainstream publisher. It was followed by ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' and ''[[The Joy of Lesbian Sex]]''. Its appearance in public bookstores in the 1970s opened the way to the widespread publication of sex manuals in the West. As a result, hundreds of sex manuals are now available in print.

Sex manuals and works of the sort became so popular during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1970s that even religious groups developed their own manuals.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeRogatis |first=A.  |title=What Would Jesus Do? Sexuality and Salvation in Protestant Evangelical Sex Manuals, 1950s to the Present |journal=Church History |volume=74 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=97–137 |doi=10.1017/S0009640700109679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the book ''[[The Act of Marriage]]'' by Christian Baptist authors Tim and Beverly LaHaye has sold over 2.5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaHaye |first=T. |last2=LaHaye |first2=B. |title=The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=Zondervan |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they began with the prerequisite of a heterosexual, complementarian relationship, the behavior they suggested went far beyond standard Christian teaching at that time.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; They suggested role play, experimentation with sex devices, masturbation to ensure climax and many other practices that were considered taboo up until the 1970s in protestant bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lahaye |first=T. F. |year=1978 |title=Act of Marriage |location= |publisher=Bantam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manuals such as Marabel Morgan's [[The Total Woman]] emphasized the importance of the female orgasm. While they all required marriage, heterosexuality and complementarianism, they did push the bounds of accepted practice within their respective spheres of influence.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; Today, Christian authors continue to produce similar manuals and guides to their constituents in search of appropriate, fulfilling behavior. Books such as Mark and Grace Driscoll's [[Real Marriage]] encourage Christians to experiment in the bedrooms with their spouses, even encouraging acts that have long been rejected by protestant tradition such as anal sex.

One of the currently most well known in America is ''[[The Guide to Getting it On]]!'' by Paul Joannides. Now in its seventh edition, it has won several prestigious awards and been translated into 12 foreign languages since appearing in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | first = P. | last = Joannides | title = The Guide To Getting It On | edition = fifth | publisher = Goofy Foot Press | place = Oregon, USA | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-885535-69-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816182246/http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | archivedate = 2007-08-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Notre Dame HDR.jpg|thumb|right|"Le Stryge" Chimera overlooks Paris from atop [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].]]
The '''strix''' (plural '''striges''' or '''strixes'''), in the mythology of [[classical antiquity]], was a bird of ill omen, the product of [[shapeshifting|metamorphosis]], that fed on human flesh and blood. It also referred to [[witchcraft|witches]] and related malevolent folkloric beings.

==Description==

===Physical appearance===
The ''strix'' is described as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, greyish white wings,{{Efn|Latin: {{linktext|canities}}}} and hooked claws in Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''.&lt;ref name=fasti&gt;Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6  ''Fasti''] VI. 131–, {{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only thorough description of the strix in Classical literature.&lt;ref name=arnott/&gt; Elsewhere, it is described as being dark-colored.{{Refn|The Latin ''atra'' (''{{linktext|ater}}'') is rather vague, and may not be indicative of color. {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=136}}.}}&lt;ref name=titinius/&gt;&lt;ref name=arnott/&gt;

===Behavior===
The ''strīx'' ({{lang|el|στρίξ}}){{efn|name=strix-em}} was a nocturnally crying creature which positioned its feet upwards and head below, according to a pre-300 BC Greek [[origin myth]].{{Efn|The myth is [[Boios]]'s ''Ornithologia'', preserved by [[Antoninus Liberalis]], described below.}}&lt;ref name=antoninus-liberalis/&gt; It is probably meant to be (and translated as) an owl,{{sfnp|Celoria|1992|pp=77–78}} but is highly suggestive of a bat which hangs upside-down.{{sfnp|Oliphant|1913|pp=134–135}}

The ''strix'' in later folklore was a bird which squirted milk upon the lips of (human) infants. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his [[Pliny's Natural History|''Natural History'']] dismissed this as nonsense{{Efn|Since the [[bat]] was the only winged animal with [[mammary glands]].}}{{Efn|In the ancient world the bat was commonly classified as a bird; only [[Aristotle]] differed, considering it halfway between bird and land animal. See {{harvp|Oliphant|1913}}, p. 134 n. 4.}} and remarked it was impossible to establish what bird was meant by this.{{Efn|Their name was once used as a curse being the only other piece of information Pliny gives here.}}&lt;ref name=pliny-11-95&gt;Bostock, John; Riley, H.T., ed., tr., Pliny, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:11.95 ''The Natural History''], xi.95. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/11*.html#232 ''Naturalis Historia'], xi.232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arnott/&gt; The same habit, where the strix foul-smellingly [[lactation|lactates]] onto an infant's lips is mentioned by [[Titinius]], who noted the placement of a [[garlic]] on the infant was the prescribed amulet to ward against it.&lt;ref name=titinius&gt;Titinius, in Ribbeck, ''Scaen. Rom. Poesis Fragg.'' II, 188, Latin passage quoted and discussed by {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=136}}. And p. 145, "[Pliny] found the Titinian strix".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;&lt;ref name="pliny-11-95"/&gt;

In the case of Ovid's ''striges'', they threatened to do more harm than that. They were said to disembowel an infant and feed on its blood. Ovid allows the possibilities of the ''striges'' being birds of nature, or products of magic, or transformations by [[witch]]es using magical incantations.&lt;ref name=fasti/&gt;

==Classical tales of bloodthirstiness==

===Greek origin myth===
{{See also|Polyphonte}}
According to [[Antoninus Liberalis]]'s ''Metamorphoses'', the ''strīx'' ({{lang|el|στρίξ}}){{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|name=strix-em|Greek ''strīx'' ({{lang|el|στρίξ}} or {{lang|el|ϛρίγξ}}), emended from ''styx'' ({{lang|el|ϛύξ / στύξ}}).&lt;ref name=strix-emendation/&gt;}} was a [[metamorphosis]] of [[Polyphonte]]; she and her bear-like sons Agrios and Oreios were transformed into birds as punishment for their cannibalism.&lt;ref name=antoninus-liberalis/&gt; Here the strix is described as (a bird) "that cries by night, without food or drink, with head below and tips of feet above, a harbinger of war and civil strife to men".{{Refn|Latin translation: "Polyphonte in Stygem [''sic.''] mutata est, avem noctu canentem, cibi potusque exsortem, caput deorsum, pedes imos habentem, belli et seditionis hominibus nuciam"}}&lt;ref name=antoninus-liberalis&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, ''Μεταμορφώσεων Συναγωγή'' 21, translated in {{harvp|Celoria|1992|pp=77–78}}, summarized in {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale only survives in the form as recorded by Antonius who flourished 100-300 AD, but it preserved an older tale from the lost ''Ornithologia'' by [[Boios]], dated to before the end of 4th century BC.{{sfnp|Oliphant|1913|p=134}}

In this Greek [[etiological myth|myth]], the ill-omened ''strīx'' herself did not perpetrate harm on humans. But one paper suggests [[guilt by association]] with her sons,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=135}}: "As woman-bird, she is .. possessed of a craving for human flesh and blood. Boio transfers this quality to her offspring in human form, to Agrios alone in avian form [vulture]."&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to reconstruct an ancient Greek belief in the man-eating ''strīx'' dating back to this age (4th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=135}}. Accepting [[Theodor Bergk]]'s postulation that [[Plautus]]'s Latin comedy was a reworking of a hypothetical "Greek original belonging to the [[Middle comedy]] of the fourth century."&lt;/ref&gt; In an opposing view, one study failed to find the ancient Greeks subscribing to the ''strīx'' as a "terror" to mankind, but noted a widespread belief in Italy that it was a "bloodthirsty monster in bird form." This study surmises that the Greeks later borrowed the concept of ''strix'' as witches, a concept articulated in Ovid,{{sfnp|Lawson|1910|p=180}} and one scholar estimates the Greeks adopted the ''strix'' as "child-murdering horrors" by the "last centuries BC".{{sfnp|Hutton|2017|p=69}} The modern Greek form {{lang|el|στρίγλα}} may betray an influence of a Latin diminutive ''strigula''.{{sfnp|Lawson|1910|p=180}}

===Early passing reference in Latin===
The first Latin allusion is in [[Plautus]]'s comedy ''[[Pseudolus]]'' dated to 191 BC,{{sfnp|Oliphant|1913|p=135}} in which an inferior cook's cuisine is [[metaphor]]ized as the ''striges'' ("vampyre owls") devouring the diners' gastrointestinal organs while still alive, and shortening their life-span.{{sfnp|McDonough|1997|p=319}}&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Henry Thomas tr. (1912)[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi016.perseus-eng1:3.2 Pseudolus, Act. 3, Scene 2]. Morris, E. P., ed. (1895)[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQngAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 T. Macci Plauti ''Pseudolus'' 820], p. 57 and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQngAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 note, p. 171]&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators point to this as attestation that the ''striges'' were regarded as man-eating ([[anthropophagy (disambiguation)|anthropophagism]]).{{sfnp|Oliphant|1913|pp=135–136}}&lt;ref name=arnott/&gt;{{Efn|Although this is an example of [[literal and figurative language|figurative use]].&lt;!--That is to say, if it was alluding to an owl referring to a non-human prey, the metaphor will still work.--&gt;}}

===Ovid's account of striges attack===

In Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' ([[8 AD]]) were the ''striges'' as already described, that targeted legendary king [[Procas]] in his cradle.{{Efn|Procas was a legendary king of [[Latium]] before the [[Roman Empire]].}} The assault was detected and interrupted but left the infant with scars on his cheeks and discoloration of his skin [[complexion]].{{sfnp|McDonough|1997|p=315}} A ritual to keep the ''striges'' away from the newborn prince was subsequently performed by the nymph [[Cardea|Cranae]] (or goddess Carna), who owned a wand of whitethorn (''spina'') given her by [[Janus]], which could expel evil from all doors.{{Efn|The ritual involved stroking the [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]] and threshold with an [[Arbutus unedo|arbutus]] branch, and placating the evil with chopped entrails of pigs, etc. This constitutes an explanation for the custom of eating beans and bacon on the [[Kalends]] of June as votive offerings to Carna.}}&lt;ref name=fasti/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonough|1997|pp=330–331}} only refers to Carna obtaining her power as compensation for Janus raping her, but the earlier passage in Ovid states a white wand was given her. Ovid, ''Fasti'' 6.110ff. Riley, Thomas H. (1851) tr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=V_0pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA214 Fasti], p. 214ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satyricon===

[[Petronius]]'s novel ''[[Satyricon]]'' (Late 1st century AD) includes a tale told by the character [[Trimalchio]], describing the ''striges'' that snatched away the body of a boy who had already died, substituting it with a straw doll. The striges made their presence known by their scream, and a manservant attending to the intrusion discovered a woman and ran her through with a sword so that she groaned, but his whole body turned livid and would die a few days later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Satyricon 63, quoted in {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|The same work also notes the striges would feed on the marrow or sinews (''nervus'') of the living.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

==Magical associations==
Pliny's comment that  "[''strix''].. employed in maledictions"&lt;ref name=pliny-11-95/&gt; signified that its name invoked in "potent" magic [[curse]]s according to one interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=137}}, and note 10&lt;/ref&gt; but it may have only been used as [[curse-word]], reflecting its regard as an accursed creature.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=maledico&amp;la=la#lexicon mălĕdīco]'' defined "II. In partic., a curse, imprecation" and "II B. transf., a cursed thing" in [[Lewis &amp; Short]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|McDonough|1997|pp=325–326}}

There are several examples of the strix's plumage, etc. said to be used as an ingredient in magic. [[Horace]] in his ''[[Epodes]]'', wrote that the strix's feathers are an ingredient in a love potion,&lt;ref&gt;Made by "the witch [[Canidia (gens)|Canidia]]": {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|McDonough|1997|p=319}} as has his contemporary [[Propertius]].&lt;ref&gt;Propertius, iii, 6, 29. The woman Cynthia accuses her rival of using the love potion. {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medea]]'s rejuvenating concoction which she boiled in a cauldron used a long list of ingredients, including the ''strix''′s wings.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamporphosis'' VII, 269. More, Brookes (1922), [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng1:7.238-7.296 translation]. Cited by {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''striges'' also came to mean "witches".{{sfnp|Oliphant|1913|p=135}} One paper speculates that this meaning is as old as the 4th century BC, on the basis that in the origin myth of Boios, various names{{Efn|Strymon, Thraissa and Triballos}} can be connected to the Macedonia-Thrace region well known for witches.{{sfnp|Oliphant|1913|p=135}} But more concrete examples occur in Ovid's ''Fasti'' (early 1st century AD) where the ''striges'' as transformations of hags is offered as one possible explanation, and [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] (fl. late 2nd century) glossed as "women who practice witchcraft" "(''maleficis mulieribus'')" or "flying women" ("witches" by transference)&lt;ref name=fasti2&gt;Frazer, James George (1929) ed., Ovid, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6uUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 ''Fasti''] '''4''', p. 143, notes to VI. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Hutton|2017|pp=69–70}}

==Underworld==
There are ''striges'', vultures and ''bubo'' owls which cry in the marshes in Hades, by the edge of [[Tartarus]]{{Refn|The spot is by [[Cocytus]], one of two rivers forming the [[moat]] of the residence of [[Dīs Pater|Dis]], and the source of these rivers are the Tartaus.}} according to [[Seneca the Younger]]'s tragedy ''Hercules Furens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0003:card=654&amp;highlight=strigis |name=''Hercules Furens''}}, 686ff; Wilson, Emily (2010) tr. {{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CWCAXl3waMC&amp;pg=PA159 |name=''Six Tragedies''}}, pp. 159–160. Seneca cited by {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=138}}: "Tartarean birds", etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the legend of [[Aloadae|Otus and Ephialtes]], they were punished in Hades by being tied to a pillar with snakes, with a strix perched on that column.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 28, cited by {{harvp|Oliphant|1913|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Hyginus spells the bird ''styx'', as in Antonius Libellus above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Oliphant|1913|loc=p. 138, note 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medieval==
&lt;!--very incomplete--&gt;
The legend of the strix survived into the [[Middle Ages]], as recorded in [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Isidore/12*.html#7.42 Etymologiae book 12], ch. 7.42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7-8th century [[John of Damascus]] equated the ''stiriges'' (Greek plural: {{lang-el|στρίγγαι, Στρῦγγαι}}){{sfnp|Lawson|1910|pp=178, 181}} with the ''gelloudes'' (pl. of ''gelllo'') in his entry ''Perī Stryggōn {{lang-el|περί Στρυγγῶν}})''.&lt;ref&gt;John of Damascus, I, p. 473 ({{lang-el|περί Στρυγγῶν}}), in Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', p. 1604. Cited by {{harvp|Lawson|1910|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that they sometimes had corporeal bodies and wearing clothing, and sometimes appeared as spirits.&lt;ref&gt;John of Damascus, I, p. 473, in Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', p. 1604. Cited by {{harvp|Lawson|1910|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern derived terms==
The Latin term ''striga'' in both name and sense as defined by Medieval lexicographers in was in use throughout central and eastern Europe.

''Strega'' (obviously derived from Latin ''striga'') is the Italian term for ''witch'', and in Romanian ''strigăt'' means 'scream',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=54830 DEX Online]&lt;/ref&gt; ''strigoaică'' is the name of the Romanian feminine vampire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=strigoaica DEX Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[strigoi]] ''is the Romanian male vampire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=strigoi DEX Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Both can scream loudly, especially when they become poltergeists - a trait they have in common with the banshees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} ''Strigăt'' is also the Romanian name of the [[barn owl]] and of the [[death's-head hawkmoth]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''Sultana Wahnón Bensusan''' (born 8 May 1960) is a Spanish essayist and literary critic, a professor at the [[University of Granada]] specializing in [[literary theory]] and [[comparative literature]].&lt;ref name=Rica&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.revistadelibros.com/articulos/kafka-y-la-tragedia-judia-de-sultana-wahnon |title=Kafka y la historia |trans-title=Kafka and History |first=Álvaro |last=de la Rica |work=[[Revista de Libros]] |language=Spanish |date=1 November 2005 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic activity==
Sultana Wahnón graduated in Spanish Philology in 1982, with a [[Licentiate (degree)#Spain|licentiate]] in the poetry of the National Literature Prize winner {{ill|Miguel Fernández (poet)|es|Miguel Fernández (poeta)|lt=Miguel Fernández}}, a Melillan author to whom she has dedicated two books. Her doctoral thesis, defended in 1987 and published by [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]] in 1998, consists of a description of the Spanish fascist aesthetic system and the analysis of its progressive dissolution in postwar literary criticism. Specializing in literary theory, she has written books such as ''Introducción a la historia de las teorías literarias'' (1991)&lt;ref name=Aguirre&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://webs.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero3/wahnon.htm |title=Sultana Wahnón: Lenguaje y Literatura |first=Joaquín María |last=Aguirre |work=Documentación de las Ciencias de la Información |number=18 |publisher=[[Complutense University of Madrid]] |pages=11–24 |language=Spanish |year=1995 |access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Teoría de la literatura y de la interpretación literaria'' (2008).&lt;ref name=Maqueda&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ogigia.es/OGIGIA7_files/MAQUEDA_CUENCA.pdf |title=Wahnón, S.: Teoría de la literatura y de la interpretación literaria |first=Eugenio |last=Maqueda Cuenca |work=Ogigia |issn=1887-3731 |number=7 |pages=86–88 |language=Spanish |year=2010 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 she began a line of research on the theater of [[Federico García Lorca|García Lorca]], a subject on which she continues to work today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://guadix.ideal.es/guadix/noticias/201502/23/sultana-wahnon-bensusan-y-el-teatro-de-federico-garcia-lorca-en-el-aula-abentofail.html |title=Sultana Wahnón Bensusan y el Teatro de Federico García Lorca en el Aula Abentofail |trans-title=Sultana Wahnón Bensusan and the Theater of Federico García Lorca at the Abentofail Classroom |first=Jesús Javier |last=Pérez |work=[[Ideal (newspaper)|Ideal]] |location=Guadix |language=Spanish |date=23 February 2015 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 her book ''Lenguaje y literatura'' was released, in which she talks with the main representatives of the [[linguistic turn]] and [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] skepticism.&lt;ref name=Aguirre/&gt; In 2000 she presented her hypothesis on the innocence of Josef K. in ''[[The Trial]]'',&lt;ref name=vio&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2004/04/17/babelia/1082157433_850215.html |title=Lo que ya vio Franz Kafka |trans-title=What Franz Kafka Already Saw |first=Reyes |last=Mate |work=[[El País]] |language=Spanish |date=17 April 2004 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she developed extensively in the book ''Kafka y la tragedia judía'' (2003).&lt;ref name=Rica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/cultural/2004/03/20/021.html |title=Josef K., héroe trágico |first=Jon |last=Juaristi |author-link=Jon Juaristi |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |page=21 |language=Spanish |date=20 March 2004 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hermeneutic discussion contained in this book is continued in more recent publications such as ''El problema de la interpretación literaria.

In 2014 she published ''En fuga irrevocable. Un ensayo de crítica de la cultura'', which deals with textual proliferation in the cultural and university spheres.

She has dedicated several articles and reviews to contemporary poets and narrators, including [[Iris M.

The legend of the Sundel Bolong mainly originated from the Javanese mythology. In Indonesian mythology, a '''Sundel Bolong''' is a mythical [[ghost]] from the archipelago which is a woman with beautiful long hair and a long white dress (her form is similar to [[Pontianak (folklore)|Kuntilanak]]). The myth is closely linked to [[prostitute]]s, meaning a "prostitute with a hole in her", in reference to the large hole which is said to appear in her back.

==Etymology==
The name "sundel bolong" derives from the physical appearance of the ghost. The word "sundel" which means "[[prostitution|prostitute]]" or "[[whore]]" and "bolong" in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] which literally means "hole." Modern folklore studies believe that the myth was developed in Java culture to deter prostitution that developed during the [[Dutch East Indies]] colonization.

==Mythology==
In folklore, Sundel Bolong is the soul of a woman who died when she was pregnant outside of marriage and therefore gave birth in her grave, or who died during childbirth and the baby came out from her back (this is the reason why the hole was created in her back)&lt;ref name="Geertz"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-SYM4PW-YAgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Sundel+Bolong#v=onepage&amp;q=Sundel%20Bolong&amp;f=false|title=The religion of Java|work=Anthropology/comparative religions Page 658 of Phoenix books|author=Clifford Geertz|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1976|page=18|isbn=978-0-226-28510-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concealed from men by her long black hair. 

Victims of Sundel Bolong spirit mainly consists of men and children. As a vengeful spirit and it is also said to be a sensitive spirit, if rejected by a man, she is said to castrate him.&lt;ref name="Geertz" /&gt; As for the children and mainly new born babies, she is said to take as her own for it is believed that she lost her child after birth. 

''Sundel Bolong'' has appeared in a number of movies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deasyelsara.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/reinterpreting-identities-in-indonesian-classic-film-poster-with-gambar-selaw/ Reinterpreting Identities in Indonesian Classic Films Poster]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, an adult horror film, ''[[Sundel Bolong (1981 film)|Sundel Bolong]]'' was released, directed by [[Sisworo Gautama Putra]] and in 2007, ''[[Legenda Sundel Bolong]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film-bioskop21.blogspot.com/2012/02/film-legenda-sundel-bolong-full-movies.html Legenda Sundel Bolong]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
* In ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Blade]]'', the Sundel Bolongs are depicted as an Asian vampire sub-species.
*In the horror game "''[[DreadOut]]'' " developed by Digital Happiness, Sundel Bolong is featured as one of the ghost.

'''Tate Liverpool''' is an [[art gallery]] and [[museum]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England, and part of [[Tate]], along with [[Tate St Ives]], Cornwall,  [[Tate Britain]], London, and [[Tate Modern]], London. The museum was an initiative of the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]]. Tate Liverpool was created to display work from the [[Tate|Tate Collection]] which comprises the national collection of British art from the year 1500 to the present day, and  international modern art. The gallery also has a programme of temporary exhibitions. Until 2003, Tate Liverpool was the largest gallery of modern and [[contemporary art]] in the UK outside London.

==History==

Housed in a converted warehouse within the [[Albert Dock]] on Liverpool's waterfront, the gallery was opened on 24 May 1988 by HRH Prince Charles, an event covered by BBC Two television. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tate Gallery Liverpool|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/38410f11fa6946cab62fcc8be03b61aa|website=BBC Genome, BBC Two England, 24 May 1988, 21.00|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Youngs|first1=Ian|title=The man who's been hands-on with priceless art for 40 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43540079|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 March 2018|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is  The original conversion was done by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] but the building was given a major refurbishment in 1998 to create additional gallery space.

In 2007, the foyer area was redesigned by architects Arca to create an updated appearance and better proportions, as well as to improve visitor handling. The gallery cafe was also redesigned by [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and Liverpool-based architects, Architectural Emporium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jade Wright|title=Tate Liverpool unveils Sir Peter Blake's new Dazzle cafe|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/tate-liverpool-unveils-sir-peter-9871916|website=Liverpool Echo|date= 17 August 2015|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tate Gallery Café|url=http://www.architectural-emporium.co.uk/project/tate/|website=Architectural Emporium|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The centrepiece of the space is a new timber desk with an undulating orange fascia, which links to the retained colour scheme of the original conversion work by Stirling. A colour-changing wall acts as a backdrop to the simplified brick volume, visible from across Albert Dock. Behind the scenes, Arca also made alterations to the hospitality, cloakroom, events and education areas.

==Live Events ==
The gallery has hosted numerous live events in the foyer, including Made Up Mix as part of Liverpool's Biennial of Contemporary Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinliverpool.com/late-at-tate-25-sept-made-up-mix/|title=Late at Tate – 25 Sept – MADE UP Mix|work=Art in Liverpool|date=24 September 2008|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biennial.com/content/LiverpoolBiennial2008MADEUP/Venues.aspx|title=Venues|work=Liverpool Biennial|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912022551/http://www.biennial.com/content/LiverpoolBiennial2008MADEUP/Venues.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event featured Die Plankton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/late/16339.htm|title=Made Up Mix|work=Tate Liverpool|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916072928/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/late/16339.htm|archivedate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing a show that was recorded for their "[https://web.archive.org/web/20111005213229/http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/184002_10150274408988397_585253396_7454342_4222274_s.jpg Yorkshire's Answers To The Beatles]" live album.

'''''The Father Christmas Letters''''', also known as '''''Letters from Father Christmas''''', are a collection of [[Letter (message)|letters]] written and illustrated by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] between 1920 and 1942 for his children, from [[Father Christmas]]. They were released posthumously by the Tolkien estate on 2 September 1976, the 3rd anniversary of Tolkien’s death. They were edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]], second wife of his youngest son, [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]]. The book was warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that elements of the stories inspired parts of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Plot==
The stories are told in the format of a series of letters, told either from the point of view of Father Christmas or his elvish secretary. They document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the North Polar Bear and his two sidekick cubs, Paksu and Valkotukka. The stories include descriptions of the massive fireworks that create the [[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]] and how Polar Bear manages to get into trouble on more than one occasion.

The 1939 letter has Father Christmas making reference to the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name=willardreview /&gt; while some of the later letters feature Father Christmas' battles against Goblins which were subsequently interpreted as being a reflection of Tolkien's views on the [[Nazi Party|German Menace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#walsh|Walsh (2001)]]: p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The letters themselves were written over a period of over 20 years to entertain Tolkien's children each Christmas. Starting in 1920 when Tolkien's oldest son was aged three,&lt;ref name=willardreview&gt;{{cite news|last=Willard|first=Nancy|title=Christmas Letters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/05/books/tolkien-christmas.html?_r=0|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 December 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; each Christmas Tolkien would write a letter from Father Christmas about his travels and adventures.&lt;ref name=travels&gt;{{cite news|title=Grand Tours: Who Travels the World in a Single Night?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-1716622/travel-etc-grand-tours-who-travels-the-world-in|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent on Sunday|date=22 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each letter was delivered in an envelope, including North Pole stamps and postage marks as designed by Tolkien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tolkien's "Father Christmas Letters"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2001/12/07/books/tolk-christmas.slideshow_1.html|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to publication, an exhibition of Tolkien's drawings was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. These included works from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''The Father Christmas Letters''.&lt;ref name="john136"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Ian|title=Gazette: Diana Caithness|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-4628707/gazette-diana-caithness|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 January 1994}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was by [[Allen and Unwin]] on 2 September 1976, three years after Tolkien's death. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition was released later that year on 19 October.&lt;ref name=tolklibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=The Father Christmas Letters|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/booksbytolkien/fatherchristmas/description.htm|publisher=The Tolkien Library|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third work by Tolkien to be released posthumously, after a collection of poems and the ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref name="john133"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]],&lt;ref name="drew421"&gt;[[#drew|Drew (1997)]]: p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; the second wife of [[Christopher Tolkien]],&lt;ref name=willardreview/&gt; it includes illustrations by Tolkien for nearly all the letters; however, it omitted several letters and drawings.&lt;ref name=paperback&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters from Father Christmas paperback (16.08.09)|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/907-Letters_from_Father_Christmas.php|publisher=The Tolkien Library|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the book was republished in 1999 it was retitled ''Letters from Father Christmas'' and several letters and drawings not contained in the original edition were added.&lt;ref name=paperback/&gt;&lt;ref name="thomp11"&gt;[[#thompson|Thompson (2007)]]: p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; One edition in 1995 featured the letters and drawings contained in individual envelopes to be read in the manner they were originally conceived to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stocking Fillers|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-4752382/stocking-fillers|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 November 1995}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The reception to the first two works published posthumously had been warm, which was subsequently thought to be due to Tolkien's recent death. The response to ''The Father Christmas Letters'' was much more measured and balanced.&lt;ref name="john133"/&gt; Jessica Kemball-Cook suggested in her book ''Twentieth Century Children's Writers'' that it would become known as a classic of children's literature,&lt;ref name="john188"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; while Nancy Willard for ''[[The New York Times]] Book Review'' also received the book positively, saying "Father Christmas lives. And never more merrily than in these pages."&lt;ref name=willardreview /&gt; In 2002, an article in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' described the work as rivalling "''The Lord of the Rings'' for sheer imaginative joy".&lt;ref name=travels /&gt;

Kocher, whilst writing for the journal ''Mythprint'', suggested that the creatures in ''The Father Christmas Letters'' may have been a precursor to those which appeared in Tolkien's later works such as the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'',&lt;ref name="john158"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; a view which was shared by Laurence and Martha Krieg in a review in the journal ''Mythlore'' (issue #14).&lt;ref name="john159"/&gt; For example, the 1933 letter features an attack on Polar Bear by a band of goblins.&lt;ref name=sack&gt;{{cite news|last=Garfield|first=Simon|title=Dear Santa, Please Sack Christmas Carole|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-81089339/dear-santa-please-sack-christmas-carole-radio|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date=23 December 2001}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kriegs suggested that the wizard [[Gandalf]] may have been developed from Father Christmas.&lt;ref name="john159"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tortoise Beats Hare''''' is a 1941 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' animated short supervised and laid out by [[Tex Avery]] (solely supervisal credited as "Fred Avery" and read by Bugs Bunny). The short, loosely based on the [[Aesop]]ian [[Aesop's fables|fable]] ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare]],'' stars [[Bugs Bunny]] and, in his first appearance, [[Cecil Turtle]].

==Plot==
As the opening credits appear, Bugs Bunny comes on the screen while eating an obligatory carrot and absent-mindedly begins reading them, grossly mispronouncing all of them in the process (e.g. {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|v|ɛr|ɪ}} for "Avery" over the correct {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|v|ər|ɪ}}) except for the word "story," the first names of Dave Monahan and Fred Avery, and all of [[Carl W. Stalling]]'s name. As he finishes, he sees the name of the cartoon and becomes exasperated, spitting out his mouthful of the carrot he was eating. After a brief tirade involving ripping apart the opening credits, he finds Cecil Turtle and bets him ten dollars he can win against him in a race. Cecil accepts and, ringing up his cousins on a telephone, devises a scheme in which they will double as him at significant points along the track while he himself crosses the finish line ahead of Bugs and claims the money. After Bugs realizes he may have been tricked the entire time, Cecil and his cousins appear behind him, each with a dollar in hand, and kiss him.

'''Xobdo.org''' is the first online [[Assamese language|Assamese]] dictionary to become available online on March 10, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assamtribune.com/apr2406/State.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519140059/http://www.assamtribune.com/apr2406/State.html |date=May 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 6, 2011 the database of this dictionary contains 37013 words of Assamese language. This is a [[wiki]], where anybody can contribute and edit words in the dictionary provided they have a substantial knowledge of the Assamese language. Moreover, the dictionary has the facility to categorize the words as per their origin, nature and locality. It also has the facility of incorporating encyclopedic entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xobdo.org/dic/index.php?w=Jayanta%20Hazarika&amp;l=1 |title=Jayanta Hazarika (English) |publisher=Xobdo.org |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[website]] uses [[UNICODE]] fonts which ensures global visibility of Assamese fonts when users set their [[character encoding]] option to [[UTF-8|Unicode (UTF-8)]].

The dictionary is the brainchild of Bikram M Baruah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TI Trade |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=jun1408/at08 |title=The Assam Tribune, June 14, 2008 |publisher=Assamtribune.com |date=2008-06-14 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Assamese people|Assamese]] [[Petroleum engineering|petroleum engineer]] based in [[Abu Dhabi]]. Later lots of interested people specialized in different areas joined as the working force behind this dictionary.

In 2007 xobdo.org added multiple interfaces to include 17 more languages spoken in the [[North East India]]:  [[Khasi language|Khasi]], [[Dimasa language|Dimasa]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Nagamese]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Mongsen Ao language|Ao]], [[Mizo language|Mizo]], [[Mishing language|Mishing]], [[Apatani language|Tanii (Apatani)]], [[Monpa language|Monpa]], [[Meitei-lon]], [[Bishnupriya]], [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Kokborok|Kok-Borok]],  [[Kukish languages|Kuki]], and [[Tanchangya language|Tanchangya]]{{which|date=October 2011}} aimed at giving a multilingual edge to the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/349364.html |title=Indian Express, August 16, 2008 |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=2008-08-16 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently XOBDO gives a platform for 27 languages of North-East India, along with English. However, the database for these  languages is still substantially small.

==Authorship and management==
[[Image:xobdoideabase.png|200px|thumb|right|Database Architecture of xobdo.org]]
A group of volunteers are responsible for adding words at XOBDO database. As of now the website has two levels of volunteers: "contributors" and "editors". A contributor enters an [[English language|English]] and its corresponding Assamese word to the temporary database. Afterwards an editor assigns a unique "idea ID" to the corresponding English and Assamese words and carries on other editing works, if required, to match the standards of XOBDO. After assigning the idea ID the words are added to the main database ready to be retrieved by a user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xobdo.org/dic/mod/article/index.php?aid=5 |title=XOBDO's Policy |publisher=Xobdo.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115064502/http://www.xobdo.org/dic/mod/article/index.php?aid=5 |archivedate=January 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
Initially xobdo.org employed [[Microsoft]] server tools and technologies. It ran [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]s on [[Windows]] [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] and the primary database on [[RDBMS]]  based on [[Microsoft SQL Server]]. However, in 2007it moved to [[open source]] technology and started running [[PHP]]s on [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] and an [[RDBMS]] on [[MySQL]].
