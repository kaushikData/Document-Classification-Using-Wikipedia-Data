'''3D security''' is a framework promoting development, diplomacy, and defense as security strategies.

The 3D security framework recognizes that security challenges like [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[global warming]], and [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] or [[Avian Flu]] epidemics require a variety of tools in addressing complex threats.  These tools can be categorized broadly under the headings of Development, Diplomacy and Defense; the 3Ds of security.

3D security or “whole of government” approaches have been promoted by countries like Canada and the U.K. for a number of years.  Now bi-partisan Congressional leaders and the Bush administration promote 3D security as a new vision for rethinking security as detailed in the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html 2006 National Security Strategy].

[[Development aid|Development]] refers to governmental and nongovernmental (NGO) efforts to build the economic, social, and political foundations of stable communities and societies. [[Diplomacy]] refers to communication or negotiation between people to solve shared problems and address conflicts through political and legal channels. Official State Department negotiations (Track I) and unofficial diplomacy [[Track II diplomacy|(Track II)]] between religious, business, academic, or other civil society leaders work best on parallel tracks resulting in agreements that are legitimate, widely supported, and sustainable. Defense refers to a wide range of military tasks including waging war, peacekeeping or coordinating disaster response.

The '''Berlin movement''' was an [[anti-Semitic]] intellectual and political movement in the [[German Empire]] in the 1880s.  The movement was a collection of unassociated individuals and organizations.

The movement developed in the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1873]] that led to a recession in the United States and parts of the western European economy.   It assailed Jews and capitalism; along with this critique it opposed liberalism and it represented a fear of [[social democracy]].  Finally, the movement came out of a [[Racial nationalism|racial conception of national identity]] on the part of the German [[middle class]].

The movement had several leaders.  The journalist and author [[Otto Glagau]] led a journal, ''Der Kulturkämpfer,'' [The Culture Warrior] that propagated these ideas.  The Lutheran theologian and politician, [[Adolf Stoecker]], led the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]]. He was the only elected representative of the party in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]].

The movement lost strength after the CSP's losses in the 1887 elections.  Additionally, the Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] distanced himself from the party. The significance of the movement laid in its being the first anti-Semitic movement in modern Germany.

'''Choe Ik-gyu''' ({{Korean|hangul=최익규|context=north}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vantage Point|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ae6AAAAIAAJ|volume=5|year=1982|publisher=Naewoe Press|location=Seoul|oclc=29800060|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 27 February 1934), also known under the pseudonym '''Choe Sang-gun''', is a [[North Korea]]n [[film director]], [[propagandist]], and [[politician]].

Choe became the head of the [[Korea Film Studio]] in 1956 at age 22. By the time [[Kim Jong-il]] took over the country's film industry in 1968, Choe was the most experienced filmmaker of North Korea. Kim and Choe became close associates – Kim producing and Choe directing – a number of important North Korean films. ''[[Sea of Blood]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Flower Girl]]'' (1972) were "[[Immortal Classics]]" that, in addition to being popular successes, profoundly shaped the industry. By the end of the 1960s, Choe supervised film making in all of North Korea as the [[Propaganda and Agitation Department]] film section head. In 1972, his responsibilities covered other forms of [[North Korean propaganda]] as well after he was made the vice director of the Department.

In 1978, Kim had [[South Korea]]'s famous director-actress couple [[Abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee|Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee abducted to North Korea]]. Choe was tasked with aiding them to make films for North Korea. After [[Shin Sang-ok|Shin]] and [[Choi Eun-hee|Choi]] escaped in 1986 on a business trip in [[Vienna]] under Choe's watch, he was demoted. Kim Jong-il's trust in Choe would survive despite numerous incidents leading to the latter's dismissal from his posts. All in all, Choe has been sacked five times from the Propaganda and Agitation Department: first in 1969, then in 1977 as part of purges, in 1986 after the Vienna affair, in 1993, and finally 2010. He served as the country's [[Minister of Culture (North Korea)|Minister of Culture]] between 2003 and 2006. He finally became the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 2009, but was replaced the following year. He remains a delegate to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]].

Choe remained part of Kim's inner circle until [[Death of Kim Jong-il|the latter's death]] in 2011. Choe supported Kim's youngest son, [[Kim Jong-un]]'s, ascension to the leadership of the country at a time when he was still an uncertain heir.

==Early and personal life==
Choe Ik-gyu was born on 26 February 1934 to a poor family in [[Hwadae County]],{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}}{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''.

His eldest daughter [[Choe Il-sim]] is an aspiring scenario writer, having written scripts for the five-part movie series ''[[The Country I Saw]]'' (1988–).{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=186}}&lt;ref name="38no_"The"&gt;{{Cite web | title = 'The Country I Saw,' or 'How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love North Korea's Bomb (Almost)' | last = Lewis | first = Jeffery | work = 38 North | date = 30 August 2012 | accessdate = 19 December 2017 | url = http://www.38north.org/2012/08/jlewis083012/ | publisher =The US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Choe began working at the [[Korea Film Studio]],{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=51}} first as a deputy [[film director]] in 1955 and then as an independent director.{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''. North Korea Leadership Watch|2009|p=1}}{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}} He became the head of the studio in 1956 at the age of just 22.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=51}} As a filmmaker, he was largely self-taught but aspiring.{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}} In addition to his formal education in arts, he now had much experience with the [[Stalinist]] model of making films in particular.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} Choe's breakthrough was the 1963 film ''[[A Garden Zinnia]]''.{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}}

In 1968, [[Kim Jong-il]], the country's future leader, took control of the country's film industry. Kim lacked experience in the field and so he teamed up with Choe,{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=60}} who was much experienced by this time and was "[a]rguably the single North Korean most knowledgeable about film, other than Kim".{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=51}} Choe became Kim's closest partner in his activities related to film;{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=60}} his "film tutor". Their collaborations became immensely popular, Choe directing and Kim producing films that would become known as "[[Immortal Classics]]" and [[People's Prize]] winners.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}}&lt;ref name="Schönherr2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schönherr|first=Johannes|title=North Korean Cinema: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6n0itIPmakC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson|isbn=978-0-7864-6526-2|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first film Choe and Kim made together was ''[[Sea of Blood]]'' (1968),{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}}&lt;ref name="YoonWilliams2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoon|first1=Keumsil Kim|last2=Williams|first2=Bruce|title=Two Lenses on the Korean Ethos: Key Cultural Concepts and Their Appearance in Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|year=2015|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson|isbn=978-0-7864-9682-2|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[Five Guerilla Brothers]]'' the same year. By the end of the decade, Choe had been appointed as a supervisor of the film industry section of the [[Propaganda and Agitation Department]] of the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]].{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}}

[[File:North Korea mass games 1998.jpg|thumb|[[Mass games]] in [[Pyongyang]], a recurring propaganda spectacle developed by Choe]]
In 1972, Choe and Kim released ''[[The Flower Girl]]'',{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} The film augmented Choe's position as Kim's close confidant, making him responsible for propaganda spectacles beyond film.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=62}} Choe was promoted as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department and elected a member of parliament in the [[fifth Supreme People's Assembly]].{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}} Choe was now in charge of events like [[Day of the Sun]] celebrations and [[Liberation Day (North Korea)|Liberation Day]] marches. He developed [[mass games]] that would evolve into the [[Arirang Festival]],{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=62}} the organizing of which he is still overseeing.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=310}} Choe would also give artistic guidance to [[Korean revolutionary opera]]s and plays.{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}} For instance, he had directed an operatic adaption of ''Sea of Blood'' in 1971.&lt;ref name="Dayez-Burgeon2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dayez-Burgeon|first=Pascal|title=Histoire de la Corée: Des origines à nos jours|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpdSCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT187|year=2012|publisher=Tallandier|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-84734-897-2|page=187|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choe and Kim's relationship became a close and long one. Choe would be personally involved in the making of many more films and supervising the production of others, such as multi-part ''[[The Star of Korea]]'' (1980–1987).{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}}

}}
Choe Ik-gyu played a role in the abduction of [[Shin Sang-ok]] and [[Choi Eun-hee]], a famous [[South Korea]]n director-actress couple.{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''. North Korea Leadership Watch|2009|p=2}}

In a secret tape recorded by Shin and Choi, Kim Jong-il is heard confiding to the couple that he decided to kidnap them on the advice of Choe who considered Shin the best director of South Korea.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=235}}

After years of separation,{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=192}} when Shin and Choi were re-united by their captor, Kim Jong-il, on 6 March 1983,{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=202}} Choe was present. He would work with Shin from that point on to direct movies for Kim Jong-il.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=215}} He would pass on messages between Kim, Shin and Choi; the latter two rarely met Kim in person.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=273}}

First, Choe accompanied Shin and Choi on a trip from Pyongyang to [[Moscow]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Fischer|2016|pp=244–245}} The purpose of the trip was to scout for locations for the first film Shin had agreed to make for Kim Jong-il: ''[[An Emissary of No Return]]''.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=245}} Choe was discontent with the project. He had been an acclaimed film director in his own right, but now he had to mind his South Korean counterpart.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=249}} Both Shin and Choi disliked Choe.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=273}} Choe resorted to criticizing Shin's directing in front of the crew.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=249}} Shin gained back control of the project by threatening to report to Kim Jong-il about Choe's behavior.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=250}} The film was finished and would be played at the [[London Film Festival]] and Shin was to attend.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=264}} Shin contemplated escaping there, but Choe and an entourage of bodyguards had traveled to London in advance.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=265}}

After Shin and Choi had managed to escape in [[Vienna]], Choe was demoted from his position in the Propaganda and Agitation Department. He was sent into the countryside, his exact whereabouts unknown for years.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=303}}

===Return to politics===
[[File:North Korea — Pyongyang Opera (1026502447).jpg|thumb|[[Korean revolutionary opera]], an art Choe has been involved in as a director and cultural administrator]]
Choe Ik-gyu was allowed to return as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 1988.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=310}} He assumed full control of the theater and operatic fields. That year, he was involved in making ''[[The Life of Chunhyang]]'', an acclaimed [[folk opera]]. Choe guided performers "as if he were a stage director". Beginning with the early 1990s, Choe – credited under his pseudonym Choe Sang-geun – produced ''[[The Nation and Destiny]]''. Choe produced, directed and wrote scenarios throughout the production of the 50-part film series, which Kim Jong-il considered the last work made under his personal guidance. Choe briefly fell out of public life in 1993 when he was dismissed from his Propaganda and Agitation Department post again. Even during this period, Kim Jong-il allowed him to travel to [[Germany]] to treat his health problems, which reflects the amount of trust Kim had in Choe.{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=186}} All in all, Choe has been dismissed four times from the Propaganda and Agitation Department.{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''. North Korea Leadership Watch|2009|p=1}}

Choe became the [[Minister of Culture (North Korea)|Minister of Culture]] in September 2003 but retired temporarily some two years later because of [[diabetes]] and other chronic health issues.&lt;ref name="engl_YONH"/&gt; He relinquished the position in 2006.{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''. North Korea Leadership Watch|2009|p=2}} Choe was elected to the [[12th Supreme People's Assembly]] on 8 March 2009,&lt;ref name="engl_YONH"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Choe Ik-gyu Named to Key Post of Workers' Party | journal = North Korea Newsletter | number = 47 | publisher = Yonhap News Agency | date = 26 March 2009 | accessdate = 18 December 2017 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2009/03/25/85/0401000000AEN20090325004500325F.HTML }}&lt;/ref&gt; representing [[Electoral District #73]].{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''. North Korea Leadership Watch|2009|p=2}} He finally became the head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department in 2009. As the director of the Department,{{sfn|''Choe Ik-gyu''. North Korea Leadership Watch|2009|p=2}} Choe was one of North Korea's propaganda chiefs.&lt;ref name="inde_'Rut"&gt;{{Cite web | title = 'Ruthless' youngest son to succeed Kim Jong-il | last = Moore | first = Malcolm | work = Irish Independent | date = 3 June 2009 | accessdate = 19 December 2017 | url = https://www.independent.ie/world-news/asia-pacific/ruthless-youngest-son-to-succeed-kim-jongil-26540824.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Kang Nung-su]] in early February 2010 for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="nkle_Pers"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Personnel Shuffles in the first half of 2010 | work = North Korea Leadership Watch | date = 4 June 2010 | accessdate = 19 December 2017 | url = http://www.nkleadershipwatch.org/2010/06/04/personnel-shuffles-in-the-first-half-of-2010/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choe was often seen accompanying Kim Jong-il on formal occasions until [[Death of Kim Jong-il|the latter's death in 2011]].{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} When traveling outside North Korea, Choe uses the name Choe Sang-geun.{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=185}} Such was the case for instance when he visited [[Seoul]] in South Korea in 2000 in the capacity of the counsel to the [[National Orchestra of North Korea]].{{sfn|''North Korea Handbook''|2002|p=170}}

===Succession of Kim Jong-un===
Choe was among those who vouched for the succession of [[Kim Jong-un]] at a time when his ascension to power remained uncertain.&lt;ref name="Gause2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gause|first=Ken E.|title=North Korea under Kim Chong-il: Power, Politics, and Prospects for Change: Power, Politics, and Prospects for Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7xBIaMvveYC&amp;pg=PA219|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-38176-8|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Kim Jong-il, Choe would aide Kim's third wife [[Ko Yong-hui]], and [[Jang Song-thaek]].&lt;ref name="engl_YONH"/&gt;

[[Paul Fischer (author)|Paul Fischer]], the author of ''[[A Kim Jong-Il Production]]'', assesses that "[t]he modern North Korean state, which is a production, a display performance of its own, owes as much to Choe Ik-Gyu's taste and talents as it does to Kim Jong-Il."{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=62}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">The '''Christian Peace Conference''' ({{lang-cs|Křesťanská mírová konference}}) was an international organization based in [[Prague]] and founded in 1958 by [[Josef Hromádka]], a pastor who had spent the [[World War II|war years]] in the United States, moving back to [[Czechoslovakia]] when the war ended and [[Heinrich Vogel]], an evangelical theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Bekanntgabe von Verleihungen des Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3464">A '''cloud storage gateway''' is a network appliance or [[Server (computing)|server]] which resides at the customer premises and translates [[cloud storage]] [[Application programming interface|API]]s such as [[SOAP]] or [[REST]] to block-based storage protocols such as [[iSCSI]] or [[Fibre Channel]] or file-based interfaces such as [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] or [[Server Message Block|SMB]].&lt;ref name="GigaOm"&gt;{{Cite web |title= GigaOm, Show Me the Gateway — Taking Storage to the Cloud |author= Gary Orenstein |date= 22 June 2010 |url= http://gigaom.com/2010/06/22/show-me-the-gateway-taking-storage-to-the-cloud/ |accessdate= 18 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boles, Jeff. [http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid5_gci1528586,00.html Cloud file storage pros and cons]. {{date|15 Mar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 report by [[Gartner Group]], cloud gateways were expected to increase the use of cloud storage by lowering monthly charges and eliminating the concern of data security.&lt;ref name="gartner"&gt;Stanley Zaffos, Adam W. Couture. Hybrid Cloud Gateway Appliances Expand Cloud Storage Use Cases. Gartner Group Research G00209453. http://storageswiss.com/2014/05/09/hybrid-cloud-storage-vs-the-enterprise/{{date|10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market==
The cloud storage gateway market was estimated at $74 million in 2012,&lt;ref name="technavio"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2386303/global_cloud_storage_gateway_market_20122016 |title= Global Cloud Storage Gateway Market. 2012-2016 |author= TechNavio |publisher= Infiniti Research Limited |date= January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; up from $11 million at the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Sliwa, Carol. [http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/feature/New-hybrid-cloud-storage-appliances-attract-attention-for-primary-data New hybrid cloud storage appliances attract attention for primary data.] May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One analyst predicted in 2013 that the cloud storage gateway market might reach US$860 million by 2016.&lt;ref name="technavio"/&gt; In January 2013, some vendors were [[CTERA Networks]], [[Emulex]], [[Panzura]], [[Riverbed Technology]], Seven10, Sonian Inc., [[StorSimple]], [[Avere Systems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hybrid Cloud Storage vs. The Enterprise|url=http://storageswiss.com/2014/05/09/hybrid-cloud-storage-vs-the-enterprise/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TwinStrata]].&lt;ref name="technavio"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Unlike the cloud storage services which they complement, cloud storage gateways use standard network protocols which integrate with existing applications. Cloud storage gateways can also serve as intermediaries to multiple cloud storage providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.austintechnology.com.au/5-ways-cloud-technology-improves-business/|title=How Cloud Technology Improves your Business|last=|first=|date=2017-02-10|work=AustinTechnology|access-date=2017-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cloud storage gateways also include additional storage features such as [[backup]] and recovery, [[cache (computing)|caching]], [[data compression|compression]], [[encryption]], [[storage de-duplication]] and [[provisioning]].&lt;ref name="GigaOm"/&gt;

The '''Communist Party of the Donetsk People's Republic''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Донецкой Народной Республики}}) is a political faction of the [[Donetsk Republic (political party)|Donetsk Republic]] organization in the [[self-proclaimed]] [[Donetsk People's Republic]], led by Boris Litvinov, former [[Chairman of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic|chairman]] of the [[People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic|Supreme Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic]] then.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.tass.ru/world/753337|title=Communist Party created in Donetsk People’s Republic|newspaper=TASS|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On October 8, 2014 it was announced about creation of the party. Boris Litvinov who previously was the headed of a regional branch of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] in the [[Kirovsky District, Donetsk]]&lt;ref name=DPAResBL&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/07/24/7032902 "Parliament" of terrorists of "DNR" led by a communist], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (24 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161004190158/https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2016/05/19_a_8254373.shtml Communists of Donbass ask Zyuganov for protection]. Gazeta.ru. 20 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; was proclaimed chairman of the party. In May 2014 Boris Litvinov being a member of the Communist Party of Ukraine also was a member of the Borodai's government.&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt; In July through October 2014 Litvinov also headed the People's Soviet of self declared republic.&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt; After his dismissal from the post of chairman of People's Soviet, there were rumors that Litvinov was even briefly arrested, yet Litvnov himself denied them.&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt;

Litvinov said the Communists would support [[Alexander Zakharchenko]], current Prime Minister of Donetsk People's Republic, to win the [[Donbass general elections, 2014]] for premiership. The Communists have endorsed Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko’s candidature at the 2 November elections for premiership.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; In [[Donbass parliamentary elections, 2014|these elections]] the Communists were banned from participating because it "made too many mistakes" in its submitted documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/29/eastern_ukraine_donetsk_peoples_republic_elections_russia Eastern Ukraine's Fake State Is About to Elect a Fake Prime Minister]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some Russian media, the final party's lists were edited in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt; Selected members were allowed to be on the party list for the Donetsk Party.&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt; To the Soviet were elected only three members of the political organization and included Boris Litvinov, Vadim Zaibert, and Nikolai Ragozin.&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt; Zaibert was later killed in war and not replaced, thus leaving only two members of the party in the Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://leftrussia.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/donetsk-the-third-extraordinary-congress-of-the-communist-party-of-the-dnr-took-place/|title=Donetsk: The Third Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the DNR Took Place|date=2016-08-11|work=Left Russia.|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Litvinov and Ragozin were expelled from the Soviet due to "loss of confidence", thus leaving the party with no representatives.&lt;ref name=gazeta/&gt;

==Program==
The party's program is fully copied and is identical with the party's program of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/save/http://wpered.su/programma-kpdnr/ Communist Party of the Donetsk People's Republic program]. Vperyod.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the Holy See}}
A '''concordat''' is a convention between the [[Holy See]] and a [[sovereign state]] that defines the relationship between the [[Catholic Church]] and the state in matters that concern both,&lt;ref name=Metz137&gt;René Metz, "What is Canon Law?" (New York: Hawthorn Books, 1960 [1st Edition]), pg. 137&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the recognition and privileges of the Catholic Church in a particular country and with secular matters that impact on church interests.

According to P.W. Brown the use of the term "concordat" does not appear "until the pontificate of [[Pope Martin V]] (1413–1431) in a work by [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nicholas de Cusa]], entitled ''De Concordantia  Catholica''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25011853|title=The Pactum Callixtinum: An Innovation in Papal Diplomacy|first=P. W.|last=Browne|date=4 May 2018|publisher=|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=180–190|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concordat dates from 1098, and from then to the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] the Holy See signed 74 concordats.&lt;ref name=Metz137/&gt; Due to the substantial remapping of Europe that took place after the war, new concordats with [[succession of states|legal successor states]] were necessary.&lt;ref name=Metz137/&gt; The post-World War I era saw the greatest proliferation of concordats in history.&lt;ref name=Metz137/&gt;

Although for a time after the [[Second Vatican Council]], which ended in 1965, the term 'concordat' was dropped, it reappeared with the Polish [[Concordat of 1993]] and the Portuguese [[Concordat of 2004]]. A different model of relations between the Vatican and various states is still evolving&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Petkoff 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Declaration on Religious Liberty, ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Church teaching ==

The Catholic church historically claimed not to be bound to one form of government over another, but was willing to work with any kind of government, so long as the rights of God and believers were maintained. Pius XI wrote in 1933: &lt;blockquote&gt; Universally known is the fact that the Catholic Church is never bound to one form of government more than to another, provided the Divine rights of God and of Christian consciences are safe. She does not find any difficulty in adapting herself to various civil institutions, be they monarchic or republican, aristocratic or democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XI, [[Dilectissima Nobis]] 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Church–State dichotomy ==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2012}}
From a Church–State perspective, the contentions regarding Concordats involves two perspectives.

From a Catholic perspective, the Church has the moral and theological right to enter into diplomatic relations with states in order to reach agreements regarding the care of its members residing there. This is the concept of ''[[Libertas ecclesiae]]'' (freedom of the Church).

However, from a non-Catholic perspective, Catholic church privileges pose certain concerns regarding religious freedom, such as:
* concordats give to the Church a privileged position that other religious groups are denied (European history in numerous books reveals this fact)
* concordats may not be "the same as treaties" because they are entered into by an entity that is BOTH religious and political in nature, viz., the Catholic Church, with exception to states which are expressly atheist or are identified as choosing anti-religious views, whereas any other treaty is regularly between two sovereign entities on a horizontal level, i.e., purely political in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Graham, "Introduction: Reflections on Vatican Diplomacy," in Kent and Pollard, eds., ''Papal Diplomacy'', 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; and
* depending on the negotiations agreed upon in the concordat, some religious groups face the threat of being marginalized. For example, in Spain, although the Constitution guarantees religious freedom (theoretically), yet in practice, the Church is mentioned by name and holds a pre-eminent position among other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Bonime-Blanc, ''Spain’s Transition to Democracy: The Politics of Constitution-making'' (Boulder, CO: Westview  Press, Inc., 1987), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, debate has occurred regarding whether the Spanish government should maintain a concordat with the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Elena Olmos Ortega, "Los Acuerdos con la Santa Sede: Instrumentos Garantes de la Libertad Religiosa," in Maria del Mar Martin, Mercedes Salido, Jose Maria Vazquez Garcia-Penuela, eds., ''Iglesia Catolica y Relaciones Internacionales: Actas del III Simposio Internacional de Derecho Concordatorio'' (Granada: Editorial Comares, 2008), 489–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of concordats==
[[File:Gérard - Signature du Concordat entre la France et le Saint-Siège, le 15 juillet 1801.jpg|thumb|Signature du Concordat entre la France et le Saint-Siège, le 15 juillet 1801]]
* The [[Concordat of 1801]] was an agreement between [[Napoleon]] and [[Pope Pius VII]]. During the French Revolution, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] had taken Church properties and issued the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Subsequent laws abolished Christian holidays.&lt;ref name="georgetown2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |title=France |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=2011-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206213909/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |archivedate=6 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }} See drop-down essay on "Religion and Politics until the French Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious had either gone into exile or been executed during the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Church gave up any claims to lands confiscated after 1790, but secured the right to public worship, subject to any public safety concerns on the part of the local prefect. Napoleon was able to pacify French Catholics, while limiting the Papacy's influence in France. While the Concordat restored some ties to the [[papacy]], it largely favored the state.&lt;ref name=Vilmer&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jean-Baptiste Jeangène|last1=Vilmer |title=Commentaire du Concordat de 1801 entre la France et le Saint-Siège |journal=Revue d’Histoire Ecclésiastique |date=2007 |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=124-154 |url=http://www.jbjv.com/Commentaire-du-Concordat-de-1801.html |trans-title=Comment on the Concordat of 1801 between France and the Holy See |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year Napoleon unilaterally amended the agreement with the [[Organic Articles]] legislating religious practice.

Some concordats guarantee the Catholic Church the tax-exempt status of a charity, being by fact the largest charitable institution in the world, either stating this explicitly, as in Brazil (2008, Article 15)&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazil {{!}} Concordat: text (2008) |url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=15311&amp;kb_header_id=37261 |website=Concordat Watch |accessdate=2018-09-18|translator-first=Daniel|translator-last=Sottomaior}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy (1984, Article 7.3),&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=878&amp;kb_header_id=39221|title=Concordat Watch - Italy - Modifications to the Lateran Concordat (1984): text|author=|date=|website=www.concordatwatch.eu|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108222655/http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=878&amp;kb_header_id=39221|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or phrasing it indirectly, as in Portugal (2004, art. 12).&lt;ref name="fiftyone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=1361&amp;kb_header_id=4131|title=Concordat Watch - Portugal - Concordat (2004) : text|author=|date=|website=www.concordatwatch.eu|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the political will is present, such concordat privileges can be extended by domestic legislation. In 1992 the tax exemption granted the Church by the Italian concordat was interpreted by a law which permits the Catholic Church to avoid paying 90% of what it owes to the state for its commercial activities.&lt;ref name="fiftytwo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maltese |first1=Curzio |translator-first=Graeme A.|translator-last= Hunter|title=Property tax relief for the Church: EU takes Italy to Court |url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showdoc.php?org_id=843&amp;doc_id=1741 |website=Concordat Watch|accessdate=2018-09-18 |date=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a small shrine within the walls of a cinema, holiday resort, shop, restaurant or hotel is sufficient to confer religious exemption.&lt;ref name="fiftythree"&gt;[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showdoc.php?org_id=843&amp;doc_id=1761 "Gli alberghi dei santi alla crociata dell'Ici"] ("Tax crusade marches on the holy hotels"), Curzio Maltese, La Repubblica, 25 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 [[Neelie Kroes]], the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] announced an investigation of this. Then, in August, the deputy finance minister in [[Romano Prodi]]’s fragile center-left coalition said the issue needed to be tackled in the next year's budget.&lt;ref name="fiftyfour"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hooper |first1=John |title=Church ready to forgo tax breaks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/28/italy.johnhooper |accessdate=2018-09-18 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306160110/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/28/italy.johnhooper |archivedate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after that nothing more about this was heard from the [[Barroso Commission]] and a few months later the Prodi government fell.

The Slovak concordat (2000, art. 20.2) ensures that church offertories are "not subject to taxation or to the requirement of public accountability".&lt;ref name="fortythree"&gt;{{cite web |title=Texts of Slovak concordats and other Church-state documents. Basic Concordat (2000) |url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/kb-1222.834 |translator-first=David |translator-last=Holohan|website=Concordat Watch |accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also the case in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], where far larger sums are involved. [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro|The Basilica at Yamoussoukro]], is estimated to have cost $300 million, and the additional running expenses for what is the largest church in the world are also shielded from scrutiny by the 1992 concordat concluded with the Ivorian dictator. Houphouët-Boigny claimed that these funds came from his private fortune. A Vatican official is reported to have called the agreement over the foundation set up to administer these funds "a delicate matter".&lt;ref name="fiftysix"&gt;
[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958078-2,00.html "The Basilica in the Bush"], Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine, 3 July 1989.
&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this concordat ensures that the foundation’s income and assets remain untaxed (art. 9.1), it holds these funds beyond the reach of both criminal and civil law (art. 7.1), it permits this money to be sent out of the country (art. 13.2) and it keeps all the foundation’s documents "inviolable", in other words, secret (art. 8).&lt;ref name="twentyseven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=7181&amp;kb_header_id=41031|title=Côte d'Ivoire - Agreement concerning the "International Foundation, Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro" (1992): text|translator-first=Muriel|translator-last=Fraser|website=Concordat Watch|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colombia]] there was a crisis between state and church in 1994 when Attorney-General [[Gustavo de Greiff#Problems with the Church|Gustavo de Greiff]] accused several Bishops of having illegal contacts with the [[FARC]] guerrillas. It turned out that under Colombia's concordat with the Holy See, members of the clergy could only be investigated by ecclesiastical courts which are ruled by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], and that the Bishops were therefore immune from investigation by the civil authorities on what many in Colombia considered to be a serious felony.

There have been at least several hundred concordats over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=871&amp;kb_header_id=822|title=Concordat Watch - Concordat Strategy - What are Concordats?|author=|date=|website=www.concordatwatch.eu|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---a very negative view of Catholics and therefore more believable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8029">The term '''corporate immune system''', or '''corporate immune response''', refers to a process within [[corporation]]s that demands organizations within the company accomplish activities in a certain way, a form of [[Conformity|conformity tendencies]]. It is, in effect, the active form of [[groupthink]], when the past outcome of groupthink processes forces itself on organizations that are otherwise different.

The term is most commonly used to describe such processes that drive out [[innovation]] and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial activity]] within organizations. This is often found within in large multi-divisional companies, where it manifests itself as inter-divisional fighting, often subtle or unintended. [[Multinational corporation]]s are particularly common examples, as divisional differences can be compounded by different corporate structures, languages and even [[time zone]]s.

==Basic definition==
The term may refer to any organizational process that tends to drive out differences, or alternately demands [[conformity]]. The name refers to parallels with biological [[immune system]]s, which attempt to drive out "foreign" invaders and sometimes react negatively against the organism it is supposed to protect:

{{quote | text=Much as the human body sends out white blood cells to fight off anything that is aberrant to the greater host organism, corporations encourage -- often subtly -- the operations which have different work cultures to be more like everyone else. Importantly, this phenomenon often occurs even when the aberrant organization is superior to the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball Fisher, [http://www.thefishergroup.com/Free%20Resources/Teams_and_the_Bottom_Line.pdf "Teams and the Bottom Line"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919210016/http://www.thefishergroup.com/Free%20Resources/Teams_and_the_Bottom_Line.pdf |date=September 19, 2011 }}, The Fisher Group, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The immune system in the body is built into the cells in the bloodstream. It has the task of eliminating or neutralizing any alien bodies that find their way into the system. This system acts to prevent alien substances from affecting the body in a harmful way. However, as in the case of the rejection of an organ transplant, it is possible that the immune system may reject an alien body that is to its long-term benefit. By analogy, our belief is that most initiatives, and subsidiary initiatives in particular, face a corporate immune system that views them as alien and potentially harmful bodies.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|pp=153-154}}}}

The essence of the term is the ''activity'' of driving out differences, as opposed to the natural ''tendency'' to do so.

==Stifling innovation==
===Underlying issues===
Within any corporation, [[project manager|manager]]s are presented with new projects and have to gain funding and staffing resources to implement them. These projects may be organizational in nature, implementing a new sales and inventory system for instance, or product related, like manufacturing and marketing a new toy. The process of introducing and implementing new ideas is a well studied area of [[microeconomics|business theory]].{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=151}}

At any point in time, any particular manager might be presented with several new ideas, and has to choose which among these to promote. Implementation carries with it certain risks, both outright failure of the initiative, or through [[opportunity cost]]s when some other initiative is not carried out due to conflicting needs or lack of resources. In larger companies, many managers will present ideas that have to compete for larger pools of resources, as decided on by upper management. Corporations normally have well-defined procedures for assessing these proposals, in order to decide among the many concepts so the most rewarding and viable projects gain support.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}}

In an ideal corporation, the company would attempt to assess the proposal and decide whether or not to fund it based solely on its merits. Under these circumstances, it would be expected that most errors in this process would be the rejection of good ideas, rather than the approval of bad ones.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}} This is because large corporations are typically dedicated to certain markets, and dedicate a large amount of their resources to improving the processes that address those markets in order to improve efficiency as well as competitiveness. Ideas for new products or markets are generally more risky, or at least more difficult to assess, than ideas that apply to the existing corporation, which is better understood.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}} That is, corporations tend to focus on "exploitation", to the detriment of "exploration".&lt;ref&gt;James March and Herbert Simon, "Organizations", Wiley, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifestation and examples===
Real-world companies rarely act in a manner that one might consider "ideal". Among the many problems that might cause a good idea to be rejected are a lack of resources, a lack of market understanding, and any number of external or internal factors. Corporate immune response may be one of these internal factors, manifesting itself as internecine fighting between divisions, or simply the rejection of ideas from divisions that are "too different" to be understood. In this context, it could be any of "the set of organizational forces that suppress the advancement of creation-oriented activities such as initiatives."{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}}

[[Apple Computer]] has been a common example of the corporate immune response in action. During the late 1980s and the 1990s in particular, many ideas were promoted within the company, only to face severe attacks by other groups within the company. Many of these attacks were not based on real problems with the ideas, but more typically a perceived threat to the sales of an existing product. For instance, the [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] faced enormous problems within the company and almost caused its inventor to quit the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | work=The Spokesman-Review | date=October 10, 1993 | location=Spokane, Washington | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19931010&amp;id=Tm1XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TPEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6737,6192649 | title='Pirate' project blossomed into prized Apple product | page=21| accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other frequently-cited examples in computing include [[Taligent]], [[OpenDoc]], [[Workplace OS]], and the [[Star Trek project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Eric | last=Bangeman | url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2003/09/mac-09182003.ars | title=Mac.Ars takes on pre-Jobs Apple and the Paris Apple Expo 2003 | publisher=ArsTechnica | date=September 18, 2003 | accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">'''Diplomacy Monitor''' was a free [[Internet]]-based tool created in 2003 to monitor [[diplomacy]] documents ([[communiqué]]s, official statements, interview transcripts, etc.) published in various diplomacy-related websites, including official sources from [[government]]s ([[head of state]] websites, [[consulate]]s, [[foreign ministries]]) all over the world.

Diplomacy Monitor addressed the emerging Internet-based [[public diplomacy]], whereby the growing number of governments embraces the power of internet to communicate with public worldwide.

The core of the Monitor was a [[web crawler]] which operated on the websites of interest. After the crawler identified documents of potential interest, they were reviewed and processed by the editorial staff and entered into the [[database]].

Diplomacy Monitor ceased operations in November 2009.

Since its establishment, Diplomacy Monitor was quickly recognized as a convenient tool for research in international issues.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DoubleExposure-promo.jpg|thumb|Promotional image of Linda Cullen (b. 1958) and Bob Robertson (1945-2017) for the CBC radio show ''Double Exposure'']] --&gt;
'''''Double Exposure''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[radio]] and [[television]] comedy series which satirized contemporary Canadian politics. The show starred Linda Cullen and Bob Robertson, and focused primarily on the stars' voice impersonations of Canadian political and cultural figures.  In addition CBC staff announcer Bob Sharples provided the introductions and conclusions to ''Double Exposure'' shows and provided narraration for many ''Double Exposure'' skits.

It played on CBC Radio (now known as [[CBC Radio One]]) at 11:33&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Saturday mornings, and on CBC Stereo (now known as [[CBC Radio 2]]) Saturday evenings at 6:32&amp;nbsp;p.m. (one half-hour later in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]). Unlike many previous CBC radio comedies, such as ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' or ''[[Frantics (comedy)|Frantic Times]]'', the show would be recorded wholly in a studio without a live audience. The duo made the jump to television with an initial satirical special in 1994, and became a television series in 1997.

==Radio show==
The radio version of the show ran from 1986 to 1997 on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]]. Prior to the launch of their own show, Robertson and Cullen were known as regular contributors of comedic sketches to [[Jack Farr (broadcaster)|Jack Farr]]'s ''[[The Radio Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Master mimic Robertson thankful for his Exposure". ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', April 16, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

It satirized contemporary Canadian politicians such as [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Joe Clark]], [[Preston Manning]], [[Barbara McDougall]], [[Bill Vander Zalm]] and others, as well as international figures such as [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Robertson specialized in such impersonations as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Ross Perot]], [[John Major]], and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]], and Cullen could do imitations of [[Sandie Rinaldo]], [[Princess Diana]], [[Julia Child]] and [[Wendy Beckett|Sister Wendy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19970517/97_0517BIO.htm#exposure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical sketches on the radio show would include over-the-top impersonations of [[Brian Tobin]] rescuing frozen [[turbot]] from the dinner plate, or Preston Manning "ee-lim-inating" everything possible. Broadcaster [[Adrienne Clarkson]] was mocked by a dead-on parody of her precise diction and haughty demeanor with the recurring catchphrase "I'm Adrienne Clarkson, and you're not", derived from Chevy Chase's early ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' refrain. (Clarkson subsequently became [[Governor General of Canada]] near the end of ''Double Exposure''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s television run.)

In 1994 the show was named the best weekly network program on CBC Radio and Stereo. They also occasionally did special radio shows targeting specific Canadian political events, such as the 2000 [[Canadian federal election, 2000|Canadian federal election]]. They also won an [[ACTRA Award]] for best comedy, and were the highest-rated radio comedy program of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatre.ubc.ca/gvpta/conference_bios.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216072046/http://www.theatre.ubc.ca/gvpta/conference_bios.htm |archivedate=2005-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television show==
The duo did New Year's Eve television specials for several years beginning in 1994. In 1997, ''Double Exposure'' moved permanently to television, moving from [[CBC Television]] to the rival [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] until 2000. On radio, the show consisted of comedic sketches and monologues; on its CBC television specials, their voice impersonations were often set to actual film clips of the politicians being satirized. The weekly series on CTV featured the pair in live sketches as well.

==Other projects==

In 2000, ''Double Exposure'' returned to CBC for a rare special radio program on the evening of the [[Canadian general election, 2000|federal election]].

In 2002, Cullen and Robertson joined with other comedians in the new satirical comedy series ''[[Point Blank (television show)|Point Blank]]'', which aired on [[The Comedy Network]]. In November 2004, Cullen and Robertson were inducted into the [[BC Entertainment Hall of Fame]].

On December 16, 2005, the Double Exposure team appeared on [[Lorne Elliott]]'s show ''[[Madly Off in All Directions]]'' on CBC Radio One. This was their first appearance on CBC Radio in five years.

In 2008, Cullen and Robertson launched Gross National Product, a website which features satirical [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grossnationalproduct.ca/ Gross National Product] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102193647/http://grossnationalproduct.ca/ |date=November 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, they started blogging and podcasting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8717">For electoral purpose, each province or municipality (the highest administrative division) of Vietnam is subdivided into electoral units (''đơn vị bầu cử'') which are further subdivided into voting zones (''khu vực bỏ phiếu''). The number of electoral divisions varies from election to election and depend on the population of that province or municipality

Since the most recent [[Vietnamese parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election in 2011]], there are 183 electoral units and 89,960 voting zones.

==Election==
''see also [[Elections in Vietnam]]''

Delegates of the [[National Assembly of Vietnam]] are directly elected from population for a five-year term. The National Assembly of Vietnam is unicameral, therefore the number of delegates in an area depends on the population of that area. Currently there are 500 delegates of the National Assembly.

==Electoral divisions==
Vietnam is a unitary state with 58 [[Provinces of Vietnam|provinces]] and 5 [[Municipalities of Vietnam|municipalities]] or centrally-controlled cities. Each province (''tỉnh'') and municipality (''thành phố trực thuộc trung ương'') is subdivided into electoral units (''đơn vị bầu cử''). The number of electoral divisions in each province and municipality depends on the population of that province and municipality. Normally an electoral unit within a province or municipality covers about 2 to 6 district-level subdivisions (''đơn vị hành chính cấp huyện''; which could be rural districts (''huyện''), urban districts (''quận''), provincial cities (''thành phố thuộc tỉnh'') or towns (''thị xã'')).

Each electoral unit is further subdivided into voting zones (''khu vực bỏ phiếu''). Two or three delegates would be elected from each electoral unit.

Since 2011 there are 183 electoral units and 89,960 voting zones.

The '''Equal Access Act''' is a [[United States]] [[Law of the United States|federal law]] passed in 1984 to compel federally funded [[secondary schools]] to provide equal access to extracurricular student clubs. Lobbied for by Christian groups who wanted to ensure students the right to conduct Bible study programs during lunch and after school, it is also essential in litigation regarding the right of students to form [[gay–straight alliance]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Chuck|title=Homosexuality and the Law: A Dictionary|year=2001|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-57607-267-7|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to form groups focused on any religion or on [[secularism]].&lt;ref name="secularstudents.org"&gt;https://www.secularstudents.org/eaaarticle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intent of the Act==
The Act provides that if a school receives federal aid and has a "limited open forum," or at least one student-led ''non-curriculum'' club that meets outside of class time, it must allow additional such clubs to be organized, and must give them equal access to meeting spaces and school publications. Exceptions can be made for groups that "materially and substantially interfere with the orderly conduct of educational activities within the school," and a school can technically "opt out" of the act by prohibiting all non-curriculum clubs.&lt;ref name=alexander258&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Public School Law, 8th edition |first=Alexander |last=Kern |author2=M. David Alexander |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2012 |page=258 |isbn=049591049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was ruled [[constitutional]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1990 in the case ''[[Westside School District v. Mergens|Westside Community Schools v. Mergens]]'', and the school was ordered to allow a student [[Christian]] group to meet.&lt;ref name=alexander258/&gt;

At the college level, controversy arose over whether a university should pay for a publication by a religious student organization.  The court ruled in ''[[Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia]]'' that if the university pays for other student organization publications, it must also pay for religious organization publications.

The Equal Access Act has also been used to fight opposition to [[gay-straight alliance]]s in high schools across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macgillivray|first=Ian|title=Gay-Straight Alliances: A Handbook for Students, Educators, and Parents|year=2007|publisher=Harrington Park Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-56023-684-9|pages=37–53|url=http://www.ianmacgillivray.com/gay-straight-alliances.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323021915/http://www.ianmacgillivray.com/gay-straight-alliances.html|archivedate=2012-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration in high schools who have opposed the formation of gay-straight alliances, and formally denied their organizers privileges and the right to assemble, found themselves being sued and caught in legal disputes. The State Supreme Courts have always ruled in favor of the gay-straight alliance, stating that the particular school must either allow the gay-straight alliance, or ban all non-curriculum groups from assembling on school property.

The Act requires that if a school permits any religious student group, then it must allow groups focused on any religion or on [[irreligion]].  This has been applied to stop schools from blocking Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and other religious groups as well as Christian ones.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/joint-statement-current-law-religion-public-schools&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Secular Student Alliance]] and other secular groups have invoked the Act to stop public high schools from blocking students organizing secular student groups.&lt;ref name="secularstudents.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secularstudents.org/nationalorgspartner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines for groups and/or clubs under its protection==
* Host school is a secondary school and receives federal financial assistance
* Already have a limited open forum, which means that at least one student-led, non-curriculum club that meets outside of class time
* Attendance is voluntary
* Group is student-initiated
* Group must guarantee aid to members who cannot afford to attend all related events and/or meetings 
* Group is not disruptive
* Persons of the community that are not part of the school  may not "direct, conduct, control, or regularly attend meetings"

==Guidelines for schools under its protection and/or enforcement==
* All groups and/or clubs have equal access to meeting spaces, the PA system, school periodicals, bulletin board space, etc.
* School officials preserve and have the right to monitor meetings
* Officials preserve and have the right to require all clubs and/or groups to follow a set of guidelines
* Schools may limit meeting times and locations, only if the rules apply to all groups and/or clubs
* Schools may prohibit people from the community from attending student groups and/or clubs.

{{Merge from|Stakeholder (law)|discuss=Talk:Escrow#Stakeholder merge|date=September 2017}}
An '''escrow''' is a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and [[disburse]]s money or documents for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties, or an account established by a [[broker]] for holding funds on behalf of the broker's [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]] or some other person until the consummation or termination of a transaction;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisonmccloskeyescrow.com/escrow-process-tips.asp|title=Escrow Process Elements &amp; Tips|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916071430/http://www.allisonmccloskeyescrow.com/escrow-process-tips.asp|archivedate=2007-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, a trust account held in the borrower's name to pay obligations such as property taxes and insurance premiums.
The word derives from the [[Old French]] word ''{{lang|fro|escroue}}'', meaning a scrap of paper or a scroll of parchment; this indicated the deed that a third party held until a transaction was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=escrow|title=escrow - Origin and meaning of escrow by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Escrow generally refers to money held by a third-party on behalf of transacting parties. It is mostly used regarding the purchase of shares of a company. It is best known in the United States in the context of real estate (specifically in [[mortgage loan|mortgages]] where the mortgage company establishes an escrow account to pay [[property tax]] and [[insurance]] during the term of the mortgage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mortgage.lovetoknow.com/Escrow|title=Escrow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}} Escrow is an account separate from the mortgage account where deposit of funds occurs for payment of certain conditions that apply to the mortgage, usually property taxes and insurance. The escrow agent has the duty to properly account for the escrow funds and ensure that usage of funds is explicitly for the purpose intended. Since a mortgage lender is not willing to take the risk that a homeowner will not pay property tax, escrow is usually required under the mortgage terms. Escrow companies are also commonly used in the transfer of high value personal and business property, like [[web site|websites]] and businesses, and in the completion of person-to-person remote [[auctions]] (such as [[eBay]]), although the advent of new low cost online escrow services has meant that even low cost transactions are now starting to benefit from use of escrow. In the [[UK]], escrow accounts are often used during private property transactions to hold solicitors' clients' money, such as the deposit, until such time as the transaction completes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.esources.co.uk/id/111/|title=Using Escrow For Payments (Payments Series - Article 2) - eSources.co.uk|first=eSources|last=UK|website=articles.esources.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include purchases of a second hand car, where the money may be released at the end of a warranty period, deposits for a property rental, where the money is released after the tenant moves out, provision of construction services, where the money may be released when the building work is complete to a defined standard, or when defined parts of the work are complete, perishable food products, sold on live seafood auctions (such as [[Gfresh]]).

An unrelated type of escrow is when a purchaser of a complex system, such as bespoke process control software or a large industrial installation, may require the supplier to place the design into [[source code escrow]], so that the purchaser remains in a position to maintain and modify the system in case of the demise of the supplier.

===Internet escrow===
Internet escrow has been around since the beginning of Internet auctions and commerce. It was one of the many developments that allowed for trust to be established in the online sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.ebay.com/community/letter.html|title=eBay Community : Letter|website=pages.ebay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with traditional escrow, Internet escrow works by placing money in the control of an independent and licensed third party in order to protect both buyer and seller in a transaction. When both parties verify the transaction has been completed per terms set, the money is released. If at any point there is a dispute between the parties in the transaction, the process moves along to dispute resolution. The outcome of the dispute resolution process will decide what happens to money in escrow. With the growth of both business and individual commerce on the web traditional escrow companies have been supplanted by new technologies.

In the [[United States]], the [[California Department of Business Oversight]] enacted Internet escrow companies as a licensed class effective 1 July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FIN&amp;sectionNum=17003.|title=California Financial Code, Division 6 Escrow Agents, Chapter 1, Section 17003|website=California Legislative Information|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Internet escrow company to be licensed was Escrow.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbo.ca.gov/Consumers/finance/pdf/qa.pdf|title=California Department of Corporations Online Escrow Fraud Questions &amp; Answers|website=California Department of Business Oversight|publisher=California Department of Corporations|access-date=14 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921101945/http://www.dbo.ca.gov/Consumers/finance/pdf/qa.pdf|archivedate=21 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Fidelity National Financial]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fidelity+National+Financial,+Inc.+to+Offer+Internet+Escrow+Services...-a056325638|title=Fidelity National Financial, Inc. to Offer Internet Escrow Services Through Escrow.com.|work=PR Newswire Association LLC|access-date=14 July 2016|via=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the [[Payment Services Directive]], which commenced on 1 November 2009, has for the first time allowed the introduction of very low-cost Internet escrow services that are properly licensed and government-regulated. The regulatory framework in the EU allows these web-based escrow services, which operate along the lines of expensive ''[[Letter of Credit]]'' service run by banks for international buyers and sellers, but at a cost in cents rather than thousands of Euros, the ability to enhance security in commercial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/index_en.htm|title=Directive on Payment Services (PSD)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105011542/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/index_en.htm|archivedate=2014-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bogus escrow]] methods have been employed online. In an effort to persuade a wary Internet auction participant, the perpetrator will propose the use of a third-party escrow service. The victim is unaware that the perpetrator has actually created an escrow site that closely resembles a legitimate escrow service. The victim sends payment to the phony escrow company and receives nothing in return. Alternatively, the victim sends merchandise to the subject and waits for his/her payment through the escrow site, which is never received because it is illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/crimeschemes.aspx|title=Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) - Internet Crime Schemes|website=www.ic3.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genuine online escrow companies will be listed on a government register, and it is advised that users should never use an online escrow service without first verifying that it is genuine by independently viewing a government on-line register. Currently there is not a license offered by the US Federal Government for online escrow services. However, certain states offer their own license for online escrow services; such as the California Department of Business&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Department of Business|url=http://www.dbo.ca.gov/Consumers/finance/OnlineEscrow_FAQs.asp#1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Department of Financial Institutions|url=http://www.azdfi.gov/Consumers/Licensees/licenses.asp?list=EA&amp;name=Escro%20Agents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking===
Escrow is used in the field of automatic banking and vending equipment. One example is [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs), and is the function which allows the machine to hold the money deposited by the customer separately, and in case he or she challenges the counting result, the money is returned. Another example is a [[vending machine]], where the customer's money is held in a separate escrow area pending successful completion of the transaction. If a problem occurs and the customer presses the refund button, the coins are returned from escrow; if no problem occurs, they fall into the coin vault of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vendingtimes.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=43736AA44A6840059F9B258F4E620E3F Up and Running], Tim Sanford, [[Vending Times]], August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property===
[[Source code escrow]] agents hold [[source code]] of [[software]] in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. Normally{{dubious|date=June 2011}} you do not own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that you are accessing, under the terms of a regular [[SaaS]] or desktop software agreement. This does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to your business and you remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless you have an escrow agreement in place. Escrow is when the software source code is held by a third party – an escrow agent – on behalf of the customer and the supplier.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Information escrow agents, such as the [[International Creative Registry]], hold in escrow intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information's ownership, contents, and creation date.

===Law===
Escrow is also known in the judicial context. So-called escrow funds are commonly used to distribute money from a cash settlement in a [[class action]] or environmental enforcement action. This way the defendant is not responsible for distribution of judgment moneys to the individual plaintiffs or the court-determined use (such as [[environmental remediation]] or [[Environmental mitigation|mitigation]]). The defendant pays the total amount of the judgment (or settlement) to the court-administered or appointed escrow fund, and the fund distributes the money (often reimbursing its expenses from the judgment funds).

===Real estate===
In the U.S., escrow payment is a common term referring to the portion of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] [[payment]] that is designated to pay for [[Property tax|real property taxes]] and [[Home insurance|hazard insurance]]. It is an amount "over and above" the [[Debt|principal]] and [[interest]] portion of a mortgage payment. Since the escrow payment is used to pay taxes and insurance, it is referred to as "T&amp;I", while the mortgage payment consisting of principal and interest is called "P&amp;I". The sum total of all elements is then referred to as "[[PITI]]", for "Principal, Interest, Tax, and Insurance". Some mortgage companies require [[customers]] to maintain an escrow account that pays the property taxes and hazard insurance. Others offer it as an option for customers. Some types of [[loans]], most notably [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) loans, require the lender to maintain an escrow account for the life of the loan.

Even with a fixed [[interest rate]], monthly mortgage payments may change over the life of the loan due to changes in property taxes and insurance premiums. For instance, if a hazard insurance premium increases by $120.00 per year, the escrow payment will need to increase by $10.00 per month to account for this difference (in addition to collection for the resulting escrow shortage when the mortgage company paid $120.00 more for the hazard insurance premium than what was anticipated). By RESPA guidelines the escrow payment must be recomputed at least once every 12 months to account for increases in property taxes or insurance. This is called an escrow analysis.

The escrow payment used to pay T&amp;I is a long term escrow account that may last for years or for the life of the loan. Escrow can also refer to a shorter term account used to facilitate the closing of a real estate transaction. In this type of escrow, the escrow company holds onto all documents and money related to closing the transaction, rather than having the buyer and the seller deal directly with each other. When and if the transaction is ready to close, the escrow company distributes all funds and documents to their rightful recipients, and records the deed with the appropriate authorities.&lt;ref name="time-escrow"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does an Escrow Account Work?|url=http://time.com/money/collection-post/2792060/how-does-an-escrow-account-work/|accessdate=9 June 2018|publisher=[[Time.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of an online escrow company's license can be checked with the regulating authority. Usually this is accessible through their official website, and should always be checked before dealing with an escrow company to ensure it is not a look-alike or fraud.

This service is offered by multiple bankers as an outsourced product.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Escrow arrangement is often used as a part of [[mergers and acquisitions]] a supplement that warranties and indemnities offered by the seller(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elementalcosec.com/guides/ma-escrow/|title=Guide to M&amp;A Escrow - Elemental CoSec|website=www.elementalcosec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will be particularly likely where the [[credit risk]] of the seller(s) is of a poor quality and therefore the buyer is concerned about their ability to recover any sums that may become due.

Unlike many other forms of escrow, escrow arrangements in corporate transactions are often designed to last for extended periods rather than simply to complete the transfer of an asset. There is also commonly the requirement for an escrow agent to adjudicate on the validity of a claim on the escrow funds, which can lead to the risk of the dispute between the parties.

Due to the length that the funds are held, the escrow arrangements need to take into account different considerations to those for other escrow arrangements, for example (i) information provision to the parties; (ii) application of [[interest]] earned on the funds; and (iii) [[credit risk|credit worthiness]] of the [[financial institution]].

==Legal implications==
Not all escrow agreements impose the duties of a legal trustee on the escrow agent, and in many such agreements, escrow agents are held to a mere [[gross negligence]] standard and benefit from [[indemnity]] and [[hold harmless]] provisions.

If the escrow agent is licensed by governmental authority{{where|date=September 2017}}, then much higher legal standards may apply.

The European Federalist Party (abbreviated as PFE) is a European political party founded on 6 November 2011 in Paris. It is the result of the reunification of the Federalist Party of France and the [[Europe United Party]] which had a presence in several countries of the European Union. It is one of the first European-oriented political parties that openly defends European federalism and is not a coalition of pre-existing national parties.

In 2016, the office was composed of President Pietro De Matteis, Vice President Geogios Kostakos, Secretary General Emmanuel Rodary, Treasurer Mariarosaria Marziali, John Retetagos, Marco Marazzi and Michel Caillouet. Following the general assembly of December 6, 2016, the office of the European Federalist Party merges with the citizen movements Stand-up for the United States of Europe and USE Now to create Stand Up For Europe. For their part, the various national associations composing the PFE, decide to continue their political action under the banner European Federalists Party. Yves Gernigon, president of the Federalist party (France), then becomes leader of the PFE.

The European Federalist Party is made up of members from 12 European countries, from civil society, who face their professional life and political commitment.

== Political strategy==
The European Federalist Party, like the federalist model, leaves a great deal of autonomy to its national sections, which have a certain freedom of adaptation of the European program to the local culture. On the other hand, the European program whose primary goal is to build a European federation is common. The PFE thus seeks to differentiate itself from the current official formations of the European Parliament by proposing a real cohesion on the European level. The announced goal is to create a mass popular movement around the party and the idea of a federal Europe to respond to the current crisis. The European Federalist Party has participated in numerous elections, including the French presidential election and the European elections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfi.co/europe/2014/05/europes-first-transnational-list-has-been-presented-by-the-european-federalist-party/|title=Europe’s First Transnational List has been Presented by the European Federalist Party|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2014|website=cfi.co|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/europa/notizie/rubriche/speciali_elezioni2014/2014/05/06/partito-federalista-presenta-candidati-in-6-paesi_c6a7f78e-91bf-4233-8dea-8480f947006d.html|title=Partito federalista presenta candidati in 6 Paesi|last=|first=|date=May 8, 2014|website=ansa.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{CN|date=November 2018}}

== Political project ==
The goal of the European Federalist Party is to create a European Federation of voluntary member states of the European Union. It aims to present candidates at all elections across Europe. He was initially supported by prominent European personalities, such as Marco Pannella (former MEP, deputy, Italian senator and Altiero Spinelli collaborator), who was a member.{{CN|date=November 2018}}

The members of the PFE campaign for the creation of a supranational European State with limited sovereign powers and political institutions: government, assembly, federal Senate representing the Member States.

=== Main proposals ===
As the name suggests, the party's goal is to make the European Union a true federal state. This project can be carried out possibly from a nucleus of volunteer countries members of the eurozone. That implies : 

*Establish a federal Constitution in place of the many current treaties. 
*Elect a federal president by direct universal suffrage to represent the federation internationally. Guarantor of its constitution, it would exercise the powers of the European Council. 
*Make the European Commission a true federal government. 
*Strengthen the powers of the European Parliament. The vote must be regionalized in order to bring MEPs closer to their constituents, while the Council of the European Union must be replaced by a real "European Senate" (upper house), with a view to a bicameral system. 
*Deepen the Court of Justice of the European Union into a real Supreme Court. 
*Strengthen the powers of the European Central Bank to empower it to deal with financial crises. 
*Create a European Headquarters responsible for the European Common Army. 
*Deepen European citizenship to make it a true nationality, independent of national citizenship. 
*Define a common European foreign and diplomatic policy to better defend European interests vis-à-vis other major powers (notably the United States and China). 
*Create a European budget to finance major projects and create jobs throughout Europe. 
*Establish European independent control authorities in the areas of environment, health security and bioethics. 
*Countries wishing to join the Federal Union will have to adopt the European Constitution to maintain a certain coherence in its functioning. This does not exclude the possibility of cooperation agreements with privileged partners.

=== The EFP and the EU ===
The PFE believes that most of the ills in the European Union today are due to old age and the shortcomings of an institutional scheme that was completed by the crisis. The European Federalist Party wants to go beyond the current Union, which according to him{{who|date=November 2018}} is "bureaucratic and undemocratic". 

The federal Europe desired by the PFE has nothing to do with the current European Union, which would be too weak to defend French and European interests, and too far from the concerns of citizens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35953">{{About|executive pay in general|compensation of executive in the US|Executive pay in the United States}}
'''Executive compensation''' or '''executive pay''' is composed of the [[Salary|financial compensation]] and other non-financial awards received by an executive from their firm for their service to the organization. It is typically a mixture of salary, bonuses, shares of or [[call option]]s on the company [[stock]], [[Employee benefit|benefit]]s, and [[perquisites]], ideally configured to take into account government regulations, tax law, the desires of the organization and the executive, and rewards for performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBPaskPAJUQC |title=The complete guide to executive compensation |first=Bruce R. |last=Ellig |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three decades starting with the 1980s saw a dramatic rise in executive pay relative to that of an [[average worker's wage]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;see, for one example, ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 4, 2005, [https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,1542100,00.html "US executive pay goes off the scale"]&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent in a number of other countries. Observers differ as to whether this rise is a natural and beneficial result of competition for scarce business talent that can add greatly to stockholder value in large companies, or a socially harmful phenomenon brought about by social and political changes that have given executives greater control over their own pay.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]], ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'',  W W Norton &amp; Company, 2007, 143-148&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have indicated that executive compensation should be better aligned with social goals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodgers |first=W. |last2=Gago |first2=S. |year=2003 |title=A model capturing ethics and executive compensation |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=189–202 |doi=10.1023/B:BUSI.0000004589.34756.8a }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. public health goals&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce and D. Denkenberger, “[https://www.academia.edu/19786309/Aligning_Executive_Incentives_with_Global_Public_Health_Goals Aligning Executive Incentives with Global Public Health Goals]”  ''Progress in Health Sciences'' '''5'''(2), 16-23 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Executive pay is an important part of [[corporate governance]], and is often determined by a company's [[board of directors]].

==Types==
{{See also|Employee stock option|Golden parachute|Performance-related pay}}
There are six basic tools of [[Financial compensation|compensation]] or [[remuneration]]:

* [[salary]]
* short-term incentives (STIs), sometimes known as [[Performance-related pay|bonuses]]
* [[long-term incentive plan]]s (LTIPs)
* [[employee benefit]]s
* paid expenses ([[perquisite]]s)
* [[insurance]]

In a modern corporation, the [[CEO]] and other top executives are often paid salary plus short-term incentives or bonuses. This combination is referred to as Total Cash Compensation (TCC).  Short-term incentives usually are formula-driven and have some performance criteria attached depending on the role of the executive. For example, the Sales Director's performance related bonus may be based on incremental revenue growth turnover; a CEO's could be based on incremental profitability and revenue growth. Bonuses are after-the-fact (not formula driven) and often discretionary. Executives may also be compensated with a mixture of cash and shares of the company which are almost always subject to [[vesting]] restrictions (a long-term incentive).  To be considered a long-term incentive the measurement period must be in excess of one year (3–5 years is common).  The vesting term refers to the period of time before the recipient has the right to transfer shares and realize value.  Vesting can be based on time, performance or both.  For example, a CEO might get 1 million in cash, and 1 million in company shares (and share buy options used). Vesting can occur in two ways: "cliff vesting" (vesting occurring on one date), and "graded vesting" (which occurs over a period of time) and which maybe "uniform" (e.g., 20% of the options vest each year for 5 years) or "non-uniform" (e.g., 20%, 30% and 50% of the options vest each year for the next three years).
Other components of an executive compensation package may include such perks as generous [[retirement plan]]s, [[health insurance]], a [[chauffeur]]ed limousine, an [[executive jet]], and interest-free [[loans]] for the purchase of housing.

===Stock options===
Executive stock option pay rose dramatically in the United States after scholarly support from University of Chicago educated Professors Michael C. Jensen and Kevin J. Murphy.  Due to their publications in the Harvard Business Review 1990 and support from Wall Street and institutional investors, Congress passed a law{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} making it cost effective to pay executives in equity.

Supporters of stock options say they align the interests of CEOs to those of shareholders, since options are valuable only if the stock price remains above the option's [[strike price]]. Stock options are now counted as a corporate expense (non-cash), which impacts a company's [[income statement]] and makes the distribution of options more transparent to shareholders. Critics of stock options charge that they are granted without justification as there is little reason to align the interests of CEOs with those of shareholders.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}   Empirical evidence{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} shows since the wide use of stock options, executive pay relative to workers has dramatically risen.  Moreover, executive stock options contributed to the accounting manipulation scandals of the late 1990s and abuses such as the [[backdating|options backdating]] of such grants.  Finally, researchers have shown {{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that relationships between executive stock options and stock buybacks, implying that executives use corporate resources to inflate stock prices before they exercise their options.

Stock options also incentivize executives to engage in [[risk-seeking]] behavior. This is because the value of a [[call option]] increases with increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] (see [[options pricing]]).  Stock options also present a potential up-side gain (if the stock price goes up) for the executive, but no [[downside risk]] (if the stock price goes down, the option simply isn't exercised).  Stock options therefore can incentivize excessive risk seeking behavior that can lead to catastrophic corporate failure.

===Restricted stock===
Executives are also compensated with [[restricted stock]], which is stock given to an executive that cannot be sold until certain conditions are met and has the same value as the market price of the stock at the time of grant. As the size of stock option grants have been reduced, the number of companies granting restricted stock either with stock options or instead of, has increased. Restricted stock has its detractors, too, as it has value even when the stock price falls. As an alternative to straight time vested restricted stock, companies have been adding performance type features to their grants. These grants, which could be called performance shares, do not vest or are not granted until these conditions are met. These performance conditions could be earnings per share or internal financial targets.

==Levels==
The levels of compensation in all countries has been rising dramatically over the past decades. Not only is it rising in absolute terms, but also in relative terms.  In 2007, the world's highest paid chief executive officers and chief financial officers were American. They made 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965.&lt;ref name="Herald Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/18/news/letter.php|title=Letter From Washington: As U.S. rich-poor gap grows, so does public outcry|accessdate=2007-02-18|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 the highest paid CEO was [[Viacom]]'s Philippe P. Dauman at $84.5 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.nytimes.com/executive_compensation The Pay at the Top] April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. has the world's highest CEO's compensation relative to manufacturing production workers. According to one 2005 estimate the U.S. ratio of CEO's to production worker pay is 39:1 compared to 31.8:1 in UK; 25.9:1 in Italy; 24.9:1 in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/11/15/GR2008111500247.html?sid=ST2008111500315&amp;s_pos=list Landy, Heather, "Behind the Big Paydays"], ''The Washington Post'', November 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The explosion in executive pay has become controversial, criticized by not only leftists but conservative establishmentarians such as [[Peter Drucker]], [[John Bogle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=868508 The Executive Compensation System is Broken] John C. Bogle| December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124027114694536997 A Crisis of Ethic Proportions]  By JOHN C. BOGLE wsj.com April 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Buffett]].&lt;ref name="Herald Tribune"/&gt;

The idea that stock options and other alleged pay-for-performance are driven by economics has also been questioned.  According to economist [[Paul Krugman]], 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Today the idea that huge paychecks are part of a beneficial system in which executives are given an incentive to perform well has become something of a sick joke. A 2001 article in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', "The Great CEO Pay Heist" encapsulated the cynicism: You might have expected it to go like this: The stock isn't moving, so the CEO shouldn't be rewarded. But it was actually the opposite: The stock isn't moving, so we've got to find some other basis for rewarding the CEO.` And the article quoted a somewhat repentant [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] [a theorist for stock option compensation]: `I've generally worried these guys weren't getting paid enough. But now even I'm troubled.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/06/25/305448/index.htm The Great CEO Pay Heist Executive] 25 June 2001, Fortune&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', 2007, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recently, empirical evidence showed that compensation consultants only further exacerbated the controversy. A study of more than 1,000 US companies over six years finds “strong empirical evidence” that executive compensation consultants have been hired as a “justification device” for higher CEO pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compensation consultants lead to higher CEO pay|url=http://insight.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2014/compensation-consultants-lead-to-higher-ceo-pay/|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of high executive pay say that the global war for talent and the rise of [[private equity]] firms can explain much of the increase in executive pay. For example, while in conservative Japan a senior executive has few alternatives to his current employer, in the United States it is acceptable and even admirable for a senior executive to jump to a competitor, to a private equity firm, or to a private equity [[portfolio company]]. Portfolio company executives take a pay cut but are routinely granted stock options for ownership of ten percent of the portfolio company, contingent on a successful tenure. Rather than signaling a conspiracy, defenders argue, the increase in executive pay is a mere byproduct of supply and demand for executive talent. However, U.S. executives make substantially more than their European and Asian counterparts.&lt;ref name="Herald Tribune"/&gt;

===United States===

The U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) has asked publicly traded companies to disclose more information explaining how their executives' compensation amounts are determined.  The SEC has also posted compensation amounts on its website&lt;ref&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission [https://www.sec.gov website]&lt;/ref&gt; to make it easier for investors to compare compensation amounts paid by different companies.  It is interesting to juxtapose SEC regulations related to executive compensation with Congressional efforts to address such compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1125295 Kenneth Rosen, Who Killed Katie Couric?

Since the 1990s, CEO compensation in the US has outpaced corporate profits, economic growth and the average compensation of all workers.  Between 1980 and 2004, Mutual Fund founder [[John Bogle]] estimates total CEO compensation grew 8.5% year, compared to corporate profit growth of 2.9%/year and per capita income growth of 3.1%.&lt;ref name=Bogle&gt;[http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/jpwalsh/PDFs/Bogle%20-%202008%20-%20Reflections%20on%20CEO%20compensation%20--%20AMP%20paper.pdf Reflections on CEO Compensation] by John C.

Jennifer Carpenter and David Yermack (Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999) p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of corporate income devoted to compensating the five highest paid executives of (each) public firms more than doubled from 4.8% in 1993-1995 to 10.3% in 2001-2003.&lt;ref name=Bebchukplus&gt;Based on the ExecuComp database of 1500 companies. {{Cite web| last=Bebchuk| first=Lucian| last2=Grinstein| first2=Yaniv|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Bebchuk_et%20al_510.pdf|title=The Growth of Executive Pay|publisher=Harvard University: John M. Olin Center for Law, Economics and Business|date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pay for the five top-earning executives at each of the largest 1500 American companies for the ten years from 1994 to 2004 is estimated at approximately $500 billion in 2005 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the ExecuComp database , from Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), (p.9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late March 2012 USA Today's tally showed the median CEO pay of the [[S&amp;P 500]] for 2011 was $9.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/story/2012-03-28/ceo-pay-executive-compensation/53839786/1 CEO pay rises again in 2011, while workers struggle to find work] By Matt Krantz and Barbara Hansen, ''USA TODAY''. Updated 31 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower level executives also have fared well. About 40% of the top 0.1% income earners in the United States are executives, managers, or supervisors (and this doesn't include the finance industry) — far out of proportion to less than 5% of the working population that management occupations make up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.williams.edu/Economics/wp/BakijaColeHeimJobsIncomeGrowthTopEarners.pdf Jobs and Income Growth of Top Earners and the Causes of Changing Income Inequality: Evidence from U.S. Tax Return Data] Jon Bakija, Adam Cole, Bradley T.

A study by [[University of Florida]] researchers found that highly paid CEOs improve company profitability as opposed to executives making less for similar jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.ufl.edu/2009/12/17/ceo-pay-2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609045955/http://news.ufl.edu/2009/12/17/ceo-pay-2/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-09 |title=Paying CEOs more than other CEOs results in stockholder dividends |accessdate= |author=Cathy Keen |authorlink= |date=2009-12-17 |work=University of Florida News |publisher=ufl.edu |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a review of the experimental and quasi-experimental research relevant to executive compensation, by Philippe Jacquart and [[J. Scott Armstrong]], found opposing results. In particular, the authors conclude that "the notion that higher pay leads to the selection of better executives is undermined by the prevalence of poor recruiting methods. Moreover, higher pay fails to promote better performance. Instead, it undermines the intrinsic motivation of executives, inhibits their learning, leads them to ignore other stakeholders, and discourages them from considering the long-term effects of their decisions on stakeholders"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacquart|first=Philippe|author2=Armstrong, J.

Another study by Professors Lynne M. Andersson and Thomas S. Batemann published in the ''Journal of Organizational Behavior'' found that highly paid executives are more likely to behave cynically and therefore show tendencies of unethical performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A 2012 report by the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]] demonstrated that the top 100 Canadian CEOs were paid an average of C$8.4 million in 2010, a 27% increase over 2009, this compared to C$44,366 earned by the average Canadian that year, 1.1% more than in 2009.&lt;ref name=canadian&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/business/article/1109514--highest-paid-canadian-ceos-got-27-per-cent-pay-hike Highest-paid Canadian CEOs got 27 per cent pay hike] Dana Flavelle| thestar.com 2| January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The top three earners were automotive supplier [[Magna International]] Inc. founder [[Frank Stronach]] at C$61.8 million, co-CEO Donald Walker at C$16.7 million and former co-CEO Siegfried Wolf at C$16.5 million.&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Although executive compensation in the UK is said to be "dwarfed" by that of corporate America, it has caused public upset.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,1542100,00.html "US executive pay goes off the scale"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism of high levels of executive pay, the [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] organisation set up the High Pay Commission. Its 2011 report described the pay of executives as "corrosive".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15827683 High pay of UK executives corrosive, report says], ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011/January 2012 two of the country’s biggest investors, [[Fidelity International Limited|Fidelity Worldwide Investment]], and the [[Association of British Insurers]], called for greater shareholder control over executive pay packages.&lt;ref name=boil/&gt;  Dominic Rossi of Fidelity Worldwide Investment stated, “Inappropriate levels of executive reward have destroyed public trust and led to a situation where all directors are perceived to be overpaid. The simple truth is that remuneration schemes have become too complex and, in some cases, too generous and out of line with the interests of investors.”  Two sources of public anger were [[Barclays]], where senior executives were promised million-pound pay packages despite a 30% drop in share price; and [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] where the head of investment banking was set to earn a "large sum" after thousands of employees were made redundant.&lt;ref name=boil&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/business/in-britain-a-rising-outcry-over-lavish-executive-pay.html In Britain, Rising Outcry Over Executive Pay That Makes ‘People’s Blood Boil’] By JULIA WERDIGIER| nytimes.com 22 January 2012| accessed 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
Since the early 2000s, companies in Asia are following the U.S. model in compensating top executives, with bigger paychecks plus bonuses and stock options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spreading the Yankee Way of Pay|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-04-17/spreading-the-yankee-way-of-pay}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with a great diversity in stages of development in listing rules, disclosure requirements and quality of talent, the level and structure of executive pay is still very different across Asia countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deliberating on the Best Executive Compensation Practices and Strategies in SEA: Kevin Ong Goes Candid|url=http://www.hrinasia.com/employee-relations/deliberating-on-the-best-executive-compensation-practices-and-strategies-in-sea-kevin-ong-goes-candid/|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosures on top executive pay is less transparent compared to that in the United Kingdom.

=== China ===
Executive compensation in China still differs from compensation in Europe and the U.S. but the situation is changing rapidly. Based on a research paper by Conyon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Compensation in China|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267406508_Executive_Compensation_in_China|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, executive compensation in China is mostly composed of salaries and bonuses, as stock options and equity incentives are relatively rare elements of a Chinese senior manager's compensation package. Since 2016 Chinese-listed companies were required to report total compensation of their top managers and board members. However, transparency and what information companies choose to release to the public varies greatly. Chinese private companies usually implement a performance-based compensation model, whereas State-owned enterprises apply a uniform salary-management system. Executive compensation for Chinese executives reached USD 150 000 on average and increased by 9.1% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Compensation in China: An Overview|url=https://www.ginkgosearch.com/executive-compensation-in-china/|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
There are a number of strategies that could be employed as a response to the growth of executive compensation.

*Extend the vesting period of executives' stock and options.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203462304577138691466777460 How to Fix Executive Compensation] by Alex Edmans, 27 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Current vesting periods can be as short as three years, which encourages managers to inflate short-term stock price at the expense of long-run value, since they can sell their holdings before a decline occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21595985-when-bosses-take-short-view-law-unintended-consequences When Bosses Take The Short-Term View] by The Economist, 8 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
*As passed in the [[Swiss referendum "against corporate Rip-offs" of 2013]], investors gain total control over executive compensation, and the executives of a board of directors. Institutional intermediaries must all vote in the interests of their beneficiaries and banks are prohibited from voting on behalf of investors.
*[[Corporation#Financial disclosure|Disclosure]] of salaries is the first step, so that company stakeholders can know and decide whether or not they think remuneration is fair. In the UK, the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20021986.htm SI 2002/1986]&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a requirement into the old [[Companies Act 1985]], the requirement to release all details of pay in the annual accounts. This is now codified in the [[Companies Act 2006]]. Similar requirements exist in most countries, including the U.S., Germany, and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
*A [[say on pay]] - a non-binding vote of the general meeting to approve director pay packages, is practised in a growing number of countries. Some commentators have advocated a mandatory binding vote for large amounts (e.g. over $5 million).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100174138 Failing Banks' Executive Pay May Face New Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim is that the vote will be a highly influential signal to a board to not raise salaries beyond reasonable levels. The general meeting means [[shareholders]] in most countries. In most European countries though, with two-tier board structures, a supervisory board will represent employees and shareholders alike. It is this supervisory board which votes on executive compensation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
*Another proposed reform is the [[bonus-malus]] system, where executives carry down-side risk in addition to potential up-side reward.
*[[Progressive taxation]] is a more general strategy that affects executive compensation, as well as other highly paid people. There has been a recent trend to cutting the highest bracket tax payers, a notable example being the tax cuts in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} For example, the Baltic States have a [[flat tax]] system for incomes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Executive compensation could be checked by taxing more heavily the highest earners, for instance by taking a greater percentage of income over $200,000.
*[[Maximum wage]] is an idea which has been enacted in early 2009 in the United States, where they capped executive pay at $500,000 per year for companies receiving extraordinary financial assistance from the U.S. taxpayers. The argument is to place a cap on the amount that any person may legally make, in the same way as there is a floor of a [[minimum wage]] so that people can not earn too little.&lt;ref&gt;Dietl, H., Duschl, T. and Lang, M.

In the [[United States]], a '''high-deductible health plan''' ('''HDHP''') is a [[health insurance]] plan with lower [[insurance premium|premiums]] and higher [[deductible]]s than a traditional health plan.   Being covered by an HDHP is also a requirement for having a [[health savings account]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health401k.com/2011/09/high-deductible-health-plans/|title=High-Deductible Health Plans |publisher=Health 401k|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some HDHP plans also offer additional "wellness" benefits, provided before a deductible is paid.  High-deductible health plans are a form of catastrophic coverage, intended to cover for [[catastrophic illness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969|date=11 January 2012|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adoption rates of HDHPs have been growing since their inception in 2004, not only with increasing employer options, but also increasing government options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claxton|first1=G|title=Employer Health Benefits: 2016 Annual Survey|url=http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-2016-Annual-Survey|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, HDHPs represented 29% of the total covered workers in the United States; however, the impact of such benefit design is not widely understood. {{Citation needed|reason=The citation provided did not address the point made here.|date=November 2018}}

==Minimum and maximum deductibles==

Participation in a qualifying HDHP is a requirement for health savings accounts and other tax-advantaged programs. A qualifying plan must have a minimum deductible and out-of-pocket maximum which the [[Internal Revenue Service]] may modify each year to reflect change in [[cost of living]]. According to the instructions for IRS form 8889, "this limit does not apply to deductibles and expenses for out-of-network services if the plan uses a network of providers. Instead, only deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses for services within the network should be used to figure whether the limit is reached."

==Impact on preventive services and utilization==

When a consumer purchases a health insurance policy, there is a [[moral hazard]] risk because the consumer may utilize too much medical care because the full cost of care is defrayed (i.e. he/she has a lower [[marginal cost]] for care than the open market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stano|first1=Sherman Folland, Allen C. Goodman, Miron|title=The economics of health and health care|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780132773690|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates of [[Consumer-driven healthcare]] (CDHC) such as HDHPs operate on the premise that imprudent choices made by patients may be avoided if they are held financially responsible through high copayments and deductibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilensky|first1=G. R.|title=Consumer-Driven Health Plans: Early Evidence And Potential Impact On Hospitals|journal=Health Affairs|date=1 January 2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=174–185|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.1.174}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, studies show that HDHP may actually promote behavior such as avoiding [[preventive care]] visits and reducing much needed [[ambulatory care]], especially for those with chronic conditions or low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Taxes/Pages/Health-Savings-Accounts.aspx|website=www.treasury.gov|accessdate=7 July 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|reason=Only contains links to forms/instructions and PDFs for HSA's yearly adjustments. Oddly, the 'accessdate' given in the citation is two years after the page says it was last updated.}}

==Personal finance implications==

To qualify for an HDHP, an individual plan must have a deductible of at least $1,300 and family plans must have a deductible of at least $2,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claxton|first1=G|title=Employer Health Benefits: 2016 Annual Survey|url=http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-2016-Annual-Survey|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An HDHP's total yearly out-of-pocket expenses (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) can't be more than $6,550 for an individual or $13,100 for a family (This limit doesn't apply to out-of-network services).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdus|first1=S.|last2=Selden|first2=T. M.|last3=Keenan|first3=P.|title=The Financial Burdens Of High-Deductible Plans|journal=Health Affairs|date=5 December 2016|volume=35|issue=12|pages=2297–2301|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the relatively high cost of HDHPs, the increased out-of-pocket costs can be burdensome especially for low income families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Deductible Health Plans|url=http://www.health401k.com/2011/09/24/high-deductible-health-plans/|website=Health 401k|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a way to try and offset the cost of care, HDHP policy holders may contribute to a [[health savings account]] (HSA) with pre-tax income.&lt;ref name="health.usnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Renter|first1=E|title=Should you Roll the Dice on a High-Deductible Health Plan?|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/10/should-you-roll-the-dice-on-a-high-deductible-health-plan|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HSA contributions, unlike other tax-advantaged investment vehicles, offer a triple tax benefit – tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=S|title=IRS Sets 2017 HSA Contribution Limits|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/irs-sets-2017-hsa-contribution-limits.aspx|website=SHRM|accessdate=7 July 2017|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum contribution limits policy holders may make to their HSA in 2018 are $3,450 (individual) and $6,900 (family) with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for people age 55 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thurber|first1=E|title=How to attract the high-deductible patient|url=https://www.advisory.com/research/market-innovation-center/the-growth-channel/2013/12/how-to-attract-the-high-deductible-patient|website=www.advisory.com|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging issues==

The number of people enrolled in HDHPs is increasing, but this is likely due to the rising cost of health care and cost-shifting to consumers – not due to the fact that HDHPs necessarily provide better care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claxton|first1=G|title=Employer Health Benefits: 2016 Annual Survey|url=http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-2016-Annual-Survey|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[American Health Care Act of 2017]] could result in higher deductibles (or total out-of-pocket cost) to consumers and leave 23 million Americans without insurance, according to the [[Congressional Budget Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jan|first1=T|title=High-deductible health plans make Affordable Care Act 'unaffordable,' critics say - The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/11/16/high-deductible-health-plans-make-affordable-care-act-unaffordable-critics-say/eaWZZJNrFhm6vVPDBcdZ0I/story.html|website=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurtzleben|first1=D|title=GOP Health Plan Would Leave 23 Million More Uninsured, Budget Office Says|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/24/529902300/cbo-republicans-ahca-would-leave-23-million-more-uninsured|website=NPR.org|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trump Administration is proposing to nearly double the maximum HSA contribution for a family from $6,750 to $13,100 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebeling|first1=Ashlea|title=IRS Sets 2018 Health Savings Account Limits, House Votes To Expand HSAs Under Trumpcare|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2017/05/04/irs-sets-2018-health-savings-account-limits-house-votes-to-expand-hsas-under-trumpcare/#66ab4e5b549d|website=Forbes|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An increase in HSA contribution limits will provide little benefit to the low-income households, which already find HDHPs to be less affordable in the event of a catastrophic illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorpe|first1=K. E.|last2=Allen|first2=L.|last3=Joski|first3=P.|title=Out-Of-Pocket Prescription Costs Under A Typical Silver Plan Are Twice As High As They Are In The Average Employer Plan|journal=Health Affairs|date=5 October 2015|volume=34|issue=10|pages=1695–1703|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One method to entice consumers to pursue HDHPs is low- or no-cost wellness benefits, which provides the insured with better access to preventive care visits and tools at lower cost.&lt;ref name="health.usnews.com"/&gt;  If successful, these plans may support the ongoing shift from curative to [[preventive health care]].

== Growth of HDHPs ==
High deductible health plans (HDHPs) have much lower premiums but high deductibles, co insurance and out of pocket maximums.&lt;ref&gt;HealthCare.gov. High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). In: Services. USCfMM, ed. Baltimore, MD2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to low upfront costs HDHPs are increasing in popularity with employers, with 24% offering some form of HDHP in 2013 (up from 5% in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/snapshots-the-prevalence-and-cost-of-deductibles-in-employer-sponsored-insurance/|title=Snapshots: The Prevalence and Cost of Deductibles in Employer Sponsored Insurance|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the individual assumes all medical costs until the minimum deductible is met. The Affordable Care Act ([[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]]), passed in 2010, has led to a significant expansion of HDHPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/cdc-nearly-40-of-us-adults-have-high-deductible-health-plans.html|title=CDC: Nearly 40% of US adults have high-deductible health plans|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed replacement of the ACA will continue with expansion of the cost sharing model while reducing the financial subsidies for the out of pocket expenses of low income patients. Specifically, the bill repeals ACA cost-sharing reduction provisions after 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jost|first=T|date=2017|title=Examining the House Republican ACA Repeal and Replace Legislation|url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170307.059064/full/|journal=Health Affairs|volume=2017: Project Hope: The People to People Health Foundation, Inc.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost-sharing and price shopping and consumer demand ==
The economic principle behind HDHPs is 'cost–sharing', a "method of financing health care that require some direct payments for services by patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The economics of Health and Health care|last=Folland|first=S|publisher=Pearson Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Increasing deductibles is one perceived way to cut health care costs by decreasing its overall usage. As out-of-pocket expenses shift from insurers and employers to individuals and employees, consumers will become more discriminant in their insurance products and engage in a higher degree of price shopping. Consumers will also compare the value of medical services provided at one site compared to another in deciding where to pursue health care services. Taken together, HDHPs should decrease health care utilization and stem the increase in national health care costs.  Success of this theory depends on ability of patients to make informed decisions on their health care purchase&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginsburg|first=PB|date=2007|title=Shopping for price in medical care|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=26 | issue = 2 |pages=208–216|via=|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.2.w208}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to what they do for goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/bp358-increased-health-care-cost-sharing-works/|title=Increased health care cost sharing works as intended: It burdens patients who need care the most|last=Gould|first=E|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With high deductibles, consumers face incentives to consider price when choosing health care providers and medical services. This economic model however remains unproven. A 2016 survey has shown members of HDHP and traditional plans to be equally likely to price shop for medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siniako|first=AD|date=2016|title=High-Deductible Health Plan Growth, and Shopping for Health Care: Enrollees with Skin in the Game|url=|journal=JAMA|volume=176 | issue = 3 |pages=395–397|via=|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.7554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers choose health care for a variety of reasons and not all of health services and amenities are amenable to price shopping.  Researchers have defined five situations which are more suitable for effective price shopping than others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# The services are not complex.
# The need for the services is not urgent.
# A diagnosis has already been made.
# Bundled prices are the norm for the service.
# The insurance benefit structure provides incentives to choose lower price providers.

== Unintended effects of cost sharing ==
While HDHPs are useful vehicles for the right consumer, there are concerns that patients may delay care due to high costs, often to their own detriment. When patients postpone necessary or preventative care (outpatient visits, screening and diagnostic testing), they may end up in hospitals' emergency rooms or wards for treatment. The tradeoff of forgoing care early for acute, resource-intensive hospitalizations later ultimately increases overall health care costs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/21-statistics-on-high-deductible-health-plans.html|title=21 statistics on high-deductible health plans|last=Murphy|first=B|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to 43% of insured patients said that they delayed or skipped physician-recommended tests or treatments because of high associated costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An additional economic principle commonly linked to HDHPs is a Health Savings Account (HSA). [[Health savings account|HSA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are tax-exempt accounts that individuals with HDHPs fund in order to pay for future medical expenses/costs for which they are now responsible.  "Introduced in 2003 as a part of the Medicare prescription drug benefit legislation, the HSA is a less-restrictive medical savings account, owned by the employee, and open to anyone enrolled in a [HDHP] and not already covered by public or private insurance" &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; . HSAs are designed to offset financial burden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/insurance/T027-C000-S002-health-savings-accounts.html|title=FAQs About Health Savings Accounts|work=www.kiplinger.com|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; of increased cost-sharing related to HDHPs, but enrollment in HSA has been limited. A 2016 study showed 61.6% of enrollees in HDHP lacked an HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdus|first=S|date=2016|title=The Financial Burdens of High-Deductible Plans|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35 | issue = 12 |pages=2297|via=|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on physician, hospital and clinical supply ==
As stated above, individuals with HDHPs often forgo or delay care due to increased cost sharing, and this often leads to patients presenting to health care providers and institutions later on in much worse condition{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. This pattern has a significant effect on the supply side of health care{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Hospitals and health care institutions take on increasing amounts of bad debt with the advent of HDHP as patients exhaust their deductibles soon after being admitted for care and default on outstanding balances{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. With rise in cost sharing, hospitals are collecting more money directly from the patients; from 2011 to 2014, the number of consumer payments to health care providers increased 193 percent according to a study by to the "Trends in Healthcare Payments Fifth Annual Report: 2014" from InstaMed.&lt;ref&gt;Instamed. Trends in Healthcare Payments Fifth Annual Report: 2014. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; From a physician/hospital supply, HDHP have forced institutions to become more consumer conscious as patients (due to price shopping) do their own research and understand their options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=D|date=2016|title=High-deductible plans have made IU Health more consumer-conscious|url=|journal=Modern Healthcare|volume=46 | issue = 22 |pages=30–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If patients with HDHPs forgo primary care, this lessens the volume and revenue they are able to generate. It also means that, later on, the burden and intensity of care per episode is much greater. The same goes for specialists as well who see less patients undergoing preventative screening and maintenance care (colonoscopies, mammograms, routine laboratory testing, etc.) and then end up with serious (and preventable) conditions.  In the long term, the cost and burden is invariably greater{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Physicians struggle with having cost become a greater reason for opting for or against a medical interaction or procedure than the health benefits for the individual{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

In [[economics]], '''hysteresis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὑστέρησις}} ''hysterēsis'', from {{lang|grc|ύστερέω}} hystereō, "(I) lag behind, come later than")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|u(ste/rhsis|ὑστέρησις}}, {{LSJ|u(stere/w|ύστερέω|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hysteresis}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to effects that persist after the initial causes giving rise to the effects are removed.&lt;ref name="Cross1993"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rod |last=Cross |title=On the Foundations of Hysteresis in Economic Systems |journal=Economics and Philosophy |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=53–74 |doi=10.1017/S0266267100005113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main areas in economics where hysteresis effects are invoked to explain economic phenomena are [[unemployment]] and international trade.&lt;ref name="Cross1993" /&gt;

For instance, in labor economics hysteresis refers to the possibility that periods of high [[unemployment]] tend to increase the rate-of-unemployment-below-which-inflation-begins-to-accelerate, commonly referred to as the [[natural rate of unemployment]] or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ([[NAIRU]]).&lt;ref name="BlanchardSummers1986"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Olivier J. |last=Blanchard |authorlink=Olivier Blanchard |first2=Lawrence H. |last2=Summers |authorlink2=Lawrence Summers |title=Hysteresis and the European Unemployment Problem |work=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |year=1986 |volume=1 |pages=15–78 |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c4245.pdf |jstor=3585159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication for statistical characterization of unemployment==

If the unemployment rate exhibits hysteresis, then it follows a statistically [[stationary process|non-stationary process]], because the [[expected value]] of the unemployment rate now and in the future permanently shifts when the rate itself changes.  The process with hysteresis is a [[unit root]] process, which in its simplest form can be characterized as

:&lt;math&gt;U_t = U_{t-1} + e_t,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt; is the unemployment rate at time ''t'' and &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt; is a stationary error term representing outside shocks to the rate.  According to this characterization, &lt;math&gt;E_{t-1}(U_{t+\tau}) = U_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\tau = 0, 1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; refers to an expectation conditional on values observed no later than time ''t''–1; any temporary shock to unemployment, represented by a single non-zero value of &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt;, results in a permanent change to expected unemployment (even for &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; indefinitely large so the expectation is for indefinitely far into the future).  A more elaborate model would allow &lt;math&gt;E_{t-1}(U_{t+\tau})&lt;/math&gt; to go up positively but less than one-for-one with &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt;.  In contrast, a non-hysteresis model of unemployment would have &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt; following a stationary process, so that &lt;math&gt;E_{t-1}(U_{t+\tau})&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrarily large &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; would always equal a permanently fixed natural rate of unemployment.

==Causes==

When some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, there are fewer employed workers left. As the [[insider-outsider theory of employment|employed workers]] usually have the power to influence or set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for even higher wages when the economy again gets better, instead of letting the wage stay at the [[equilibrium wage]] level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis, i.e., the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.&lt;ref name="BlanchardSummers1986" /&gt;

It has also been argued that unemployed people lose their skills during unemployment, which makes them less likely to again get jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves Heap, Economic Journal 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy implications==

If there is no hysteresis in unemployment, then for example if the [[central bank]] wishes to lower the [[inflation|inflation rate]] it may shift to a contractionary [[monetary policy]], which if not fully anticipated and believed will temporarily increase the unemployment rate; if the contractionary policy persists, the unemployment rise will eventually disappear as the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate. Then the cost of the anti-inflation policy will have been temporary unemployment.  But if there is hysteresis, the unemployment rise initiated by the contractionary policy will never completely go away, and in this case the cost of the anti-inflation policy will have been permanently higher unemployment, making the policy less likely to have greater benefits than costs.

==Evidence==

The experience of the United Kingdom since the early 1980s counts against hysteresis as a determinant of the natural rate of unemployment, as unemployment fell much faster in the recovery from the early 1990s recession than after the early 1980s recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/unemployment/changing_natural_rate_unemployment.html|title=Discuss some of the factors that might cause  the natural rate of unemployment to change over time.&amp;nbsp; - Economics  Help|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An econometric study of fourteen OECD countries rejected the hysteresis hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9915/1/MPRA_paper_9915.pdf | title=Does Hysteresis in Unemployment Occur in OECD Countries?

The '''InterAction Council''' is an independent non-profit organization that brings together former world leaders to mobilize their energy, experience and international contacts in an effort to develop recommendations and foster co-operation and positive action around the world.

Founded in 1983, this body meets on annually and is composed of 40 former world leaders. The organization and its members jointly develop recommendations on, and practical solutions for, the political, economic and social problems confronting humanity. These efforts are focused on three main priority areas: peace and security, world economic revitalization and universal ethical standards.

One of its most well-known initiatives was the development of a draft Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities|url=http://interactioncouncil.org/a-universal-declaration-of-human-responsibilities|website=www.interactioncouncil.org|publisher=InterAction Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an attempt to propose a set of responsibilities that were shared by all individuals to counterbalance the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Denis|title=A UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RESPONSIBILITIES?|url=http://untribune.com/a-universal-declaration-of-human-responsibilities/|website=www.untribune.com|publisher=UN Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new "global ethic" would provide a foundation of freedom, justice and peace in order for universal rights to be meaningful. These agreed values and standards complements universal rights, as the maximization of personal freedom at the expense of others, without consideration of others, is as problematic as having no rights at all.

==Books==
The InterAction Council released its first book in 2008 through the McGill-Queen's University Press in Canada, entitled ''Bridging the Divide: Religious Dialogue and Universal Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Axworthy|first1=Thomas S.|title=Bridging the Divide|url=http://www.mqup.ca/bridging-the-divide-products-9781553392200.php?page_id=46|website=McGill-Queen's University Press|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second book, produced with the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation of Canada and the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, was released in the fall of 2012, entitled: ''The Global Water Crisis: Addressing an Urgent Security Issue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigas|first1=Harriet|title=The Global Water Crisis|url=http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WaterSecurity_The-Global-Water-Crisis.pdf|website=United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health|publisher=United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the InterAction Council again partnered with the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health on the release of Global Agenda 2013: Water, Energy, and the Arab Awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adeel|first1=Zafar|title=Water, Energy, and the Arab Awakening|url=http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Water-Energy-and-the-Arab-Awakening_Web.pdf|website=United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health|publisher=United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, the Council published a book from its Interfaith Dialogue in Vienna, Austria in March of that year, entitled, ''Ethics in Decision-Making''.

'''The Party of Tatar National Independence ''İttifaq''''' or '''''Ittifak''''' ({{lang-tt|Татар милли бәйсезлек партиясе "Иттифак"|Tatar Milli Bäysezlek Partiäse "İttifaq"}}, {{lang-ru|Тататрская партия национальой независимости "Иттифак"}}) is a political party founded in the [[Tatar ASSR]] in April, 1990, and officially registered on January 3, 1992.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=23&amp;sid=319930]&lt;/ref&gt; Ittifaq was the first non-[[communist]] party in [[Tatarstan]].  It is commonly referred to as a [[Volga Tatars|Tatar]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] party.  It was named in honour of [[Ittifaq al-Muslimin]], a pre-revolutionary Muslim political party represented in the parliament (Duma) of the czarist [[Russia]].

The aims, as claimed by the party, are:
* revival of the [[Tatar people|Tatar nation]]
* restoring Tatar [[Sovereign state|statehood]]
* recognition of the Tatar state as an international entity.

The permanent leader of the Ittifaq party is [[Fäwziä Bäyräm]]ova.  She has been leading the party for more than 20 years.  The party published its own newspaper - ''Altın Urda'' - from 1993 to 1998.&lt;ref name="TES"&gt;{{TES|Татар милли бәйсезлек партиясе "Иттифак"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing''' is a Canadian publishing house that specialises in literature on the German armed forces of the [[World War II]] era. Its authors are both popular history writers such as [[Paul Carell]] and [[Franz Kurowski]], along with the war-time veterans (and post-war apologists), including [[Kurt Meyer]] of the [[SS Division Hitlerjugend]] and [[Otto Weidinger]] of the [[SS Division Das Reich]]. 

The press has received praise from North American and German writers for professionally produced text and picture books. J.J. Fedorowicz has been profiled by the American historians [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]] in their 2006 work ''[[The Myth of the Eastern Front]]'', where they describe Fedorowicz as a leading press of war-romancing literature and criticise it for providing a platform for authors who present an uncritical and ahistorical portrayal of the German war effort during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet-German war]] of 1941–1945.

==Authors==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-299, KZ-Mauthausen, Himmlervisite.jpg|thumb|[[SS]] commander and subsequent Fedorowicz author [[Otto Kumm]] (front row, left) on tour of the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen concentration camp]] with [[Heinrich Himmler]] (center), June 1941.]]
Fedorowicz Publishing was the first North American press to translate works by the German author [[Franz Kurowski]], providing laudatory and fictionalised wartime chronicles of German units and their highly-decorated personnel. In early 1990s, Fedorowicz released Kurowski's two popular works, ''[[Panzer Aces]]'' and ''[[Infantry Aces]]'', in 1992 and 1994, respectively. The first two books were followed up by ''Panzer Aces II'', ''Panzer Aces III'', ''Luftwaffe Aces'' and similar works.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=206}}

In addition to Kurowski, the publishing house printed works by authors such as Patrick Agte (closely associated with the post-war Waffen-SS lobby group [[HIAG]]), former Nazi propagandist [[Paul Carell]] and Marc Rikmenspoel, a leading apologist for the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=207}}  It brought to the English-speaking audiences multiple works by former Waffen-SS members, such as [[Hubert Meyer]], [[Rudolf Lehmann (SS officer)|Rudolf Lehmann]], [[Kurt Meyer|Kurt "Panzer" Meyer]], [[Otto Weidinger]], and [[Karl Ullrich]], among others. Their publications included memoirs by former Wehrmacht ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) personnel, such as [[Otto Carius]], a famous "[[panzer ace]]", and Helmuth Spaeter of the [[Division Grossdeutschland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=kw%3A%22J.J.+Fedorowicz%22&amp;fq=&amp;dblist=638&amp;qt=first_page ''WorldCat.org''], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Fedorowicz titles were subsequently made available to a wider audience by mass market and specialty publishers such as [[Ballantine Books]] and [[Stackpole Books]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=174}}

==Reception==
Historians [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]] in their work ''[[The Myth of the Eastern Front]]'' describe J.J. Fedorowicz as the leading publisher of war-romancing literature dedicated to the portrayal of the German war effort on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The books include multiple photographs and are accompanied by cover art that, as with Kurowski's ''Panzer Aces'' series, "evokes heroism, determination and might of the German soldier and his weapons".{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=159, 173–176}}

According to ''The Myth of the Eastern Front'', J.J.Fedorowicz has played an important role in publicising the works of German World War II veterans, such as [[Otto Carius]], alongside the authors who the book describes as "gurus". In Smelser and Davies's definition, the gurus are writers who specialise in the [[Wehrmacht]] and, in particular, the [[Waffen-SS]] and are popular among the readers who "romanticise" the Eastern Front, These authors present an uncritical and ahistorical portrayal of the military and paramilitary formations of [[Nazi Germany]] that is in stark contrast to the realities of the war of conquest and racial annihilation.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=159}} The book describes Fedorowicz's web site as "the heart of the romancing ethos", among other similar publishers such as [[Schiffer Publishing]] and Merriam Press:{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=158, 206}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some cases, as their [gurus'] appeal grows, they graduate up the scale of publishing importance from self-publishing to the myriad small presses (...), to the top, particularly to the Fedorowicz publishing house (...). To be published through Fedorowicz is to have arrived.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, the press has won praise from its authors for its portrayal of the German military. In a preface to the Fedorowicz translation of his ''Tigers in the Mud'', Carius thanks the publisher for enabling him and other German authors to reach a broader audience in the English-speaking world. He writes:{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=206}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Through these publications, the defamation of the German soldier in film, television and the press has been countered and the picture of the Wehrmacht has been a more objective one by means of the help offered by many sources.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smelser and Davies conclude that Fedorowicz's position on the former members of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS hues closely to that of Carius, who condemns the deserters and traitors, along with "lies" and false "claims" about the German soldier. "The Fedorowicz link provides romancers with reaffirmation of their sentiments toward the German soldiers and their field commanders", the book finds.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=206}} 

Chris Evans, history editor at [[Stackpole Books]], writes in an introduction to one of the Fedorowicz books reissued by Stackpole: "J.J. Fedorowicz has a well earned reputation for publishing exceptionally high quality books on German World War II subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Evans, in Karlheinz Munch (2005): ''The Combat History of German Heavy Anti-Tank Unit 653 in World War II'', [[Stackpole Books]], {{ISBN|978-0811732420}}, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Author Mark Healy in his work ''Zitadelle: The German Offensive Against the Kursk Salient 4–17 July 1943'' refers to Fedorowicz's publications on the [[Battle of Kursk]] as "remarkable text and photo books", highlighting the two volume works by Restayn and Moller, which contain new photographs and present an "unforgettable image of the scale of the battle".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Healy (2010): [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYkTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=%22fedorowicz+publishing%22+reputation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH65_Q0MzQAhUJllQKHUwdAOEQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fedorowicz%20publishing%22%20reputation&amp;f=false ''Zitadelle: The German Offensive Against the Kursk Salient 4–17 July 1943''], {{ISBN|978-0752457161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favorably comparing Fedorowicz with Schiffer Publishing, author [[George Forty]] notes that the company has a "worldwide reputation for the excellences in its military literature".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Forty]] (2009): ''Tiger Tank Battalions in World War II'', Zenith Press, {{ISBN|978-0760330494}}, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">The '''Lausanne Congress''' of 1867 is the common name assigned to the 2nd General Congress of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), generally known as the First International. The meeting was held in the city of [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] from September 2 to 8, 1867. It was attended by 71 delegates, representing the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union|labor]] movements of Switzerland, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], [[Italy]], and [[Belgium]].

==History==

===Background===

The International Workingmen's Association (IWA), commonly known as the First International, was an international association of trade unionist and socialist political activists which attempted to coordinate labor activities across national boundaries. The organization is remembered for the active participation of many pioneer leaders of the modern [[socialism|socialist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] movements, including [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. Membership in the IWA was numerically small, its funding inadequate, and its institutional life short — lasting a mere 8 years from its establishment in 1864 until its termination at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress of 1872]].&lt;ref&gt;Julius Braunthal, ''History of the International: Volume 1: 1864-1914.'' [1961] Henry Collins and Kenneth Mitchell, translators. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967; pg. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishment of the IWA was related to ongoing efforts to coordinate the activities of the trade union movements in Great Britain and France, a project begun in connection with the [[1862 International Exhibition|1862 London World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=JB88&gt;Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 1, pg. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic crisis had led the imperial French government to concede the right to French workers to elect a delegation of 750 to the London exhibition.&lt;ref name=JB88 /&gt; While in London certain members of this delegation headed by [[Henri Tolain]] (1828-1897) established contact with British trade union leaders and opened the door for a formal meeting in London the following summer in support of the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising of 1863]].&lt;ref&gt;Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 1, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWA first met in international session in the Swiss city of [[Geneva]] in September 1866 in an event remembered to history as the [[Geneva Congress (1866)|Geneva Congress]].

===Convocation===

The Lausannne Congress was called to order on September 2, 1867 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. There were 71 delegates in attendance, of whom the majority (38) were affiliated with the local Swiss labor movement.&lt;ref name=Stekloff99&gt;G.M. Stekloff, ''History of the First International.'' Eden Paul and Cedar Paul, trans. New York: International Publishers, 1928; pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in attendance were 18 representatives of the French labor movement, including Tolain and Karl Marx's future son-in-law [[Charles Longuet]]; 6 German delegates, including medical doctor [[Louis Kugelmann]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Büchner]]; 2 delegates each from Great Britain and Italy, and one from Belgium.&lt;ref name=Stekloff99 /&gt; In addition there were in attendance four members of the General Council of the IWA, headed by [[Johann Eccarius]].&lt;ref name=Stekloff99 /&gt;

Each delegate held one equal vote, regardless of the number of mandates of support he had received.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100&gt;Stekloff, ''History of the First International,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those participating derived their basic political ideas from the writings of French mutualist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stekloff, ''History of the First International,'' pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decisions===

The gathering dealt with the organizational structure of the IWA and approved a uniform rate of dues of one English penny per capita, to be paid quarterly to the General Council in London.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100 /&gt; It was decided that the General Council would in turn be obligated to issue reports on a quarterly basis to the central committees of its affiliated national organizations.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100 /&gt;

The Congress debated the issue of national banks and the investment of trade union funds, ultimately approving a resolution made by Eccarius urging members of the IWA to work to "induce the trade unioins to devote their funds to cooperative production" rather than tying up the same assets in bank accounts.&lt;ref name=Stekloff100 /&gt;

Also considered by the congress was the matter of education, opining in favor of the standard of free, compulsory, [[secular]] education.&lt;ref name=Stekloff101&gt;Stekloff, ''History of the First International,'' pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWA, an international association of trade unionists from its creation, moved towards socialist advocacy at the Lausanne Congress, adopting a resolution calling for state ownership of transportation and exchange in order to break the hold of large companies on these institutions.&lt;ref name=Stekloff101 /&gt; This represented the first time that the organization had formally supported the principle of collective ownership.&lt;ref name=Stekloff101 /&gt;

'''''Lethal Politics: Soviet Genocide and Mass Murder since 1917''''' is an influential {{fact|date=December 2017}} book by [[Rudolph Rummel|R.J. Rummel]], published by [[Transaction Publishers]] in 1990. The book examines [[Mass killings in the Soviet Union|genocides and mass murders perpetrated by the Soviet regime]] from the days of [[Vladimir Lenin]] until the last years of the [[Cold War]], with an emphasis on the [[Joseph Stalin]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Tamas Meszerics, ''Journal of Communist Studies'', 7(4), 1991, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review by Geoffrey Swain, ''Slavonic and East European Review'', 69(4), 1991, p. 765-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Rummel's central theory was that citizens of totalitarian, especially [[Marxist]] systems, were most likely to be killed by their government, whereas "democratic systems provide a path to peace, and universalizing them would eliminate war and minimize global, political violence."&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Rummel, Preface to Lethal Politics&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''macro''' in [[computer science]] is a rule or [[pattern]] that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to a replacement input sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure.

A macro is used to define [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] or [[Procedure (computer science)|procedures]],&lt;ref name="processor"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow [[code reuse]], or to design [[domain-specific languages]].

Macros can be separated into several types: 
* Text substitution macros as in the C language.&lt;ref name="processor"/&gt;
* Macros in software. In some software, a sequence of instructions can be associated to a keyboard or mouse action. Some software can include a programming language (like [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] in Microsoft Office) allowing the control of software features.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Macro-définition|Macro-définition (French)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other types of macros exist; they aren't covered in this article.

Macros can be very useful to software users. They simplify regularly used actions (repetitive code for a programmer, or a sequence of actions in a program) so that the productivity of the user is increased. However, many problems exist, they will be tackled subsequently.

== Flaws and macros viruses ==

=== Text substitution dangers ===
There are a few dangers in text substitution macros, like C macros.
The C preprocessor is a powerful tool that can bring clarity to the code or on the contrary, obscure it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|work = safety of macros
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compiler error ====
First, because there isn't any form of macros error checking (as there is for C or assembly language), it is possible to make macros which will not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = The power of ten - Rules for developing safety critical code
|url = http://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf
|author = Gerard J. Holzmann
|pages = 1–2
|work = safety of macros
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, for the C language, the syntax of each macro is replaced by what has been declared by the preprocessor. Only after that does the compiler check the code.

Example :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
//file example.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define someString foo

int main()
{
   printf("Example !");
   return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This example compiles because the macro someString isn't used. But if this macro was used, there would be a compilation error.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
//file example.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define someString foo

int main()
{
   printf("Example : %s", someString);
   return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
gcc -o example example.c
example.c: In function 'main':
example.c:6:26: erreur: 'foo' undeclared (first use in this function)
example.c:6:26: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is just a simple example, but in some applications, when the count of code lines begins to be huge, it can be really important.&lt;br /&gt;
If the macro doesn't compile, you may have to change its syntax. In the previous example, quotation marks have to be added to foo. For the others, the whole syntax will be false, so you may have to change the macro and all calls to it.&lt;br /&gt;
As the case, this type of flaw can be minimal or can affect the maintenance of an application.

==== Repetitive code ====
In this second point, we'll see that repetitive code can be found in some macros. And this can lead to wasted computing time.&lt;br /&gt;
Let's illustrate this by the following code:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alteridem.net/2010/07/21/the-dangers-of-macros/ Repetitive code of some macros]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
// file example2.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define max(a,b) (((a) &gt; (b)) ? (a) : (b))

int main()
{
   printf("The max ? %d", whatMax());
   return 0;
}

int whatMax()
{
   int foo = 5;
   return max( foo, getNumber() ); 
}

int getNumber()
{
   printf("I am called !\n");
   return 3;
} 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
There is a call of a macro called "max" between 2 values: the variable foo and the return value of the function getNumber().&lt;br /&gt;
It's just a basic macro calling a function which calculate the maximum between 2 values.&lt;br /&gt;
When this code is executed, we obtain:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
./example2
I am called !
The max ? 5
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
For the moment, there is nothing wrong but let's replace the value of getNumber by 6 for example, now the result is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
./example2
I am called !
I am called !
The max ? 6
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The function getNumber() is called two times, yet you only need to call it one time.&lt;br /&gt;
This is because of the macro. If you replace the call of the macro "max" by its syntax, then the return in whatMax is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
return (((foo) &gt; (getNumber()) ? (foo) : (getNumber()); 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
When the value of getNumber is greater than the value of foo, it is called two times: one for the comparison and one for the return.&lt;br /&gt;
As you can see, it can slow down an execution of a program when the function, in this example, need to take time to calculate the return value.

==== Results not expected ====
For the last point of this section, we will see that macros can be potentially dangerous.&lt;br /&gt; In some programs, there is critical data on which some operations can be needed. In order to make those operations more legible, macros can be used, but it can be double-edged.&lt;br /&gt;Let's take an example in this code and its execution:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainbell.com/tutors/c/Advice_and_Warnings_for_C/Macros_and_Miscellaneous_Pitfalls.html Potential dangers in macros]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
// file example3.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #define cube(x) x*x*x
 #define double(x) x+x
 
int main()
{
    int x = 3;
    int y = cube(x + 1);
    int z = 5 * double(x);
   
    printf("y is %d\n",y);
    printf("z is %d\n",z);  
   
    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
./example3
y is 10
z is 18
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Normally, the result expected was "y is equal to 64 and z to 30". But when the preprocessor replace the calls of the macros, we obtain:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
// y:
x + 1*x + 1*x + 1 // equivalent to
x + (1 * x) + (1 * x) + 1 // or
3 + (1 * 3) + (1 * 3) + 1 // is equal to 10

// z:
5 * x+x // equivalent to
(5 * x) + x // or 18
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Macros in C (and others languages like [[SMX (computer language)|SMX]], [[SAM76]], [[assembly language]], etc.) are just text substitution, they don't do anything more. It is the responsibility of the programmer to be careful about it, in this case, put parentheses.&lt;br /&gt;
But, in others cases, some effects cannot be instantly predicted, like this one:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
// file example4.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define double(x) ((x)+(x))
 
int main()
{
    int x = 3;
    int y = double (++x);
    
    printf("y is %d\n",y); 
   
    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
8 is expected as the value of y, but the result at the execution is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
./example4
y is 10
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Let's see what happens if we decompose the execution stack:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=C&gt;
y = (++x) + (++x);
/*
the stack is :
+
++x
++x

- the first '+' is unstacked
- the first '++x' is evaluated and unstacked =&gt; x = 4
- the second '++x'is evaluated and unstacked =&gt; x = 5
- then the '+' give x+x = 5+5 = 10*/
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The result is logical when we look at the execution stack but was not very obvious instinctively.

So, users of macros have to be careful because without attention, errors can easily appear (in addition, instructions like '++x' in imbricated instructions are not very recommended either).

=== VBA-type/Winword macros flaws ===
These flaws are completely different from the previous ones : the main problem in [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]]-type macros is the viruses. Macro viruses are relatively recent, the first one named Concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The main reason of that is that ''the high-level languages used to write macro code are powerful and easy to use, considerably increasing the pool of potential virus writers, and the documents containing the macros can be disseminated rapidly and widely by E-mail''.&lt;ref name="Melissa"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
So they can be spread quickly and be very destructive.

==== Different types of macros viruses ====

===== System Macro Viruses =====
System macro means macros that interact with the basic operators in a Word document (like often-used functionalities like FileSave, FileSaveAs which are macros).&lt;br /&gt;
The strength, but the weakness of a Word document is that such types of macros can be redefinied by users.&lt;br /&gt;
This allow a great flexibility for the user, but, this is a flaw too that hackers can exploit to take down the control of the document and the computer where the Word document is opened.&lt;br /&gt;
Such type of viruses use automatic and semi-automatic macros, they can be launched by any action or some events without the user’s knowledge or consent.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, a Word document have the following macros: AutoExec, AutoNew, AutoClose, AutoOpen, AutoExit, so it's easy for a hacker to replace these basic functionalities by a macro virus which have the same name as the original functionality.&lt;ref name="Melissa" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, a combination of shortcut keys can be associated with a system command (like Ctrl+B to set up the bold font) and the user can change them, replacing them by customs macros. So a hacker can modify and create such macros that the user will activate by using the shortcut key.&lt;br /&gt;
Such macros can also be activated by a macro button, like a button "Click here for further information" which seems common and safely.&lt;ref name="Melissa" /&gt;

===== Document to Macro Conversion =====
A type of macro virus that cut and paste the text of a document in the macro. The macro could be invoked with the Auto-open macro so the text would be re-created when the document (empty) is opened. The user will not notice that the document is empty. The macro could also convert only some parts of the text in order to be less noticeable.
Removing macros from the document, manually or by using an anti-virus program would lead to a loss of the content of the document.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|609–610}}

===== Polymorphic Macros =====
''[[Polymorphic code|Polymorphic]] viruses change their code in fundamental ways with each replication in order to avoid detection by anti-virus scanners.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/polymorphic-macro-viruses-part-one Polymorphics macros]&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Microsoft Word|WordBasic]] (first name of the language [[Visual Basic]]), [[Polymorphic code|polymorphic]] viruses are difficult to do.&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, the macro's [[Polymorphic code|polymorphism]] relies of the [[encryption]] of the document. However, the hackers have no control of the [[encryption key]].&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, the encryption isn't really efficient : the encrypted macros are just in the document, so the encryption key too and when a [[Polymorphic code|polymorphic]] macro replicates itself, the key doesn't change (the replication affects only the macro not the encryption).&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to these difficulties, a macro can't modify itself, but another macro can.&lt;br /&gt;
WordBasic is really a powerful language, it allows some operations to the macros :
*Rename the variables used in the macro(s).
*Insert random comments between the operators of its macro(s)
*Insert between the operators of its macros other, ‘do-nothing’ WordBasic operators which do not affect the execution of the virus.
*Replace some of its operators with others, equivalent ones, which perform the same function.
*Swap around any operators the order of which does not impact the result of the macro’s execution.
*Rename the macro(s) themselves to new, randomly selected names each time the virus replicates itself to a new document, with the appropriate changes in these parts of the virus body which refer to these macros.

So, in order to implement macros viruses which can change its contents, the hackers have to do another macro which fulfill the task to modify the content of the virus.&lt;br /&gt;
However, this type of macros viruses isn't really widespread. Indeed, the hackers choose to do macros viruses because it's easy and quick to implement. Make a [[Polymorphic code|polymorphic]] macro need a lot of knowledge of the language WordBasic (it needs the advanced functionalities) and more time than a "classic" macro virus.&lt;br /&gt;
Even if the hacker make a polymorphic macro, the [[Polymorphic code|polymorphism]] needs to be done, so, the document needs to be update and the update can be visible for a user.&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|610–612}}

===== Chained macros =====
During the replication, a macro can create do-nothing macros. But this idea can be combined with polymorphic macros, so macros are not necessarily do-nothing, each macro invokes the next one so they can be arranged in a chain. In that case, if they are not all removed during a disinfection, some destructive payload is activated. Such attack can crash the winword processor with an internal error. Since [[Microsoft Word|Winword 6.0]], the number of macros per template is limited to 150, so the attack is limited too but can still be very annoying.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|623}}

===== ‘Mating’ Macro Viruses =====
The macro viruses can, in some cases, interact between them. If two viruses are executed at the same time, both of them can modify the source code of each other.&lt;br /&gt;
So, it results a new virus which can't be recognize by the anti-viruses software. But, the result is totally random : the macro virus can be more infectious or less infectious, it depends to what part of the virus has been changed.&lt;br /&gt;
However, when the 'mating' is unintentional, the macro virus in result has more chances to be less infectious.&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, in order to replicate itself, it has to know the commands in the source code, but, if it's changed with a random scheme, the macro can't replicate itself.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, it is possible to do such macros intentionally (it is different from polymorphic macros viruses which have to use another macro to change their contents) in order to increase the infectivity of the two viruses.&lt;br /&gt;
In the example of the article,&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|612–613}} the macro virus ''Colors&lt;ref name="Colors"&gt;[http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Word+Color+Macro+Virus&amp;offset=0 Macro Virus Colors]&lt;/ref&gt;''  infected a document, but another infected the user's system before : the macro virus ''Concept''.&lt;br /&gt;
Both of these viruses use the command ''AutoOpen'', so, at first, the macro virus ''Colors'' was detected but the command ''AutoOpen'' in it was the command of the macro virus ''Concept''.&lt;br /&gt;
Moreover, when ''Concept'' duplicate itself, it is unencrypted, but the command in the virus ''Colors'' was encrypted (Colors encrypt its commands).&lt;br /&gt;
So, the replicate of the macro virus ''Concept'' result of the hybridation of this macro virus (which infected the user's system first) and ''Colors''.&lt;br /&gt;
The "hybrid" could replicate itself only if ''AutoOpen'' wasn't executed, indeed this command comes from ''Concept'', but the body of the hybrid is ''Colors'', so that create some conflicts.&lt;br /&gt;
This example shows the potential of mating macro viruses : if a couple of mating macro viruses is created, it will make more difficult to detect both of the macro virus (in hypothesis, there is only two which mate) by the [[Signature based detection|virus-specific]]scanners and may reinforce the virility of the viruses.&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, this type of macro virus is very rare (more than the polymorphic macro viruses, there may not exist one), indeed, create two (or more) which can interact with each other and not reduce the virlity (rather reinforce it) is complicated.

===== Macro Virus Mutators =====
One of the worst scenarios in the world of viruses would be a tool allowing to create a new virus by modifying an existing one.
For executable files, it is hard to create this kind of tool. But it is very simple for macro viruses since sources of macros are always available. Based on the same idea of polymorphic macros, a macro can perform modifications to all macros present in the document. Considering this, there is just a few modifications to make to the macro in order to convert it in a macro virus mutator.
So it is quite easy to create macro virus generators, so it is possible to create quickly several thousands of the known viruses.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|613–614}}

===== Parasitic macro viruses =====
Most macros viruses are stand-alone; they don’t depend on other macros (for the infectious part of the virus not for the replication for some viruses), but some macros viruses do. They are called parasitic macros.&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|614–615}}
When they are launched, they check other macros (viruses or not), and append their contents to them. In this way, all of the macros became viruses.
But, this type of macro can’t be spread as quickly as stand-alone macros.
Indeed, it depends on other macros, so, without them, the virus can’t be spread. So, parasitic macros often are hybrid: they are stand alone and they can infect other macros.
This kind of macro virus poses real problems to the [[Virus scanner#Signature-based detection|virus-specific]] anti-virus; in fact, they change the content of other viruses, so the accurate detection isn't possible.

==== Suboptimal anti-virus ====
There are different types of anti-virus (or scanner), one of them is the [[heuristic analysis]] anti-virus which interpretes or emulates macros.&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, to examine all of the branches of macros require a [[NP-complete]] complexity&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|605}} (using [[backtracking]]), so in this case, the analysis of one document (which contains macros) would take too much time. Interpreting or emulating a macro would lead to either [[False positive#Type I error|false positives]] errors or macro viruses not detected.

Another type of anti-virus, the [[Integrity checker#Integrity verification|integrety checker]] anti-virus, in some cases, doesn't work : it only checks all documents with extensions DOT&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.file-extensions.org/dot-file-extension DOT extension]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Microsoft Word#File extensions|DOC]] (indeed, some anti-virus producers suggest to their users), but Word documents can reside in others extensions than those two and the content of the document tends to change often.&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|605}}&lt;br /&gt; So, like the [[heuristic analysis]], this can lead to [[False positive#Type I error|false positives]] errors, due to the fact that this type of anti-virus checks the whole document.&lt;br /&gt;
The last type of anti-virus seen will be the [[Virus scanner#Signature-based detection|virus-specific]] scanner.&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|608}} It searches the signature of viruses, so, the type of anti-virus is weakest than the previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, the viruses which are detected by [[Virus scanner#Signature-based detection|virus-specific]] scanners are just the ones knew by the producers of the software (so, more updates are needed than others types of scanners). Moreover, this type of anti-virus is really weak against morphing viruses (cf.[[#Different types of macros viruses|section above]]), if a macro virus change its content (so, its signature), it can no more be detected by the [[Virus scanner#Signature-based detection|virus-specific]] scanners even if it's the same virus which do the same actions. Its signature doesn't match the one declare in the virus scanner.

Additional to the responsibility of the anti-virus, there is a responsibility of the users : if a potential macro virus is detected, the user can choose what to do with it : ignore it, [[Quarantine (computing)|quarantine]] it or destroy it, but the last option is the most dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;
The anti-virus can activate some destructives macro viruses which destroy some data when they are deleted by the anti virus.&lt;br /&gt;
So, both of the virus scanners and the users are responsible of the security and the integrity of the documents/computer.&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, even if the anti-virus aren't optimal in the virus detection, most of the macro viruses are detected and the progression in the virus detection improve but with the creation of new macro viruses.

== Solutions ==

===Text-substitutions macros===

====Marco====
Text-substitutions macros can be separated of the compiler (like in C) but they will not be securised. Or they can be integrated in the compiler but this will limit their utilisation.
Marco is a solution allowing macros with both advantage and so, improving the productivity of the programmer, in particular for multi-languages applications. Indeed, it is independent from the language, the only requirement is that the compiler of the target language produce descriptive error messages with location and cause of errors.
Marco also needs a module and a plug-in to understand a language. The plug-in must contain three oracles: one that check for syntactic well-formedness, one to determine a fragment's free names and the last one to test whether a fragment captures a given name. For the moment, it is just a prototype and it will only support [[C++]] and [[SQL]]. Marco proves that safe code using macros can be well-encapsulated and language-scalable at the same time.&lt;ref name="Marco"&gt;

====MacroML====
An example of macro language allowing type-safe macros. [[MacroML]] is an expressive, typed language that supports generative macros.
Macros are translated into the target language, MetaML and it gives a well-type program without runtime errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macro viruses===
There will always be faults in the world of viruses. Fortunately, a lot of macro viruses can be countered with good [[Antivirus software|anti-virus]].
This section presents characteristics that anti-virus should have to protect from macro-viruses.

====Polymorphic macros====
First, specific anti-virus products will not really affect this kind of virus, anti-virus analyzing the content will be more efficient.
Also, there is something to notice: the modification process is relatively slow and is noticeable by the user.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|611–612}}

====Chained macros====
In order to protect from these macros viruses, a scanner has to detect all elements of the chain and remove them properly.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|612}}

====‘Mating’ Macro Viruses====
The anti-virus has to detect all macros of the virus but also any remnants of them. In the example of ''[http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Word+Color+Macro+Virus&amp;offset=0 Colors]'', the anti-virus must not detect that Microsoft's ScanProt (macro virus protection tool) contains remnants of the virus but the problem is that ScanProt does contain parts of the virus.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|613}}

There is another problem, if a virus B is created by modifying some macros of a virus A which consists in a set of macros, then the virus B could be detected as a remnant of A but the anti-virus would only identify (and remove) the non-modified macros.
After that, in some cases, the replication of the virus (which does not contain original macros of A now) could be successful. In fact, the anti-virus would have created a new virus.&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|613}}

====Macro Virus Mutators====
Anti-virus have to be updated very easily and fast to counter these viruses. A lot of informations is added every day and the performance of the anti-virus must not drop while updates.
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|614}}

====Parasitic macro viruses====
The problem here is that there is not an easily identifiable set of macros, the anti-virus have to parse the body of the macro and identify and cut parts added by the macro viruses (fortunately, this task is not difficult to achieve).
&lt;ref name="Attack prevent"/&gt;{{rp|615}}

'''Masmou3''' ({{lang-ar|مسموع}}, "heard") is an Egyptian movement created by liberal and leftist activists in the aftermath of the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|2013 military coup]], organising daily protests by banging on pots and pans during the curfew in protest against the military-backed government and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].

==History==
''Masmou3'' was founded in August 2013 in the aftermath of the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|military coup]] against [[Mohamed Morsi|President Morsi]], following a [[August 2013 Egyptian raids|violent crackdown]] by security forces on sit-ins by supporters of the deposed president, in which hundreds of protesters were killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian security forces storm protesters’ camps|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egyptian-security-forces-move-against-protesters-camps/2013/08/14/bc079750-04a7-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]|date=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the imposition of a night time curfew by the military-backed government.

On 17 August, the ''Masmou3'' campaign was started on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disillusioned Egyptians defy curfew by banging pots and pans|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20130827-egyptians-defy-curfew-banging-pots-pans|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[France 24]]|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first English [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]], the activists posted: "If you reject religious fascism &amp; the Egyptian State's route to civil war, every night at 9PM open your window &amp; make some noise #masmou3".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If you reject religious fascism &amp; the Egyptian State's route to civil war|url=https://twitter.com/masmou3/status/368709765041381376|accessdate=29 August 2013|website=[[Twitter]]|date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August, they posted: "If you survived #Sisi's strings of sedating populist slogans, don't forget to give him a nice round of bang-bangs at 9PM. #masmou3"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If you survived #Sisi's strings of sedating populist slogans|url=https://twitter.com/masmou3/status/369143475419103232|accessdate=29 August 2013|website=[[Twitter]]|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "@masmou3 has 700 followers since yesterday only. 700 people who say no to #MB fascism and no to #Sisi fascism. That's very good news."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=@masmou3 has 700 followers since yesterday only|url=https://twitter.com/masmou3/status/369204064707309569|accessdate=29 August 2013|website=[[Twitter]]|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 5 September 2013, the Twitter account has attracted more than 1,500 followers, and the Facebook page has attracted more than 21,000 followers.

On 22 August, American television news channel [[CNN]] showed a report about the movement, including an interview with activist Aalam Wassef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Egyptians that want to be heard|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/world/2013/08/22/pkg-sayah-egypt-be-heard.cnn|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August, the movement launched its official Facebook page, "so that our voice remains heard against the attempts of the state and the Brotherhood to kill our revolution, and so that our voice remains heard against their violence and their attempts to silence us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masmou3 official Facebook page|url=http://www.facebook.com/masmou3|accessdate=29 August 2013|website=[[Facebook]]|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 27 August, it published a campaign song and video (with English subtitles) on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=الحرية جاية جاية! حملة مسموع #jan25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWqWpddwFu0|accessdate=29 August 2013|website=[[YouTube]]|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media Watch International''' is a [[media monitoring]] organization founded by Sharon Tzur and based in [[New York City]].  It describes itself as "an independent, [[non-profit]] organization dedicated to advancing Israel's image by promoting accurate, impartial media coverage of, and providing timely, factual information about, Israel and the Middle East."

==Programs==
===Honest Reporting===
{{main|Honest Reporting}}
Sharon Tzur previously ran [[Honest Reporting]], a media monitoring organization based in the UK. Media Watch International was created with seed money from the [[Aish HaTorah#Philanthropic fund|Jerusalem Fund]] of [[Aish HaTorah]] to absorb HonestReporting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/HonestReporting.com_Takes_on_Biased_Media.asp Jewish Telegraphic Agency article on HonestReporting]&lt;/ref&gt;  MWI's Honest Reporting program is described by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] as focusing on "guiding the reader into productive activism" and that it is "Pro-Israel" but "does not take a particular Israeli political position." [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007125805/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/hasbara/pers.html]

===Democracy High School Edition===
According to the [[Koret Foundation]], which provides funding for MWI initiatives, Media Watch International in collaboration with [[Jewish National Fund]] and [[American Friends of Likud]] runs the "Caravan for Democracy High School Edition" (HSE), which "empowers high school juniors and seniors to advocate for Israel and respond to anti-Israel sentiments when they go off to college. The program has filled a void in Jewish education that previously left many students unprepared to support Israel when faced with opposing viewpoints or hostility."

==History==

===Activities===

====Fed Up, 2014====
In November 2014, MORE was involved in the "Fed Up" campaign composed of 20 community and labor groups who met with Federal Reserve Chair [[Janet Yellen]] to present proposals related to extending central bank stimulus and increasing public input on monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mui|first1=Ylan Q.|title=Main Street takes on monetary policy, Round 2|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/14/main-street-takes-on-monetary-policy-round-2/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=6 December 2014|date=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Nations Committee Against Torture statement with parents of Michael Brown, 2014====
On November 12, 2014, Michael Brown's parents submitted a prepared statement with Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment, Hands Up United and the Organization for Black Struggle to the [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] stating that their son's death and the "excessive force by police officers on peaceful protesters" in Ferguson in the weeks that followed violated the principles of the U.N. convention entitled Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.&lt;ref name=wapo_111214&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Brown’s parents take their case to United Nations torture panel|last1=Bever|first1=Leslie|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/12/michael-browns-parents-take-their-case-to-united-nations-torture-panel/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement made several requests of the United Nations including: recommending the immediate arrest of police officer Darren Wilson, the resignation of Police Chief Thomas Jackson, and granting amnesty to protesters arrested during related demonstrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''New Profile''' (פרופיל חדש)  is a movement for transforming [[Israel]]i society into a "civilian" one ("חברה אזרחית" &amp;ndash; a term recently coined by parts of the Israeli [[left wing]] to highlight their view of the present society as "recruited" or "militarized"). It is a voluntary organization that acts against the compulsory law of military enlistment and supports people who refuse to enlist in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. 
New Profile is a [[Feminism|feminist]] organization and most of its activists are women.

==Major goals of New Profile==
* Reducing the [[militarism]] in Israeli society.
* Resisting the Israeli [[Military occupation|occupation]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]].
* Reducing the stigma of [[profile 21]].
* Cancelling the law of compulsory enlistment to the [[Israeli Defense Forces|Israeli military]].
* Helping [[Refusenik (Israel)|refuseniks]] or people who don't enlist in the army for other reasons.
* Supporting refusniks who are in army prison because of their refusal to enlist in the army or serve in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Occupied Territories]].
* Educating the public.
* Recruiting lesbian women

==Legal proceedings and criminal investigation==
In September 2008, Israeli Attorney General, [[Menachem Mazuz]], ordered the police to open a criminal investigation against New Profile because of allegations of "incitement to draft dodging" and helping people secure exemptions fraudulently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020999.html "Mazuz to police: Probe group accused of encouraging draft dodgers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2009, 8 New Profile activists were detained and the organization's computers were confiscated. &lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/30/israel-military |title=Israel's budding autocracy: The arrest of members of a pacifist NGO is symptomatic of a country that is becoming militarised at an alarming pace |author=Dimi Reider | date= April 30, 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-lethal weapons''', also called '''less-lethal weapons''',&lt;ref&gt;Michigan State Police Training Manual 2012 (pp. 68-70): same effective definition for LL as what DoDD 3000.03 (2013) has for NL&lt;/ref&gt; '''less-than-lethal weapons''', '''non-deadly weapons''', '''compliance weapons''', or '''pain-inducing weapons''' are [[weapon]]s intended to be [[lethality|less likely to kill a living target]] than [[conventional weapons]] such as [[knife|knives]] and [[firearm]]s. It is often understood that unintended or incidental casualties are risked wherever force is applied, but non-lethal weapons try to minimise the risk as much as possible. Non-lethal weapons are used in [[police|policing]] and [[combat]] situations to limit the escalation of conflict where employment of lethal force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum casualties, or where policy restricts the use of conventional force.

Non-lethal weapons may be used by conventional military in a range of missions across the [[force continuum]]. They may also be used by [[military police]], by [[United Nations]] forces, and by [[Military occupation|occupation forces]] for [[peacekeeping]] and stability operations.  Non-lethal weapons may also be used to channelize a battlefield, control the movement of civilian populations, or to limit civilian access to restricted areas (as they were utilized by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]'s [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] in [[Somalia]] in 1995). When used by police forces domestically, similar weapons, tactics, techniques and procedures are often called "less lethal" or "less than lethal" and are employed in [[riot control]], prisoner control, [[crowd control]], refugee control, and [[self-defense]].

==Recent history of non-lethal weapons development for military use==
[[File:Tazer use on US Army soliders.jpg|thumb|Demonstration of the use of Taser gun on US military personnel. The device was originally developed for use by civilian police.]]

In the past, military and police faced with undesirable escalation of conflict had few acceptable options. Military personnel guarding embassies often found themselves restricted to carrying unloaded weapons. National guards or policing forces charged with quelling [[riot]]s were able to use only [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]]s or similar club-like weapons, or [[bayonet]] or [[saber]] charges, or fire [[live ammunition]] at crowds. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Non-lethality Policy Review Group at U.S. Global Strategy Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m2tech.us/images/upload/Nonlethality-A%20Global%20Strategy.pdf Nonlethality: A Global Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305103649/http://www.m2tech.us/images/upload/Nonlethality-A%20Global%20Strategy.pdf |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington and other independent [[think tank]]s around the world called for a concerted effort to develop weapons that were more life-conserving, environmentally friendly, and fiscally responsible than weapons available at that time.&lt;ref&gt;''War and Anti-War'', [[Alvin Toffler]] and Heidi Toffler, Little, Brown (1993), Chapter 15, p.125–136.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Congress and other governments agreed and began an organized development of non-lethal weapons to provide a range of options between talking and shooting.

Recognizing the need to limit the escalation of force, research and development of a range of non-lethal weapons has since been undertaken internationally by governments and weapons manufacturers to fill the need for such weapons. Some non-lethal weapons may provide more effective riot control than firearms, truncheons or bayonets with less risk of loss of life or serious injury. Before the general availability of early military non-lethal weapons in the mid 1990s, war-fighters had few or no casualty-limiting options for the employment of scalable force and were continually at risk whenever lethal force was prohibited during sensitive missions{{Citation needed|date = October 2014}}.

In 2001 the [[United States Marine Corps]] revealed its development of a less-than-lethal energy weapon called the [[Active Denial System]], a focused high frequency microwave device said to be capable of heating all living matter in the target area rapidly and continuously for the duration of the beam, causing transient intolerable [[pain]] but no lasting damage. The skin temperature of a person subjected to this weapon can jump to approximately {{convert|130|°F|°C}} in as little as 2 seconds depending on the skin's starting temperature. The system is nonlethal (the penetration of the beam into human skin is only a few millimeters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2007/04/pain_ray_injure/|title=Pain Ray Injures Airman|first=Noah|last=Shachtman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt; 
Until the development of non-lethal weapons, police officers around the world had few if any non-lethal options for riot control. Common tactics used by police that were intended to be non-lethal or less lethal included a slowly advancing wall of men with batons, officers on horses trained to deal with policing situations, or a charge into a riot using the flats of sabers. Other reasonably successful approaches included shotguns with lower-powered cartridges, "salt shells", using [[Bean bag round|bean-bag rounds]] and ricocheting the shot off of the ground. In the mid-20th century, with the integration of fire-control systems into major cities, police found that high-pressure fire hoses could be effective in dispersing a crowd (the use of [[water cannon]]s and [[fire truck]]s has remained an effective nonlethal tactic to disperse riots). Trained [[police dog]]s were also commonly used to scare and disperse rioters and apprehend individuals. In the 1980s the development of the high-tensile plastics [[Kevlar]] and [[Lexan]] revolutionized [[personal armor]] and shields, and led to new tactics for riot squads and other special-purpose teams. Officers could now stand up against violent rioters throwing dangerous projectiles without having to resort to lethal methods to quickly disperse the danger.  Coupled with the introduction of effective non-lethal chemical agents such as [[tear gas]] and offensive odor canisters, and non-lethal impact rounds such as [[rubber bullets]] and "bean bag" [[flexible baton round]]s, riot tactics were modified to rely less on violent response to attacking rioters than on a return to the slowly advancing wall, with supporting officers firing non-lethal ordnance into the crowd to discourage advance.

Police officers on patrol were traditionally armed with a baton or pistol or both, and non-lethal methods of subduing an attacker centered on hand-fighting techniques such as [[jujutsu]] and baton use. In the 1980s and 1990s officers began deploying non-lethal personal sidearms such as [[pepper spray]]s, and eventually [[electroshock weapon]]s such as [[Taser]]s, which were developed for use by police and also found a market in [[Self-defense (theory)|self-defense]] by private citizens. However, [https://www.demarcko.com/collections/keychains-pepper-spray these weapons] were developed for non-lethal resolution of a one-on-one conflict.

During the 1990s and early 2000s (decade) interest in various other forms of less-than-lethal weapons for military and police use rose. Amongst other factors, the use of less-than-lethal weapons may be legal under international law and treaty in situations where weapons such as aerosol sprays or gases defined as chemical are not. Less-than-lethal weapons are also useful in keeping the peace in the aftermath of violent conflict.

Between the years of 1987–1990 after a three-year field study by the FBI's Firearm's Training Unit; In 1990 the use of Oleoresin Capsicum was first issued and used by the FBI as the first official law enforcement agency.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) police began to adopt a new pepper spray delivery system based on the equipment used in [[paintball]]s. A specialized paintball, called a "pepperball", is filled with liquid or powdered [[capsaicin]], the active ingredient in pepper spray, and is propelled by compressed gas using a paintball marker similar to those used for the sport but operating at higher pressure. The impact of the capsule is immediately painful (a pepperball's shell is thicker than a standard paintball and is fired at higher velocity), and it breaks open on impact, dispersing the capsaicin with similar effect to aerosol-delivered pepper spray.  However, to be most effective, pepper spray must contact the eyes, nose, or mouth of the target; pepper spray on clothing or tougher skin has a much reduced effect.

==Effects==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
Non-lethal weapons' ability to incapacitate with minimal lasting effects has made them the weapon of choice for use in civilian populations. However, some analysts describe "non-lethal" as a misnomer and instead define them as "less-lethal".&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-lethal technologies—an overview|accessdate=1 October 2010|author=Nick Lewer and Neil Davison|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==
{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}
Non-lethal weapons are intended to minimize injury or death. While people are occasionally seriously injured or killed by these weapons, fatalities are relatively infrequent.  Causes of death from non-lethal weapons are varied and occasionally uncertain. Misplaced or ricocheting shots, pre-existing medical conditions, inadequate user training, repetitive applications and intentional misuse have been implicated in different cases where death has occurred.

As different parts of the body differ in vulnerability, and because people vary in weight and fitness, any weapon powerful enough to incapacitate may be capable of killing under certain circumstances.  Thus "non-lethal force" does have some risk of causing death: in this context "non-lethal" means only "not ''intended'' to kill".

Several groups maintain there is great room for improvement in non-lethal weapons and procedures for their use. Claims for the relative safety of such weapons are usually contingent on their being used "properly". For example, the [[rubber bullet]]s developed during the 1960s were supposed to be fired at the ground and hit the target only after ricochet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0524-04.htm Study Says Rubber Bullets Too Dangerous For Civil Crowd Control, from AP, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; and other non-lethal bullets are designed to be fired at the lower body; they can be lethal if fired directly at the head, as commonly happens.

==Ammunition==
Non-lethal rounds are [[Cartridge (firearms)|firearm rounds]] which are designed to [[shooting to wound|incapacitate, but not kill]], a target. The rounds rely on the transfer of kinetic energy and [[Blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] to accomplish this incapacitation. [[Rubber bullet]]s, rubber buckshot, [[/soft polymer round|soft polymer round]]s, [[wax bullet]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, [[beanbag round]]s, [[sponge grenades]], [[Ring Airfoil Projectile|ring airfoil projectiles]] (both kinetic and tear gas projectiles) and [[Electroshock weapon|rubber bullets with electroshock effect]] (e.g. [[Taser]] [[XREP]] rounds) are less lethal than conventional metal bullets, and are also propelled at lower speed by using less propellant. "Bean bag" type bullets are sometimes referred to as [[flexible baton round]]s. More recently, high-velocity [[paintball gun]]s are also used to launch less-lethal rounds, including the [[FN 303]] launcher and PepperBall commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepperball.com|title=PepperBall® - Non-Lethal Weapons and Training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the Variable Velocity Weapon Concept, for which a propulsion energy source may not yet have been clearly established and/or finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/07/set-assault-rif.html|title=Army Looks to Turn Toy Into Next-Gen Rifle|first=David|last=Hambling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, all of these technologies apply the same basic mechanism, which is to launch a mass at the target that interacts kinetically.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Explosives==
[[Hand grenade]]s come in several less-lethal varieties, such as [[Stun grenade|"flashbang" (stun) grenades]], [[Hand grenade#Sting|"sting" grenades]] with rubber [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], and grenades designed to release chemical irritants (described below).

In 1972 stun grenades were used to capture the hijacked [[Sabena Flight 571]], allowing the Israeli forces headed by [[Ehud Barak]] and including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to storm the plane and take it over within 10 minutes while capturing two terrorists and killing Ali Taha, the leader of the terrorist group and his aide, while rescuing all passengers (three were wounded, and one died of her injuries several days later).

A stun grenade was apparently used by members of the [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|IHH]] against the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldiers during the [[Gaza flotilla raid]] at the beginning of the IDF storming of the [[Mavi Marmara]].&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global News Blog|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0602/Israel-releases-new-videos-of-Gaza-flotilla-raid|accessdate=May 19, 2012|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010 in Kenya, a stun grenade was used to draw attention, and then a real grenade along with an explosive package were used, killing many people. In April during the [[2010 Kyrgyzstani uprising]] police attempted to use stun grenades to stop a demonstration but the crowd overwhelmed the police.  In March stun grenades were used by Belorussian police in [[Minsk]] against demonstrators, and again in September they were used by Greek police in [[Athens]]. In both cases the demonstrations were dispersed with no injuries.

In February 2011 stun grenades were seen used by Egyptian police against rioters.

==Gases and sprays==
{{Further|Incapacitating agent}}

===Water===
[[File:Wasserwerfer.jpg|thumb|Water cannon during a German demonstration, 2001]]

[[Water cannon]]s are commonly used in crowd and riot control, for dispersal or to prevent movement on a particular position. These water cannons are like pressure washers, but not quite as strong. Water-filled rounds for small arms are in experimental stages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
[[Water cannon#Electrified water cannon|Electrified water cannon]] was in development but was abandoned.

===Scent-based weapons===
[[Malodorant]]s produce smells so horrible they cause people to leave the affected area.  In 2008, the [[Israeli Defence Forces]] began using [[Skunk (weapon)|Skunk]] for crowd control. It is a form of mist sprayed from a water cannon, which leaves a terrible odor of rot or sewage on whatever it touches, and does not wash off easily.

===Pepper spray===
The active ingredient in [[pepper spray]] is oleoresin capsicum (OC), an acrid irritant chemical derived from [[cayenne pepper]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/162358.pdf |title=Evaluation of Pepper Spray |last1=Edwards |first1=Steven M. |last2=Granfield |first2=John |last3=Onnen |first3=Jamie |date=February 1997 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |work=Research in Brief |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1998 estimate by the [[Internet Association of Chiefs of Police]] suggested at least 113 pepper spray-related fatalities had occurred in the United States, all with aggravating factors such as intoxication, pre-existing health problems, or from the police use of airway-restrictive immobilizing holds that can cause [[positional asphyxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terryjallen.com/journo-subP/teargas.htm |title=Tear Gas: Chemical Cops |last=Allen |first=Terry J. |work=In These Times |date=May 29, 2000 |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern California chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] recommends against maximal prone restraint techniques following pepper spray application, and they caution that anyone sprayed should be monitored to ensure effective breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu-sc.org/attach/p/Pepper_Spray_New_Questions.pdf |title=Pepper Spray Update: More Fatalities, More Questions |publisher=ACLU of Southern California |date=June 1995 |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tear gas===
[[File:VPD anti-riot officers.jpg|thumb|Vancouver Police Department officers in anti-riot gear and armed with tear gas grenade launchers confront [[Stanley Cup]] rioters.]]

The use of chemical weapons such as [[tear gas]] ([[CS spray|CS]]) and pepper spray ([[Pepper spray|OC]]) has come under increasing scrutiny and criticism due to studies showing serious long term side effects. Many police forces are no longer exposing their members to the chemicals during training.

Journalist [[Rubén Salazar]] was killed in Los Angeles in 1970 by an errant CS gas canister during the [[Chicano Moratorium|Chicano riots]]. Other serious injuries and fatalities have occurred from either tear gas itself or the projectiles it is delivered in, including the critical injury of veteran Scott Olsen from a tear gas canister during the 2011 Occupy Oakland protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oakland Police Critically Injure Iraq War Veteran During Occupy Protest|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/iraq-vet-oakland-police-tear-gas_n_1033159.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mace===
Often promoted for self-defense, [[Mace (spray)|mace]] is a spray of various formulations, that may include tear gas, pepper spray, and [[phenacyl chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;Bunker 1997, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychochemical===
{{Main|Psychochemical weapons}}
[[Psychochemical weapons]] are psychoactive drugs, such as [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]], [[LSD]], [[Kolokol-1]], [[EA-3167]], and [[3-Methylamphetamine]] designed to have a disorienting effect when used during combat or interrogation.&lt;ref name=rozsa&gt;Rózsa L 2009.

''Substance Use &amp; Misuse,'' '''44,''' 172-178.] accessed: 27. 11. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep gas===
During the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], Russian special forces used an unidentified gas (thought to be [[3-methylfentanyl]] or another [[fentanyl]] variant dissolved in halothane gas) in an attempt to induce sleep in both hostages and terrorists. Many of the hostages and terrorists (including all of the suicide bombers) were anesthetized, but some terrorists donned gas masks and thus were able to avoid the effects of the gas. Because the agent used was a potent Fentanyl derivative (a synthetic opioid), it causes respiratory depression and ultimately respiratory failure if administered in high enough dosages. The central nervous system effects, such as anesthesia and respiratory depression could have been reversed by an opioid antagonist such as [[naloxone]], which is stocked by hospitals and most ambulances. However, because the Russian authorities did not release any information regarding what type of agent was used, medical professionals were unaware that an opioid had been used during the rescue attempt and thus were unable to administer the antidote which could have saved most hostages. Approximately 700 hostages were rescued, while 130 died from exposure to the gas. All the terrorists were ultimately killed by Russian forces through some combination of gas exposure and gunfire.

===Other chemical agents===
{{Further|Incapacitating agent}}
[[Blister agent]]s, including [[CR gas]], are less often used riot control agents. Other irritants include [[CS gas]] and [[nonivamide]] (PAVA).

{{Main|Area denial weapons}}
Area denial weapons work by either incapacitating or deterring the enemy.

===Anti-vehicle===
[[File:Caltrop from Vietnam 1968.jpg|thumb|right|Iron caltrops]]
 
Vehicle stoppers include a wide range of methods and devices meant to disable a vessel or vehicle to prevent attack by an oncoming vessel or vehicle or to stop that vessel or vehicle for evaluation. Vessel and vehicle stoppers may include kinetic, chemical, or electromagnetic means.&lt;ref name=Bunker1997&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoZYYz1ZieYC&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7 |last=Bunker |first=Robert J. |title=Nonlethal Weapons: Terms and References |publisher=DIANE Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=142899193X |volume=15 |series=INSS occasional paper |author2=USAF Institute for National Security Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-12-pulses-immobilize-cars-rf-safe-stop.html|title=Pulses immobilize cars with RF Safe-Stop from e2v|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savelec-project.eu/|title=Savelec project - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caltrops ====

[[Caltrop]]s are known to have been in use since Roman times and may have been used earlier: the concept was familiar to the 4th century BC Greeks, who used rocks, brush, nets and trees placed in the path of enemy conveyances on land or ensnarement devices hidden under water to achieve the same result: stop the enemy or suspected hostile in his tracks for examination or to prevent or limit incursions. Contemporary caltrops look something like large jacks from the childhood game. Placed in the path of oncoming wheeled or tracked vehicles, they are meant to foul wheels, destroy tires and tracks, and incapacitate vehicles.&lt;ref name=Bunker1997/&gt;

=== Anti-personnel ===

==== Caltrops ====
 
Simple rows or clusters of sharpened sticks (also known as [[punji stick]]s), and the use of small [[caltrops]] have been a feature of anti-[[infantry]] warfare for a long time. However, due to the difficulty of mass-producing them in the pre-modern age, they were rarely used except in the defense of limited areas or chokepoints, especially during sieges, where they were used to help seal breaches. Increasing ease of production still did not prevent these methods from slowly falling out of favor from the late Middle Ages onward.&lt;ref name="Cal"&gt;"[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3805676.html Weaponry: The Caltrop]", Reid, Robert W., originally in ''[[Military History (magazine)|Military History]]'', August 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Caltrops are still sometimes used in modern conflicts, such as during the [[Korean War]], where Chinese troops, often wearing only light shoes, were particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Cal"/&gt; In modern times, special caltrops are also sometimes used against wheeled vehicles with pneumatic tires. Some South American urban guerrillas as the [[Tupamaros]] and [[Montoneros]] called them "miguelitos" and used these as a tactic to avoid pursuit after ambushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcci.net/globalizacion/2008/fg747.htm|title=Tupamaros. De las armas a las urnas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riot gun==

In current usage a [[riot gun]] or less-lethal launcher is a type of firearm that is used to fire ""non-lethal" or "less-lethal" ammunition for the purpose of suppressing riots. Less-lethal launchers may be special purpose firearms designed for riot control use, or standard firearms, usually shotguns and grenade launchers, adapted to riot control use with appropriate ammunition. The ammunition is most commonly found in 12 gauge (.729 inches) shotguns and 37mm and 40&amp;nbsp;mm (1.46 and 1.57 inches) grenade launchers.

In the United States, the term riot gun more commonly refers to a [[riot shotgun]].

==Electroshock weapons==
[[Electroshock weapon]]s are incapacitant weapons used for subduing a person by administering electric shock aimed at disrupting superficial muscle functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name "[[Taser]]", which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons, and electroshock belts administer an electric shock by direct contact.

==Directed energy weapons==
[[File:Long Range Acoustic Device 500X in New York City.jpg|thumb|An [[NYPD]] officer stands ready with a sonic weapon, the [[LRAD]] 500X, at an [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest on November 17, 2011 near the [[New York City Hall]]]]
{{Main|Directed-energy weapon}}
Directed energy weapons are weapons that emit energy in an aimed direction without the means of a projectile. They are non-lethal and can immobilize people as well as machines (e.g. vehicles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurekaaerospace.com/hpems.php HPEM Active Denial System disabling vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; Directed energy weapons include electromagnetic weapons, (including [[laser weapon]]s) and [[microwave]] weapons, [[particle beam weapon]]s, [[sonic weapon]]s and [[plasma weapon]]s.

=== Ultraviolet laser ===

HSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for the last names of the original founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of [[San Diego, California]], USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine article "Beyond the Rubber Bullet". It is an [[electrolaser]] using [[ultraviolet]] [[laser]] beams of 193&amp;nbsp;nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248&amp;nbsp;nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, with their website defunct as of September 2017.&lt;ref name="hsvti.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsvti.com|title=lasik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulsed Energy Projectile ===

'''[[Pulsed Energy Projectile]]''' or '''PEP''' is a technology of non-lethal [[directed energy weapon]]ry currently under development by the [[U.S. military]]. It involves the emission of an invisible [[laser]] pulse which, upon contact with the target, ablates the surface and creates a small amount of exploding [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This produces a pressure wave that stuns the target and knocks them off their feet, and [[electromagnetic radiation]] that affects [[nerve cells]] causing a painful sensation. The technology can also be used as a lethal weapon, and indeed an early name was ''[[pulsed impulsive kill laser]]''.

The pulsed energy projectile is intended for [[riot control]] and is said to work over distances of up to 2&amp;nbsp;km. It weighs about 230&amp;nbsp;kg and will probably be mounted on vehicles. The weight could become lighter as laser production technology improves.

The system was developed by [[Mission Research Corporation]] (now owned by [[Orbital ATK]]). It uses a chemical [[deuterium fluoride laser]] device producing [[infrared]] laser pulses.  The plasma (produced by the early part of the pulse) explodes because its [[electron]]s absorb the energy of the later part of the pulse.

In 2003, a US military review reported{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} that the electromagnetic radiation produced by PEPs had been shown to cause pain and temporary paralysis in animal experiments.

United States Special Operations Command FY 2010 plans included starting developmental work on a Counter UAV Pulsed Energy Projectile.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/pep.htm|title=Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP)|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active Denial System (ADS)===

The '''[[Active Denial System]]''' ('''ADS''') weapon system is a dish that projects electromagnetic radiation just powerful enough to penetrate human skin and make the nervous system think the victim is on fire, although no physical damage is done.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Future combat vehicles such as the American [[GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle]] will incorporate non-lethal weapons.&lt;ref name=GCVspecs&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://defense-update.com/features/2010/january/gcv_army_details_100110.html |title=U.S. Army Outlines Ground Combat Vehicles Priorities |publisher=Defense update |date= |accessdate= January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Boston Globe'', September 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; since it works by heating the surface of targets, such as the skin of targeted human subjects.

In 2011, the ADS was redesigned to make it smaller, more reliable, and able to be used on the move. ADS II is being designed to operate from moving aircraft, as well as moving ground vehicles. The redesign does not address problems in different environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="ADS 2"&gt;[http://strategypage.com/htmw/htmurph/articles/20121003.aspx Death Ray Turns Warm And Fuzzy] – Strategypage.com, October 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air Force Special Operations Command]] is experimenting with mounting an ADS on the [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130J Ghostrider]] gunship to target threatening crowds or individuals on the ground. This is to give the gunship a non-lethal option so the crew has more engagement options. Due to the increasing number of engagements in populated areas, the Air Force is aiming to field a system within 5–10 years to have enough aircraft available with non-lethal systems.&lt;ref name="flightglobal.com"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-special-forces-pursuing-ac-130-based-active-denial-415124/ US Special Forces pursuing AC-130-based 'active denial system'] - Flightglobal.com, 29 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft will apparently use the ADS II version.&lt;ref name="AC-130J Gets A Ray Gun"&gt;[http://strategypage.com/htmw/htairw/articles/20150810.aspx AC-130J Gets A Ray Gun] - Strategypage.com, 10 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dazzler ===

A [[Dazzler (weapon)|Dazzler]] is a [[directed-energy weapon]] intended to temporarily blind or disorient its target with intense directed radiation. Targets can include sensors or human vision. Dazzlers emit [[infrared]] or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and [[visible light]] against humans, when they are intended to cause no long-term damage to [[eye]]s. The emitters are usually [[laser]]s, making what is termed a ''laser dazzler''. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a [[laser diode]]) or green (a [[diode-pumped solid-state laser]], DPSS) areas of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Initially developed for military use, non-military products are becoming available for use in law enforcement and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/us-cops-and-military-to-get-laser-guns-602983 |title=US cops and military to get laser guns |date=27 May 2009 |author=Mark Harris |publisher=[[Techradar.com]] |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20011548-71.html |title=Police to experiment with blinding 'Dazer Laser'? |author=Chris Matyszczyk |date=23 July 2010 |publisher=[[CNET]].com |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weapons designed to cause permanent blindness are banned by the 1995 [[United Nations]] [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]]. The dazzler is a [[non-lethal force|non-lethal]] [[weapon]] intended to cause [[Flash blindness|temporary blindness]] or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.

The LRAD is the round black device on top of the [[New York City]] police Hummer.
The '''[[Long Range Acoustic Device]]''' ('''LRAD''') is an [[acoustic hailing device]] developed by [[LRAD Corporation]] to send messages and warning tones over longer distances or at higher volume than normal [[loudspeaker]]s.

Although generally considered 'non-lethal weapons', electromagnetic weapons do pose health threats to humans.  In fact, "non-lethal weapons can sometimes be deadly."&lt;ref&gt;Air University Research Template: "[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat34.pdf NON-LETHAL WEAPONS: SETTING OUR PHASERS ON STUN?

[[United States Department of Defense]] policy explicitly states that '''non-lethal weapons''' "shall not be required to have a zero probability of producing fatalities or permanent injuries."&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense; DIRECTIVE; [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300003p.pdf NUMBER 3000.3]; July 9, 1996; Certified Current as of November 21, 2003; ASD(SO/LIC); SUBJECT: Policy for Non-Lethal Weapons; References: (a) Title 10, United States Code; (b) DoD Directive TS-3600.1, "Information Warfare (U)", December 21, 1992; PG. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a Human Effects Advisory Panel was established in 1998 to provide independent assessment on human effects, data, and models for the use of 'non-lethal weapons' on the general population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/nld4/kenny.pdf Human Effects Advisory Panel Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114161030/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/nld4/kenny.pdf |date=2004-11-14 }}; presented to: NDIANon-Lethal Defense IV&lt;/ref&gt; the TECOM Technology Symposium in 1997 concluded on non-lethal weapons: "Determining the target effects on personnel is the greatest challenge to the testing community," primarily because  "the potential of injury and death severely limits human tests."  However, "[[Directed-energy weapon|directed energy weapons]] that target the central nervous system and cause neurophysiological disorders" may violate the [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] of 1980. And weapons that go beyond non-lethal intentions and cause "superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering" could violate the [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1977."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/jfq_pubs/1621.pdf Non-Lethal Weaponry: From Tactical to Strategic Applications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223201043/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/jfq_pubs/1621.pdf |date=2003-12-23 }}; Colonel Dennis B.

Any such studies require explicit consent of all participants so as not to violate the UN Convention against torture and other cruelties.

== Misuse ==
Pepper spray is one non-lethal weapon alleged to have been misused by American police. In two incidents in California in 1997, police swabbed pepper spray directly into the eyes of protesters.&lt;ref name="Amnesty1997"&gt;''[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/067/1997/en/ USA: Police use of pepper spray - tantamount to torture]''.

==Terrorism concerns==
Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the [[Lexington Institute]] in Virginia states that: "The relevant (electromagnetic weapon) technology is well within the grasp of some countries and transnational [[terrorist]] groups", and further states that U.S. hardware is susceptible to microwave and other directed-energy weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Inside the Pentagon; Cebrowski calls for cultural changes; DEFENSE OFFICIALS URGE COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR PRECISION ATTACKS; April 3, 2003 [http://209.85.215.104/unclesam?q=cache:EVT0Miqqv0EJ:www.oft.osd.mil/library/library_files/article_42_Inside%2520the%2520Pentagon--story%2520from%2520Flash%2520conference.doc+electromagnetic+weapons+heart+attacks&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=us]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PAMI''' ({{lang-es|Programa de Atención Médica Integral}}; {{lang-en|Comprehensive Medical Attention Program}}) is a [[public health insurance]] agency in [[Argentina]] managed by the Ministry of Health.

==Overview==
Administered under the aegis of the ''Instituto Nacional de Servicios Sociales para Jubilados y Pensionados'' (National Institute of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners, or INSSJP), PAMI serves [[senior citizen]]s, and veterans of the 1982 [[Falklands War]].

PAMI maintains 37 regional offices and 550 local offices for its over 4 million enrollees. The agency provides free medicine to 650,000 pensioners and retirees, 87% of whom earn the minimum [[pension]] of around US$200 a month.&lt;ref name=pami/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/notas/559770-La-jubilacion-minima-subira-a-1227-en-marzo.html|title=La jubilación mínima subirá a $1.227 en marzo|publisher=''InfoBae''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 13% receive a benefit of the high cost of their treatment, in cases where this exceeds a retiree's income. The agency covers 100% of the cost of drugs to treat [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], and other chronic medical conditions. Medications for [[hypertension]], which affects nearly nine of out of ten seniors in Argentina, are covered with an 80% discount, including prescription drugs for [[cholesterol]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=pami/&gt; The agency covers over 2,000 [[stent]] insertions annually,&lt;ref name=clarin1/&gt; as well as over 6,000 [[pacemaker]] implants (70% of those provided in Argentina).&lt;ref name=pami/&gt;

PAMI covers around 25 million doctor's visits and nearly 2 million prescriptions annually.&lt;ref name=clarin1/&gt; Surgical procedures covered by the agency in 2009 included over 55,000 for [[cataracts]], 50,000 [[intraocular lens]]es, 20,000 hip and knee surgeries, and 700 [[organ transplant]]s.&lt;ref name=pami/&gt; Other benefits include [[kinesiology]], [[legal aid]], [[mental health]], and [[funeral]] expense assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pami.org.ar/result.php?c=3-2-4|title=Centros de Atención|publisher=PAMI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits represent 10% of the total pension payments issued by [[ANSES]], the national [[social security]] agency. The real market value of the medical services, medicine, and other services provided by PAMI, however, amount to 30% of retirees' income. the total expenditure on drugs for PAMI in 2010 was almost us$750 million; were retirees to pay the market price of these drugs, their cost would have approximated us$3 billion. Private [[health insurance]] is widely available in Argentina. The cost of [[Insurance premium|premium]]s for those over age 60 would be unaffordable to most retirees, however, as these average around us$150 per person per month.&lt;ref name=pami/&gt;

==History==

Historically, health expenses in Argentina were met on an [[out-of-pocket]] basis, or through a number of [[mutual aid society|mutual aid societies]] and [[health care co-operatives]] established by [[guild]]s, as well as by [[Immigration in Argentina|immigrant]] associations. Health care co-operatives developed into employer and [[Trade unions in Argentina|trade union]] sponsored ''obras sociales'' beginning in 1910. They expanded rapidly during the administration of President [[Juan Perón]] from 1946 to 1955, when unionization was fostered.&lt;ref name=wb&gt;{{cite book|title=Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth|publisher=The World Bank|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health coverage for senior citizens remained sparse, however, and those who could retain their ''obra social'' generally received less adequate care than younger enrollees.&lt;ref name=clarin1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/01/13/e-04701d.htm|title=El PAMI sufrió hasta ahora 13 intervenciones|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAMI was thus established to absorb the growing number of seniors on the initiative of Social Welfare Minister [[Francisco Manrique]], and was signed into law by President [[Alejandro Lanusse]] via Decree 19.032, on May 13, 1971.&lt;ref name=clarin1/&gt; The insurer functioned only in [[Buenos Aires]] at its outset, though by 1976, it had opened offices in all the [[Provinces of Argentina|nation's provinces]]. PAMI established a network of affiliated [[general practitioner]]s,&lt;ref name=clarin1/&gt; and negotiated rates and prices with other ''obras sociales'', health care federations such as the [[Argentine Medical Association]], and with local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalgeriatrico.com.ar/detallenotas.asp?Id=2188|title=Historia del PAMI|publisher=Portal Geriátrico}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also financed other needs affecting seniors, notably a [[mortgage]] loan program benefiting thousands whose homes were slated for demolition in 1978, during the construction of new [[freeway]]s in Buenos Aires by Mayor [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]].&lt;ref name=clarin1/&gt;

The prolonged economic downturn of the 1980s affected the agency's finances, however. President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] placed PAMI under [[Federal intervention]] in March 1988, and appointed the former [[Governor of Buenos Aires]], Dr. [[Alejandro Armendáriz]], as head of the Crisis Management Commission. The agency's finances were stabilized by September, and the crisis commission was dissolved in favor of a panel presided by Argentina's two leading senior citizens' [[advocacy group]]s. PAMI was restored to solvency while adding spousal benefits and vacation subsidies for beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saladillo.gov.ar/index.php?include=contenidos/comunidad/personalidades/alejandroarmend%E1riz05.htm|title=Alejandro Armendáriz|publisher=Municipalidad de Saladillo}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Alfonsín signed Law 23.660 on January 5, 1989, which made affiliation in PAMI mandatory for all registered employees, and enacted a 6% [[payroll tax]] to that effect.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/0-4999/62/texact.htm|title=Ley N° 23.660|publisher=Información Legislativa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency's financial crisis was compounded by a series of administrative crises during the subsequent administration of President [[Carlos Menem]]. Menem's third appointee to the post, [[Matilde Menéndez]], and most of her board of advisers would be indicted for [[fraud]] stemming from contracts signed during her 1992—94 tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/88339-procesan-a-ex-directores-del-pami |title=Procesan a ex directores del PAMI |trans-title=Former PAMI Directors Prosecuted |work=[[La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=19 February 1998 |access-date=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 recession cut its revenues from US$3.1 billion to US$2.4 billion, and led to a US$1.2 billion debt.&lt;ref name=clarin2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/96/11/25/T-00201d.htm|title=PAMI: admiten que se paga de más en los contratos|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandro Bramer Markovic was appointed in 1996 with a mandate to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse at the insurer, only to resign the following year amid accusations of excessive spending on outside [[auditing]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/170309-pami-gasto-3290000-en-auditorias-en-cinco-meses|title=PAMI: gastó $ 3.290.000 en auditorías en cinco meses|publisher=''La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, Víctor Alderete, remained at the post until the end of Menem's presidency in 1999. His tenure, however, was marked by [[subcontractor]] cost overruns, and he faced over 20 charges to that related to these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/12196-el-pami-signado-por-los-escandalos|title=El PAMI, signado por los escándalos|publisher=''La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAMI had entered a crisis stage. The agency's annual budget declined to US$900 million in 2003. Coverage, in addition, was managed through a system consisting of 72 intermediaries whose costs reached 50% of the agency's benefits spending, and the resulting deficits at PAMI prompted a reduction in prescription drug coverage to 40% by 2003. These developments led most retirees to opt out of the system, and membership declined from four million in 1992&lt;ref name=wb/&gt; to 900,000 by 2003, or fewer than one fourth of Argentine seniors.&lt;ref name=pami/&gt;

The administrations of Presidents [[Néstor Kirchner|Néstor]] and [[Cristina Kirchner]] prioritized the agency in their budget policy, and from 2003 to 2010, budgets for PAMI increased from 2.6 billion [[Argentine peso|pesos]] to 15.6 billion pesos, or 500%. Its related [[social assistance]] programs were expanded, and 800,000 seniors received [[food policy|nutritional]], [[housing policy|rent]], and other assistance from PAMI. The agency's chronic deficits were reversed, and by 2010, it maintained a reserve fund of aroundUS$1.75 billion. Its enrollment also recovered, and services were provided to a total of 3.7 million patients in 2009, or 89% of the agency's members.&lt;ref name=pami/&gt;

Soon after its founding, PFAW launched an affiliated [[501(c)(3)]] organization, [[People for the American Way Foundation]], for the purpose of conducting more extensive educational and research activities for left-wing causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glanz|first=James|title=Survey Finds Support Is Strong For Teaching 2 Origin Theories|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40D15F83F5F0C728DDDAA0894D8404482|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the People for the American Way Voters Alliance was launched as a [[political action committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, Laurie (November 5, 1998).

PFAW has been active in battles over judicial nominations, opposing U.S. Supreme Court nominee [[Robert Bork]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]] and supporting the nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court of [[Sonia Sotomayor]].&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/39506328/president-trumps-conservative-court-shift-may-slow-down-as-liberal-judges-avoid-retirement}}&lt;/ref&gt;PFAW is also active in federal elections, donating $339,874 to oppose Republican candidates in the 2014 election cycle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People For The American Way|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cycle=2014&amp;cmte=People+for+the+American+Way|website=OpenSecrets.org|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and $351,075 to oppose Republican candidates in the 2016 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=People+for+the+American+Way|title=People for the American Way Outside Spending {{!}} OpenSecrets|website=www.opensecrets.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right Wing Watch ===
PFAW, a left-wing group, monitors what it characterizes as "right-wing" activities. Toward this end, the organization sponsors a website called "Right Wing Watch", which showcases video footage of groups and individuals who take conservative stances on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gryboski|first1=Michael|title='Right Wing Watch' YouTube Account Again Suspended Due to Fmr.

In 2014, [[The Benham Brothers|Jason and David Benham]] lost the opportunity to host their own [[HGTV]] television show after Right Wing Watch labeled the brothers as "anti-gay, anti-choice extremists" because of their statements at various events about homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/08/hgtv-benham-brothers-anti-gay_n_5287322.html|title=HGTV Drops Benham Brothers’ ‘Flip It Forward’ After Anti-Gay Views Are Unearthed|date=2014-05-08|work=[[HuffPost]]|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/08/showbiz/tv/benham-brothers-hgtv/|title=Benham brothers lose HGTV show after 'anti-gay' remarks|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=2014-05-09|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, David Benham said, "We love all people.

'''Policy experimentation''' points to political-administrative procedures and initiatives that allow to discover or test novel instruments of problem-solving and thereby propel broader-based policy innovation or institutional adaptation in a given polity, economy or society.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek FA. The constitution of liberty. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North DC. Institutions, institutional change and economic performance. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland G. Transition and economics: politics, markets, and firms. Cambridge: MIT; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mukand SW. and Rodrik D. In search of the Holy Grail: policy convergence, experimentation, and economic performance. In: American Economic Revue, 95(1): p. 374–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

As compared to centralized [[legislation]] or national regulation, one of the major advantages of decentralized policy experimentation is seen in allowing spatially, sectorally or temporally limited policy trials that reduce the risks and costs of introducing major reform schemes to the national polity, economy and society. A major deficit of policy experimentation is seen in promoting policy heterogeneity, legal fragmentation and jurisdictional disparities.

The term has come to renewed prominence in the discussion about the political processes behind China's economic rise since the beginning of [[Chinese economic reform]] policies in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Sebastian Heilmann|Heilmann 2008]]. Policy Experimentation in China’s Economic Rise. In: Studies in Comparative International Development, 43 (1): p. 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Policy experimentation often just paraphrases the cycles of policy reversals and policy re-prioritization that are characteristic of all political systems if established policies come to be seen as failing, too costly, or politically risky.

In a stricter definition policy experimentation implies a policy process in which experimenting units try out a variety of methods and processes to find imaginative solutions to predefined tasks or to new challenges that emerge during experimental activity. Policy experimentation is not equivalent to freewheeling trial and error or spontaneous policy diffusion. It is a purposeful and coordinated activity geared to producing novel policy options that are injected into official policymaking and then replicated on a larger scale, or even formally incorporated into national law.

In more technical terms, experimentation aims “to inform policy by using experiments with direct interventions and control groups instead of observational studies or theoretical analyses”&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller, F.]] Selected papers of Frederick Mosteller, New York, Springer; 2006: p. 487, 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of policy experimentation==

===Small-scale policy experimentation===
If policy experimentation is designed and evaluated by social scientists as part of government-sponsored pilot programs, it is usually limited to narrowly defined trial measures and preselected target groups. It often is confined to the fine-tuning of implementation technicalities (such as testing the suitability of a new social security card in a pilot site), but only very rarely to substantive policy formulation (such as the extent, focus, or budgeting of social policies) that are the object of complex bargaining processes in which tactical political considerations weigh much heavier than outside expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Jowell R. Trying it out: the role of ‘pilots’ in policy-making. London: Government Chief Social Researcher’s Office; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broad-based transformative policy experimentation===
Transformative policy experimentation is much more comprehensive and ambitious since it strives to alter economic and administrative behavior and institutions. Such experimentation also opens up entirely new market segments and establishes new types of corporate organization, thereby regularly moving beyond the originally defined test groups and procedures and involving policymakers on different levels of the political system. Mosteller sees such “reorganization experiments” as the most difficult to carry out because they depend on a chain of complex interrelations, may require a great deal of time and resources, tend to provoke stiff political opposition, have to deal with ongoing contextual changes, and are subject to political-administrative interference and changes of the rules of the game in the middle of the experimental process. Transformative experimentation usually comes in the shape of demonstration projects taking place in a politically realistic—i.e., fluid, disturbed, and contested—context that escapes strict scientific controls, but can give a fuller view of the workings of novel policies and their impact on major social, market, or administrative actors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller, Frederick]]. Selected papers of Frederick Mosteller, New York, Springer; 2006: p. 479-480, 492-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation prior to legislation===
Policy experimentation in this variant constitutes a distinct mode of governance that differs in one fundamental way from standard assumptions about policymaking. The conventional model of the policy process that is widely taken for granted by jurists, economists, and political scientists holds that policy analysis, formulation, and embodiment in legislation precede implementation. But policy experimentation means innovating through implementation first, and drafting universal laws and regulations later.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Sebastian Heilmann|Heilmann 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy experimentation versus incrementalism==
At first sight, policy experimentation displays commonalities with what Lindblom&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, Charles E. 1959. The Science of ‘Muddling Through, In: Public Administration Review 19(2): p. 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, Charles E. 1979. Still Muddling, Not Yet Through, Public Administration Review 39 (6): 517-526.&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes as the incremental method of successive limited comparisons in making public policy: the exploratory, reversible character of policymaking and the prior reduction of political antagonisms by avoiding drastic change at the outset. Yet, under certain conditions, experimentation can transcend incrementalist tinkering with existing practices and lead to drastic policy departures and transformative change marked by the emergence of new configurations of actors, interests, institutions, ideologies, and goals.

==Tools of experimentation==
In democratic polities, policy experimentation comes as mostly small-scale explorative pilot projects, as pioneering legislation by individual states in federal systems (“states as laboratories”), as experimental or sunset clauses incorporated into formal legislation, or, very rarely, as a special dispensation for local administrative districts to be exempt from certain provisions of national law.&lt;ref&gt;Morand, Charles-Albert, ed. 1993. Évaluation législative et lois expérimentales [Legislative Evaluation and Experimental Laws]. Aix-en-Provence: Presse Universitaires d’Aix-Marseille.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, David H., Donna Linksz, and Marvin Mandell. 2003. Social Experimentation and Public Policymaking. Washington, DC: Urban Institute Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hummel, Konrad. 2003. Recht der behördlichen Regelungsexperimente [Law of Experiments in Administrative Regulation]. Berlin: Duncker and Humblot.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Chinese government, experimentation comes in three main forms as (1) experimental regulation (provisional rules made for trial implementation), (2) "experimental points" (model demonstrations and pilot projects in a specific policy domain), and (3) "experimental zones" (local jurisdictions with broad discretionary powers).&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Sebastian Heilmann|Heilmann 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Polish National Party''' ({{lang-pl|Polska Partia Narodowa}}) is a fringe [[nationalist]] and ultra-conservative [[political party]] in [[Poland]] led by Leszek Bubel. Its motto is: "I am Polish, therefore I have Polish obligations", as quoted after the Polish politician and statesman [[Roman Dmowski]] whose ideas are used by the starting point for its ideology.

==History and leadership==
The leader of the party during the 1990s was Boleslaw Tejkowski.&lt;ref name=cas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mudde|first=Cas|title=Extreme-right Parties in Eastern Europe|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|year=2000|volume=34|issue=1|pages=5–27|doi=10.1080/00313220008559132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the party and Tejkowski were notorious for their virulent nationalist and antisemitic propaganda.&lt;ref name=cas/&gt; The party was registered on March 22, 2004. In 2004 the party participated in the European Parliament elections and took the last 21st place with 0.04% votes. In the 2005 elections for the Polish Senate and [[Sejm]], the party received 34,127 votes or 0.29% of the total.&lt;ref name="wybory2005-1"&gt;[http://www.wybory2005.pkw.gov.pl/SJM/EN/WYN/M/k73.htm ] Information from National Electoral Commission&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish parliamentary election, 2005]] Polish parliamentary election, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In Presidential elections of the same year, Leszek Bubel received 18,828 votes, or 0.13%&lt;ref name="wybory2005-2"&gt;[http://www.wybory2005.pkw.gov.pl/PZT1/EN/WYN/W/index.htm] Information from National Electoral Commission. Presidential Election The Republic of Poland. 9 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The party did not compete in the 2007 Parliamentary elections nor in the 2009 European Parliament elections.

==Agenda==

== The Bubel Band ==

At the beginning of 2008 chairman of the party Leszek Bubel appeared on [[YouTube]] with the song "Longinus Zerwimycka".&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28C8g2t4hf0] "Longinus Zerwimyska" on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; The song made fun of Jews in Poland and told them to go to the [[United States]]. The act provoked numerous protests{{Citation needed|reason=What protests?|date=October 2018}}. Despite the protests Bubel released another offensive video clip: "Bzykający Rabin"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4jR7g2Uv1c ] "Bzykający Rabin" on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; ("Buzzing Rabbi"). The word "bzykać" in Polish slang means to engage in sex. The PPN website's 2008 domain name "donaldtusk.net" was described by Bubel himself as a bad joke.&lt;ref name="dziennik"&gt;[http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/artykuly/77459,antysemicka-strona-pod-adresem-premiera.html  Antysemicka strona pod adresem premiera] Dziennik.pl, Kraj; 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; Until now Bubel band released six albums:

* ''Longinus Zerwimycka'' ([[2008 in music|2008]])
* ''Polskie elity'' ([[2008 in music|2008]])
* ''W hołdzie Narodowym Siłom Zbrojnym'' ([[2009 in music|2009]])
* ''Żołnierze Wyklęci'' ([[2010 in music|2010]])
* ''Rycerze Idei'' ([[2010 in music|2010]])
* ''Życie i Śmierć Dla Narodu'' ([[2010 in music|2010]])

The '''Popular center of remembrance''' (''Centro Popular de la Memoria'') is a former illegal detention center in [[Rosario]], {{province|Santa Fe|Argentina}}. It was used by the provincial police between 1976 and 1979, during the [[Dirty War]], to hold people with no formal charges and torture them, under the pretense of fighting radical [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[subversion (political)|political subversion]] and [[terrorism]]. Most of the detainees were in fact social activists, political dissidents, or merely relatives or acquaintances of people that were ideologically suspect in the eyes of the military junta of the self-styled [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|National Reorganization Process]].

The CPM occupies a corner of a large building that takes up a whole block in the city center, between Dorrego and Moreno and between Santa Fe and Córdoba St. It used to be the police headquarters, and during the Dirty War it was formally the home of an intelligence division of the provincial police (''Servicio de Informaciones de la Unidad Regional II''). There is evidence of its use as a detention center since 1976 and until 1979. It was informally termed ''El Pozo'' ("The Pit") and ''La Favela'' ("The [[Favela]]").

The head of the Intelligence Service at the time was [[Gendarmería Nacional Argentina|Gendarmería]] Commander [[Agustín Feced]], who sometimes took part personally in kidnappings, torture sessions and executions. Two of his foremost collaborators were [[José Rubén Lo Fiego]], who are being investigated since 2004.

After the fall of the last military junta and the return to democracy in 1983, the building continued to serve its official functions, until 2001, when [[human rights]] organizations demanded that it be preserved. On 2001-03-22 the Ministry of Government of the province of Santa Fe dictated Resolution No. 0060 to fulfill this request. The official facilities were dismantled and the police headquarters were moved elsewhere. A part of the building was given to municipal control, another one was turned into a delegation of the provincial government, and the central courtyard became an open public square. The relevant sections were granted to a group of human rights organizations by Decree No. 0717 of 2002-05-09 with the name of ''Centro Popular de la Memoria''. It now hosts a memorial exhibition managed by relatives of victims of forced disappearance.

A documentary film about the CPM was released, with the support of a local producer ([http://www.calandaproduce.blogspot.com/ Calanda Producciones]). It includes the story of the investigation and recovery of the detention center as a memorial, and testimonies of the research team and some survivors.

The '''Proliferation Security Initiative''' (PSI) is a global effort that aims to stop trafficking of [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), their delivery systems, and related materials to and from [[State (polity)|states]] and [[non-state actor]]s of proliferation concern.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Launched by [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in May 2003 at a meeting in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], the PSI has now grown to include the endorsement of 105&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/t/isn/c27732.htm&lt;/ref&gt; nations around the world, including [[Russia]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], [[New Zealand]], [[Republic of Korea]] and [[Norway]]. Despite the support of over half of the [[Member states of the United Nations|Members]] of the [[United Nations]], a number of countries have expressed opposition to the initiative, including [[India]], [[China]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005070105231300.htm&amp;date=2005/07/01/&amp;prd=th&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The idea of the PSI is generally credited to [[John R. Bolton]], former US Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security and former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], after 15 [[Scud]] missiles found on board an [[Flag state|unflagged]] [[North Korea]]n freighter, the ''So Sen'', heading towards [[Yemen]] had to be released when it turned out that [[international law]] did not allow them to be confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1579&lt;/ref&gt; Given this apparent gap in international law, several months later US President Bush announced the initiative with his counterpart, [[President of Poland|Polish President]] [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] at Wawel Castle in Kraków on May 31, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Washington touts success of non-proliferation initiative |date=May 27, 2008|publisher=AFP|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iRKd1kgGLUVPl-_nPi81GPo9R-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psi.msz.gov.pl/index.php?document=18&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the PSI included 11 "core" states (Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], the United Kingdom, the US and Poland). On September 4, 2003, in [[Paris]], these countries detailed the principles governing the PSI in a document titled the "Statement of Interdiction Principles". The document defines the activities which are to be undertaken by the initiative, specifically "to establish a more coordinated and effective basis through which to impede and stop shipments of WMD, delivery systems, and related materials flowing to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern, consistent with national legal authorities and relevant international law and frameworks, including the UN Security Council circumstances in which such operations may be carried out (at sea, on land, or in the air) including, most importantly, the requirement that any action taken must be consistent with international law."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/t/isn/c27726.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since the initial core group of 2003, PSI has expanded to include an "Operational Experts Group" (OEG) of 21 nations&lt;ref&gt;http://125.60.3.200/news.do?mode=detail&amp;thiscode=eng030001&amp;guid=51100&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 84 other endorsing states. Key states who have endorsed the initiative since its initial founding include major actors in [[international trade]] such as Singapore and the [[United Arab Emirates]], as well as countries such as [[Turkey]] and the Republic of Korea, who are geographically close to states designated by [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s as proliferation threats.

Eleven nations have signed bilateral Mutual Shipboarding Agreements with the United States, allowing the mutual expedition of shipboarding requests for ships under those nations' flags.  The Eleven are the [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Liberia]], [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mongolia]], [[Panama]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. Each of these nations maintains a large number of commercial vessels on their registries, and are often considered [[flag of convenience]] states.&lt;ref&gt;For the text of these bilateral agreements, see [https://www.state.gov/t/isn/c12386.htm this U.S. Department of State web page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an academic analysis of shipboarding in the PSI context, see {{cite journal |author=Fabio Spadi|year=2006 |title=Bolstering the Proliferation Security Initiative at Sea: A Comparative Analysis of Ship-boarding as a Bilateral and Multilateral Implementing Mechanism |work=Nordic Journal of International Law |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mnp/nord/2006/00000075/00000002/art00005|doi=10.1163/157181006778666614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, at a speech in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], newly inaugurated President [[Barack Obama]] announced that he planned to transform the PSI into a "durable international institution",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/obama_nuclear_proliferation.html&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that US promotion of the initiative would remain non-partisan and cross over from the previous administration.  Indeed, Obama had made the strengthening of the PSI one of his campaign promises in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|Presidential election of 2008]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/192/strengthen-the-proliferation-security-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to promote the PSI through the 2010 White House Nuclear Security Strategy.

The 2013 PSI High Level Political Meeting facilitated the adoption of a set of four Joint Statements, advancing cooperation among PSI endorsing states toward:
-  Ensuring a Robust Initiative
-  Enhancing Critical Interdiction Capabilities and Practices
-  Strengthening Authorities for Action
-  Expanding Strategic Communications

Progress on implementation was reviewed at the PSI Mid-Level Political Meeting in January 2016, hosted in Washington, DC.  Another PSI High Level Political Meeting will be hosted in France in 2018.  

The PSI has evolved considerably since 2003, embracing a much wider array of proliferation security issues, such as customs enforcement, export controls, proliferation finance, and intangible transfers of technology.  Given its broad and flexible mandate, the PSI now plays a vital role in advancing proliferation security norms and standards of practice.

== Participation ==
[[File:Map of Proliferation Security Initiative states.png|thumb|upright=2.0|alt=102 PSI-endorsing states as of April 2013.|PSI-endorsing states, as of 2013]]
The primary role of PSI participants is to abide by the '''Statement of Interdiction Principles''', with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials.  Additionally, participants are recommended to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items.  Finally, participants are to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.

The PSI also supports the maintenance of an informal network of transgovernmental linkages that sustain cooperation outside of the formal PSI framework.  

In the United States, the program is managed by the [[United States National Security Council#Staff|National Security Staff]] working out of the [[White House]], with the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]] playing lead roles; with other departments and agencies in supporting roles.

Participation in PSI activities generally include OEG meetings, live exercises, command post exercises, tabletop exercises, seminars, workshops, and other WMD Interdiction
training.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stratcom.mil/factsheets/Proliferation_Security_Initiative_Support_Cell/&lt;/ref&gt; Current members include:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/t/isn/c27732.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Capabilities and Practices (CCP)==
Endorsing states are developing a formal set of tools called Critical Capabilities and Practices (CCP) for use by all PSI partners to aid in their ability to interdict WMD. An ongoing effort, the CCP is organized into four elements:

Element 1.  Prohibiting Proliferation-Related Conduct – Having in place appropriate legal authorities to prohibit and prevent proliferation activity within and across one’s border

Element 2. Inspection and Identification – The ability to effectively inspect air, land, and sea cargos and to identify proliferation-related materials

Element 3. Seizure and Disposition – The ability to undertake appropriate actions to seize and dispose of interdiction-related materials

Element 4. Rapid Decision Making – The development of decision-making practices that facilitate timely government responses to interdiction scenarios

Examples of these capacity building tools include:

• Model Legislation

• Commodity identification guides and associated training

• Legal analyses of UN Security Council Resolutions

• Expert briefings on inspection methodologies

• Best practices associated with information sharing and decision-making procedures

The CCP effort is advanced by the CCP Review Team, launched in 2015.  The Review Team seeks to enhance the resources available to PSI endorsing countries through compiling a library of tools and resources and through assisting in the coordination of capacity building events and exercises.  Review Team members include: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, and the United States.

==Interdictions and Events==
The PSI has no central body or secretariat and is not a coordinator of real-world interdictions.  It is a political commitment, a flexible arrangement of international cooperation and is consistent with domestic and international legal authorities. Endorsing states seek a robust capacity to conduct interdictions that usually involve only two or three governments.
 
* On December 9, 2002 the {{ship|SPS|Navarra}} intercepted and boarded the freighter ''So San'', several hundred miles southeast of Yemen at the request of the U.S. government as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The ''So San'', sailing without a flag, attempted evasive action, so the ''Navarra'' after firing four warning shots into the water at the bow of the ship and rifle fire on the ship's hull, getting no answer, fired on a cable crossing the ''So San'' from bow to stern to remove obstacles and proceeded to approach it from a helicopter. The ship from North Korea was carrying a cargo of 15 [[Scud]] missiles, 15 conventional warheads with 250&amp;nbsp;kg of high explosive, 23 fuel tanks of nitric acid and 85 drums of chemicals. Yemen subsequently reported that the cargo belonged to them and protested against interception, ordering the materials returned.&lt;ref name=nyt-20021212&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/12/world/threats-responses-war-materiel-reluctant-us-gives-assent-for-missiles-go-yemen.html |title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: WAR MATERIEL; Reluctant U.S. Gives Assent For Missiles to Go to Yemen |author=David E. Sanger, Thom Shanker|newspaper=New York Times |date=12 December 2002 |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this incident occurred prior to the establishment of the PSI, it is cited as being a major reason for the PSI's establishment.
*In September 2003, Germany obtained information that the BBC China, an [[Antigua and Barbuda]]-flagged vessel, was transporting nuclear-related materials to [[Libya]] as on behalf of the [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] proliferation network. The German government dispatched intelligence experts to Italy, who conducted an inspection of the ship in the Mediterranean with the support of the US Navy. The inspection revealed that the ship's container number was fabricated and the German government confiscated the nuclear-related equipment (aluminum tubes that can be converted into [[centrifuge]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.go.jp/e/publ/w_paper/pdf/2007/39Part3_Chap3_Sec3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although some sources cite this interdiction as an early success of the PSI, others dispute the initiative's relationship to this event.
*In an embarrassing "failure" of the PSI, in April 2005 Germany authorized the export of a high-tech crane aboard the vessel Hual Africa that could be utilized in [[Iran]]'s [[Shahab-4]] missile program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,353917,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2009, the North Korean vessel Kang Nam believed to be headed to [[Myanmar]] turned around after being tracked by the US Navy.  In the same timeframe, two Japanese and one Korean man were arrested for trying to import WMD technology to Myanmar.  After this incident, North Korea claimed that it would engage in military action in retaliation for any searching of its ships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvb.no/news/north-korean-ship-makes-u-turn/2714&lt;/ref&gt;
*On September 22, 2009, South Korea seized North Korean containers transiting the port of [[Busan]] which contained protective clothing used to protect against chemical weapons.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40684.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*In December 2009, [[Thailand]] stopped a North Korean shipment of mixed conventional arms and missile technology, based on information from US intelligence, which had been tracking the shipment since it departed [[Pyongyang]]. The ultimate planned destination of the materials was not determined, but it was thought to be heading towards Iran (to eventually arm [[Hezbollah]] or [[Hamas]]) or potentially [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/world/asia/14thai.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Thomas | last1=Fuller | first2=David E. | last2=Sanger | title=Officials Seek Destination of North Korean Arms | date=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months later, in February 2010 [[South Africa]] ordered the return of a shipment of North Korean military equipment to the port of [[Durban]], ostensibly declared as heading to the [[Congo Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/world/asia/26nations.html | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | title=North Korean Military Parts Were Intercepted, U.N. Says | date=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2011, the [[New York Times]] reported on the turning around of the Belize-flagged North Korean Vessel MV Light, suspected of transporting missile technology to Myanmar. The [[USS McCampbell (DDG-85)|USS McCampbell]] intercepted the ship and requested boarding, which was refused by the vessel operator despite the granting of authority from Belize, consistent with the US-Belize ship boarding agreement (see History above). The failure of the North Korean crew to comply with the orders of its flag arguably made it a "stateless" vessel under international maritime law, however the ship was allowed to return to North Korea. Although the materials were not "interdicted" or even inspected to verify a violation, the fact that the commodity never reached its planned target arguably made it a "success" for PSI.&lt;ref&gt;http://rolandsanjuan.blogspot.com/2011/06/maritime-counter-proliferation-case-of.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercises==
PSI activities include the regular holding of activities known as "exercises," which aim to test the authorities and capabilities of endorsee nations to interdict WMD-related materials. Exercises can include "live action" events such as ship boardings or container searches, or be limited to "tabletop" activities where subject matter experts explore legal and operational interdiction questions related to a fictional scenario. Recent PSI exercises have included:

•PHOENIX EXPRESS 2012 (May), a US-led maritime exercise, with a PSI inject, held in the Mediterranean Sea

•PACIFIC SHIELD 2012 (July), a dedicated PSI exercise hosted by Japan, featuring an air scenario

•PANAMAX 2012 (Aug), a joint U.S./Panama maritime exercise with a PSI inject

•EASTERN ENDEAVOR 2012 (Sep), a dedicated PSI exercise hosted by South Korea, featuring a maritime scenario

•Eastern European PSI Workshop (Nov 2012), hosted by Moldova, featuring a ground-based scenario

•LEADING EDGE 2013 (Feb), a joint UAE/US dedicated PSI exercise featuring air, maritime and ground interdiction activities

•SAHARAN EXPRESS 2013 (Mar), a US-led maritime exercise with a PSI inject, held off the West Coast of Africa

==Criticism==

===Legality===
Critics of PSI, such as China, [[Iran]] and the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK), argue that the declared intent of PSI members to stop ships on the high seas is a violation of international law guaranteeing freedom of the seas. In particular, it's argued that Article 23 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) allows ships "carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances" the right of innocent passage through territorial seas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2505.html&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have asserted that the PSI gives states a license to carry out acts of "piracy" on the high seas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anti-imperialist.org/korea-piracy_9-16-03.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued the PSI's intent to "interdict nuclear materials and contraband" is a broad enough charter to include any naval operation anywhere and for any actual purpose. There are concerns that such actions could lead to war.&lt;ref&gt;http://world.mediamonitors.net/Headlines/Proliferation-Security-Initiative-and-the-US-1-000-Ship-Navy-Control-of-the-World-s-Oceans-Prelude-to-War&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia's Foreign Minister [[Hassan Wirajuda]] argued that the PSI "initiative was not initiated through a multilateral process, but only a group of nations that have a common goal to conduct a certain initiatives." He also believed that PSI violates the UNCLOS. (Xinhua News Agency, March 17, 2006). Other critics have argued that PSI activities violate international laws regarding self-defense, Articles 19 and 88 of UNCLOS.&lt;ref&gt;https://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/lrv_issues_v35n02_i01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A large proportion of criticisms of the legality of PSI come from Indian news sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers10%5Cpaper969.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idsa.in/strategicanalysis/IndiasParticipationintheProliferationSecurityInitiative_avkumar_2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-08-25/india/27993487_1_present-sanctuaries-terrorist-movements-counter-terrorism-measures | work=The Times Of India | title=India's fears of terror-via-sea real: US | date=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism over the legality of PSI also focus around the fact that the initiative does not fall under any United Nations committee or body, and that doing so might legitimize it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/forum/security/08043Valencia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Targets specific states===

Many of academic and news articles about the initiative state that the PSI is focused specifically on states such as Iran and the DPRK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/governance/psi/BP53%5B1%5D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  North Korea has stated that it feels the PSI is an instrument for an aggressive war planned by the United States against the DPRK under the pretext of blockading ships and planes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200905/news27/20090527-17ee.html&lt;/ref&gt; Indian publications discouraging participation in PSI have defined PSI as being specifically directed towards Iran and have stated that "India on no account should be a part of any anti-Iranian strategic initiative led by the United States."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers10%5Cpaper969.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Other potential suggested targets of PSI have included [[Syria]], Myanmar, and Pakistan.

Despite these accusations and perceptions, all official PSI documentation and press releases state that PSI does not target any particular state, and that individual nations within the initiative are able to make self-determinations on what shipments are targeted. Several PSI-endorsee states have diplomatic and trade relationships with Iran, the DPRK, and other states suggested as likely targets.

===Perception as a "US-led" initiative===

The preponderance of news sources and academic analysis on the initiative often describe PSI as being a "US-led" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-n-koreas-nuclear-test-south-korea-jo/466266/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_list/en/99.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacewar.com/reports/North_Korea_Blasts_Seoul_Over_US_Led_Sea_Drills_999.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/13/stories/2004011301331300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Singapore joins U.S.-led security initiative | date=January 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1586&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the issue of whether PSI targets specific states, participants in the initiative itself explicitly deny that it is an effort "led" by the United States and that PSI is truly defined by the nonproliferation activities of endorsing nations.

Much early criticism of the initiative also explicitly linked PSI to other international activities of the globally controversial [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], including namely the [[War on Terror]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] to overthrow the [[Taliban]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]],  and a general international perception of US [[unilateralism]] outside of United Nations frameworks. Domestically in the United States, [[Progressivism in the United States|liberal]] critics referenced the PSI and its links to Under-Secretary Bolton as an extension of the Bush Administration's "[[Coalition of the willing]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://antiwar.com/prather/?articleid=9686&lt;/ref&gt;  However, over time much of these criticisms have subsided as PSI activities grew to have large [[bipartisan]] support&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34327.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States Congress]] and the PSI continued to be promoted under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama]].

With President Obama's continued promotion of the initiative and commitment to expand and institutionalize it, many initial opponents of the initiative have reduced their negative comments and begun efforts to explore joining the initiative in order to be recognized as a player in global non-proliferation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=4919&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of transparency===

Some criticism of PSI has been pointed towards the "secretive" nature of the initiative. It has been argued that "the secretiveness surrounding PSI interdictions and the methods employed make it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness or its legitimacy,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/forum/security/08043Valencia.html&lt;/ref&gt; and that the lack of formality and structure in the initiative are causes for concern.&lt;ref&gt;https://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/lrv_issues_v35n02_i01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2006 speech, then-Undersecretary of State [[Robert Joseph]] claimed that between April 2005 and April 2006 the United States had cooperated with other PSI participants on "roughly two dozen" occasions to prevent transfers of concern; and in May 2005 Ulrik Federspiel, [[Denmark]]’s ambassador to the United States, asserted that "the shipment of missiles has fallen significantly in the lifetime of PSI."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI&lt;/ref&gt;  However, references such as these provide no actual information on or evidence of interdictions which have occurred, leaving critics to remain skeptical of such numbers or of any "metrics" that prove the effectiveness of the initiative.

While these criticisms persist, many PSI events, such as annual Operational Experts Group meetings, contain a very high degree of civil society participation.  Think tanks and industry representatives, for instance, participated in the 2016 Operational Experts Group meeting and were permitted to Tweet throughout.

===Responses to criticism===

Much of the criticism about the PSI have been faced with counter-arguments, given the inaccurate or outdated nature of much of the information about the initiative. The most common negative portrayal of PSI represents it as an illegal, US-led effort to interdict third party vessels on the high seas. PSI proponents have countered that:

*United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540|1540]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sc/1540/&lt;/ref&gt; places an international obligation on all Members of the UN to take action against the proliferation of WMD, and its language matches closely with the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles.
*UNSCRs [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|1874]] (on the DPRK's WMD program) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929|1929]] (on Iran's WMD program) explicitly call on or require UN Members to take interdiction and inspection actions against WMD-related materials that are consistent with PSI's principles. Thus inspection of such vessels are international mandates rather than "piracy," as accused by DPRK and Iran.
*Article 4 of the [[2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]] illegalize the illicit transfer of WMD-related materials by maritime vessel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stimson.org/proliferation-security-initiative-/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2010 [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) "[[Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation]]" and "[[Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]" illegalize the illicit transfer of WMD-related materials by aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icao.int/icao/en/jr/2011/6601_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Contrary to comments that the PSI works "outside" of international frameworks such as the United Nations, UN officials including [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] have "applaud[ed] the efforts of the Proliferation Security Initiative to fill a gap in our defenses."&lt;ref&gt;http://npsglobal.org/eng/component/content/article/147-articles/304-the-proliferation-security-initiative-psi-alberto-dojas-.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2004, the PSI was "expanded" beyond a military and intelligence effort to include greater cooperation with law enforcement entities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nti.org/e_research/source_docs/us/congress/congressional_research_service/88.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PSI has largely evolved from a focus on interdiction of ships at sea to [[Customs|inspection in ports]].&lt;ref&gt;http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/38north_SR_PSI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vast majority of PSI exercises (see exercises section above) include activities involving customs services, law enforcement officials, and focus on cargo traveling by air and land as well as sea - including cargo transiting within a country's territory. This directly contradicts the common perceptions of PSI as military, maritime or [[International waters|high seas]]-focused.
* As noted within the PSI principles, PSI is an "activity, not an organization"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI&lt;/ref&gt; and grants no state any additional authorities to take action. All states are merely asked to take actions consistent with domestic and international law. Therefore, PSI as an initiative explicitly recommends only actions within international and domestic legal authorities.
* A large portion of states which have been critical of PSI consider themselves part of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which indicates that while nominally claiming objections to the initiative for "legal" reasons, actual hesitation towards endorsement might be more aligned with political considerations, such as not wanting to be seen as supporting United States or "[[Western world#Modern political|Western]]" initiatives.
*China's objections for supposed legal reasons also come into question, as it has been identified as a neighboring country which has supported transshipment of DPRK's WMD materials, and "turns a blind eye to North Korea’s proliferation whenever it can get away with it."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110516_4732.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freekorea.us/2011/06/14/another-north-korean-vessel-intercepted-turned-around/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9937">The '''right to housing''' is the [[economic, social and cultural right]] to adequate [[house|housing]] and shelter. It is recognised in some [[Economic, social and cultural rights#National constitutions|national constitutions]] and in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

== Definition ==
The right to housing is recognised in a number of [[international human rights instruments]]. Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] recognises the right to housing as part of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]].&lt;ref name="Edgar2002"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Edgar| first = Bill |author2=Doherty, Joe |author3=Meert, Henk| title = Access to housing: homelessness and vulnerability in Europe| publisher = [[The Policy Press]]| year = 2002| pages = 17| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pxFjtTWFJlYC&amp;dq=right+to+housing+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-86134-482-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It states that:

{{Cquote|Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.}}

Article 11(1) of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) also guarantees the right to housing as part of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]].&lt;ref name="Edgar2002" /&gt;

In [[international human rights law]] the right to housing is regarded as a freestanding right. This was clarified in the 1991 General Comment no 4 on Adequate Housing by the [[UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general comment provides an authoritative interpretation of the right to housing in legal terms under international law.&lt;ref name="Edgar2002" /&gt;

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]] on the application of [[international human rights law]] in relation to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] affirm that "everyone has the right to adequate housing, including protection from [[eviction]], without discrimination and that States shall a) take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure security of tenure and access to [[Affordable housing|affordable]], habitable, accessible, culturally appropriate and safe housing, not including shelters and other emergency accommodation, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or material or family status; b) take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to prohibit the execution of evictions that are not in conformity with their international human rights obligations, and ensure that adequate and effective legal or other appropriate remedies are available to any person claiming that a right to protection against forced evictions has been violated or is under threat of violation, including the right to resettlement, which includes the right to alternative land of better or equal quality and to adequate housing, without discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 15. The Right to Adequate Housing&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to housing is also enshrined in Article 28 of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 16 of the [[European Social Charter]] (Article 31 of the Revised European Social charter) and in the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serac.org/African%20Commn%20Communication%20and%20Decision.doc ACHR decision in case SERAC v. Nigeria - see para. 60 (p. 25)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68Cljyd8C?url=http://www.serac.org/African%20Commn%20Communication%20and%20Decision.doc |date=2012-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, aspects of right to housing under ICESCR include: legal security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location and cultural adequacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/469f4d91a9378221c12563ed0053547e?Opendocument The right to adequate housing (Art.11 (1)). CESCR General comment 4 - see para. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; As a political goal, right to housing was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the [[Second Bill of Rights]].

The [http://housing.urv.cat/en/cover/research/project/tenlaw/ TENLAW project] provided a more efficient opportunity to international and interdisciplinary research in the housing and property field. It created the first housing chair at the University Rovira i Virgili (Spain) on July 11, 2013, which opened up possibilities for research and dissemination in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00553|title=Providing a more efficent opportunity to international and interdisciplinary research in the housing and property field.

== UN Habitat ==
The right to adequate housing was a key issue at the 1996 Habitat meeting in Istanbul and a main theme in the [[Istanbul Agreement and Habitat Agenda]]. Paragraph 61 of the agenda identifies the steps required by governments to "promote, protect and ensure the full and progressive realisation of the right to adequate housing". The 2001 Habitat meeting, known as Istanbul +5, reaffirmed the 1996 Istanbul Agreement and Habitat Agenda and established the [[UN Human Settlement Programme]] to promote the right to housing in cooperation with the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. Known as [[UN–HABITAT]], the programme is the most important international forum for the right to housing. It is tasked with promoting housing rights through awareness campaigns, and to develop benchmarks and monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="Edgar2002" /&gt;

== Implementations ==

=== South Africa ===

In [[South Africa]], section 26 of [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa|Chapter Two of the Constitution]] establishes that "everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing". The [[Department of Human Settlements]] is tasked with implementing this mandate. Based on recent data, around 3.6 million South Africans still live in shacks or informal settlements (2013 data),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehda.co.za/uploads/files/HDA_South_Africa_Report_lr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while it is estimated that around 200,000 are homeless or living on the streets (2015 data).&lt;ref&gt;http://wp.wpi.edu/capetown/projects/p2015/service-dining-rooms/background/homelessness-in-south-africa/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Daily Caller''''' is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] American news and opinion website based in [[Washington, D.C.]] It was founded by political pundit [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Neil Patel (political advisor)|Neil Patel]] in 2010.

== History ==
''The Daily Caller'' was founded by [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Neil Patel (political advisor)|Neil Patel]]. After raising $3 million in funding from businessman [[Foster Friess]], the website was launched on January 11, 2010. The organization started with a reporting staff of 21 in its Washington office. It was launched as an alternative to the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', similarly featuring sections in broad range of subjects beyond politics.

By late 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the site had quadrupled its page view and total audience and had become profitable without ever buying an advertisement for itself.&lt;ref name="Stelter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/business/media/tucker-carlson-angles-for-daily-caller-clicks-not-fights.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Still a Conservative Provocateur, Carlson Angles for Clicks, Not Fights|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=October 7, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, the site was receiving over 35 million views a month according to Quantcast, surpassing rival sites such as ''[[The Washington Times]]'', [[Politico]], and [[Forbes]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Caller"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Daily Caller|url = http://dailycaller.com/advertise/|website = The Daily Caller|access-date = February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has an active community, with over 200,000 comments made each month.

Notable figures have commented on ''The Daily Caller''. [[Karl Rove]] has said that "''The Daily Caller'' is necessary reading for anyone who wants to be up to speed with what's going on with politics in America." [[Lawrence Kudlow|Larry Kudlow]] referred to the site as "one of [his] faves."&lt;ref name="The Daily Caller"/&gt;

''The Daily Caller'' also hosts ''The Mirror'', a blog written by former FishbowlDC editor and ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' columnist Betsy Rothstein. ''The Mirror'' covers [[Media in Washington, D.C.|media in Washington D.C.]], news related to journalism organizations, as well as political and media related gossip.

== Political stance ==
When it first launched in January 2010, [[Mercedes Bunz]], writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said ''The Daily Caller'' was "setting itself up to be the conservative answer to ''[[The Huffington Post]]''". According to Bunz, a year before the website launched, Carlson promoted it as "a new political website leaning more to the right than ''[[Politico]]'' and ''[[TalkingPointsMemo]]''". However, at launch, he wrote a letter to readers that said it was not going to be a right-wing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bunz|first=Mercedes|title=The Daily Caller: the conservative answer to the Huffington Post|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jan/11/daily-caller-tucker-carlson|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 11, 2010|location=London|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a January 2010 interview with ''Politico'', Carlson said ''The Daily Caller'' was not going to be tied to his personal political ideologies and that he wanted it to be "breaking stories of importance".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=January 11, 2010|title=Tucker: 'Conventional journalism is no safer than a start-up'|first=Michael|last=Calderone|work=Politico|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0110/Tucker_Conventional_journalism_is_no_safer_than_a_startup.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article about ''The Caller''{{'}}s launch, [[Howard Kurtz]] wrote, "[Carlson's] partner is Neil Patel, a former Dick Cheney aide. His opinion editor is Moira Bagley, who spent 2008 as the Republican National Committee's press secretary. And his $3 million in funding comes from Wyoming financier Foster Friess, a big-time GOP donor. But Carlson insists this won't be a right-wing site". Kurtz quoted Carlson as saying, "We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011100892.html |first=Howard|last=Kurtz |title=Tucker's excellent adventure |work=The Washington Post |date=January 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Carlson said that the vast majority of traditional reporting comes from a liberal point of view and called  ''The Daily Caller''{{'}}s reporting "the balance against the rest of the conventional press".&lt;ref name="Stelter"/&gt;

In a 2012 ''[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' article, Tom Bartlett said Carlson and Patel developed ''The Daily Caller'' as "a conservative news site in the mold of the liberal ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' but with more firearms coverage and fewer nipple-slip slide shows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Tom|title=The Bearable Lightness of Being Tucker Carlson|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2012/11/26/the-bearable-lightness-of-being-tucker-carlson|work=The Washingtonian|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Caller'' has published a number of articles that dispute the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-caller-uncritically-reports-misleading-satellite-temperature-study-michael-bastasch/|title=Daily Caller uncritically reports poorly supported conclusion of satellite temperature study|date=December 4, 2017|work=Climate Feedback|access-date=July 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story saying that a "peer-reviewed study" by "two scientists and a veteran statistician" found that recent years have not been the warmest ever.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/climatology-fraud-global-warming/|title=FACT CHECK: Peer-Reviewed Study Proves All Recent Global Warming Fabricated by Climatologists?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=July 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/05/exclusive-study-finds-temperature-adjustments-account-for-nearly-all-of-the-warming-in-climate-data/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170706143558/http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/05/exclusive-study-finds-temperature-adjustments-account-for-nearly-all-of-the-warming-in-climate-data/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 6, 2017|title=Study Targets Adjusted Climate Data {{!}} The Daily Caller|date=July 6, 2017|work=archive.is|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged "study" was a PDF file on a WordPress blog, and was not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Also in 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' uncritically published a bogus ''Daily Mail'' story which claimed that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manipulated data to make climate change appear worse; at the same time, legitimate news outlets debunked the ''Daily Mail'' story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/25/the-mails-censure-shows-which-media-outlets-are-biased-on-climate-change|title=The Mail's censure shows which media outlets are biased on climate change {{!}} Dana Nuccitelli|last=Nuccitelli|first=Dana|date=September 25, 2017|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2017/02/07/bogus-daily-mail-story-spearheads-latest-right-wing-assault-climate-change-science/215257|title=Bogus Daily Mail Story Spearheads Latest Right-Wing Assault On Climate Change Science|date=February 7, 2017|work=Media Matters for America|access-date=July 19, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/05/noaa-scientists-manipulated-temperature-data-to-make-global-warming-seem-worse/|title=Whistleblower: NOAA Scientists Manipulated Temperature Data To Make Global Warming Seem Worse|website=dailycaller.com|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story claiming that a study found no evidence of accelerating temperatures over a 23-year period, which climate scientists described as a misleading story.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2016, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story claiming that climate scientist [[Michael E.

=== Misleading video about NPR ===
In 2011, ''The Daily Caller'' was the first news outlet to disseminate a video by conservative provocateur James O'Keefe which purportedly showed an NPR fundraiser deriding Republicans. The video was later proven to have been misleadingly edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.cjr.org/feature/the_great_right_hype.php|title=The Great Right Hype|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False prostitution allegations ===
In March 2013 ''The Daily Caller'' posted interviews with two women claiming that New Jersey [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Bob Menendez]] had paid them for sex while he was a guest of a campaign donor.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Mathew (November 1, 2012) [http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/01/women-sen-bob-menendez-paid-us-for-sex-in-the-dominican-republic/#ixzz2NSZkGg33 "Women: Sen. Bob Menendez paid us for sex in the Dominican Republic"]. ''The Daily Caller''. Retrieved March 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The allegation came five days before the [[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2012|2012 New Jersey senate election]].  News organizations such as [[ABC News]], which had also interviewed the women, the ''[[New York Times]]'', and the ''[[New York Post]]'' declined to publish the allegations, viewing them as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility.&lt;ref name="abc-says"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = ABC News | title = Woman Says She Was Paid to Lie About Claim of Sex With Senator Menendez | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/woman-paid-lie-claim-sex-senator-menendez/story?id=18653773 | accessdate = March 13, 2013 | date = March 5, 2013 | first = Rhonda | last = Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-partisan"&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/nyregion/partisan-push-led-to-troubling-revelations-about-senator-menendez.html | accessdate = March 13, 2013 | date = February 16, 2013 | first = Eric | last = Lipton | title = Inquiry on Democratic Senator Started With a Partisan Push}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic-post"&gt;{{cite web | work = The Atlantic | url = http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/03/only-daily-caller-thought-daily-callers-scoop-was-scoop/62906/ | title = Daily Caller's Prostitution 'Scoop' Was So Thin Even the 'New York Post' Passed | first = Philip | last = Bump | accessdate = March 13, 2013 | date = March 8, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/03/only-daily-caller-thought-daily-callers-scoop-was-scoop/62906/ | archivedate = June 30, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, one of the women who accused Menendez stated that she had been paid to falsely implicate the senator and had never met him.&lt;ref name="abc-says"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-madeup"&gt;{{cite news | work = Washington Post | title = Escort says Menendez prostitution claims were made up | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/escort-says-menendez-prostitution-claims-were-made-up/2013/03/04/31299fe2-8514-11e2-999e-5f8e0410cb9d_story.html | last=Leonnig | first = Carol D. | authorlink = Carol D.

A few weeks later, police in the Dominican Republic announced that three women had claimed they were paid $300–425 each to lie about having had sex with Menendez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dominican police: Three women lied about sex with Menendez|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/03/18/dominican-police-three-women-lied-about-sex-with-menendez/|first=Vince|last=Coglianese|agency=Associated Press|date=March 18, 2013|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate= March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominican law enforcement also alleged that the women had been paid to lie about Menendez by an individual claiming to work for ''The Daily Caller''.

=== Fox News controversy ===
In March 2015 ''The Daily Caller'' columnist [[Mickey Kaus]] quit after editor [[Tucker Carlson]] refused to run a column critical of [[Fox News]] coverage of the immigration policy debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/mickey-kaus-quits-daily-caller-after-tucker-carlson-204135.html|title=Mickey Kaus quits Daily Caller after Tucker Carlson pulls critical Fox News column|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|date=March 17, 2015|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson, who also works for Fox, reportedly did not want ''The Daily Caller'' publishing criticism of a firm that employed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/18/daily-callers-tucker-carlson-takes-a-stand-for-censorship/|title=Daily Caller’s Tucker Carlson takes a stand for censorship|last1=Wemple|first1=Erik|date=March 18, 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Neil Munro quit two weeks later and Carlson said he was not going to go to work for Breitbart. However, He started writing for Breitbard four months later and has remained there, as of November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/neil-munro-reporter-who-heckled-obama-out-at-daily-204792.html|title=Neil Munro, reporter who heckled Obama, out at Daily Caller|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|date=March 31, 2015|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 presidential election ===
According to a study by [[Harvard University|Harvard University's]] [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society]], ''The Daily Caller'' was among the most popular sites on the right during the 2016 presidential election. The study also found that ''The Daily Caller'' provided "amplification and legitimation" for "the most extreme conspiracy sites", such as Truthfeed, Infowars, Gateway Pundit and Conservative Treehouse during the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/08/22/trump-backers-disturbing-reliance-on-hoax-and-conspiracy-theory-websites-in-1-chart/|title=Analysis {{!}} Trump backers’ alarming reliance on hoax and conspiracy theory websites, in 1 chart|last=https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts|website=Washington Post|access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yochai|first=Benkler,|last2=Hal|first2=Roberts,|last3=M.|first3=Faris, Robert|last4=Bruce|first4=Etling,|last5=Ethan|first5=Zuckerman,|last6=Nikki|first6=Bourassa,|date=2017|title=Partisanship, Propaganda, and Disinformation: Online Media and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:33759251|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/partisan-right-wing-websites-shaped-mainstream-press-coverage-before-2016-election-berkman-klein-study-finds/|title=Partisan right-wing websites shaped mainstream press coverage before 2016 election, Berkman Klein study finds|date=August 16, 2017|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=August 23, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Caller'' also "employed anti-immigrant narratives that echoed sentiments from the alt-right and white nationalists but without the explicitly racist and pro-segregation language."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; ''The Daily Caller'' also played a significant role in creating and disseminating stories that had little purchase outside the right-wing media ecosystem but that stoked the belief among core Trump followers that what Clinton did was not merely questionable but criminal and treasonous. In a campaign that expressed deep anti-Muslim sentiment, a repeated theme was that Hillary Clinton was seriously in hock to Muslim nations.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In one of its most frequently shared stories, ''The Daily Caller'' falsely asserted that Morocco's King Mohammed VI flew Bill Clinton on a private jet, and that this had been omitted from the Clinton Foundation's tax disclosures.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; ''The Daily Caller'' also made the "utterly unsubstantiated and unsourced claim" that Hillary Clinton got Environmental Protection Agency "head Lisa Jackson to try to shut down Mosaic Fertilizer, described as America’s largest phosphate mining company, in exchange for a $15 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from King Mohammed VI of Morocco, ostensibly to benefit Morocco’s state-owned phosphate company."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

=== Encouragement of violence against protesters ===
In January 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' posted a video which encouraged violence against protesters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/15/media/daily-caller-fox-news-video-car-crashing-liberal-protesters/index.html|title=Fox News, Daily Caller delete posts encouraging people to drive through protests|last=Kludt|first=Tom|date=August 15, 2017|website=CNNMoney|access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20170815_ap_15c507df08d54afb9597b9c1b59271c7.html|title=Fox removes video with cars plowing through demonstrators|work=Philly.com|access-date=August 16, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816005603/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20170815_ap_15c507df08d54afb9597b9c1b59271c7.html|archivedate=August 16, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/2017/08/16/daily-caller-fox-news-delete-video-celebrating-liberal-protesters-getting-pushed-way-cars/|title=Daily Caller, Fox News Delete Video Celebrating 'Liberal Protesters' Getting 'Pushed Out of the Way by Cars'|date=August 16, 2017|website=Snopes.com|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/business/media/charlottesville-deadly-protest-media.html|title=Where Is the Line?

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] subsequently criticized ''The Daily Caller'', saying that it had a "white nationalist problem".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/08/16/daily-caller-has-white-nationalist-problem|title=The Daily Caller has a White Nationalist Problem|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=August 18, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPLC also said that two other contributors to ''The Daily Caller'' had ties to white nationalist groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It later retracted its claim that Richard Pollock, a devout Jew, was a white nationalist, saying "Pollock was initially included in this story" but "there is no evidence to suggest Mr. Pollock is otherwise a white nationalist."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Ties to white supremacists ===
In August 2018, ''The Atlantic'' reported that Scott Greer, then deputy editor of ''The Daily Caller'', had written pieces under a pseudonym in the white supremacist publication ''Radix Journal'' from 2014 to 2015''.'' In articles for ''Radix Journal'', Greer expressed white nationalist views, as well as racist anti-black and antisemitic views. While in his emails and messages, he expressed anti-Christian and antisemitic theories, as well his relationship with Richard Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/a-daily-caller-editor-wrote-for-an-alt-right-website-using-a-pseudonym/569335/?utm_source=twb|title=A Daily Caller Editor Wrote for an ‘Alt-Right’ Website Using a Pseudonym|last=Gray|first=Rosie|date=September 5, 2018|work=The Atlantic|access-date=September 6, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being confronted with his past white supremacist writings, Greer resigned from any affiliation with ''The Daily Caller''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/a-daily-caller-editor-wrote-for-an-alt-right-website-using-a-pseudonym/569335/?utm_source=twb|title=A Daily Caller Editor Wrote for an ‘Alt-Right’ Website Using a Pseudonym|last=Gray|first=Rosie|date=September 5, 2018|work=The Atlantic|access-date=September 6, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it had been revealed, Scott Greer  had ties to members of the white nationalist movement, including friendships with Devin Saucier, assistant to Jared Taylor of American Renaissance, and anti-immigrant activist Marcus Epstein, who pled guilty to assaulting an African American woman two years prior to the relationship with Scott Greer.&lt;ref name="salon1"&gt;[https://www.salon.com/2017/08/21/the-daily-caller-has-a-white-nationalist-problem_partner The Daily Caller has a white nationalist problem] August 21, 2017, STEPHEN PIGGOTT, ALEX AMEND, Salon&lt;/ref&gt; Greer had later deleted parts of his Facebook page, but is seen photographed with nationalists such as Tim Dionisopoulos and [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]], [[Wolves of Vinland]] and appears wearing clothes belonging to the group [[Youth for Western Civilization]].&lt;ref name="salon1"/&gt;  The Daily Caller itself subsequently stated, about why he had not been fired in 2017: “We had two choices: Fire a young man because of some photos taken of him at metal shows in college, or take his word. We chose to trust him. Now, if what you allege is accurate, we know that trust was a mistake, we know he lied to us. We won’t publish him, anyone in these circles, or anyone who thinks like them. People who associate with these losers have no business writing for our company.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/a-daily-caller-editor-wrote-for-an-alt-right-website-using-a-pseudonym/569335/?utm_source=twb|title=A Daily Caller Editor Wrote for an ‘Alt-Right’ Website Using a Pseudonym|last=Gray|first=Rosie|date=September 5, 2018|work=The Atlantic|access-date=September 6, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website has also published pieces by [[Peter Brimelow]], founder of the white supremacist website [[VDARE]].&lt;ref name="salon1"/&gt;

=== Heckling of Obama ===
In 2012, ''Daily Caller'' reporter Neil Munro interrupted Barack Obama during one of the President's press conferences, while Obama was giving remarks. Obama said, "The next time I prefer you let me finish my statements before you ask a question." Cutting off Munro's reply, Obama said, "I didn't ask for an argument."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/who-neil-munro-and-why-he-interrupting-president-united-states/326859/&lt;/ref&gt; Munro's interruption of remarks by the president was widely considered a startling breach of etiquette. Editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson defended Munro's hectoring, saying "As a general matter, reporters are there to ask [questions]" and that he was "proud" of Munro.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/tucker-carlson-defends-heckling-reporter-126302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/06/obama-interrupted-by-heckling-reporter-126301|title=Obama interrupted by heckling reporter|work=POLITICO|access-date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/06/15/obama-heckled-by-daily-caller-reporter-during-immigration-speech-in-rose-garden--|title=VIDEO: Obama Heckled By Daily Caller Reporter During Immigration Speech In Rose Garden|last=Flock|first=Elizabeth|date=June 15, 2012|website=U.S. News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/barack-obama-heckled-daily-caller-338367|title=Reporter Heckles President Obama, Asks Why He 'Favors Foreign Workers' (Video)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=May 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/jun/15/neil-munro-daily-caller-obama|title=Daily Caller reporter interrupts Obama's Rose Garden statement|last=Braiker|first=Brian|date=June 15, 2012|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munro later said in a statent that his intention was to ask questions after the president made his remarks but misjudged when the president was closing. "I timed the question believing the president was closing his remarks, because naturally I have no intention of interrupting the President of the United States. I know he rarely takes questions before walking away from the podium. When I asked the question as he finished his speech, he turned his back on the many reporters, and walked away while I and at least one other reporter asked questions."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/who-neil-munro-and-why-he-interrupting-president-united-states/326859/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/06/obama-interrupted-by-heckling-reporter-126301&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stefan Halper ===
''The Daily Caller'' was the first news outlet to report on Stefan Halper, a confidential FBI source, and his interactions with Trump campaign advisors [[Carter Page]] and [[George Papadopoulos]]. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] about campaign matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Tanfani |url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-former-trump-campaign-aide-george-1509374196-htmlstory.html |title=Former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying to the FBI agents in Mueller probe |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 12, 2018 |date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page became the subject of surveillance warrants issued by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] regarding his alleged contacts with Russian intelligence officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Beckwith |first1=Ryan Teague |last2=Abramson |first2=Alana |date=February 1, 2018 |title=Who Is Carter Page?

=== Allegation of non-profit abuse ===
According to Callum Borchers of ''the Washington Post'', ''the Daily Caller'' has "a peculiar business structure that enables it to increase revenue while reducing its tax obligation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/02/charity-doubles-as-a-profit-stream-at-the-daily-caller-news-foundation/|title=Analysis {{!}} Charity doubles as a profit stream at the Daily Caller News Foundation|last=Borchers|first=Callum|date=June 2, 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 18, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, a for-profit company, does this by relying on its charity arm, ''the Daily Caller'' News Foundation, to create the majority of its news content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exposedbycmd.org/tucker-carlson|title=Exposed: Tucker Carlson, His "Charity," and the Trump Campaign Cash He Didn't Tell FOX Viewers About - EXPOSEDbyCMD|date=June 1, 2017|work=EXPOSEDbyCMD|access-date=June 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lisa Graves, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration, the situation is “a huge rip-off for taxpayers if ''the Daily Caller'' News Foundation is receiving revenue that it doesn't pay taxes on, to produce stories that are used by the for-profit enterprise, which then makes money on the stories through ads.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/02/charity-doubles-as-a-profit-stream-at-the-daily-caller-news-foundation/|title=Analysis {{!}} Charity doubles as a profit stream at the Daily Caller News Foundation|last=Borchers|first=Callum|date=June 2, 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 19, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imran Awan ===
''The Daily Caller'' kept conspiracy theories surrounding [[Imran Awan]] alive with aggressive coverage.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/congressional-it-staffer-reaches-plea-deal-that-debunks-conspiracy-theories-about-illegal-information-access/2018/07/03/3f22786a-7e30-11e8-b0ef-fffcabeff946_story.html|title=Ex-congressional IT staffer reaches plea deal that debunks conspiracy theories about illegal information access|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/07/03/federal-prosecutors-debunk-conspiracy-theory-involving-ex-wasserman-schultz-aide/|title=Federal prosecutors debunk conspiracy theory involving ex-Wasserman Schultz aide|last=Leary|first=Alex|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=July 3, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imran Awan was an IT worker for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. ''The'' ''Daily Caller'' sought  to tie Awan to a wide range of alleged criminal activity, including unauthorized access to government servers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/feds-debunk-it-staffer-conspiracy-theory-pushed-by-the-1827322016|title=Feds Debunk IT Staffer Conspiracy Theory Pushed by The Daily Caller and Trump|last=Cameron|first=Dell|work=Gizmodo|access-date=July 3, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reporter behind the aggressive coverage of Awan told Fox News that the affair was "straight out of James Bond."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An 18-month investigation by federal prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing in Awan's work in the House and no support for the conspiracy theories about Awan. In the announcement of the conclusion of the investigation, investigators rebuked a litany of right-wing conspiracy theories about Awan.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Chinese email hacking ===
In August 2018, ''The Daily Caller'' ran a story alleging that a Chinese-owned company hacked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and successfully obtained nearly all of her emails. The Daily Caller cited “two sources briefed on the matter.” After publishing the story, President Trump tweeted the allegations made in ''Daily Caller''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s reporting. The FBI rebutted the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fbi-rebuts-trump-tweet-about-china-hacking-clinton-s-email-n904811|title=FBI rebuts Trump tweet about China hacking Hillary Clinton's email|work=NBC News|access-date=August 29, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Washington Post'', the claims are without evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-without-citing-evidence-says-china-hacked-hillary-clintons-emails/2018/08/29/cdbd6c60-ab71-11e8-8a0c-70b618c98d3c_story.html|title=Trump, without citing evidence, says China hacked Hillary Clinton’s emails|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Emperor Wears No Clothes''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Jack Herer]].  Starting in 1973, the story begins when Herer takes the advice of his friend, "Captain" Ed Adair, and begins compiling tidbits of information about the ''[[Cannabis]]'' plant and its numerous uses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herer, Jack|date=  1985|title=The Emperor Wears No Clothes|publisher=  Ah Ha Publishing|location= Van Nuys, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; including as [[hemp]] and as a [[Cannabis (drug)|drug]]. After a dozen years of collecting and compiling historical data, Herer first published his work as ''The Emperor Wears No Clothes'', in 1985.  The twelfth edition was published in November 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herer, Jack|date=2010|title=The Emperor Wears No Clothes|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book continues to be cited in Cannabis rescheduling and re-legalization efforts.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The book, backed by H.E.M.P. (United States), Hanf Haus (Germany), Sensi Seeds/[[Hash, Marihuana &amp; Hemp Museum]], [[Amsterdam]], (Netherlands), and T.H.C., the Texas Hemp Campaign (United States), offers $100,000 to anyone who can disprove the claims made within.  Quoting from the book's back cover:

{{quote|If all fossil fuels and their derivatives, as well as trees for paper and construction were banned in order to save the planet, reverse the [[Greenhouse Effect]] and stop [[deforestation]]; then there is only one known annually renewable natural resource that is capable of providing the overall majority of the world's [[paper]] and [[textile]]s; meet all of the world's transportation, industrial and home energy needs, while simultaneously reducing pollution, rebuilding the soil, and cleaning the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] all at the same time... and that substance is -- the same one that did it all before -- Cannabis Hemp... [[Marijuana]]!}}

The title of the book [[allusion|alludes]] to [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s classic fairy tale "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]" (1837).  Herer uses Andersen's story as an allegory for the current prohibition of Cannabis.

European expert on hemp and author of the doctoral thesis ''Crop physiology of fibre hemp'' (1994), Dr. Hayo M.G. van der Werf criticized the book for containing some inaccuracies, stating, "Although most of the information contained in the book is valid, some of its claims are clearly incorrect."&lt;ref name="Werf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://druglibrary.org/olsen/hemp/iha/iha01213.html |title=Hayo M.G. van der Werf : Hemp facts and hemp fiction |website=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of land use in Ireland, a '''townpark''' or '''town park''' was a [[smallholding]]  near a town and farmed by someone resident in the town.&lt;ref name="CrawfordFoy1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=W. H.|last2=Foy|first2=R. H.|title=Townlands in Ulster: Local History Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUY6GT1cJC4C&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=1998|publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation|isbn=9780901905840|page=97 |quote=Elsewhere in Ulster townlands so close to the town were often divided into small fields called townparks because they were let only to the townspeople.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a major landowner provided a contiguous area near the town which was subdivided into multiple townparks, each rented on a short-term lease, for a higher rent than that paid by a full-time resident farmer.

==Townlands==
The Boundary Survey of 1825–44, associated with [[Griffith's Valuation]] and the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]], set down the names and denominations of subdivisions of land. Griffith often erected a contiguous block of townparks into a single [[townland]] named "Town Parks" or "Town Parks of [name of town]". The 1901 townland index recorded such townlands by the following towns: [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]], [[Larne]], [[Ballymena]], [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]], [[Ballymoney]], [[Ballyhaise]], [[Cavan]], [[Cloyne]], [[Midleton]], [[Lifford]], [[Ballyshannon]], [[Newtownards]], [[Skerries, County Dublin|Skerries]] (Holmpatrick civil parish), [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Ballinasloe]], [[Galway]], [[Portumna]], [[Castledermot]], [[Athy]], [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], [[Daingean]] (then Philipstown), [[Carrick on Shannon]], [[Longford]], [[Newtown Forbes]], [[Ardee]], [[Dundalk]], [[Navan]], [[Athboy]], [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Borris-in-Ossory]], [[Mountmellick]], [[Roscrea]], [[Carrick-on-Suir]], [[Cahir]], [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], [[Delvin]], [[Wexford]], [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], [[Tallow, County Waterford|Tallow]], [[Tuam]], [[Donaghadee]], and [[Killeshandra]].&lt;ref name="townlands1901"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20(by%20date)/1901/Ireland&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=453&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=897 |title=1901 Census of Ireland: General topographical index |year=1904 |series=[[Command paper]]s |volume=Cd.2071 |publisher=HMSO |pages=886–7 |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also "Town Fields" ([[Borrisokane]]), "Town Lands" ([[Clonakilty]]), "Town Lot" ([[Tipperary (town)|Tipperary]]), "Town Lots" ([[Bantry]]), and "Townplots" ([[Kinsale]] and [[Killala]]).&lt;ref name="townlands1901"/&gt; Town Parks was also the townland containing the centre of [[Belfast]]; it is listed in the 1861 index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Alphabetical Index to the Townlands and Towns, Parishes, and Baronies of Ireland: Based on the Census of Ireland for the Year 1851 |series=Command papers |url=http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20(by%20date)/1861/Ireland&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=411&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=886 |year=1861 |page=874}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was entirely within the [[county borough]] boundary by 1901.&lt;ref name="townlands1901"/&gt; [[Thurles Townparks]] is the townland, now almost entirely urbanised, around the historic centre of [[Thurles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20(by%20date)/1901/Ireland&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=448&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=289 |title=Census of Ireland 1901; Area, houses, and population; Volume II: Munster; No.5: County of Tipperary |page=83 |chapter=VII.

==Land Acts==
The [[Irish Land Acts]] of 1870 and 1881, which were designed to enable [[tenant farmer]]s to purchase their holdings from landlords, specifically excluded townparks from their terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1870/en/act/pub/0046/sec0015.html|title=Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, Section 15 (1)|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1881/en/act/pub/0049/sec0058.html|title=Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, Section 58 (2)|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to [[case law]] interpreting the Acts' definition of "townpark",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stubbs|first=William Cotter |title=The Irish Law Times Digest of Cases 1867–1893 |url=https://archive.org/stream/irishlawtimesan00unkngoog#page/n328/mode/2up |year=1895 |publisher=John Falconer |location=Dublin |pages=cc268–274; §§214–252 |nopp=Y |chapter=Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had three components:
# That they adjoin or are near a city or town; 
# That they bear an increased value as accommodation land beyond their ordinary letting value for merely farming purposes
# That they are occupied by a person living in a city or town or its suburbs

A "town" need not be a [[municipality]] with [[town commissioners]] or other government, and conversely a place within the municipal boundary might yet be too far from the built-up area to be considered a townpark.  Population was suggestive but not definitive: [[Portglenone]] with 800 people was held not to be a "town", whereas [[Timoleague]] was, with only 366.

{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}

In [[information security]], '''transshipment''' is a technique for protecting software services and applications by ensuring they only receive data that they are known to be able to handle safely. The term is analogous to that in the [[Transshipment|logistics industry]] where cargo is offloaded from one means of transport and on to another at a port of entry. With transshipment, [[information]] is extracted from the [[data]] used to send it and then encoded as data that can be handled safely.

== Method ==

With transshipment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deep-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/Transshipment-–-giving-safe-passage-to-business-information.pdf Transshipment - giving safe passage to business information]&lt;/ref&gt; messages are intercepted and the business information they carry is extracted. This information is then encoded in a new message using a data format that the receiving application can safely handle.

== Example ==

For example, an email client may be known to handle messages with a simple structure without failure but not the full generality allowed by the standards. Transshipment can then be used to protect the mail client from attackers who can exploit weaknesses in its ability to handle the general case. The transshipment process extracts the business information in the email messages and creates a new message that conveys the same information but using simple structures. So the mail client is protected without knowing details of any weaknesses in its implementation.

== Implementation ==

The transshipment function must handle any and all data sent to it by potential attackers. To be useful the function must be implemented without it being [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerable]] to attack. This can be achieved by using [[Guard (information security)|Guard]] technology that separates the implementation into three parts - a destination proxy that interacts with the message originator and extracts the business information from messages, a verifier and a source proxy that creates a new message to carry the business information and interacts with the message recipient. The verifier's role is to ensure that the source proxy is only presented with the business information using the simple data format it is expecting. As a result, the [[attack surface]] is limited to the verifier's interface and that part of the source proxy's interface which is visible through the verifier.

== Advantages ==

Unlike [[antivirus software]] the use of transshipment defends against unknown attacks, and hence [[zero-day attack]]s, and does not require routine updates to signatures or [[Heuristic]]s.

The '''Vyapam scam''' was an [[entrance examination]], admission and recruitment [[scam]] that was unearthed in the [[India]]n state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dangerous Corruption in India|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/opinion/dangerous-corruption-in-india.html|work=nytimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved scamsters including politicians, senior and junior officials and businessmen systematically employing imposters to write papers, manipulate exam hall seating arrangements and supply forged answer sheets by bribing officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25 mystery deaths and 2,000 arrests: All about MP's Vyapam scam|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/25-mystery-deaths-and-2-000-arrests-all-about-mp-s-vyapam-scam/story-Y3dLEQdkEsVyCwuPQXxaXI.html|accessdate=8 November 2017|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBI FILES A CHARGESHEET AGAINST 592 ACCUSED PERSONS IN A CASE RELATING TO ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES IN PMT-2012 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED BY VYAPAM|url=http://cbi.nic.in/pressreleases/pr_2017-11-23-1.php|website=cbi.nic.in|publisher=Central Bureau of Investigation, India|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scam involved 13 different exams conducted by Vyapam, for selection of medical students and state government employees (including food inspectors, transport constables, police personnel, school teachers, dairy supply officers and forest guards) where the final results were rigged. The exams were taken by around 3.2 million students each year, many of whom were actually paid proxies for other undeserving students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/the-mystery-of-indias-deadly-exam-scam |title= The mystery of India’s deadly exam scam |author=Aman Sethi |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included an "engine-bogie" system wherein seating arrangements were manipulated so that a paid smarter student was seated between two others to allow the latter to copy answers from the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India reeling from Vyapam scandal|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/world/india-reeling-vyapam-scandal-109402|accessdate=8 November 2017|publisher=BBC Online / The Daily Star|date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board]] (MPPEB), popularly known by its [[Hindi]] acronym "Vyapam" ('''Vya'''vsayik '''Pa'''riksha '''M'''andal), is a self-financed and autonomous body incorporated by the state government responsible for conducting several entrance tests in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vyapam Corruption Case Mystifies India|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/world/asia/vyapam-corruption-case-mystifies-india.html|work=nytimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These entrance exams are held for recruitment in government jobs and admissions in educational institutes of the state. The scam involved a collusion of undeserving candidates, who bribed politicians and MPPEB officials through middlemen, to get high ranks in these entrance tests. The scam also led to between 23 and 40 'unnatural' deaths of involved individuals, though unofficial figures run well into more than a 100 custodial deaths including the erstwhile MP Governor's son and deaths in staged road accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivastava|first1=Vaibhav|title=Vyapam Scam: The CBI’s Clean Chit Is Not the Final Word on the Matter|url=https://thewire.in/194948/vyapam-scam-cbis-clean-chit-not-final-word-matter/|accessdate=8 November 2017|publisher=The Wire|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Inquiry Into Scandal Over Testing Set to Expand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/world/india-inquiry-into-scandal-over-testing-set-to-expand.html|work=nytimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cases of irregularities in these entrance tests had been reported since the mid-1990s, and the first [[First Information Report|FIR]] was filed in 2000. However, until 2009, such cases were not thought to be part of an organized ring. When major complaints surfaced in the pre-medical test (PMT) in 2009, the state government established a committee to investigate the matter. The committee released its report in 2011, and over a hundred people were arrested by the police. However none of the accused have been convicted as most of them either suspiciously died in custody or were released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dixit|first1=Rakesh|title=Vyapam: How a Munnabhai-style Exam Scam Turned Into a Macabre Thriller|url=https://thewire.in/5249/vyapam-how-a-munnabhai-style-exam-scam-turned-into-a-macabre-thriller/|accessdate=8 November 2017|publisher=The Wire|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer scale of the scam came to light in 2013, when the [[Indore]] police arrested 20 people who had come to impersonate candidates for PMT 2009. The interrogation of these people led to the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, the leader of an organized [[racket (crime)|racket]] involved in the scam. The state government established a Special Task Force (STF) on 26 August 2013. Subsequent interrogations and arrests uncovered the involvement of several politicians, bureaucrats, MPPEB officials, racket leaders, middlemen, candidates and their parents in the scam. By June 2015, more than 2000 people had been arrested in connection with the scam. These included the state's ex-education minister Laxmikant Sharma and over a hundred other politicians. In July 2015, the Supreme Court of India issued an order to transfer the case to the country's premier investigating agency, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI). In the same year, the Wikipedia page of Vyapam scam became the 19th most viewed page on Wikipedia globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vyapam-scam-on-Wikipedias-top-20-list/articleshow/48129815.cms Vyapam scam on Wikipedia's top 20 list], July 19, 2015, The Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many senior personnel including Justice Bhushan who heads the Special Investigative team and Indian doctors including Anand Rai (the whistle blower in this case) are of the opinion that the Vyapam scam was functional since the 1990s when they themselves gave their medical exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25 mystery deaths and 2,000 arrests: All about MP's Vyapam scam|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/25-mystery-deaths-and-2-000-arrests-all-about-mp-s-vyapam-scam/story-Y3dLEQdkEsVyCwuPQXxaXI.html|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=HT correspondent|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that Vyapam is just the tip of the iceberg, and similar "systems" of proxies giving medical exams are operational in other states of India as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vyapam: India's deadly medical school exam scandal|url=http://medicaliaorg.ning.com/forum/topics/vyapam-india-s-deadly-medical-school-exam-scandal|website=medicaliaorg.ning.com|publisher=IMS (Medicalia.org - The internet medical scoeity)|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The scam ==

Vyapam was entrusted with the responsibility of conducting large-scale competitive tests for admission to various professional courses and for recruitment to government jobs.&lt;ref name="Role of Board"&gt;[http://www.vyapam.nic.in/role_of_the_board.htm Role of The Board], Official Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vyapam scam involved collusion among exam candidates, government officials and middlemen: undeserving candidates were offered high marks in the exams, in exchange for [[kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. The following tricks were used by those involved in the scam:&lt;ref name="tnm_335"/&gt;

; Impersonation
: Brilliant students (including previous years' top candidates) or practicing doctors would be paid to impersonate exam candidates. The photograph on the candidate's admit card was replaced by the impersonator's photograph. After the exam, it was changed back to the original. This was done in collusion with the corrupt board officials.

; Copying
: Undeserving candidates bribed the board officials through middlemen to be seated strategically next to a brilliant dummy candidate, who was also paid money. The dummy candidate let them copy from his sheet or exchanged the sheet at the end of the exam.

; Manipulation of records and answer sheets
: The undeserving candidates would leave their [[Optical mark recognition|OMR]] answer sheets blank or fill in only the answers they were sure about. The corrupt board officials would manipulate records to give these candidates randomly high percentages. To avoid being caught in case of an audit, they would file an [[Right to Information Act|RTI]] request demanding to view these answer sheets, and fill in the answers according to the marks.

; Leaking the answer key
: The corrupt board officials leaked the answer key to the selected candidates.

== Unearthing of the scam ==

Cases of malpractice in Vyapam scam had been reported since 1995, and the first FIR was found in 2000 in [[Chhatarpur district]]. In 2004, seven cases were registered in [[Khandwa district]]. However, such reports of malpractice were seen as isolated cases.&lt;ref name="tnm_31892"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/uncovering-vyapam-does-buck-really-stop-bjp-and-chouhan-31892 |title=Uncovering Vyapam: Does the buck really stop with the BJP and Chouhan? |author=Siddhartha Mishra |date=2015-07-06 |publisher=The News Minute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009-11: Initial probe by committee ===

A report by the Madhya Pradesh Local Fund Audit office for 2007-08 found several financial and administrative irregularities in MPPEB, including unauthorized disposal of application forms.&lt;ref name="tnm_31892"/&gt; It was suspected that the application forms were being destroyed so that they could not be compared to exam admit cards and other records. In 2009, fresh complaints of irregularities in the pre-medical test (PMT) surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/mp-govt-accuses-vyapam-scam-whistleblower-of-political-affiliation/|title=MP govt accuses Vyapam scam whistleblower of ‘political affiliation’|date=15 March 2015 |work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indore-based activist Anand Rai filed a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) requesting investigation into the scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/tests-of-your-patience/294386 |title=Tests Of Your Patience - Jun 01,2015 |work=Outlook}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Chief Minister [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]] set up a committee headed by the State Joint Director of Medical Education to probe the allegations.&lt;ref name="charu_42_2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/42-dead-why-is-shivraj-chouhan-not-facing-more-heat-in-the-vyapam-scam-1435607494.html|title=42 dead: why is Shivraj Chouhan not facing more heat in the Vyapam scam?|date=2015-06-30|publisher=Catch News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, MPPEB monitored 145 suspects during the Pre-Medical Test (PMT). Most of the suspects did not turn up, but 8 were caught for impersonating others. This included Kanpur-based Satyendra Varma, who had accepted {{INR}} 4 lakh to appear in place of Ashish Yadav, in Indore.&lt;ref name="IE_held_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/8-held-for-impersonation-in-premedical-test-in-mp/822230/ |title= 8 held for impersonation in pre-medical test in MP |author=Milind Ghatwai |date=2011-07-26 |newspaper=Indian Express }}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 exam toppers from the previous year appeared for the exam. Suspecting that these people were called in to impersonate others or to help candidates cheat by sitting adjacent to them, MPPEB asked them to explain their reasons for re-taking the exams. MPPEB also started using biometric technology: thumb impressions and photographs of all the persons appearing for the exam were taken to be matched during the post-results counselling.&lt;ref name="IE_guilty_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/mp-medical-admission-scam-guilty-students-to-face-action/ |title=MP medical admission scam: Guilty students to face action |date= 2011-12-30 |newspaper=Indian Express }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee set up by Chouhan in 2009 submitted its report to the government in November 2011. It mentioned that 114 candidates had passed PMT using impersonation. The candidates, mostly from rich families, had been impersonated by practicing doctors and talented medical students, some of whom had come from neighbouring states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]. The middlemen had charged each candidate {{INR}} 1-4 million. The findings raised concern that several fake doctors admitted through PMT in earlier years might have graduated as practitioners. The possibility of government officials being involved in the scam was also mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/100-fake-doctors-MP-hit-by-Munnabhai-scam/articleshow/11285266.cms |title=100 fake doctors? Madhya Pradesh hit by Munnabhai scam |newspaper=The Times of India |date=2011-12-29 |author=Lemuel Lall }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the MP Government announced that all the students who had gained admissions by fraudulent means would be asked to quit their courses. This included those who had already spent some years taking the course.&lt;ref name="IE_guilty_2011"/&gt;

In 2012, Indore police arrested four people who had come to impersonate candidates in the PMT exam. The arrested had been promised sums ranging from {{INR}} 25,000 to {{INR}} 50,000 each.&lt;ref name="ToI_double_2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Impostors-double-rate-to-help-aspiring-medicos/articleshow/20962778.cms|title=Impostors double rate to help aspiring medicos |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 MP-PMT exam ===

The massive scale of the Vyapam scam came to light in 2013. On the night of 6–7 July, the Indore police arrested 20 people from various city hotels. These people, 17 of whom were from [[Uttar Pradesh]], had come to impersonate local candidates in the PMT exam scheduled on 7 July 2013.&lt;ref name="DNA_23000_2013"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-pmt-scam-23000-page-chargesheet-produced-against-34-accused-1941377 PMT scam: 24,000 page chargesheet produced against 34 accused], DNA India December 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The impersonators had been promised sums ranging from {{INR}} 50,000 to {{INR}} 100,000.&lt;ref name="ToI_double_2013"/&gt; Based on information collected during the interrogation of these 20 impersonators, Indore police found out that an organized racket headed by Jagdish Sagar was involved in the scam. After the arrests and the revelation, Dr. [[Anand Rai]] submitted a complaint to the local Superintendent of Police (economic offence wing), seeking a detailed investigation. He sought probe into the role of MPPEB's chairman, exam controller, assistant controller and deputy controller.&lt;ref name="ToI_hunt_2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Hunt-on-for-MPPMT-racket-mastermind-in-UP-MP/articleshow/20996767.cms |title=Hunt on for MPPMT racket mastermind in UP, MP |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 2013, Jagdish Sagar was arrested in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/STF-files-charge-sheet-against-28-in-MPPMT-scam/articleshow/23601295.cms |title=STF files charge-sheet against 28 in MPPMT scam |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list containing names of 317 students was confiscated from him. MPPEB's exam controller Pankaj Trivedi, who was not a suspect in the scam at that time, tried to protect these students. He sent a letter to various government departments and the deans of medical colleges, insisting that these students should be allowed admission once they sign an affidavit. The affidavit would state that they didn't use any unfair means, and that their admissions would be canceled if they were found guilty in the police investigations. On 28 September 2013, Trivedi was also arrested, based on Jagdish Sagar's interrogation.&lt;ref name="ToI_fish_2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/PMT-scam-STF-cops-ignored-role-of-big-fish/articleshow/29391827.cms|title=PMT scam: STF, cops ignored role of big fish|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October, the Special Task Force (STF) of the police chargesheeted 28 people, including Jagdish Sagar. In December 2013, the STF produced a 23,000-page supplementary [[chargesheet]] against 34 accused in the Indore district court. Out of these 34 accused chargesheeted, 30 were students and their guardians. Four others included Pankaj Trivedi, Dr. Sanjeev Shilpkar and Dr. Jagdish Sagar's accomplice Gangaram Pipliya.&lt;ref name="DNA_23000_2013"/&gt;

=== Other exams probed ===

In November 2013, the STF found that the scamsters had rigged five recruitment tests: Pre-PG, Food Inspector Selection Test, Milk Federation test, Subedar-Sub Inspector and Platoon Commander Selection Test and Police Constable Recruitment Test - all held during 2012 for government jobs in the state. For Pre-PG Test of 2012, MPPEB's former examination controller Dr Pankaj Trivedi and its system analyst Nitin Mahindra provided model answer keys to candidates through photocopies. For the other four exams, the Vyapam officials manipulated the OMR answer sheets by taking them out of the strong room. Different FIRs against 153 people, including Sudhir Sharma, were filed. Sharma had earlier been interrogated by CBI in mining scam of Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name="FPJ_2013_rigged"&gt;[http://freepressjournal.in/vyapam-gang-had-rigged-5-more-exams/ Vyapam gang had rigged 5 more exams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212459/http://freepressjournal.in/vyapam-gang-had-rigged-5-more-exams/ |date=12 August 2014 }}, The Free Press Journal November 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, the government announced that the STF was investigating rigging of nine examinations, and 127 people had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/127-arrested-after-investigations-into-nine-examinations/|title=127 arrested after investigations into nine examinations|date=4 March 2014|work=Free Press Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous years' PMT exams were also investigated. The STF found that 286 candidates had cleared PMT-2012 through fraudulent means. On 29 April 2014, 27 students of [[Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore|MGM Medical College]] in Indore were expelled for having used fraudulent means to clear PMT-2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/27-medical-college-students-expelled-for-alleged-involvement-in-mppeb-scam-684581.html 27 medical college students expelled for alleged involvement in MPPEB scam], IBN Live April 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the High Court asked the police why several of the accused in the case had not been arrested yet. Following this, the STF made several arrests. On 15 June, the STF arrested the state's former technical education minister and BJP leader Laxmikant Sharma for his alleged involvement in the contractual teachers recruitment scam. On 18 and 19 June 2014, the police arrested over 100 medical students from different parts of the state, for their involvement in the PMT scam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/vyapam-scam-stf-arrests-over-100-candidates-696150.html Vyapam scam: STF arrests over 100 candidates], IBN Live June 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the STF revealed that Jagdish Sagar's racket had also rigged the entrance exams for recruitment in [[State Bank of India|SBI]] and other nationalized banks. These entrance exams included the [[Institute of Banking Personnel Selection]]'s exams and the SBI Probationary Officer's exam.&lt;ref name="toisbi"&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/Even-SBI-exams-rigged-by-proxies-of-scam-riddled-MPPEB/articleshow/43055694.cms Even SBI exams rigged by proxies of scam-riddled MPPEB], The Times of India, September 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==
Initial investigations into the irregularities were conducted by the various city units of the state police. During 2009-11, a committee established by the state government and headed by the State Joint Director of Medical Education, probed the irregularities in the PMT exam.&lt;ref name="charu_42_2015"/&gt;

After the role of organized crime rackets and politicians in the scam came to light, the state government formed a Special Task Force (STF) of the police on 26 August 2013, to investigate the scam.

=== Racket leaders ===

Several organized [[racket (crime)|rackets]] were involved in the Vyapam scam. These included the gangs led by Dr. Jagdish Sagar, Dr. Sanjeev Shilpakar and Sanjay Gupta, who were described as "[[boss (crime)|kingpins]]" of the PMT scam. For PMT 2013, Dr. Sagar had given 317, Shilpakar 92 and Sanjay Gupta 48 names. Mahendra had recorded the details of these candidates in his computer and destroyed the list. While allotting roll numbers to these candidates, the slots immediately before or after them were left blank. These roll numbers were then allotted to fake candidates. The roll numbers were set at their homes and brought to office in a pen drive. After reaching the office, Mahendra uploaded the roll numbers to the computers. He then used to telephone the middlemen and provide a confirmation.

; Dr. Jagdish Sagar
: Indore-based Jagdish Sagar helped around 140 students get selected to the medical courses illegally, during 2009-12 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/lavish-spender-who-struggled-for-mbbs-helped-hundreds-cheat-their-way-in/|title=Lavish spender who struggled for MBBS, helped hundreds cheat their way in |date=23 July 2013|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged impersonators, largely sourced from Uttar Pradesh.

In turn, Shilpakar had bribed MPPEB officials including Nitin Mahindra, impersonators and brokers who brought candidates to him. He absconded after the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, but was later arrested by the STF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/shilpakar-earned-rs-3-cr-from-45-pmt-candidates/|title=Shilpakar earned Rs 3 cr from 45 PMT candidates|date=31 October 2013|work=Free Press Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was arrested in 2014 for allegedly blackmailing the Vyapam accused using the [[call detail record]]s (CDRs) collected by the investigating team.&lt;ref name="FPJ_blackmail_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA_trainee_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-vyapam-mysterious-death-of-trainee-woman-cop-is-the-latest-2102312 |title=Vyapam: Mysterious death of trainee woman cop is the latest |newspaper=DNA |date=7 July 2015 |author=Iftikhar Gilani }}&lt;/ref&gt; He approached the [[Indian National Congress]] leader [[Digvijaya Singh]], claiming to be a whistleblower who was being falsely implicated for trying to expose the involvement of senior BJP leaders (including Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan) in the scam.&lt;ref name="DNA_trainee_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Outlook_Uttam_2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/4000-mp-cops-are-using-tapping-sw/297389 |title="4,000 MP Cops Are Using Tapping S/W" |author=Uttam Sengupta |publisher=Outlook |date=4 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he has reported receiving death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150706/jsp/opinion/story_29724.jsp |title=Intimations of evil - The Vyapam deaths |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=6 July 2015 |author=Mukul Kesavan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-vyapam-scam/article7402744.ece |title=All you need to know about the Vyapam scam |author=Pradipti Jayaram and Apuurva Sridharan |newspaper=The Hindu |date=9 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also alleged that some unidentified people tried to kill his family by ramming a truck into their car, but the police investigation concluded that his car had collided with a dead cow on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Whistleblowers-car-hit-cow-carcass-no-murder-bid-Cops/articleshow/47209550.cms |title=Whistleblower’s car hit cow carcass, no murder bid: Cops |date=9 May 2015 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FPJ_turtle_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/car-turned-turtle-as-it-hit-a-dead-cow-not-by-truck/582037 |title=Car turned turtle as it hit a dead cow, not by truck }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the police briefly detained his wife accusing her of having illegal [[hawala]] cash; Pandey alleged that this was done to intimidate and harass him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/i-t-dept-to-probe/633548 |title=I-T dept to probe |date=28 July 2015 |newspaper=The Free Press Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/whistleblowers-wife-detained-with-hawala-money-in-indore/ |title=Whistleblower’s wife detained with ‘hawala money’ in Indore |newspaper=Indian Express |date=26 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations against the Governor ==
The STF also found evidence against the state Governor [[Ram Naresh Yadav]]. On February 24, 2015, Yadav was charged for criminal conspiracy in rigging the MPPEB forest guard recruitment examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Vyapam-scam-FIR-filed-against-MP-governor/articleshow/46358084.cms Vyapam scam: FIR filed against MP governor], The Times of India, Feb 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His son Shailesh was an accused in the contractual teachers' recruitment and later found dead in mysterious circumstances in March, 2015. His former officer-on-special-duty Dhanraj Yadav was arrested by STF in 2013 in connection with the scam. The Governor petitioned the High Court arguing that no criminal proceedings could be initiated against him, as the [[Constitution of India]] grants him immunity while he is in office. The High Court agreed and stayed his arrest, but ordered the investigations against him to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/madhya-pradesh/vyapam-scam-hc-stays-arrest-of-mp-governor-ram-naresh-yadav_1580232.html|title=Vyapam scam: HC stays arrest of MP Governor Ram Naresh Yadav|work=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SIT chief declared that the investigators will act against Yadav after his retirement in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/politics/god-save-governor-despite-vyapam-scam-taint-ram-yadav-enjoy-modi-govts-favour-2328888.html God save the governor: Despite Vyapam scam taint why does Ram Yadav enjoy Modi govt's favour?], Firstpost.com, July 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Three advocates petitioned the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] to order removal of Yadav as Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/supreme-court-moved-removal-madhya-pradesh-governor-057|title=Supreme Court moved for removal of Madhya Pradesh governor|work=The Asian Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bench comprising [[Chief Justice of India]] [[H.

The CBI will investigate the Vyapam scam and more than 30 deaths allegedly linked to the job recruitment scandal, the Supreme Court ruled on 9 July 2015.

== Allegations against the Chief Minister ==

In 2014, Prashant Pandey (aka "Mr. X"), an IT consultant hired by the STF, was arrested for trying to use the team's information to blackmail the Vyapam accused.&lt;ref name="FPJ_blackmail_2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/pandey-was-blackmailing-vyapam-accused-had-links-with-stf/418838 |title=Pandey was blackmailing Vyapam accused, had links with STF |date=2014-08-08 |author=Satyadev Katare |newspaper=The Free Press Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandey then approached the [[Indian National Congress]] leader [[Digvijaya Singh]], and claimed that he was a whistleblower who was being harassed for exposing the role of Chief Minister [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]] in the scam. He alleged that the investigating agencies had tampered with the contents of the [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] sheet recovered from hard disk of the scam accused Nitin Mohindra's computer. Mohindra maintained a record of the candidates' names, their roll numbers and the names of those who had recommended them. Hundreds of people were arrested based on the information in this sheet. Pandey claimed that the investigators had modified the original version of the sheet by removing the names of senior BJP leaders, including Chouhan, from the sheet.&lt;ref name="ToI_lab_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/Gujarat-lab-report-gives-clean-chit-to-STF/articleshow/47037072.cms |title=Gujarat lab report gives clean chit to STF |date=2015-04-25 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digvijaya Singh then submitted a 15-page affidavit before the SIT, alleging that the investigators were shielding the Chief Minister. SIT took cognisance of Singh's complaint, and sent both versions of the Excel sheet for forensic analysis. The forensic laboratory reported that the Excel sheet available with STF was genuine, while Pandey's version was forged.&lt;ref name="ToI_lab_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/vyapam-scam-digvijaya-submitted-forged-evidence-sit-tells-court/ |title=Vyapam scam: Digvijaya submitted forged evidence, SIT tells court |date=2015-04-25 |author=Milind Ghatwai }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Singh's submission was rejected as a forgery by Justice Khanwilkar in the MP High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/excel-evidence-presented-by-digivjaya-singh-was-forged-says-court-757953?pfrom=home-lateststories |title=Excel 'Evidence' Presented by Digvijaya Singh Was Forged, Says Court |date=2015-04-24 |publisher=NDTV |author=Siddharth Ranjan Das |editors=Abhishek Chakraborty }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandey stood by his version, and stated that it had been authenticated by Truth Labs, a private forensic lab.&lt;ref name="ToI_lab_2015"/&gt; He approached the [[Delhi High Court]] for protection as a whistleblower, claiming persecution by the MP Police. He claimed that he first sent the documents to the BJP minister [[Kailash Vijayvargiya]] and the Prime Minister's Office; he approached Congress leaders only when he did not receive any response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/i-had-to-go-public-when-real-documents-didnt-come-out-vyapam-scam-whistleblower-to-ndtv-749030 |title=Delhi Police withdraw Vyapam whistleblower’s security |date=2015-03-03 |author=Sunetra Choudhury |publisher=NDTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandey also stated that he was getting threat calls from influential people. The Delhi court therefore ordered police protection for him in February 2015. However, it was withdrawn in mid May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/delhi-police-withdraw-vyapam-whistleblowers-security/|title=Delhi Police withdraw Vyapam whistleblower’s security |date=2017-05-17 |publisher=The Indian Express |author=Press Trust Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chouhan hit back at his critics, saying that his government should be credited for the exposing the scam. He stated that only 228 out of 350,000 appointments made during his tenure had been affected by the recruitment scam, and unlike previous governments, he had conducted a thorough probe. Replying to Congress' allegations that his wife had got jobs for 17 of her relatives from Gondia, he pointed out that not a single candidate from Gondia had got the job in the question.&lt;ref name="HT_Uttam_2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-should-get-credit-not-persecution-for-exposing-scam-shivraj-singh-chouhan/article1-1242097.aspx |title= I should get credit for exposing Vyapam scam: Shivraj Singh Chouhan |author=Kumar Uttam |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=2014-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaths ==
A number of people connected to the scam and its investigation, died during the course of investigation. The opposition parties and activists alleged that several of these deaths happened under suspicious circumstances. In 2015, the Special Task Force (STF) submitted a list to High Court, naming 23 people who are believed to have died "unnatural death". According to the STF, most of these deaths took place before it took over the investigation in July 2013. Some media reports claimed that 40+ people associated with the scam had died under mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref name="IE_Narendra_2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/vyapam-scam-accused-narendra-singh-tomar-dies/|title=24th Vyapam death: 29-yr-old Narendra Singh Tomar has ‘heart attack’, kin protest|date=2015-06-29|newspaper=Indian Express|author=Milind Ghatwai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Government dismissed the allegations, arguing that Vyapam conducts very large-scale examinations and thousands of people are admitted or recruited through these exams every year. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan insisted that death of every person linked with Vyapam exams should not be linked to the Vyapam scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-vyapam-scam-now-a-trainee-sub-inspector-commits-suicide-2102091 |title= Every death should not be linked to Vyapam, says MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Anamika Kushwaha's suicide |date=2015-07-06 |newspaper=DNA }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state's Home Minister [[Babulal Gaur]] claimed that the deaths were "natural".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vyapam-scam-accused-deaths-natural-babulal-gaur/1/447767.html |title=Deaths of Vyapam scam accused were natural: MP Home Minister Babulal Gaur |publisher=NDTV |date=2015-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to whistleblower Anand Rai, 10 of these deaths are suspicious, while the rest might be coincidences. The deaths considered as suspicious by him include the deaths of Akshay Singh, Namarata Damor, Narendra Tomar, D K Sakkale, Arun Sharma, Rajendra Arya and four middlemen who died in road accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/vyapam-scam-10-deaths-were-suspicious-rest-may-be-a-coincidence-says-anand-rai/articleshow/47967026.cms |title=Vyapam scam: 10 deaths were suspicious, rest may be a coincidence, says Anand Rai |date=2015-07-07 |newspaper=Economic Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the High-Court Special Investigation Team (SIT), 32 people in 25-30 age-group identified as 'racketeers' during the investigation, died in suspicious circumstances since the investigation started in 2012. The SIT officials raised concerns that the arrested people were naming those who were already dead, in order to mislead the probe.&lt;ref name="ToI_Nobody_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/Nobody-knows-how-40-PEB-accused-died/articleshow/47454826.cms |title=Nobody knows how 40 PEB accused died |date=2015-05-28 |author=P Naveen |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of "unnatural deaths" mentioned in the STF and SIT records, plus other deaths alleged to be "suspicious" by the opposition parties and the media.

== Reactions on social media ==
The mysterious deaths of people linked to Vyapam scam triggered [[Black comedy|dark humour]] on various [[social media]] platforms across India. People compared it to the fictional television series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and termed it as India's version of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The untimely and sudden death of a journalist soon after interviewing the family members of another dead accused was considered inauspicious. An online perception was created that any sort of link to the scam could bring trouble or even mysterious death.&lt;ref name="htjul1015"&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mystery-vyapam-deaths-spark-a-wave-of-dark-humour-on-social-media/article1-1367620.aspx Mystery Vyapam deaths spark a wave of dark humour on social media], July 10, 2015, Hindustan Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hashtags such as #KhooniVyapam (Bloody Vyapam), #killervyapamscam, #vyapam, #VyapamGenocide, and #shivrajisteefado (Shivraj, resign) were used by people to post their reactions.&lt;ref name="htjul1015" /&gt;

== Judgement ==
On February 13, 2017, the Supreme Court of India delivered an 83-page judgement and cancelled the degrees of 634 doctors. The court said:

{{block quote | The actions of the appellants are founded on unacceptable behaviour and in complete breach of rule of law. Their actions constitute acts of deceit...National character, in our considered view, cannot be sacrificed for benefits - individual or societal...If we desire to build a nation on the touchstone of ethics and character, and if our determined goal is to build a nation where only rule of law prevails, then we cannot accept the claim of the appellants (students) for suggested societal gains (by allowing them to keep the degrees on the condition of doing social service free of cost for some years)..We have no difficulty in concluding in favour of rule of law...

{{Infobox non-profit
|logo=Logo final transparent copy.png
|status=Registered non-profit organization ("[[eingetragener Verein]]")
|formation=July 2016, registered September 2017
|headquarters=[[Tübingen]], [[Germany]]

}}

WhyEurope is a non-partisan and independent non-profit organization, which was founded in 2016 in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], Germany. It aims at highlighting the benefit of the [[European Union]] for an average citizen in their daily lives by adopting an innovative communication style. Since September 2017, WhyEurope e.V. is an officially registered association based in [[Tübingen]], Germany. It has approximately 30 members from over 10 European states.

== Background and History ==
The initiative was founded by the three students Hans-Christoph Schlüter, Benedikt Erasmus Kau and Mirko Moser-Abt. All three shared a concern about the rise of euroscepticism and right-wing-populism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Badische Zeitung|Title=Facebook-Seite "Whyeurope" ist pro-europäisch und populistisch - Kultur - Badische Zeitung|language=German|URL=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/kultur-sonstige/facebook-seite-whyeurope-ist-pro-europaeisch-und-populistisch--134027863.html|AccessDate=2018-03-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the [[Brexit]] referendum was the trigger for them to become active. They decided to publish pictures with simple pro-European messages on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=euractiv.com|Title=WhyEurope: ‘Brexit was the trigger. We had to do something’|Date=2017-02-24|language=German|URL=https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/video/whyeurope-brexit-was-the-trigger-we-had-to-do-something/|AccessDate=2018-03-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication Style ==
WhyEurope has adopted a communication style they refer to as “Positive [[Populism]]”. The founders describe the approach as simple, emotional and personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=euractiv.com|Title=Students trial ‘positive populism’ in pro-EU messages|Date=2017-01-20|language=German|URL=https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/students-trial-positive-populism-in-pro-eu-messages/|AccessDate=2018-03-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refrain from including difficult, political or legal terms in their slogans and make their messages as catchy and short as possible. Furthermore, WhyEurope aims to trigger positive emotions by connecting political issues to every-day topics such as love or happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Positiver Populismus" – Co-Gründer von WhyEurope im Interview|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.laute-europaeer.de/2017/12/08/whyeurope-interview/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=de-DE|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative aims at pointing out the concrete advantages complex benefits of [[European integration]] have in people's daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung für die Freiheit|Title=Why Europe|language=German|URL=https://www.freiheit.org/why-europe|AccessDate=2018-03-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders have repeatedly stated that ''Positive Populism'' is to be seen as a simple and emotional communication style, but sustains a foundation of hard facts and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Europe? – Euranet Plus|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.euranetplus.de/2017/03/06/why-europe/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=de-DE|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrary to actual ‘negative’ populists, they want to provide factual evidence and explanations for their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About {{!}} WhyEurope|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.whyeurope.org/about/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WhyEurope considers Positive Populism an approach to oppose current populist and [[Extremism|extremist]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONTENT: Pourquoi l’Europe? Initiation au populisme positif – Master Europe|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://mastereurope.eu/content-whyeurope-populismepositif/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, the technical communication of the European Union might have contributed to the lack of support those institutions have received during the past years. Adopting a more appealing communication approach might help the Union to regain confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Anne Havenith|Title=Kármán Hochschulzeitung - WhyEurope – Die EU retten mit Social Media?|language=German|URL=http://www.karman-aachen.de/archiv/item/1415-whyeurope-%E2%80%93-die-eu-retten-mit-social-media|AccessDate=2018-03-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independence ==
Since their foundation, WhyEurope has always emphasized their character as a non-partisan and independent initiative. Despite being in contact with actors of the European Union, they have repeatedly stated their distance to the EU institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Christoph Schlüter - Raising emotional engagement with Europe - EuropCom 2017|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXgi2tmUbls|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=European Committee of the Regions|date=2017-11-10|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refuse to accept any financial support in any form from the European Union and other political institutions or actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whyeurope.org/support-us/|title=Support Us {{!}} WhyEurope|website=www.whyeurope.org|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other initiatives ==
WhyEurope has had a number of cooperations with other pro-European initiatives. Since beginning of 2016, Benedikt Kau and Hans-Christoph Schlüter were in contact with [[:de:Daniel Röder|Daniel Röder]] and Sabine Röder when they launched the demonstrations under the name [[Pulse of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Europe – Wahres mit Augenzwinkern – #PulseofEurope|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://pulseofeurope.eu/de/why-europe-wahres-mit-augenzwinkern/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-03-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=de-DE|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulse of Europe adopted the campaign and the slogan of the campaign “Blijf bij ons” focusing on the [[:de:Parlamentswahl in den Niederlanden 2017|Dutch General elections]]. Together, the initiatives mobilized ten thousands of people joining pro-European demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Duitsers demonstreren tegen 'nexit': blijf bij ons!|language=German|URL=https://nos.nl/artikel/2162875-duitsers-demonstreren-tegen-nexit-blijf-bij-ons.html|AccessDate=2018-03-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further cooperations included projects with the [[Young European Federalists]] and [[Laute Europäer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=“Positiver Populismus” – Co-Gründer von WhyEurope im Interview|url=https://www.laute-europaeer.de/2017/12/08/whyeurope-interview/|language=de-DE|accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Reception ==
