[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Song of the Angels (1881).jpg|thumb|''Song of the Angels'' (1881) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] (1825-1905)]]

'''[[Angel]]s''' have appeared in works of [[art]] since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an paintings and sculpture.

Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome/frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] (which have beastial characteristics), [[ophanim]] (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and [[cherubim]] (which have mosaic features);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Alice. Of Wing and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim. pp. 2–4. {{ISBN|978-3-11-020528-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless. Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless.&lt;ref&gt;"Because angels are purely spiritual creatures without bodies, there is no sexual difference between them. There are no male or female angels; they are not distinguished by gender.", p. 10, "Catholic Questions, Wise Answers", Ed. Michael J. Daley, St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0867163984}}, 9780867163988. See also [https://www.catholic.com/qa/can-angels-be-male-or-female Catholic Answers], which gives the standard, unchanged, Catholic position.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19th-century art, especially [[funerary art]], this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned.

===In the Early Church===
Specific ideas regarding how to portray angels began to develop in the early Church. Since angels are defined as pure spirits,
&lt;ref name=gorgievski&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fYareuHCAu0C&amp;pg=PA1 Gorgievski, Sandra. ''Face to Face with Angels: Images in Medieval Art and in Film''], McFarland (2010) {{ISBN|9780786457564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longhurst&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1908542/The_Science_of_Angelology_in_the_Modern_World_-_The_Revival_of_Angels_in_Contemporary_Culture Longhurst S.T.D., Christopher Evan. "The Science of Angelology in the Modern World: The Revival of Angels in Contemporary Culture", ''The Catholic Response''], Volume IX, No.2, September/October 2012 (pp. 32-36) {{ISSN|1553-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of a defined form has allowed artists wide latitude for creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/story/1185507/angels-exist-but-have-no-wings-says-church "Angels Exist But Have No Wings, Says Church", ''Skye News'', 20 December 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the "likeness of man" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as "the man Gabriel." Such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous descriptions of angels, as in Genesis 19:5.&lt;ref name=everson&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/gabriel357902.shtml Everson, David. "Gabriel Blow Your Horn! - A Short History of Gabriel within Jewish Literature", Xavier University, December 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428000000/http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/gabriel357902.shtml |date=28 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually depicted in the form of young men.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UvZNzngArGQC&amp;pg=PA1 Marshall, Peter and Walsham, Alexandra (editors). ''Angles in the Early Modern World''], p. 5, Cambridege University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780521843324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known Christian image of an angel, in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], which is dated to the middle of the third century, is a depiction of the Annunciation in which Gabriel is portrayed without wings. Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].

In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the angel, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the coemeterium majus, substitutes the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for the heavenly messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01485a.htm Hassett, Maurice. "Early Christian Representations of Angels." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying winged angels, very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject, are derivations in visual terms from pairs of [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] in classical art.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

In this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: "They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art, and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.

===Byzantine art===
[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''[[loros]]'' of the Imperial guards.]]

Angels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as "Victory". They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus, having light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as the "comely features and fine bodies" desired by slave traders.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  Those "castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards,...." As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  "Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture Brown, Amelia R., "Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture", University of Queensland (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold.&lt;ref name=longhurst/&gt; Angels, especially the archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''[[loros]]'', a long gold and jewelled  [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards, and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West, and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.

===Medieval art===
Medieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'', Gabriel wears a dalmatic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 Andre, J. Lewis. "The Icons and Emblems of the Holy Angels", ''The Belfry: Quarterly Papers on Art, History and Archaeology'', No. III, Burns &amp; Oates, London, October 1876,]&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]. This indicated that, for all their powers, they could not perform the [[Eucharist]], and were in this respect outranked by every priest, reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In [[Early Christian art]] white robes were almost invariably adopted, sometimes bound with the "golden girdle" of Revelation. During the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour,&lt;ref name=vinycomb&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca08.htm Vinycomb, John. ''Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art'', p.30, Chapman and Hall, London(1909)]&lt;/ref&gt; while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Fra Angelico]] painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty, as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.&lt;ref name=gorgievski/&gt;

===Renaissance art===
[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|left|Fra Angelico, The Annunciation, 1437-46]]
The classical ''[[erotes]]'' or ''[[putto]]'' re-appeared in art during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in both religious and mythological art, and is often known in English as a [[cherub]], the singular of cherubim, actually one of the higher ranks in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art, and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance, except that they may be amusing Christ or [[John the Baptist]] as infants in scenes of the [[Holy Family]].

===Victorian art===
In the late 19th century artists' model [[Jane Morris|Jane Burden Morris]] came to embody an ideal of beauty for [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous, they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and others used her image often and in different ways, creating a new type of angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000614.php Homan, Roger. "Jane Burden: How a Pre-Raphaelite model changed our image of angels", ''The Social Affairs Unit'', 14 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic art ==
According to Islamic teaching, angels are made of light, are beautiful, and have wings; although the shape and form of the wings are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php Islamic Resource &amp; Information Service (IRIS), New Zealand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410081112/http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php |date=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islamic art]] angels mainly appear mainly in narrative scenes in miniature painting, in the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman]] traditions.  They are especially common in illustrations of the Prophet's [[Mi'raj]], one of the occasions where their presence is mentioned in the [[Quran]].  Their appearance generally draws more from the [[iconography]] of pre-Islamic Persia, and [[Buddhist art]], than from angels in Christian art. Some of the earliest [[Ilkhanid]] examples are exceptions to this.  They have wings, often multi-coloured,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/angels-fly-on-high-multicolored-wings.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27524&amp;NewsCatID=438 Gamm, Niki. Angels fly on high multicolored wings", ''Hurriyit Daily News'' Istanbul, Turkey, 11 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and very often floating scarves drawing from Chinese Buddhist art. They are not very common however; many appear in illustrations to biographical accounts of the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], which are themselves rare.  There are a few studies of angels by themselves, especially from [[Safavid]] Persia.

In Islamic holy book, God rejects the depictions of angel as female in several verses of [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''. [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/37. Those Ranging in Ranks|chapter 37:149-150]].&lt;/ref&gt; and He will question those who make the depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''.  [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/43. Gold|chapter 43:19-20]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Davies''' (October 28, 1912 &amp;ndash; 1975) was an [[United States|American]] occultist.

==B.O.T.A.==
Successor to [[Paul Foster Case]] in [[Builders of the Adytum]] (B.O.T.A.), Davies served as Prolocutor General until her death in 1975.  She expanded the curriculum of the school by amplifying and reworking Case's 'Esoteric Astrology' and by authoring the courses on 'Developing SuperSensory Powers,' 'Sexual Polarity,' 'Meditational Ascent of the Tree of Livingness,' and 'Qabalistic Doctrines of Rebirth.'

According to her B.O.T.A. obituary, Ann was born on October 28, 1912, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

==Published works==
''This is Truth About the Self''.  Short meditations covering the essence of each statement of [[Pattern on the Trestleboard|The Pattern on the Trestleboard]] (something akin to a creed for the Builders of the Adytum).  Touches on the Ten Divine Emanations depicted on the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]].

''Inspirational Thoughts on the Tarot''.  Davies' original poetry, discussion of the attribution of the Tarot Keys and material from Davies' Tarot classes are blended together in essays examining each of the Major Tarot Keys.

''Monograph on Principles of Health and Diet''.  Advice and guidance about physical health from a Qabalistic perspective.

Many of Davies' lectures and monographs on [[Kabalah|Qabalah]], occult [[tarot]], [[meditation]] and [[astrology]] are described at the [http://bota.org B.O.T.A. website.]

==Biography==
Some biographical material on Davies can be found in the book ''Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works'' by Paul Clark, Steward of the [[Fraternity of the Hidden Light]]. The book also contains purported messages from Master R ([[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Comte de St. Germaine]]) to [[Paul Foster Case]], Ann Davies and Case's wife Harriet.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, P. (2013) ''Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works''. Covina CA: Fraternity of the Hidden Light.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Apostolic Syndic''' is a Catholic layman, who in the name, and by the authority, of the [[Holy See]], assumes the care and civil administration of the temporalities and in particular the pecuniary alms destined for the support and benefit of Franciscan convents, and thence provides for the requirements of the brethren.

==History==
To the [[Friars Minor]], corporate as well as individual ownership was forbidden by the constitution or the rule. During the first years of the order's existence, the literal observance of this precept, being feasible as well as possible, presented no difficulty; but as time went on, and the order developed as a vast organization, and spread over the whole world, countless difficulties had to be faced and fierce controversy arose, the quaestio de paupertate lasting for centuries. To preserve and safeguard as far as possible the letter as well as the spirit of the complete "expropriation" advocated by St. Francis, the popes adopted the ''fictio juris'' of assuming to themselves the ownership of all goods bestowed upon the friars. Thus the friars were legally regarded as mere users, the right of property being vested in the Roman pontiff, except in cases where the donors made explicit reservation in their own behalf. But as the civil administration of property in one's own interest is an act of ownership, and this was prohibited by the rule, such administration had to be exercised by a steward appointed, or at least authorized, by the Holy See.

According to the Decretal of [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]], "Exiit qui seminat" (art. 12, n. 2) of 14 August 1279, the appointment of the Apostolic Syndic rested with the sovereign pontiff or the order's [[cardinal protector]]; sometimes bishops acted as their delegates in this matter; but [[Martin IV]] ("Exultantes", 18 January 1283) empowered the superiors of the order —the general, the provincials, and the custodes— within their respective spheres of jurisdiction, to appoint and remove syndics as circumstances might require.

The larger powers with which the syndic was invested by Martin IV and by his successors, [[Martin V]] ("Constitutiones Martinianae" in Wadding, "Annales", X, 301) and [[Paul IV]] ("Ex Clementi", 1 July 1555), gave rise to the appellation syndicus Martinianus in contradistinction to syndicus communis. This latter, as constituted by [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]] (Exiit) and [[Clement V]] ("Exivi de Paradiso", 6 May 1312), could deal only with movable property (valuables excepted) and with purchase moneys. The Martinian syndic on the other hand, as trustee and agent of the Holy See on behalf of the friars, might receive and dispose of all goods movable and immovable (money offerings, legacies, and remunerations) and, in pursuance of his trust, institute proceedings in the courts and take such other steps as might be deemed necessary to protect the interest of the community in whose favour he acted.

The Apostolic syndic and his wife and children were accorded the enjoyment of all and sundry indulgences, pardons, and privileges which the friars themselves have obtained, or shall obtain, from the Holy See ([[Clement VII]], "Dum Consideramus", 16 April 1526).

[[Image:Aten.svg|250px|thumb|right|[[Aten]]]]
'''Atenism''', or the "'''Amarna heresy'''", refers to the religious changes associated with the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep IV]], better known under his adopted name, [[Akhenaten]]. In the 14th century BC, Atenism was [[Egypt]]'s state religion for around 20 years, before subsequent rulers returned to the traditional gods and the Pharaohs associated with Atenism were erased from Egyptian records.

==History of Aten before Akhenaten==
[[Image:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.) (Musée du Caire) (2076972086).jpg|right|325px|thumb|Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] and his family adoring the Aten]]

[[Aten]], the god of Atenism, first appears in texts dating to the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]], in the [[Story of Sinuhe]]. During the Middle Kingdom, Aten "as the sun disk...was merely one aspect of the sun god [[Ra|Re]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Handbook to Life in Ancient Egypt, Facts on File Inc., 1998. p.124&lt;/ref&gt; It was a relatively obscure [[sun god]]; without the Atenist period, it would barely have figured in Egyptian history. Although there are indications that it was becoming slightly more important during the eighteenth dynasty, notably [[Amenhotep III]]'s naming of his royal barge as ''Spirit of the Aten'', it was Amenhotep IV who introduced the Atenist revolution in a series of steps culminating in the official installment of the Aten as Egypt's sole god. Although each line of kings prior to the reign of Akhenaten&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, op. cit., p.124&lt;/ref&gt; had previously adopted one deity as the royal patron and supreme state god, there had never been an attempt to exclude other deities, and the multitude of gods had always been tolerated and worshipped. During the reign of [[Thutmosis IV]], it was identified as a distinct solar god, and his son Amenhotep III established and promoted a separate cult for the Aten. There is no evidence that Amenhotep III neglected the other gods or attempted to promote the Aten as an exclusive deity.

==Atenist revolution==
Amenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in the fifth year of his reign (1348/1346 BC), raising Aten to the status of supreme god, after having initially permitted continued worship of the traditional gods.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, op. cit., p.125&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the [[cartouche]] form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. The religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a [[Sed festival]], a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, it possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III. Some Egyptologists think that he had a [[coregency]] with Amenhotep IV of 2-12 years.

The British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|Hieroglyphs on the backpillar of Amenhotep III's statue. There are 2 places where Akhenaten's agents erased the name Amun, later restored on a deeper surface. The British Museum, London]]
The fifth year is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, [[Akhetaten]] (''Horizon of the Aten''), at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Evidence appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. Then, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (''Spirit of the Aten'') as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In the seventh year of his reign (1346/1344 BC), the capital was moved from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to Akhetaten, but construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres, he was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too. Taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at [[Karnak]] and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of [[Amun]].

The Burrell Collection, Glasgow]]
In the ninth year of his reign (1344/1342 BC), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'': "O Sole God beside whom there is none". Aten's name is also written differently after the ninth year of the Pharaoh's rule to emphasise the radicalism of the new regime. Aten, instead of being written with the symbol of a rayed solar disc, now became spelled phonetically.

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatrism|monolatry]] rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods. He simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten.

It is known that Atenism did not attribute divinity only to Aten. Akhenaten continued the [[imperial cult#Ancient Egypt|cult]] of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the [[Son of God|son of Aten]] and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amarnareligion.html|title=Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten|website=www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten, and only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Routledge dictionary of Egyptian gods and goddesses|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34495-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast with traditional Egyptian religion==
{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
Akhenaten carried out a radical program of religious reform. For about twenty years, he largely supplanted the age-old beliefs and practices of the Egyptian state religion, and deposed its religious hierarchy, headed by the powerful priesthood of [[Amun]] at Thebes. For fifteen centuries, the Egyptians had worshiped an extended family of gods and goddesses, each of which had its own elaborate system of priests, temples, shrines and rituals. A key feature of the cults was the veneration of images and statues of the gods, which were worshipped in the dark confines of the temples.

The pinnacle of the religious hierarchy was the Pharaoh, both king and living god. Administration of the Egyptian kingdom was thus inextricably bound up with and largely controlled by the power and influence of the priests and scribes. Akhenaten's reforms cut away both the philosophical and economic bases of priestly power, abolishing the cults of all other deities and, with them, the large and lucrative industry of sacrifices and tributes that the priests controlled.

At the same time, he strengthened the role of the Pharaoh. [[Dominic Montserrat]], analysing the various versions of the hymns to the Aten, argues that all versions of the hymns focus on the king; he suggests that the real innovation is to redefine the relationship of god and king in a way that benefited Akhenaten, quoting a statement of Egyptologist [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]]: "Amarna religion was a religion of god and king, or even of king first and then god".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montserrat|first=Dominic|title=Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415301862|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amenhotep III: Perspectives on His Reign|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|author=John Baines|editors=David O'Connor, Eric Cline|page=281|chapter=The Dawn of the Amarna Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Akhenaten presented Aten to the Egyptian people as a variant of the familiar supreme deity Amun-Ra (itself the result of an earlier rise to prominence of the cult of [[Amun]], resulting in Amun becoming merged with the sun god [[Ra]]), in an attempt to put his ideas in a familiar religious context. ''Aten'' is the name given to the solar disc, and the full title of Akhenaten's god was ''Ra-[[Horus]], who rejoices in the horizon in his name of the light which is in the sun disc''. (That is the title of the god as it appears on numerous stelae, placed to mark the boundaries of Akhenaten's new capital at Akhetaten.)

However, in the ninth year of his reign Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion by declaring Aten not merely the supreme god but the only god, and Akhenaten was the [[Son of God|son of Aten]] was the only intermediary between the Aten and his people.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Nicholas, Akhenaton: Egypt's False Prophet {{ISBN|0-500-28552-7}}, pg 146&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc in which the rays, commonly depicted as ending in hands, appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. New temples were constructed in which the Aten was worshipped in the open sunlight rather than in dark temple enclosures, as the old gods had been.

Although idols were banned, even in people's homes, they were typically replaced by functionally equivalent representations of Akhenaten and his family venerating the Aten and receiving the [[ankh]] ([[sail (hieroglyph)|breath]] of life) from him. The radicalisation of the ninth year, including spelling Aten phonetically instead of using the rayed solar disc, may be a determination on the part of Akhenaten to dispel a probable misconception among the common people that Aten was really a type of sun god like Ra. Instead, the idea was reinforced that such representations were representations above all of concepts, of Aten's universal presence, not of physical beings or things.

==Amarna art==
{{main|Amarna art}}
Styles of art that flourished during the brief period are markedly different from other Egyptian art. They bear a variety of affectations, from elongated heads to protruding stomachs, exaggerated ugliness and the beauty of Nefertiti. Significantly, for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten's family was depicted in a decidedly naturalistic manner. It is clearly shown displaying affection. 

Images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti usually depict the Aten prominently above that pair, with the hands of the Aten closest to each offering Ankhs. Unusually for New Kingdom art, the Pharaoh and his wife are depicted as approximately equal in size, with Nefertiti's image used to decorate the lesser Aten temple at Amarna. That may suggest that she also had a prominent official role in Aten worship.

Artistic representations of Akhenaten usually give him an unusual appearance, with slender limbs, a protruding belly and wide hips. Other leading figures of the Amarna period, both royal and otherwise, are also shown with some of these features, suggesting a possible religious connotation, especially as some sources suggest that private representations of Akhenaten, as opposed to official art, show him as quite normal. It is also suggested by Bob Brier, in his book "The Murder of Tutankhamen", that the family suffered from [[Marfan's syndrome]], which is known to cause elongated features, which may explain Akhenaten's appearance.

==Decline==
Crucial evidence about the latter stages of Akhenaten's reign was furnished by discovery of the so-called ''[[Amarna Letters]]''. Believed to have been thrown away by scribes after being transferred to papyrus, the letters comprise a priceless cache of incoming clay message tablets sent from imperial outposts and foreign allies. The letters suggest that Akhenaten was obsessed with his new religion, and his neglect of matters of state was causing disorder across the massive Egyptian empire. The governors and kings of subject domains wrote to beg for gold and complained of being snubbed and cheated. Also discovered were reports that a major plague pandemic was spreading across the ancient Near East. This pandemic appears to have claimed the life of Akhenaten's main wife ([[Nefertiti]]) and several of his six daughters, which may have contributed to a declining interest on the part of Akhenaten in governing effectively.

With Akhenaten's death, the Aten cult he had founded almost immediately fell out of favor due to pressures from the Priesthood of Amun. Tutankhaten, who succeeded him at 8 (with Akhenaten's old vizier, [[Ay]], as regent) changed his name to [[Tutankhamun]] in the third year of his reign (1330 BC) and abandoned Akhetaten, the city falling into ruin. The temples that Akhenaten had built from talaat blocks, including the temple at Thebes, were disassembled by later pharaohs, reused as a source of building materials and decorations for their own temples, and inscriptions to Aten were defaced. Finally, [[Akhenaten]], [[Smenkhkare]], [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ay]] were removed from the official lists of Pharaohs, which instead reported that [[Amenhotep III]] was immediately succeeded by [[Horemheb]].

==Link to monotheism in Abrahamic religions==
{{See also|Akhenaten#Akhenaten_and_monotheism_in_Abrahamic_religions}}
Because of the monolatristic or [[monotheistic]] character of Atenism, a link to [[Judaism]] (or other monotheistic religions) has been suggested by various writers. For example, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]] assumed Akhenaten to be the pioneer of monotheistic religion and [[Moses]] as Akhenaten's follower in his book ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' (see also [[Osarseph]]). The Egyptian author [[Ahmed Osman (author)|Ahmed Osman]] went as far as to claim that Moses and Akhenaten were the same person.

==Atenism in modern culture==
* American composer [[Philip Glass]] composed [[Akhnaten (opera)|a grand opera]] about [[Akhenaten]] which sets texts from the [[Amarna letters]] and [[Hymn to the Aten]]. 
* Finnish author [[Mika Waltari]] used the idea of Aten and Atenism in his historical novel ''[[The Egyptian]]''.
* New Zealand-Canadian author [[Pauline Gedge]] did the same in her 1984 historical novel ''The Twelfth Transforming''.
* "[[Sirius B (album)|Son of the Sun]]", a song by the [[symphonic metal]] band [[Therion (band)|Therion]], is critical of Atenism and monotheism.
* In the video game ''[[The Secret World]]'', the Aten is a malevolent supernatural force that wants to destroy Egypt, and Akhenaten is a victim of its [[mind control]].

He moved to [[Lumber City, Georgia|Lumber City]] with his family when he was six years old.&lt;ref name=georgiaen&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-991 Brainard Cheney (1900-1990)], ''[[The New Georgia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a writing career that covered four decades. He published four novels — ''Lightwood'' (1939), ''River Rogue'' (1942), ''This Is Adam'' (1958), and ''Devil's Elbow'' (1969) — that depict the marring of Agrarian ideals by the social transformation of south Georgia between 1870 and 1960. Ultimately, these novels demonstrate the negative impact of unfettered capitalism, [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], and northern exploitation on south Georgia.

Cheney attended [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and there became friends with many of the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]] and Agrarian writers. He took courses under [[John Crowe Ransom]] and shared a room with [[Robert Penn Warren]]. In 1928, Cheney married [[Frances Neel Cheney|Frances Neel]], a reference librarian.&lt;ref name=cheneyf&gt;[http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/speccol/cheneyf_bio.shtml Frances Neel Cheney Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619182827/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/speccol/cheneyf_bio.shtml |date=June 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife frequently entertained [[Caroline Gordon]] and [[Allen Tate]] at [[Idler's Retreat]], a large [[Antebellum architecture|Antebellum]] house in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], which Frances had inherited.&lt;ref name=cheneyf/&gt; When they were received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1953, Gordon and Tate were their sponsors.&lt;ref name=georgiaen/&gt;
[[File:Idler's Retreat.JPG|thumb|250px|Idler's Retreat, the Cheneys' home in Smyrna, Tennessee.]]

After Vanderbilt, Cheney became involved in journalism and politics, working for the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' from 1925 to 1942, and later as public relations director for Tennessee governor [[Frank G. Clement]] from 1952 to 1958.&lt;ref name=georgiaen/&gt; He later penned the governor's address at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]] ("How long oh Lord, how long..."), as well as assisting Robert Penn Warren with some of the speeches included in his novel, ''[[All the King's Men]]''.

Cheney's first novel, ''Lightwood'', dealt with the Dodge Timber Wars that followed the Civil War. These events took place in the current south Georgia counties of Dodge and Telfair, during a period from 1870 through as late as 1923. The associated legal case is considered one of the most complex in recent history, reminiscent of Dickens' book, ''Bleak House''. In 2011, ''The Lightwood Chronicles, being the true story of Brainard Cheney's novel, Lightwood'', was published. The book includes a collection of essays and other information relating to the Wars, divided into two sections: ''Lightwood'' as History and ''Lightwood'' as Fiction. The editor, Stephen Whigham, interviewed Mr. Cheney in 1982.

Cheney wrote two plays, ''Strangers in This World'', produced at the Vanderbilt University Theater in February 1952 and at the Little Theater, [[University of Louisville]], Belknap Campus, in January 1956, and ''I Choose to Die'', produced at the Vanderbilt University Theater in November 1960.&lt;ref name=cheneyb&gt;[http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/speccol/cheneyb_bio.shtml Brainard Bartwell Cheney Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619183123/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/speccol/cheneyb_bio.shtml |date=June 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1952, Cheney wrote an appreciative review of [[Flannery O'Connor]]'s first novel, ''[[Wise Blood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Untitled review of ''Wise Blood'' in ''[[Shenandoah (magazine)|Shenandoah]]'', 3 (Autumn 1952), 55-60. Reprinted in Stevens ed. (1986), Appendix A.&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining Cheney's address from Caroline Gordon, O'Connor wrote to thank him for writing about her book "so carefully and with so much understanding".&lt;ref&gt;Stevens ed. (1986), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In his reply, Cheney described himself to the Catholic O'Connor as "an ex-Protestant, ex-agnostic, who had just found his way back (after 10 or 12 generations) to The Church".&lt;ref&gt;Stevens ed. (1986), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheneys visited O'Connor for the first time in June 1953. They became close friends with O'Connor and corresponded and shared ideas with her until her death in 1964. Like O'Connor, Cheney was interested in the work of [[Teilhard de Chardin]], about whom in 1965 he co-authored an essay, "Has Teilhard de Chardin Really Joined the Within and Without of Things?", published in ''[[The Sewanee Review]]''.&lt;ref name=cheneyb/&gt;

Cheney returned to Georgia in the early 1980s to celebrate a reprinting of his first two novels and the Altamaha R.A.F.T. (Restoring Altamaha Folk Traditions) festival. For the festival, Cheney, who had served as a raft-hand in about 1917,&lt;ref&gt;McGregory, Jerrilyn (1997). ''Wiregrass Country''. Jackson MS: University Press of Mississippi, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; piloted a reconstructed [[timber raft]] all the way to the coast at [[Darien, Georgia]]. Cheney died in [[Nashville]] in 1990 at the age of eighty-nine. His wife died in 1996, also at the age of eighty-nine.

Cheney's novels reveal his desire for a return to a simpler way of life, one founded on natural cycles and rooted in an appreciation of the land. His tragic characters often go astray by attempting to urbanize themselves or betray their own way of life. In his work, redemption can only be achieved by a return to a farm or a religious conversion, as in ''Devil's Elbow.''

In 2011, [http://www.lightwood.com MMJW BookHouse] began republishing Cheney's novels. All four novels are now available in hardcover, softcover and ebook formats.

'''''Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon''''' is a 2006 book in which the American [[philosopher]] and [[cognitive scientist]] [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that [[religion]] is in need of [[scientific analysis]] so that its nature and future may be better understood. The "spell" that requires "breaking" is not [[religious belief]] itself but the belief that it is off-limits to or beyond scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The University of Edinburgh|title=Daniel Dennett: Breaking the Spell - Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|date=2009-02-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WhQ8bSvcHQ|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

=== Part I ===
The book is divided into three parts. Part I discusses the motivation and justification for the entire project: ''Can'' science study religion? ''Should'' science study religion? 

=== Part II ===
After answering in the affirmative, Part II proceeds to use the tools of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[memetics]] to suggest possible [[theories]] regarding the [[Evolutionary origin of religions|origin of religion]] and subsequent [[history of religion|evolution of modern religions]] from ancient [[folk religion|folk beliefs]]. Part III analyzes religion and its effects in today's world: Does religion make us [[Morality|moral]]? Is religion what gives [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]]? What should we [[religion and children|teach the children]]? Dennett bases much of his analysis on [[empirical]] evidence, though he often points out that much more research in this field is needed.

Dennett's working definition of religions is: "social systems whose participants avow belief in a [[supernatural]] agent or agents whose approval is to be sought". He notes that this definition is "a place to start, not something carved in stone".

== Critical reception ==
The book has received differing reviews from various consumer, [[Mass media|mass media outlets]].

=== The Guardian ===

''The Guardian''{{'}}s [[Andrew Brown (writer)|Andrew Brown]] describes it as giving "a very forceful and lucid account of the reasons why we need to study religious behaviour as a human phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A., (2006). Beyond Belief. ''The Guardian]]. Available to: {{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/25/highereducation.news3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518053323/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/25/highereducation.news3 |archivedate=2016-05-18 |df= }}. [Accessed 25/07/2015]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific American ===

In ''Scientific American'', [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]] describes the book's main draw as being "a sharp synthesis of a library of evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-a-rational-grip-o/?page=1 "Getting a Rational Grip on Religion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608235943/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-a-rational-grip-o/?page=1 |date=June 8, 2015 }}, ''Scientific American'', December 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Yorker ===

In ''The New Yorker'', evolutionary biologist [[H. Allen Orr]] described the book as "an accessible account of what might be called the natural history of religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/03/060403crbo_books?currentPage=all "The God Project"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225230626/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/03/060403crbo_books?currentPage=all |date=December 25, 2013 }}, ''The New Yorker'', April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the religious community ===

==== The New York Times ====
[[Leon Wieseltier]], former member of the editorial board of the ''[[Jewish Review of Books]], called the book, in ''The New York Times'', "a sorry instance of present-day [[scientism]]" and alleged it to be "a merry anthology of contemporary superstitions".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/books/review/19wieseltier.html?ex=1298005200&amp;en=9fcb401ef9fc3e82&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "The God Genome"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812064159/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/books/review/19wieseltier.html?ex=1298005200&amp;en=9fcb401ef9fc3e82&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |date=August 12, 2015 }}, ''The New York Times'', February 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The New Atlantis ====
A professor of a private, Catholic university and outspoken critic of the [[Environmentalism|environmentalist movement]], [[Charles T. Rubin]], likened Dennett in ''The New Atlantis'' to "a tone-deaf music scholar", criticized his "unwillingness to admit the limits of scientific rationality" and accused him of "deploying the same old Enlightenment tropes that didn't work all that well the first time around".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-god-meme "The God Meme"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313043015/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-god-meme |date=March 13, 2013 }}, ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'' 12 (Spring 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
A '''canon''' (from the [[Latin]] ''canonicus'', itself derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang |grc|κανονικός}}, ''kanonikós'', "relating to a rule", "regular") is a member of certain bodies subject to an [[canon law|ecclesiastical rule]].

Originally, a canon was a [[cleric]] living with others in a clergy house or, later, in one of the houses within the precinct of or close to a [[cathedral]] and conducting his life according to the orders or rules of the church. This way of life grew common (and is first documented) in the eighth century. In the eleventh century, some churches required clergy thus living together to adopt the rule first proposed by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] that they renounce private wealth. Those who embraced this change were known as Augustinians or [[Canons Regular]], whilst those who did not were known as [[Secular clergy|secular]] canons.

==Secular canons==
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the members of the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of a [[cathedral]] ([[cathedral chapter]]) or of a [[collegiate church]] (so called after their chapter) are canons. Depending on the title of the church, several languages use specific titles, e.g., in German ''Domherr or Domkapitular'' in a ''Dom'' (i.e., cathedral), ''Stiftsherr'' in a prelature that has the status of a [[Stift]] (notably under a [[prince of the Church]]).

One of the functions of the cathedral chapter in the Roman Catholic Church was to elect a [[vicar capitular]] (now named a diocesan administrator) to serve during a ''[[sede vacante]]'' period of the [[diocese]]. Since the 1983 revision of the [[Code of Canon Law]], this responsibility belongs to the college of [[consultor]]s, unless the national bishops conference decides that the functions that canon law ascribes to the college of consultors, including this one, are to be entrusted to the cathedral chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1R.HTM |title=Canon 502 §3 | work = The Code of Canon Law | publisher = The Vatican | place = Rome, [[Italy|IT]] |accessdate= 2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All canons of the [[Church of England]] have been secular since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], although an individual canon may also be a member of a religious order. Mostly, however, they are ordained, that is, priests or other clergy. Today, the system of canons is retained almost exclusively in connection with [[cathedral]] churches. A canon is a member of the [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] of (for the most part) priests, headed by a [[Dean (religion)|dean]], which is responsible for administering a cathedral or certain other churches that are styled [[collegiate churches]]. The dean and chapter are the formal body which has legal responsibility for the cathedral and for electing the bishop.

===Honorary canons===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Regent's Park College, Oxford]] --&gt;
The title of Canon is not a permanent title and when no longer in a position entitling preferment, it is usually dropped from a cleric's title nomenclature.  However, it is still given in many [[diocese]]s to senior [[parish]] priests (including some [[Rural Dean]]s, those who have played a role in the wider life of the diocese, those who have served in the diocese for a long time, or similar) as a largely honorary title. It is usually awarded in recognition of long and dedicated service to the diocese. Honorary canons are members of the chapter in name but are non-residential and receive no [[Remuneration|emoluments]]. They are entitled to call themselves canon and may have a role in the administration of the cathedral.

[[File:Memorietafel Rijksmuseum SK-A-2312.jpeg|thumb|left|''Four canons with Sts Augustine and Jerome by an open grave, with the Visitation''. {{Interlanguage link multi|Master of the Spes Nostra|nl|3=Meester van de Spes Nostra}} (active c. 1500–1520, Northern Netherlands)]]Generally speaking, canons in the [[Anglican Communion]] are of this sort, and thus are equivalent to a [[monsignor]] in the Roman Catholic Church, often wearing the violet or violet-trimmed [[cassock]] which is associated with that rank. In some [[Church of England]] dioceses, the title [[Prebendary]] is used instead of canon when the cleric is involved administratively with a cathedral.

Honorary canons within the Roman Catholic Church may still be nominated after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Also, priests (and honorary chaplains) of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] and the [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] are, in fact, titular or honorary canons of these respective Orders and have the right to the honorific title of "Canon" and "Monsignor" {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} in addition to the choir dress of a canon, which includes the mozetta (black with purple piping for Malta and white with a red Jerusalem cross for Holy Sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;Insignia according to Gammarelli and Barbiconi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/imgres?q=mozzetta+cappellano+magistrale+malta&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tbo=d&amp;qscrl=1&amp;rlz=1T4GGNI_enUS500US500&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=714&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=ea3AwLiKmXaZkM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.iagiforum.info/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D2%26t%3D4502%26start%3D0&amp;docid=0oy87gNj7oaChM&amp;imgurl=http://www.smomge.org/Brianz.jpg&amp;w=311&amp;h=449&amp;ei=S7qdUMy-B8PX0QHZ0YDACA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=499&amp;vpy=115&amp;dur=7564&amp;hovh=270&amp;hovw=187&amp;tx=94&amp;ty=147&amp;sig=114858509990863049397&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=146&amp;tbnw=96&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=38&amp;ved=1t:429,r:4,s:0,i:86|type=Image search result |website= www.smomge.org/Brianz.jpg|publisher=Google|accessdate=14 January 2018|title=Canon information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the reign of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]], the [[heads of state]] of [[France]] have been granted by the [[pope]] the title of sole honorary canon of [[Saint John Lateran]] and [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vicariatusurbis.org/?page_id=188&amp;ID=674|title=Ente - Santissimo Salvatore e Santi Giovanni Battista ed Evangelista in Laterano|publisher=Vicariate of the Diocese of Rome|accessdate=18 June 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vicariatusurbis.org/?page_id=188&amp;ID=675|title=Ente - San Pietro in Vaticano|publisher=Vicariate of the Diocese of Rome|accessdate=18 June 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the demise of the Kingdom of France this honour became transferred to the [[President of the French Republic|Presidents of the Republic]], and hence is currently held by [[Emmanuel Macron]]. This applies even when the French President is not a Catholic or is an atheist. The proto-canon of the papal basilica of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] is the [[King of Spain]], currently [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/various/basiliche/sm_maggiore/en/capitolo/capitolo.htm|title=Liberian Chapter.

Before the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], the [[King of England]] was a canon of the basilica of [[Saint Paul outside the Walls]].
[[Image:Portret van Pierre-Louis Stillemans door Jozef Janssens de Varebeke.jpg|thumb|Kanunnik Petrus-Ludovicus Stillemans (1821–1902), brother of [[Antoon Stillemans]] Honorary canon of St Bavon Catedral, [[Flanders]]]] In addition to canons who are clerics in [[holy orders]], cathedrals in the Anglican Communion may also appoint lay persons as canons. The rank of ''"lay canon"'' is especially conferred upon [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|diocesan chancellors]] (the senior legal officer of the diocese, who is usually, though not exclusively, a lay person).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

It has traditionally been said that the King of England (now the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Sovereign]]) is a canon or [[prebendary]] of [[St David's Cathedral|St David's Cathedral, Wales]]. However, this is based on a misconception. The canonry of St Mary’s College, St David's became the property of the [[The Crown|Crown]] on the [[dissolution of the monasteries]]. The Sovereign was never a canon of St David’s, even as a layman (see also The [[Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]] (1562) Article 37), though he or she may occupy the first [[prebendal]] [[Choir (architecture)#Seating|stall]], which is assigned for the monarch's use.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Canon professors===
A canon professor is a canon at an Anglican cathedral (either lay or in orders) who also holds a university professorship. There are four canon professorships in the [[University of Oxford]] in conjunction with [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]] and two in [[Durham University]] in conjunction with [[Durham Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjJnyE3miTMC&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Religion and Law in the United Kingdom|author1=Mark Hill|author2=Russell Sandberg|author3=Norman Doe|publisher=Kluwer Law International|date=2011|page=182|isbn=9789041134400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.org.uk/Across-the-UK/North-East-Cumbria/Cathedral-and-university-welcome-new-professors|title=Cathedral and university welcome new professors|publisher=Premier Christian Media Trust|date=2014|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although academics titled "canon professor" may also be found at other universities where the appointments as canon and professor have been made independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chester.ac.uk/departments/trs/staff/graham|title=Canon Professor Elaine Graham|publisher=[[Chester University]]|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/trs/people/staff/academic/burridge/index.aspx|title=The Revd Canon Professor Richard Burridge|publisher=[[King's College London]]|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ces/research/wreru/aboutus/staff/lf/|title=The Revd Canon Professor Leslie Francis|publisher=[[University of Warwick]]|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2 of the [[Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measure 1995]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/uk-church-measures/1995/ukcm_19950002_en_1#l1g2 |title=Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measure 1995 No. 2 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed for the express purpose of enabling [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]], to appoint not more than two lay canons. One of the motivations for this provision was the fact that, under section 6 of the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840]], the position of [[Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History]] in the [[University of Oxford]] was annexed to a Residentiary Canonry of the cathedral, meaning that the Regius professorship could be held only by an Anglican priest. Following the death of [[Peter Hinchliff]] in 1995 the Regius professorship was held by [[Henry Mayr-Harting]], a [[Roman Catholic]] layman, from 1997 until 2003, and was taken up by another lay person, [[Sarah Foot]], in [[Michaelmas Term]] 2007. Three other [[Faculty of Theology, University of Oxford#Professors|Statutory Professorships]], the [[Regius Professor of Divinity|Regius Professorship of Divinity]], [[Lady Margaret Professor (Oxford)|Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity]], recently held by the famous Anglican theologian, [[John Macquarrie]], and [[Regius Professorship of Moral and Pastoral Theology]], are annexed to canonries of Christ Church and were until recently held only by Anglican priests.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}[[Image:Kanunnik, Sint-Jozef-Klein-Seminarie Sint-Niklaas.jpg|thumb|left|Another [[Flemish people|Flemish]] canon in official clerical dress of canons]]
At Durham, the canon professorships are the [[Van Mildert Professor of Divinity]], the holder of which must be an Anglican priest, and the [[Michael Ramsey Professor of Anglican Studies]], who must be Anglican but did not have to be ordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/about/news/?itemno=23733|title=Two new Canon Professors appointed|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarshipdb.net/jobs-in-United-Kingdom/Van-Mildert-Canon-Professor-Of-Divinity-Durham-University=aWmQucdx5BGULgAlkGUTnw.html|title=Van Mildert Canon Professor of Divinity|accessdate=30 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073356/http://scholarshipdb.net/jobs-in-United-Kingdom/Van-Mildert-Canon-Professor-Of-Divinity-Durham-University%3DaWmQucdx5BGULgAlkGUTnw.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarshipdb.net/jobs-in-United-Kingdom/Michael-Ramsey-Professor-Of-Anglican-Studies-Durham-University=dS_He8dx5BGULgAlkGUTnw.html|title=Michael Ramsey Professor of Anglican Studies|accessdate=30 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044012/http://scholarshipdb.net/jobs-in-United-Kingdom/Michael-Ramsey-Professor-Of-Anglican-Studies-Durham-University%3DdS_He8dx5BGULgAlkGUTnw.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the chair in Greek at the university was also a canon professorship.

The Lightfoot professorship was attached to the canonry until 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/the-rev-professor-douglas-jones-517952.html|title=The Rev Professor Douglas Jones|work=The Independent|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the non-Anglican [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] was appointed.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Minor canons===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ozias Thurston Linley]] --&gt;

[[Minor Canon]]s are those clergy who are members of the foundation of a cathedral or collegiate establishment. They take part in the daily services. They have sometimes formed a distinct corporation as at St Paul's, London.  In St Patrick's Dublin they are distinct from, and rank before, the Vicars Choral. The two groups overlap however; the two senior vicars, the Dean's Vicar and the Succentor, are also the two senior Minor Canons. Some Minor Canons do sit with, but are not voting members of, the Chapter.  Although at present Minor Canons are generally more junior clergy this is a recent development. Within living memory such offices were often freehold and were held by clergy of great distinction and seniority.

==Canons regular==
{{main|Canons Regular}}
Canons regular are the members of certain religious orders in the Roman Catholic Church (not to be confused with clerics regular), composed of priests and some choir canons who live in community, together in the past with lay brothers. There are a variety of congregations of canons, some of which are part of the Confederation of [[Canons Regular]] of St. Augustine.[[Image:ALCAMO 2010 MGR Rode.JPG|thumb|A canon receives [[Franc Rodé]] as guest of honour.]]
* [[Canons Regular of the Lateran]] or St. Saviour, which seems to date back to [[Pope Alexander II]] (1063)
* [[Order of the Canons Regular of Premontre]]; [[Norbertines]] founded by St. Norbert (1120)
* [[Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Coimbra|Order of the Holy Cross (Canons Regular)]] founded in Portugal in 1131 and re-founded in 1977
* [[Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross]] (the Crosiers), founded at Clair-lieu, near Huy, in Belgium, in 1211
* [[Swiss Congregation of Canons Regular of Saint Maurice of Agaune]]
* [[Gilbertine Order]], a solely English order of canons regular, which became extinct under King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]
* [[Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception]], a congregation of Canons Regular founded in France in 1871
[[Image:Sint-Salvatorskapittel Bruges Precious Blood 2008.JPG|thumb|Canons, [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]]]Many bishops endeavoured to imitate St. Augustine and St. Eusebius, and to live a common life with the clergy of their church. Rules taken from the sacred canons were even drawn up for their use, of which the most celebrated is that of [[St. Chrodegang]], [[Bishop of Metz]] (766). In the tenth century, this institution declined; the canons, as the clergy attached to a church and living a common life were called, began to live separately; some of them, however, resisted this relaxation of discipline, and even added poverty to their common life. This is the origin of the canons regular. [[Pope Benedict XII]] by his constitution ''Ad decorem'' (15 May 1339) prescribed a general reform of the canons regular. The [[canons regular]] ex professo united Holy Orders with religious life, and being attached to a church, devoted themselves to promoting the dignity of [[divine]] [[worship]]. With [[monks]], Holy Orders are incidental and secondary, and are superadded to the religious life. With canons as with the clerks regular, Holy Orders are the principal thing, and the religious life is superadded to the Holy Orders.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Diane Hegarty''' (born July 10, 1942) is co-founder of the [[Church of Satan]], which she co-founded with her longtime partner [[Anton LaVey]].

As well as being a self-described [[witchcraft|sorceress]], Diane was co-founder with [[Anton LaVey]] of the [[Church of Satan]] and served as High Priestess for approximately 25 years. 

Anton LaVey [[divorced]] his first wife Carole and began a relationship with Hegarty that lasted  25 years, from 1960 to 1985. They had a child, [[Zeena Schreck]] (née LaVey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Don|last= Lattin|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Satan's Den in Great Disrepair |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F1999%2F01%2F25%2FMN77329.DTL |quote=Both Karla LaVey [sic] and Schreck [sic] were the product of LaVey's common-law marriage to Diane Hegarty from 1962 to 1986.

Along with her Satanic duties as hostess, model enchantress, mother and magician's wife, she helped Anton raise a lion cub named Togare.

Hegarty administered the Church and typed and edited [[The Satanic Bible]], [[The Satanic Rituals]], [[The Satanic Witch|The Compleat Witch]] (aka The Satanic Witch) and [[The Devil’s Notebook]]. She did most of the Church's administrative, press and member relations work. Their daughter [[Zeena Schreck]] was in the media spotlight at age 3, at her Satanic baptism, and again defending the Church of Satan against [[allegations]] of [[Satanic ritual abuse]] as public representative and High Priestess of the Church of Satan between 1985-1990 during the 1980s [[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|Satanic panic]], the politically-motivated Christian fundamentalist [[witch-hunts]] in America.

'''Dunbar Isidore Heath''' (3 March 1816, London – 27 May 1888) was an English clergyman prosecuted for heresy in 1861; he was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].

==Life==
Dunbar Heath was the third son of George Heath, [[serjeant-at-law]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was elected scholar in 1836, and graduated B.A. in 1838. From 1840 to 1847 he was a fellow of Trinity.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=HT833DI|name=Heath, Dunbar Isidore}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a recognized authority on [[Egyptology]], he was one of the early translators of the [[papyri]] in the [[British Museum]]. In 1852 Heath wrote ''The Future Human Kingdom of Christ'', in which he distinguished the “saved nations from the glorified saints” by outlining an early concept of “the two salvations.” He was prosecuted for heresy in 1861 by the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and sentenced by the [[Court of Arches]] for publishing these ideas. He would not recant and tried to appeal his sentence by attempting to defend his character and doctrine from the Scriptures through the writing of several booklets. All of this failed and as a result of this prosecution he suffered not only the loss of his profession, but sustained heavy financial losses as well.

Heath edited the ''Journal of Anthropology''.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom}}
In the United States, [[freedom of religion]] is a constitutionally protected right provided in the religion clauses of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Freedom of religion is also closely associated with [[separation of church and state]], a concept advocated by Colonial founders such as [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|Dr. John Clarke]], [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], [[William Penn]] and later founding fathers such as  [[James Madison]] and  [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Legal and public foundation==
The [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] addresses the issue of religion in two places: in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the Article VI [[No religious test clause|prohibition on religious tests]] as a condition for holding public office. The First Amendment prohibits the Congress  from making a law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof".  This provision was later expanded to state and local governments, through the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Incorporation]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

===Colonial precedents===
The October 10, 1645, charter of [[Flushing, Queens]], New York, allowed "liberty of conscience, according to the custom and practice of Holland without molestation or disturbance from any magistrate or ecclesiastical minister." However, New Amsterdam Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] issued an edict prohibiting the harboring of Quakers. On December 27, 1657, the inhabitants of Flushing approved a protest known as The [[Flushing Remonstrance]]. This contained religious arguments even mentioning freedom for "Jews, Turks, and Egyptians," but ended with a forceful declaration that any infringement of the town charter would not be tolerated.
 
Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle in the founding of the colony of Maryland, also  founded by the Catholic [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.&lt;ref name="Symbol of Enduring Freedom"&gt;Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years  later (1649), an enactment of religious liberty, the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: "No person or persons ... shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof."  The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J. (1988). Maryland: A Middle Temperament, p 21, Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-3399-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1657, Lord Baltimore regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692,&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&amp;dq=maryland+toleration+act&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Maryland Toleration Act], The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties, New York: CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-415-94342-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when after Maryland's [[Province of Maryland#Protestant Revolution of 1689|Protestant Revolution of 1689]], freedom of religion was again rescinded.&lt;ref name="Symbol of Enduring Freedom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roarke"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ybHa6D24qQC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=henry+darnall&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=fcKDS_qNIKjoygTH_rnxCg&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=henry%20darnall&amp;f=false Roark, Elisabeth Louise, p.78, Artists of colonial America] Retrieved February 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition  in 1704, an Act was passed "to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province", preventing Catholics from holding political office.&lt;ref name="roarke" /&gt; Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the [[American Revolution]], when Maryland's [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] signed the [[American Declaration of Independence]].

[[Rhode Island]] (1636), [[Connecticut]] (1636), [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] (1682), founded by Baptist [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], Congregationalist [[Thomas Hooker]], and Quaker [[William Penn]], respectively, established the religious freedom in their colonies in direct opposition to the theocratic government which Separatist [[Congregationalists]] ([[Pilgrim Fathers]]) and [[Puritans]] had enforced in [[Plymouth Colony]] (1620) and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] (1628).&lt;ref&gt;Encylclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/place/Massachusetts-Bay-Colony&lt;/ref&gt; Having fled religious persecution themselves in England, the leaders of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colony restricted franchise to members of their church only, rigorously enforced  their own interpretation of theological law and banished  freethinkers such as Roger Williams, who was actually chased out of Salem., as well as banning Quakers and Anabaptists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Weinstein]] and David Rubel (2002), ''The Story of America: Freedom and Crisis from Settlement to Superpower'', DK Publishing, Inc., New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-7894-8903-1}}, pp. 58-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Fennell (1998), ''Plymouth Colony Legal Structure (http://www.histarch.uiuc.edu/plymouth/ccflaw.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanover Historical Texts Project (http://history.hanover.edu/texts/masslib.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Schmidt, ''Hooker, Thomas'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band III (1958), col. 449&lt;/ref&gt; These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and Jews also had full citizenship and free exercise of their faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs,74-75, 99-105, 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin S. Gaustad (1999), ''Liberty of Conscience: Roger Williams in America'', Judson Press, Valley Forge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Fantel (1974), ''William Penn: Apostel of Dissent'', William Morrow &amp; Co., New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-688-00310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that democracy and freedom of conscience were the will of God. Williams gave the most profound theological reason: As [[faith]] is the free gift of the [[Holy Spirit]], it cannot be forced upon a person. Therefore, strict [[separation of church and state]] has to be kept.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 943&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States. The inseparable connection of [[democracy]], freedom of religion, and the other forms of freedom became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded vigorously and successfully the [[disestablishment]] of the [[Anglican]] and Congregational [[state churches]] that had existed in most colonies since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516247-9}}, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Amendment===

In the United States, the religious civil liberties are guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]:

{{quote|Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.}}

The "[[Establishment Clause]]," stating that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion," is generally read to prohibit the Federal government from establishing a national church ("religion") or excessively involving itself in religion, particularly to the benefit of one religion over another. Following the ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and through the doctrine of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], this restriction is held to be applicable to state governments as well.

The "[[Free Exercise Clause]]" states that Congress cannot "prohibit the free exercise" of religious practices. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has consistently held, however, that the right to free exercise of religion is not absolute. For example, in the 19th century, some of the members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] traditionally practiced [[polygamy]], yet in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1879), the Supreme Court upheld the criminal conviction of one of these members under a federal law banning polygamy. The Court reasoned that to do otherwise would set precedent for a full range of religious beliefs including those as extreme as human sacrifice. The Court stated that "''Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.''" For example, if one were part of a religion that believed in [[Vampire|vampirism]], the First Amendment would protect one's belief in vampirism, but not the practice.

===The Fourteenth Amendment===

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees the religious civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;For the distinction between religious civil liberties and religious civil rights, see e.g.: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9–11, 1979''. Preface&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the First Amendment secures the free exercise of religion, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of religion, by securing "the equal protection of the laws" for every person:

{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction there of, are citizens of the United States and of the State where in they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.}}

===Religious tests===
The affirmation or denial of specific religious beliefs had, in the past, been made into qualifications for public office; however, the [[United States Constitution]] states that the inauguration of a President may include an "affirmation" of the faithful execution of his duties rather than an "oath" to that effect — this provision was included in order to respect the religious prerogatives of the [[Quakers]], a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination that declines the swearing of [[oaths]]. The U.S. Constitution also provides that "No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification of any Office or public Trust under the United States."
Several states have language included in their constitutions that requires state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=RT1 /&gt; These include [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref name=RT2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas2.htm|title=Quotation, Overview, and the Constitutions of Arkansas &amp; Maryland|publisher=Ontario consultants on religious tolerance|accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryland]],&lt;ref name=RT2 /&gt; [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=RT3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas3.htm|title=Religious discrimination in state constitutions : Constitutions of Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee &amp; Texas|publisher=Ontario consultants on religious tolerance|accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Carolina]],&lt;ref name=RT3 /&gt; [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=RT3 /&gt; [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref name=RT3 /&gt; [[Tennessee]],&lt;ref name=RT3 /&gt; and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=RT3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instance in Texas an official may be "excluded from holding office" if he/she does not "acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being." (i.e. [[God]])[http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000100-000400.html Texas Legislature Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810092848/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000100-000400.html |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court. Even though they are still on the books, these provisions have been rendered unenforceable by [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions.&lt;ref name=RT1&gt;{{cite web

With reference to the use of animals, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the cases of the  [[Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]] in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection". (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}})&lt;ref&gt;"Criminal Law and Procedure By Daniel E. Hall – Cengage Learning, July 2008 – p. 266 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KnBnknQAHlkC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=religious+beliefs+need+not+be+acceptable,+logical,+consistent+or+comprehensible+to+others+in+order+to+merit+First+Amendment+protection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3ePeXVLZHE&amp;sig=v8SQRTZB0z8n5YNCA_kf98FlyPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UeS-T76tC4TQgAfd1czyCQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20beliefs%20need%20not%20be%20acceptable%2C%20logical%2C%20consistent%20or%20comprehensible%20to%20others%20in%20order%20to%20merit%20First%20Amendment%20protection&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise in Texas in 2009, issues that related to [[animal sacrifice]] and [[animal rights]] were taken to the [[5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in the case of ''Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless.'' The court ruled that the free exercise of religion was meritorious and prevailing and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of [[Euless, Texas]] from enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating to the use of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1479305.html"]. Full text of the opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious liberty has not prohibited states or the federal government from prohibiting or regulating certain behaviors; i.e. [[prostitution]], [[gambling]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and certain [[drugs]], although some [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] interpret religious freedom to extend to these behaviors. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has ruled that a [[right to privacy]] or a [[due process]] right does prevent the government from prohibiting adult access to [[birth control]], [[pornography]], and from outlawing [[sodomy]] between consenting adults and early trimester [[abortions]].

===The "wall of separation"===
[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that the First Amendment erected a "[[wall of separation]] between church and state" likely borrowing the language from [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], founder of the [[First Baptist Church in America]] and the Colony of Rhode Island, who used the phrase in his 1644 book, ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]], often regarded as the "Father of the Bill of Rights",&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2006b.&lt;/ref&gt; also often wrote of the "perfect separation",&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822&lt;/ref&gt; "line of separation",&lt;ref&gt;letter to Rev Jasper Adams spring 1832&lt;/ref&gt; "strongly guarded as is the separation between religion and government in the Constitution of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;Detached Memoranda, 1820&lt;/ref&gt; and "total separation of the church from the state".&lt;ref&gt;letter to Robert Walsh, March 2, 1819&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy rages in the United States between those who wish to restrict government involvement with religious institutions and remove religious references from government institutions and property, and those who wish to loosen such prohibitions.  Advocates for stronger [[separation of church and state]] emphasize the plurality of faiths and non-faiths in the country, and what they see as broad guarantees of the [[United States Constitution|federal Constitution]]. Their opponents emphasize what they see as the largely Christian heritage and history of the nation (often citing the references to "Nature's God" and the "Creator" of men in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]). Some more socially conservative Christian sects, such as the Christian Reconstructionist movement, oppose the concept of a "wall of separation" and prefer a closer relationship between church and state.

Problems also arise in U.S. public schools concerning the teaching and display of religious issues. In various counties, [[school choice]] and [[school vouchers]] have been put forward as solutions to accommodate variety in beliefs and freedom of religion, by allowing individual school boards to choose between a secular, religious or multi-faith vocation, and allowing parents free choice among these schools. Critics of American voucher programs claim that they take funds away from public schools, and that the amount of funds given by vouchers is not enough to help many middle and working class parents.

U.S. judges often ordered alcoholic defendants to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] or face imprisonment. However, in 1999, a federal appeals court ruled this unconstitutional because the A.A. program relies on submission to a "Higher Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Warner v. Orange County Department of Probation |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19931088827FSupp261_11052.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006 |vol=827 |reporter=F.Supp. |pinpoint=261 |date=July 29, 1993 |court=United States District Court, S.D.

Thomas Jefferson also played a large role in the formation of freedom of religion.  He created the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], which has since been incorporated into the Virginia State Constitution.

===Other statements===

====Inalienable rights====
The [[United States of America]] was established on foundational principles by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/declare.htm
|title=Declaration of Independence : July 4, 1776
|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School
|accessdate=2007-04-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident:
That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; (based on Thomas Jefferson's draft.)&lt;ref&gt;https://jeffersonpapers.princeton.edu/selected-documents/jefferson%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Coriginal-rough-draught%E2%80%9D-declaration-independence-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious institutions====
In 1944, a joint committee of the [[Federal Council of Churches of Christ]] in America and the [[Foreign Missions Conference]] formulated a "Statement on Religious Liberty"

&lt;blockquote&gt;Religious Liberty shall be interpreted to include freedom to worship according to conscience and to bring up children in the faith of their parents; freedom for the individual to change his religion; freedom to preach, educate, publish and carry on missionary activities; and freedom to organize with others, and to acquire and hold property, for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=V. Norskov Olsen|title=Christian Faith &amp; Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiKhJi6L83cC|year=1996|publisher=TEACH Services, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57258-118-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MiKhJi6L83cC&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Freedom of religion restoration====
Following increasing government involvement in religious matters, Congress passed the 1993 [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A number of states then passed [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts|corresponding acts]] (e.g., Missouri passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaty of Tripoli====
Signed on November 4, 1796, the [[Treaty of Tripoli]] was a document that included the following statement:

{{quote|As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims]; and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.}}

This treaty was submitted to the Senate and was ratified unanimously on June 7, 1797, and then signed by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  In accordance with [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] of the Constitution, on that date this treaty became incorporated as part of "the supreme Law of the Land".

==Supreme Court rulings==

===Jehovah's Witnesses===

Since the 1940s, the Jehovah's Witnesses have often invoked the First Amendment's freedom of religion clauses to protect their ability to engage in the proselytizing (or preaching) that is central to their faith.  This series of litigation has helped to define civil liberties case law in the United States and Canada.

In the United States of America and several other countries, the legal struggles of the Jehovah's Witnesses have yielded some of the most important judicial decisions regarding [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of press|press]] and [[freedom of speech|speech]].  In the [[United States]], many [[Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses by country#United States|Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses]] are now landmark decisions of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] law.  Of the 72 cases involving the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court has ruled in favor of them 47 times.  Even the cases that the Jehovah's Witnesses lost helped the U.S. to more clearly define the limits of First Amendment rights.  Former Supreme Court Justice [[Harlan Stone]] jokingly suggested "The Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties."  "Like it or not," observed American author and editor Irving Dilliard, "Jehovah's Witnesses have done more to help preserve our freedoms than any other religious group."

"The cases that the Witnesses were involved in formed the bedrock of 1st Amendment protections for all citizens," said Paul Polidoro, a lawyer who argued the Watchtower Society's case before the Supreme Court in February 2002.  "These cases were a good vehicle for the courts to address the protections that were to be accorded free speech, the free press and free exercise of religion.  In addition, the cases marked the emergence of individual rights as an issue within the U.S. court system.

Before the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] brought several dozen cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] during the 1930s and 1940s, the Court had handled few cases contesting laws that restricted [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Until then, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] had only been applied to [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the federal government.

However, the cases brought before the Court by the Jehovah's Witnesses allowed the Court to consider a range of issues: mandatory flag salute, sedition, free speech, literature distribution and military draft law. These cases proved to be pivotal moments in the formation of [[constitutional law]].  Jehovah's Witnesses' court victories have strengthened rights including the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service and the right to engage in public discourse.

During the World War II era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses in several landmark cases that helped pave the way for the modern civil rights movement.  In all, Jehovah's Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946.

===Lemon test===
The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has consistently held fast to the rule of strict separation of church and state when matters of prayer are involved.
In ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) the Court ruled that government-imposed nondenominational prayer in public school was unconstitutional. In [[Lee v. Weisman]] (1992), the Court ruled prayer established by a school principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and in [[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]] (2000) it ruled that school officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process for the purpose of indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty is the cornerstone of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.

The Court has therefore tried to determine a way to deal with church/state questions.  In ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), the Court created a three-part test for laws dealing with religious establishment.  This determined that a law was constitutional if it:
# Had a [[secular]] purpose
# Neither advanced nor inhibited religion
# Did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.

Some examples of where inhibiting religion has been struck down:

* In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the Court ruled that a Missouri law prohibiting religious groups from using state university grounds and buildings for religious worship was unconstitutional. As a result, Congress decided in 1984 that this should apply to secondary and primary schools as well, passing the [[Equal Access Act]], which prevents public schools from discriminating against students based on "religious, political, philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings".  In Board of Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 236 (1990), the Court upheld this law when it ruled that a school board's refusal to allow a Christian Bible club to meet in a public high school classroom violated the act.
* In [[Good News Club v. Milford Central School]], 533 U.S. 98 (2001), the Court ruled that religious groups must be allowed to use public schools after hours if the same access is granted to other community groups.
* In [[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia|Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia]], 515 U.S. 819 (1995), the Supreme Court found that the [[University of Virginia]] was unconstitutionally withholding funds from a religious student magazine.

==State constitutions==

Under the doctrine of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Incorporation]], the first amendment has been made applicable to the states.  Therefore, the states must guarantee the freedom of religion in the same way the federal government must.

Many states have freedom of religion established in their constitution, though the exact legal consequences of this right vary for historical and cultural reasons. Most states interpret "freedom of religion" as including the freedom of long-established [[religious communities]] to remain intact and not be destroyed. By extension, [[Liberal democracy|democracies]] interpret "freedom of religion" as the right of each individual to freely choose to [[Religious conversion|convert]] from one religion to another, [[Syncretism|mix]] religions, or [[Irreligion|abandon religion]] altogether.

===Requirements for holding a public office===

{{main|Oath of Office#United States}}

The [[no religious test clause]] of the U.S. constitution states that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." Although it has become tradition for US presidents to end their [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|Presidential Oath]] with "so help me God", this is not required by the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation|Constitution]]. The same applies to the [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[United States Senate|Senate]], the members of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], and all other civil and military officers and federal employees, who can either make an [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] or take an oath ending with "[[so help me God]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|5|3331}}, ''Oath of Office'';&lt;br /&gt;

===Issues at the workplace===

Problems sometimes arise in the workplace concerning religious observance when a private employer discharges an employee for failure to report to work on what the employee considers a [[Liturgical year|holy day]] or a day of rest. In the United States, the view that has generally prevailed is that firing for any cause in general renders a former employee ineligible for unemployment compensation, but that this is no longer the case if the 'cause' is religious in nature, especially an employee's unwillingness to work during [[Jewish]] [[Shabbat]], [[Christian]] [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]], or [[Muslim]] [[jumu'ah]].

After reports {{as of|2010|8|alt=in August 2010}} that soldiers who refused to attend a Christian band's concert at a Virginia military base were essentially punished by being banished to their barracks and told to clean them up, an Army spokesman said that an investigation was underway and "If something like that were to have happened, it would be contrary to Army policy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ja7NKtqkk0F3fQWCNf56L0MAFrSgD9HNJ3C80 AP: Troops: Skipping Christian concert got us punished]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/08/20/national/a151658D07.DTL SF Gate: Troops: Skipping Christian concert got us punished]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation of Catholics===

[[File:The American River Ganges (Thomas Nast cartoon).jpg|thumb|Famous 1876 editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] showing bishops as [[crocodile]]s attacking public schools, with the connivance of Irish Catholic politicians]]

[[John Higham (historian)|John Higham]] described anti-Catholicism as "the most luxuriant, tenacious tradition of paranoiac agitation in American history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Jenkins |title=The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=1 April 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=p5SW0l7ciokC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;vq=%22the+most+luxuriant,+tenacious+tradition+of+paranoiac+agitation+in+American+history%22 |isbn=0-19-515480-0 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Catholicism which was prominent in the United Kingdom was exported to the [[United States]]. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society. The first, derived from the heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars of the 16th century]], consisted of the "Anti-Christ" and the "Whore of Babylon" variety and dominated Anti-Catholic thought until the late 17th century. The second was a more secular variety which focused on the supposed intrigue of the Catholics intent on extending medieval despotism worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mannard |first=Joseph G. |title=American Anti-Catholicism and its Literature |year=1981 |url=http://www.geocities.com/chiniquy/Literature.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knIMqNnD?url=http://www.geocities.com/chiniquy/Literature.html|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Sr.]] has called Anti-Catholicism "the deepest-held bias in the history of the American people."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c4J9MLLSjgwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=the+%22deepest+held%22+bias+in+the+history+of+the+american+people&amp;source=web&amp;ots=2Sd828deti&amp;sig=T_9ZlRkbYLBS7a3y0peeGXyzFMI "The Coming Catholic Church"].

[[File:Ballot1.jpg|left|thumb|Rev. [[Branford Clarke]] illustration in [[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]] 1928 by Bishop [[Alma White]] Published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, NJ]]]]
Because many of the British colonists, such as the [[Puritan]]s and [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]s, were fleeing religious persecution by the Church of England, much of early American religious culture exhibited the more extreme anti-Catholic bias of these Protestant denominations. Monsignor [[John Tracy Ellis]] wrote that a "universal anti-Catholic bias was brought to Jamestown in 1607 and vigorously cultivated in all the thirteen colonies from [[Massachusetts]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1956|American Catholicism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial charters and laws contained specific proscriptions against Roman Catholics. Monsignor Ellis noted that a common hatred of the Roman Catholic Church could unite [[Anglican]] clerics and Puritan ministers despite their differences and conflicts.

Some of America's [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]]s held anti-clerical beliefs.  For example, in 1788, [[John Jay]] urged the [[New York Legislature]] to require office-holders to renounce foreign authorities "in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/nhprc/annotation/march-2002/religion-founding-fathers.html Annotation&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote: "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government,"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Alexander von Humboldt]], December 6, 1813&lt;/ref&gt; and, "In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the [[despotism|despot]], abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Horatio G. Spafford, March 17, 1814&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states devised [[loyalty oath]]s designed to exclude Catholics from state and local office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages = 361 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public support for American independence and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the U.S. Constitution by prominent American Catholics like [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his second cousins, Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] and [[Daniel Carroll]], allowed Roman Catholics to be included in the constitutional protections of civil and religious liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Breidenbach, Michael D. (2013), 'Conciliarism and American Religious Liberty' (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Cambridge)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Catholic animus in the United States reached a peak in the 19th century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the influx of Catholic immigrants. Some American Protestants, having an increased interest in prophecies regarding the end of time, claimed that the Catholic Church was the [[Whore of Babylon]] in the Book of Revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bilhartz |first=Terry D. |editor= |title=Urban Religion and the Second Great Awakening |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pK_DqHjUfg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA115,M1 |year= 1986|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=Madison, NJ |isbn=0-8386-3227-0 |chapter= |quote= |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting "nativist" movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, was whipped into a frenzy of anti-Catholicism that led to mob violence, the burning of Catholic property, and the killing of Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |title=The History of Anti-Catholicism |accessdate=2008-11-10 |author=Jimmy Akin |work=This Rock |publisher=Catholic Answers |date=2001-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907171941/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0103bt.asp |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This violence was fed by claims that Catholics were destroying the culture of the United States. The nativist movement found expression in a national political movement called the [[Know-Nothing Party]] of the 1850s, which (unsuccessfully) ran former president [[Millard Fillmore]] as its presidential candidate in 1856.

The founder of the Know-Nothing movement, [[Lewis C. Levin]], based his political career entirely on anti-Catholicism, and served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1845–1851), after which he campaigned for Fillmore and other "nativist" candidates.

After 1875 many states passed constitutional provisions, called "[[Blaine Amendments]], forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blaineamendments.org/Intro/whatis.html What are Blaine Amendments?], [http://www.blaineamendments.org blaineamendments.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021004190702/http://www.blaineamendments.org/ |date=2002-10-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Mauro, [http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/analysis.aspx?id=11498 High court agrees to settle Part II of voucher battle] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20031229015900/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/analysis.aspx?id=11498 |date=December 29, 2003 }}, May 20, 2003, [http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org First Amendment Center Online].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[United States Supreme Court]] partially vitiated these amendments, when they ruled that vouchers were constitutional if tax dollars followed a child to a school, even if it were religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bush, Jeb |url=http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2009/03/04/bushed0304.html?cxntlid=inform_artr | title =WILL PUBLIC SCHOOLS SUFFER UNDER VOUCHERS?

Anti-Catholicism was widespread in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Dumenil (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1928 presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]] was a rallying point for the Klan and the tide of anti-Catholicism in the U.S.  The Catholic ''[[National Shrine of the Little Flower|Church of the Little Flower]]'' was first built in 1925 in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], a largely Protestant area.  Two weeks after it opened, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in front of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Shannon |first1= William V. |authorlink1= William V.

In 1922, the voters of [[Oregon]] passed an [[initiative]] amending [[Oregon Revised Statutes|Oregon Law]] Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act.  The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law.  The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating [[parochial school]]s, including Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. Paul. [http://www.shibleyrighton.com/pdf/Howard/CEAArticleApril2001.pdf "Cross-Border Reflections, Parents’ Right to Direct Their Childrens’ Education Under the U.S. and Canadian Constitutions"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029102538/http://www.shibleyrighton.com/pdf/Howard/CEAArticleApril2001.pdf |date=October 29, 2008 }}, ''Education Canada'', v41 n2 p36-37 Sum 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools.  In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called "the Magna Carta of the parochial school system."

In 1928, [[Al Smith]] became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's nomination for president, and his religion became an issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1928|campaign]].  Many Protestants feared that Smith would take orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the country.

A key factor that hurt [[John F. Kennedy]] in his [[1960 U.S. Presidential election|1960 campaign for the presidency of the United States]] was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]], including [[Norman Vincent Peale]], believed that, if he were elected president, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[pope]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pxolK9z1zh0C&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Kennedy%20%22Norman%20Vincent%20Peale%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The first modern campaign: Kennedy, Nixon, and the election of 1960], Gary Donaldson, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;  To address fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, "I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters — and the Church does not speak for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html |title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association |accessdate=2007-09-17 |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |date=2002-06-18 |work=American Rhetoric |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802122054/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html |archivedate=2016-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic.

Kennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) – the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  ''[[The New York Times]]'', summarizing the discussion late in November, spoke of a "narrow consensus" among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5&lt;/ref&gt; as Catholics flocked to Kennedy to demonstrate their group solidarity in demanding political equality.

In 2011, The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] argued that the [[Obama Administration]] put an undue burden upon Catholics and forced them to violate their right to freedom of religion as part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].

===Situation of the Latter Day Saint movement 1820–90===
{{main|Anti-Mormonism}}
Historically, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which is often called [[Mormonism]], has been the victim of [[religious violence]] beginning with reports by founder [[Joseph Smith]] immediately after his [[First Vision]] 1820&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/20-25 Joseph Smith – History 1:20–25]&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing as the movement grew and migrated from its inception in western [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Ohio]], [[Missouri]], and [[Illinois]]. The violence culminated when Smith was [[death of Joseph Smith|assassinated]] by a mob of 200 men in [[Carthage Jail]] in 1844. Joseph Smith had surrendered himself previously to the authorities, who failed to protect him. As a result of the violence they were faced with in [[Eastern United States|the East]], the [[Mormon pioneers]], led by [[Brigham Young]], migrated westwards and eventually founded [[Salt Lake City]], and many other communities along the [[Mormon Corridor]].

Smith and his followers experienced relatively low levels of persecution in New York and Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;The historian [[Fawn M. Brodie]] ([[No Man Knows My History]], 119) speculated that one of [[John Johnson (Latter Day Saints)|John Johnson]]'s sons, Eli, meant to punish Smith by having him castrated for an intimacy with his sister, Nancy Marinda Johnson. However, historian [[Richard Lyman Bushman]] states that this hypothesis failed, partly because Eli was John Johnson's brother, not his son.

After a [[succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], most of the Mormons united under [[Brigham Young]], who organized an evacuation from Nauvoo and from the United States itself after the federal government refused to protect the Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph Fielding |authorlink=Joseph Fielding Smith |title=Church History and Modern Revelation |volume=4 |pages=167–173 |publisher=[[Deseret Book]] |date=1946–1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young and an eventual 50,000–70,000 would cross the [[Great Plains]] to settle in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the surrounding area. After the events of the [[Mexican–American War]], the area became a [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|United States territory]]. Young immediately petitioned for the addition of the [[State of Deseret]], but the federal government declined. Instead, Congress carved out the much smaller [[Utah Territory]]. Over the next 46 years, several actions of the federal government were directed at Mormons, specifically to curtail the practice of polygamy and to reduce their political and economic power. These included the [[Utah War]], [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], [[Poland Act]], [[Edmunds Act]], and [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]]. In 1890, LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued the [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]], ending polygamy.

With the concept of [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]], from 1830 to 1890 the Mormon faith allowed its members to practice [[polygamy]]; after 1843 this was limited to [[polygyny]] (one man could have several wives). The notion of polygamy was not only generally disdained by most of Joseph Smith's contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;in 1854 the Republican party referred to polygamy in its platform as one of the "twin relics of barbarism" (in addition to slavery). see: [[History of civil marriage in the U.S.]]&lt;/ref&gt; it is also contrary to the traditional [[Christian views of marriage|Christian understanding of marriage]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After 1844 the United States government passed legislation aimed specifically at the Mormon practice of [[polygamy]] until [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) officially renounced it.

United States]], the U.S. supreme court concluded that "religious duty" was not a suitable defense to an indictment for polygamy; therefore, a law against polygamy is not legally considered to [[Religious discrimination|discriminate against a religion]] that endorses polygamy. When their appeals to the courts and lawmakers were exhausted and once church leaders were satisfied that God had accepted what they saw as their sacrifice for the principle, the prophet leader of the church announced that he had received inspiration that God had accepted their obedience and rescinded the commandment for plural marriage. In 1890, an [[1890 Manifesto|official declaration]] was issued by the church prohibiting further plural marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Wardle |first1=Lynn D |last2=Nolan |first2=Laurence C. |title=Fundamental Principles of Family Law |publisher=Wm.

=== Situation of Native Americans ===

Aside from the general issues in the relations between Europeans and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] since the initial [[European colonization of the Americas]], there has been a historic suppression of Native American religions as well as some current charges of [[religious discrimination]] against Native Americans by the U.S. government.

With the practice of the [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|Americanization of Native Americans]], Native American children were [[Native American boarding schools|sent to Christian boarding schools]] where they were forced to worship as Christians and traditional customs were banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html ''Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208092347/http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html |date=2006-02-08 }} -[[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]] writing for [[Amnesty International]] Magazine on the historic government policy of forcing over 100,000 [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children to attend Christian boarding schools, and the subsequent social reverberations of "widespread sexual and physical abuse" suffered at the hands of school administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Freedom of Religion Act 1978, "spiritual leaders [of Native Americans] ran the risk of jail sentences of up to 30 years for simply practicing their rituals."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org – [http://www.religioustolerance.org/nataspir2.htm Native American Spirituality]&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Sun Dance]] was illegal from the 1880s (Canada) or 1904 (USA) to the 1980s.

Continuing charges of religious discrimination have largely centered on the [[eagle feather law]], the use of ceremonial [[peyote]], and the [[repatriation]] of Native American human remains and cultural and religious objects:

*The [[eagle feather law]], which governs the possession and religious use of eagle feathers, was written with the intention to protect then dwindling eagle populations on one hand while still protecting traditional Native American spiritual and religious customs, to which the use of eagle feather is central, on the other hand. As a result, the possession of eagle feathers is restricted to ethnic Native Americans, a policy that is seen as controversial for several reasons.
*[[Peyote]], a spineless cactus found in the desert southwest and [[Mexico]], is commonly used in certain traditions of Native American religion and spirituality, most notably in the [[Native American Church]].  Prior to the passage of the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] (AIRFA) in 1978, and as amended in 1994, the religious use of peyote was not afforded legal protection. This resulted in the arrest of many Native Americans and non-Native Americans participating in traditional indigenous religion and spirituality.
*Native Americans often hold strong personal and spiritual connections to their ancestors and often believe that their remains should rest undisturbed. This has often placed Native Americans at odds with archaeologists who have often dug on Native American burial grounds and other sites considered sacred, often removing artifacts and human remains – an act considered sacrilegious by many Native Americans. For years, Native American communities decried the removal of ancestral human remains and cultural and religious objects, charging that such activities are acts of [[genocide]], religious persecution, and [[discrimination]]. Many Native Americans called on the government, museums, and private collectors for the return of remains and sensitive objects for reburial. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which gained passage in 1990, established a means for Native Americans to request the return or "repatriation" of human remains and other sensitive cultural, religious, and funerary items held by federal agencies and federally assisted museums and institutions.

===Situation of atheists===

A 2006 study at the [[University of Minnesota]] showed atheists to be the most distrusted minority among Americans. In the study, [[sociology|sociologists]] Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann conducted a survey of American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups. 40% of respondents characterized atheists as a group that "does not at all agree with my vision of American society", putting atheists well ahead of every other group, with the next highest being Muslims (26%) and [[homosexual]]s (23%). When participants were asked whether they agreed with the statement, "I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group," atheists again led minorities, with 48% disapproval, followed by Muslims (34%) and [[African-American]]s (27%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volokh.com/posts/1144075320.shtml|title=Hostility to Atheism – The Last Socially Acceptable Prejudice?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Penny Edgell |first= |authorlink= |author2=Joseph Gerteis |author3=Douglas Hartmann  |date=April 2006 |title=Atheists As "Other": Moral Boundaries and Cultural Membership in American Society |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages= 211–234|id= |url=http://www2.asanet.org/journals/asr/2006/toc050.html |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1177/000312240607100203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Foley, co-chairman for Campus Atheists and Secular Humanists, commented on the results, "I know atheists aren't studied that much as a sociological group, but I guess atheists are one of the last groups remaining that it's still socially acceptable to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/03/24/67686|title=Survey: U.S. trust lowest for atheists}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[UBC|University of British Columbia]] study conducted in the United States found that believers distrust atheists as much as they distrust [[rapists]]. The study also showed that atheists have lower employment prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~will/Gervais%20et%20al-%20Atheist%20Distrust.pdf |title=Do You Believe in Atheists?

Several private organizations, the most notable being the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies#Position on religious belief|do not allow atheist members]].&lt;ref name="fi-md"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Discrimination against atheists: the facts | author = Downey, Margaret | authorlink = Margaret Downey | journal = [[Free Inquiry]] | volume = 24 | issue = 4 |date=June–July 2004 | pages = 41–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy has come under fire by organizations who assert that the Boy Scouts of America do benefit from taxpayer money and thus cannot be called a truly private organization, and thus must admit atheists, and others currently barred from membership. An organization called [[Scouting for All]], founded by [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] [[Steven Cozza]], is at the forefront of the movement.

====Court cases====

In the 1994 case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.FindLaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=U10355|title=FindLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet]]'', Supreme Court Justice [[David Souter]] wrote in the opinion for the Court that: "government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supct.Law.Cornell.edu/supct/html/93-517.ZS.html|title=Cornell Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Everson v. Board of Education]] established that "neither a state nor the Federal Government can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another". This applies the [[Establishment Clause]] to the states as well as the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Atheism.About.com/library/decisions/religion/bl_l_BoEEverson.htm|title=About Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] make the protection of persons from religious discrimination conditional on their acknowledgment of the existence of a [[deity]], making freedom of religion in those states inapplicable to atheists.&lt;ref name=RT1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RT2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RT3 /&gt; These state constitutional clauses have not been tested. [[Civil rights]] cases are typically brought in federal courts, so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance.

In ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'' (2004), after atheist [[Michael Newdow]] challenged the phrase "under God" in the United States [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found the phrase unconstitutional. Although the decision was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal, there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be legally usable without modification in schools in the [[western United States]], over which the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction. This resulted in political furor, and both houses of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed resolutions condemning the decision, unanimously.&lt;ref name="CNN_Senators ..."&gt;{{cite news|url=http://Archives.CNN.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/26/senate.resolution.pledge/index.html|title=CNN|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2010-05-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707082104/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/26/senate.resolution.pledge/index.html|archivedate=2009-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-dominated group of 100–150 congressmen stood outside the capital and recited the pledge, showing how much they disagreed with the decision.&lt;ref name="CNN_Senators ..." /&gt; The Supreme Court subsequently reversed the decision, ruling that Newdow did not have [[standing (law)|standing]] to bring his case, thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge.

=== Case studies ===
*The [[Eagle Feather Law]], which governs the possession and [[religious]] use of [[eagle]] feathers, was officially written to protect then dwindling eagle populations while still protecting traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[religious]] customs, of which the use of eagles are central. The Eagle Feather Law later met charges of promoting racial and religious discrimination due to the law's provision authorizing the possession of eagle feathers to members of only one ethnic group, Native Americans, and forbidding Native Americans from including non-Native Americans in [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] customs involving eagle feathers—a common modern practice dating back to the early 16th century.
*Charges of religious and racial discrimination have also been found in the education system. In a recent example, the dormitory policies at [[Boston University]] and The [[University of South Dakota]] were charged with racial and religious discrimination when they forbade a university dormitory resident from [[smudging]] while praying. The policy at The [[University of South Dakota]] was later changed to permit students to pray while living in the university dorms.
* In 2004, a case involving five Ohio prison inmates (two followers of [[Ásatrú in the United States|Asatru]] (a modern form of [[Norse paganism]]), a minister of the [[Church of Jesus Christ Christian]], a [[Wicca]]n witch ([[neopaganism]])), and a [[Satanist]] protesting denial of access to ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship was brought before the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60916FC355F0C708DDDA90994DC404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fS%2fSupreme%20Court%20 NY Times: Justices Will Hear 2 Church-State Cases]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Globe]] reports on the 2005 decision of ''[[Cutter v.

'''George Francis Rayner Ellis''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], Hon. [[FRSSAf]] (born 11 August 1939), is the emeritus distinguished professor of [[complex systems]] in the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Cape Town]] in  [[South Africa]]. He co-authored ''[[The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time]]'' with [[University of Cambridge]] physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], published in 1973, and is considered one of the world's leading theorists in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, W.W. (1995) ''Profile: George F. R. Ellis &amp;ndash; Thinking Globally Acting Universally'', [[Scientific American]] '''273'''(4), 50-55.&lt;/ref&gt; He is an active [[Quaker]] and in 2004 he won the [[Templeton Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040324154541/http://www.templetonprize.org/news_templetonprize_2004.html Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 to 1992 he served as president of the [[International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation]]. He is a past president of the [[International Society for Science and Religion]]. He is an A-rated researcher with the [[National Research Foundation of South Africa|NRF]].

Ellis was a vocal opponent of [[apartheid]] during the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] reign in the 1970s and 1980s, and it is during this period that Ellis's research has focused on the more philosophical aspects of [[cosmology]], for which he won the [[Templeton Prize]].  He was also awarded the [[Order of the Star of South Africa]] by [[Nelson Mandela]], in 1999. On 18 May 2007, he was elected a [[fellow]] of the British [[Royal Society]].

In 2005 Ellis appeared as a guest speaker at the Nobel Conference in [[St. Peter, Minnesota]].

==Life==
Born in 1939 to George Rayner Ellis, a newspaper editor, and Gwendoline Hilda MacRobert Ellis in Johannesburg, George Francis Rayner Ellis attended the [[University of Cape Town]], where he graduated with honours in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics with distinction. He represented the university in fencing, rowing and flying.

While a student at [[Cambridge University]], where he received a PhD in applied maths and theoretical physics in 1964, he was on college rowing teams.

At Cambridge, Ellis served as a research fellow from 1965 to 1967, was assistant lecturer in the [[Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] until 1970, and was then appointed university lecturer, serving until 1974.

Ellis became a visiting professor at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, a lecturer at the [[Cargese Summer School]] in Corsica in 1971 and the [[Erice Summer School]] in Sicily in 1972, and a visiting H3 professor at the [[University of Hamburg]], also in 1972.

The following year, Ellis co-wrote ''[[The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time]]'' with [[Stephen Hawking]], debuting at a strategic moment in the development of [[General Relativity Theory]].

In the following year, Ellis returned to South Africa to accept an appointment as professor of applied mathematics at the [[University of Cape Town]], a position he held until his retirement in 2005.

George Ellis has worked for many decades on anisotropic cosmologies (Bianchi models) and [[inhomogeneous cosmology|inhomogeneous universe]]s, and on the philosophy of cosmology.&lt;ref name="Issue in the Philosophy of cosmology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=George|title=Handbook in Philosophy of Physics |date=2006 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=0-444-53002-9|pages=1183–1285}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently writing on the emergence of complexity, and the way this is enabled by top-down causation in the hierarchy of complexity.&lt;ref name="Top down causation and emergence: some comments on mechanisms"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=George |title=Top down causation and emergence: some comments on mechanisms |journal=Royal Society Interface Focus |date=6 February 2012|volume=2|issue=2|pages=126–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[philosophy of science]], Ellis is a [[Platonist]].&lt;ref name="True Complexity and its Associated Ontology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=George|title=Science and Ultimate Reality: Quantum Theory, Cosmology and Complexity|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-83113-X|pages=607–636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindu art''' encompasses the artistic traditions and styles culturally connected to [[Hinduism]] and have a long history of religious association with Hindu scriptures, rituals and worship.

==Background==
[[Hinduism]], with its [[Hinduism by country|1 billion followers]], it makes up about 15% of the world’s population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape - Hinduism|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-hindu.aspx|work=A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Major Religious Groups as of 2010|publisher=The pew foundation|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art.  There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;”Heart of Hinduism: Sanskrit and Sanskriti (Culture).” 2004, 30 Mar 2009. &lt; http://hinduism.iskcon.com/lifestyle/801.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

*Singing
*Instrumental music
**Learning music in [[Hindu culture]] was a difficult task before the 20th century because of a necessary birth into a [[gharana]]. After the early 1920s integration of anyone wanting to learn classical Hindustani music could. An average ensemble normally includes a harmonium (which was brought to India by westerners), flute, [[veena]], [[sitar]], swaramandala, and a tabla. Many of the songs have strong themes that are related to theology such as a god’s favorite pastimes, praise of any god whether they be in their original form from “the trinity” or the god's reincarnation, even stories of the creation of earth. Since instrumental music is a performance art it must follow strict guidelines that come from the treatise Natya Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Beck, Guy. “Hindu music, now and into the future.” Hinduism Today October/November/December 2007. 28-31. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1515&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

**Drapery- The art of drapery has progressed over time. At one point both men and women wore dhotis but around the 14th century that changed and women’s fashion became more intricate thus creating the sari. The drapery involved distinguishes the wearer’s taste, occupation, and social status. The fabrics chosen range from cotton and synthetic fabrics all the way to silk. The fabric chosen depends on what occasion the wearer is going to use the item of clothing for. The draping of the sari comes in four different families: [[Marvari]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], Tribal, and Nivi. The family that the wearer chooses depends on the wearer’s personal taste. The way an item of clothing is draped tells a lot about the wearer such as expression of creativity, progression of fashion, and where the user comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Boulanger, Chantal. “The Remarkable Indian Art of Draping.” Hinduism Today.

==Historic Texts on Art Practices==

*Natya Shastra
**The Natya Shastra is the leading guide to the Hindu performing arts. It is based on the Natya Veda, which no longer exists, and is roughly 37 chapters long with 6,000 [[slokas]].&lt;ref&gt;“Natya Shastra: Encyclopedia II.” 29 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Natya_Shastra_-_Text_and_title/id/1793036&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities Dedicated to the Production of Art==

*Raghupajpur
**This city is solely dedicated to the production of artwork that is driven by the divine forces of Hinduism and these artworks are produced in a traditional fashion. The city is located in Eastern India (Orissa) and at one point this city was at risk of being completely destroyed due to British rule{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. During this time religion and the power of the kings were being overthrown and as such there was no reason for a city to exist whose main purpose is to supply traditional art. After this crisis occurred the city began to exclusively base itself on agriculture until a man named Jacnnath Mopatra led a training center for chitrakars. This revolution began production of the traditional art works once again in the 1950s and since the work being produced is known internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohanty, M.P. “Living, Painting, Worshipping Art.” Hinduism Today. July/August/September 2007. 54-59. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Symbols==

*Extra Limbs-Extra limbs are seen on many of the Hindu deities in paintings and sculptures. The extra limbs show how much power the god is capable of because of their ability to perform many tasks at once. Such as the goddess [[Sarasvati]] always has a minimum of four arms. Two of the arms will be playing a vina, representing the tuning of her knowledge, prayer beads in another hand and a scripture in another, both of these items are used to represent her devotion to her spirituality. Since she is the goddess of learning and art we see that she is very capable and very powerful in her area of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp. “Saravasti, the Goddess of Learning.” 20 Mar 2009. &lt; http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lotus Flower-The lotus flower is another common item seen constantly throughout the arts. The lotus flower represents purity, beauty, prosperity, fertility, and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Anil K. Goel, Lucknow. “God’s Favorite Flower.” Hinduism Today. 1999. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4411&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason the flower shows these attributes is due to the process in which the lotus flower goes through in order to blossom. The flower grows out of mud and rests atop the water in which it grows showing the hardship it must endure in order to achieve maximum beauty. Many deities have their name based on the Sanskrit word for lotus such as Lakshimi.&lt;ref&gt;“Lotus-Hindu Symbols” Religion Facts. 2007. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/lotus.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang Yi-Jui, later known as Grand Master '''Hun Yuan''' (born 2 February 1944 in [[Zhongliao, Nantou]], Taiwan), is the founder of [[Weixinism]], also known as Weixin Shengjiao, one of the largest Taiwanese [[new religious movement]]s. 
He is also the author of several books on [[I Ching]] and [[Feng Shui]] and a prolific painter.

==Life==
Chang Yi-Jui was born in 2 February 1944 in Zhongliao Township, Nantou County, Taiwan.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; For the first thirty-eight years of his life, he was not particularly interested in religion, although he developed an early interest in the philosophical and practical wisdom of the traditional Chinese systems [[I Ching]] and [[Feng Shui]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Chang (2016), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1963, he graduated at the Land Survey Department of Kuang-Hwa Senior Industrial Vocational High School in [[Taichung City]], Taiwan. He remained in the School as a teacher of Engineering Measurement. He was also the founder of Zhong Xin Measuring Ltd., known as the first company of land surveying in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016a), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
His business career came to an unexpected halt in 1982, when Chang fell seriously ill. He attributed his seemingly miraculous recovery to a divine intervention, and decided from then on to consecrate his life to religion. He claimed to have received revelations from [[Guiguzi]], a name indicating a book of military strategy written between the late [[Warring States]] period and the end of the [[Han Dynasty]] and by extension its real or mythological author, later deified in [[Chinese folk religion]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Chang then went to a pilgrimage to Mount Dawu, in [[Taitung County]], Taiwan, accompanied by some friends. On the mountain, he claimed to have received a new revelation. He reported that the [[Jade Emperor]], a popular character in Chinese folk religion, admonished him “never to be selfish” and to “encourage people for self-cultivation.”&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016a), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1983, Chang started putting his vow to devote his life to religion into practice. He opened a family hall called Yi Yao She in Taichung City, where he started teaching I Ching and offering divination services to the followers he had gathered. One year later, Yi Yao She was renamed [[Shennong]] Temple and Chang claimed to have received the Buddhist name and title “Grand Master Hun Yuan” by divine revelation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He claimed to be mystically united with the Bodhisattva Wang Chan Lao Zu, who had once incarnated on Earth as Guiguzi, and to receive regular revelations from him.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2016), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1987, the [[Martial law in Taiwan]] was lifted, and Grand Master Hun Yuan was allowed to expand its activities and eventually to legally register a movement known as Weixin Shengjiao, or [[Weixinism]], literally “Sacred Teachings of the Heart (or Mind) Only.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The movement opened its new and larger headquarters in 1987 in [[Nantou County]], where the Hsien Fo Temple was inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016a), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, it was followed by 42 branch temples, where religious rituals are performed and courses of I Ching and Feng Shui are offered on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;See Chang (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Hun Yuan hold what he called the 99 Days Chanting Ceremony and taught his first research classes on I Ching and Feng Shui.&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016a), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Feng Shui World View'', published in 1995, made Hun Yuan known to a larger public in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the same year, the convention “Propagating the Dharma of Feng Shui for the Home” at Linkou Stadium, Taipei, drew a crowd of 36,000.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Weixinism==
[[File:Italian iPhone 2779.jpg|thumb|Grand Master Hun Yuan blessing a child]]
Hun Yuan is primarily known as the founder and leader of [[Weixinism]] or Weixin Shengjiao, a Taiwanese new religion with a presence among the Chinese diaspora in other countries and with some Western followers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Its global membership is "about 300,000, with a larger audience estimated by Taiwan's Ministry of Internal Affairs at 1,000,000".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Weixin Shengjiao has been described as an institutionalization of traditional Chinese folk religion, centered on the worship of Guiguzi and of the Three Chinese Ancestors, the [[Yellow Emperor]], [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] and [[Chiyou]], and on the divulgation of I Ching and Feng Shui as systems of practical and not only philosophical wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2016), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
The canon of Weixin Shengjiao includes scriptures of [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Taoism]], as well as the large corpus of revelations Hun Yuan claims to receive from Guiguzi, collected in the sixteen volumes of the ''Apocalypse Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;Chang(2016), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; All the speeches and writings, and in fact all the daily utterances, of Hun Yuan, are collected in the ''Weixin Dao Zang'', which, by 2017, had reached the extraordinary size of more than 18,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2010-).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hun Yuan is the author of several volumes popularizing I Ching and Feng Shui. One, collecting his Yang House Feng Shui Lectures, was translated into English in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016b).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education Facilities==
In 1996, Hun Yuan founded a continuing education facility known as I Ching University, while the parallel institution Weixin College served as an academic facility for the study of I Ching and Feng Shui and was accredited as a university by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2016), p. 5; Ministry of Education (Taiwan) 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, I Ching University stated that, from its foundation, it had completed twenty-three year-long courses, and the number of its students had exceeded sixty thousand. In 2016, I Ching University started acknowledging “''pingxin'' virtuous fellows,” i.e students who had studied there for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;See Chen and Li (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television programs==
In 1997, Hun Yuan started what would become a long career as teacher of I Ching and Feng Shui via television. He became a familiar face for Taiwanese TV viewers, and in 1998 presented his ideas overseas through his first international tour.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The movement claimed that the number of television programs and series of lectures on Feng Shui by Hun Yuan airing in different countries around the world in 2017 exceeded five hundred.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLba9-oIbpHgcqcphWpt0sdi_moSEGsGz |title=陽宅風水學傳法講座 |trans-title=Yang House Feng Shui Studies Dharma Preaching Lecture |medium=Youtube Video}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian Activities==
[[File:Hun Yuan Book.jpg|thumb|Grand Master Hun Yuan autographing a book]]
In 1996, Hun Yuan founded the “Pure Land in This World Chinese Merit Foundation.” Its original aim was to propagate I Ching and Feng Shui. In 1999, however, the devastating [[1999 Jiji earthquake]] struck Taiwan. Hun Yuan mobilized the members of the Foundation and sent them to the afflicted areas. They taught how to rebuild [[anti-seismic]] public buildings and homes by using the principles of Feng Shui, but also provided help to affected families.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The movement reported that the number of Taiwanese families that received help from the Foundation exceeded three thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Jian (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the name of the Foundation was changed to “Weixin Shengjiao Merit Foundation.” According to the movement, the current number of members is around sixty thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Wu (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations between Taiwan and China==
[[File:Ancestor Ceremony 2016.jpg|thumb|Unified Ancestor Worship Ceremony, Taipei 2016]]
In 2001,with the stated aim of improving the relationships between Taiwan and China, Hun Yuan organized in Taipei what became the first of a series of annual conferences on Guiguzi, featuring scholars from the two sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] and reached an agreement with the authorities of the Chinese province of [[Henan]] to build there a Town of Chinese Culture, or City of Eight Trigrams (a name derived from the I Ching), featuring several temples.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, Hun Yuan established the Gui Gu Zi Academic and Research Association, whose stated aim is to trace the origins and foundations of Chinese culture. In particular, the Association compiled a list of 15,615 Chinese family clan names,&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2004a).&lt;/ref&gt; 917 names of emperors who ruled in China,&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2004b).&lt;/ref&gt; and 3,762 wars which plagued Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 
For Hun Yuan, collecting these names does not serve a purely scholarly purpose but also a religious one. In 2004, he organized in the Linkou Stadium, Taipei, the first “Unified Ancestor Worship Ceremony for Chinese in the 21st Century,” honoring all the ancestors of the Chinese peoples, particularly those who had died in different wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016a), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds in excess of 30,000 attend these ceremonies held each year on January 1.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2016); Chang (2016), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Presidents of the republic of Taiwan and other senior political leaders have also participated in the ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;See Weixin Shengjiao (2004), p. 90, and Weixin Shengjiao (2008), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, [[Wu Ching-ji]], then Taiwan’s Minister of the Education, announced during a conference on Feng Shui that Hun Yuan had been nominated as a candidate for the [[2013 Nobel Peace Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;See video at http://hunyuan.tw/?disp=wisdom&amp;m=1&amp;s=23&amp;n=68&amp;p=9739. Wu’s announcement is from minutes 6'18" to 7'05”.&lt;/ref&gt; (which was finally awarded to the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]]).

==Artistic Production==
[[File:Hun_Yuan,_The_Stable_Nation_of_the_Golden_Dragon.jpg|thumb|right|Hun Yuan, ''The Stable Nation of the Golden Dragon'']]
Hun Yuan is also a prolific painter. Although rooted in the tradition of [[Chinese calligraphy]] and [[ink wash painting]], his large works, often depicting dragons, are realized in a distinctive style. He often demonstrates publicly how they are produced in a few seconds with a single brush stroke applying black ink to [[Xuan paper]].&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995); Chang (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; All branch temples of Weixin Shengjiao store paintings by Hun Yuan, but the largest collection is now at Weixin Museum, a museum that is part of Weixin Shengjiao’s headquarters in Nantou County.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, and the movement itself. regard as most significant the 108 pieces of dragon-shaped ''ruyi'' ("auspicious," literally “everything goes as one wishes”) calligraphy, including the frequently reproduced ''The Stable Nation of the Golden Dragon''.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;
Hun Yuan has also produced designs for building and gardens. The movement reported that the landscape design of the Hsien Fo Temple was based on a project by Hun Yuan, who insisted that the layout of the buildings should correspond with the shape of the nearby mountains to create a feeling of harmonious unity, based on both Feng Shui and [[Zen]].&lt;ref&gt;See  [http://www.cjs.org.tw/index.htm “禪機山仙佛寺全球資訊網 (The official website of Chan Chi Shan Hsien Fo Temple).”]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the movement, Hun Yuan also supplied designs for the two Eight Trigrams Holy City that Weixin Shengjiao is building in Henan, China and in Nantou County, Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photo.cjs.tw/?f=gallery|title=禪機山視覺影像館  - 唯心宗 - 唯心聖教|website=photo.cjs.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes used as a [[premedication]] (especially to reduce [[respiratory tract]] [[secretions]]) to [[surgery]], mostly commonly by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]].&lt;ref name = BNF/&gt;&lt;ref name = AMH/&gt;

===Pregnancy===
Hyoscine crosses the [[placenta]] and is a United States [[Pregnancy category#United States|pregnancy category C]] and [[Pregnancy category#Australia|Australian Category B1]] medication, meaning a risk to the [[fetus]] cannot be ruled out. Sufficient studies in women and animals are not available to rule out harm, but existing studies have not shown increased risk. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. It may cause respiratory depression and/or [[neonatal]] [[hemorrhage]] when used during pregnancy. [[Transdermal]] hyoscine has been used as an adjunct to [[epidural anesthesia]] for [[Cesarean section|Caesarean delivery]] without adverse CNS effects on the newborn. Except when used prior to Caesarean section, it should only be used during pregnancy if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

===Breastfeeding===
Hyoscine enters [[breast milk]] by [[secretion]]. Although no human studies exist to document the safety of hyoscine while nursing, the manufacturer recommends that caution be taken if hyoscine is administered to a breastfeeding woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |title=Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation |date=1994 |publisher=Williams and Wilkins |location=Baltimore, MD |pages=777–778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elderly===
The likelihood of experiencing adverse effects from hyoscine is increased in the elderly relative to younger people. This phenomenon is especially true for older people who are also on several other medications. It is recommended that hyoscine use should be avoided in this age group because of these potent anticholinergic adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flicker|author2=Ferris |title=Hypersensitivity to scopolamine in the elderly |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=1992 |pages=437–441 |pmid=1615141 |volume=107 |issue=2–3 |doi=10.1007/bf02245172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barash|title=Clinical anesthesia |year=2009 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7817-8763-5 |page=346 |edition=6 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than this [[supportive treatment]], [[gastric lavage]] and induced [[emesis]] (vomiting) are usually recommended as treatments for oral overdoses.&lt;ref name = EMChyd/&gt; The symptoms of overdose include:&lt;ref name = EMCBut/&gt;&lt;ref name = EMChyd/&gt;

* [[Enzyme inhibitor|Inhibition]] of [[gastrointestinal motility]]

==Interactions==
Due to interactions with metabolism of other drugs, hyoscine can cause significant unwanted side effects when taken with other medications. Specific attention should be paid to other medications in the same [[Pharmacology|pharmacologic]] class as hyoscine, also known as [[anticholinergic]]s. The following medications could potentially interact with the metabolism of hyoscine: [[analgesics]]/pain medications, [[ethanol]], [[zolpidem]], [[thiazide diuretics]], [[buprenorphine]], anticholinergic drugs such as [[Tiotropium bromide|tiotropium]], etc.

==Route of administration==
Hyoscine can be taken by mouth, [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]], [[Eye drop|ophthalmically]] and [[intravenous]]ly, as well as via a [[transdermal patch]].&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite journal |author = White, P.

Although it is usually referred to as a nonspecific antimuscarinic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scopolamine+nonselective&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C11|website=scholar.google.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is indirect evidence for [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|m1-receptor subtype]] specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The relative selectivity of anticholinergic drugs for the M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes.|journal=Movement Disorders|author=Burke, RE|date=1986|volume=1|issue=2|pages=135–144|doi=10.1002/mds.870010208|pmid=2904117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis in plants==
Hyoscine is among the [[secondary metabolites]] of plants from [[Solanaceae]] (nightshade) family of plants, such as [[henbane]], [[jimson weed]] (''[[Datura]]''), angel's trumpets (''[[Brugmansia]]''), and corkwood (''[[Duboisia]]'').&lt;ref name = "Muranaka_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Muranaka, T. |author2=Ohkawa, H. |author3=Yamada, Y. |title = Continuous Production of Scopolamine by a Culture of ''Duboisia leichhardtii'' Hairy Root Clone in a Bioreactor System |journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume = 40 |issue = 2–3 |pages = 219–223 |year = 1993 |doi = 10.1007/BF00170370 |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g7x30m6495332j8j/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

The [[biosynthesis]] of hyoscine begins with the [[decarboxylation]] of [[L-ornithine]] to [[putrescine]] by [[ornithine decarboxylase]]. Putrescine is [[Methylation|methylated]] to N-methylputrescine by [[putrescine N-methyltransferase]].&lt;ref name="Ziegler2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziegler J, Facchini PJ | title = Alkaloid biosynthesis: metabolism and trafficking | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 735–69 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18251710 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[putrescine oxidase]] that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the [[deamination]] of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal, which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to N-[[methyl]]-[[pyrrole|pyrrolium]] cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with [[acetoacetic acid]] yielding [[hygrine]]. No [[enzymatic]] activity could be demonstrated to catalyze this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to [[tropinone]].&lt;ref name="Ziegler2008" /&gt;

Subsequently, [[tropinone reductase I]] converts [[tropinone]] to [[tropine]] which condenses with [[phenylalanine]]-derived phenyllactate to [[littorine]]. A [[cytochrome P450]] classified as Cyp80F1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li R, Reed DW, Liu E, Nowak J, Pelcher LE, Page JE, Covello PS | title = Functional genomic analysis of alkaloid biosynthesis in Hyoscyamus niger reveals a cytochrome P450 involved in littorine rearrangement | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–20 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16720272 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine [[aldehyde]]. In the final step, [[hyoscyamine]] undergoes [[epoxidation]] catalyzed by [[6beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine epoxidase]] yielding hyoscine.&lt;ref name="Ziegler2008" /&gt;

==History==
One of the earlier alkaloids isolated from plant sources, hyoscine has been in use in its purified forms (such as various salts, including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide and sulfate), since its isolation by the German scientist [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ladenburg |first1=Albert |title=Die natürlich vorkommenden mydriatisch wirkenden Alkaloïde |journal=Annalen der Chemie |date=1881 |volume=206 |issue=3 |pages=274–307 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hx3khy;view=1up;seq=690 |trans-title=The naturally occurring alkaloids that act mydriatically [i.e., to dilate the pupils] |language=German}} ; see pp. 299–307.&lt;/ref&gt; and as various preparations from its plant-based form since antiquity and perhaps prehistoric times. Following the description of the structure and activity of hyoscine by Ladenburg, the search for synthetic analogues of and methods for total synthesis of hyoscine and/or [[atropine]] in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in the discovery of [[diphenhydramine]], an early antihistamine and the prototype of its chemical subclass of these drugs, and [[pethidine]], the first fully synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]], known as Dolatin and Demerol amongst many other trade names.

In 1899, a Dr. Schneiderlin recommended the use of hyoscine and [[morphine]] for surgical anaesthesia and it started to be used for purpose, sporadically.&lt;ref name=Keys/&gt;&lt;ref name=canadian&gt;{{cite journal |last=|first= |date=August 1915|title= Twilight Sleep: the Dammerschlaf of the Germans|journal= The Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume= 5|issue= 9|pages= 805–8|pmc=1584452|pmid=20310688}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The use of this combination in [[obstetric anesthesiology]], was first proposed by Richard von Steinbuchel in 1902 then was picked up and further developed by Carl Gauss in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]] starting in 1903.&lt;ref name=nyt_invest&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=TWILIGHT SLEEP; Is Subject of a New Investigation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05EED8113EE733A05752C3A9679C946496D6CF|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1915-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method came to be known as "Dämmerschlaf" ("twilight sleep") or the "Freiburg method".&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt_invest/&gt; It spread rather slowly, and different clinics experimented with different dosages and ingredients; in 1915 The Canadian Medical Association Journal reported that "the method [was] really still in a state of development".&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;  It remained widely used in the US until the 1960s, when growing [[chemophobia]] and a desire for more [[natural childbirth]] led to its abandonment.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Finkbeiner |first1=Ann |title=Labor Dispute.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
''Hyoscine hydrobromide'' is the [[international nonproprietary name]], and ''scopolamine hydrobromide'' is the [[United States Adopted Name]]. Other names include ''levo-duboisine'', ''devil's breath'' and ''burundanga''.&lt;ref name="Uribe_et_al_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uribe-Granja |first1=Manuel |last2=Moreno-López |first2=Claudia L. |last3=Zamora S. |first3=Adriana |last4=Acosta |first4=Pilar J. |title=Perfil epidemiológico de la intoxicación con burundanga en la clínica Uribe Cualla S.

===Recreational use===
While it has been occasionally used recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties, the experiences are often unpleasant, mentally and physically. It is also physically dangerous, so repeated use is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Freye |first = E. |title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs |chapter = Toxicity of Datura Stramonium |publisher = Springer |year = 2010 |location = Netherlands |pages = 217–218 |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u42k03r4v3234615/ |isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 |doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2448-0_34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, more than 20 people were hospitalized with [[psychosis]] in [[Norway]] after ingesting counterfeit [[Rohypnol]] tablets containing hyoscine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2507100.ece |title=Bilsykemedisin i falske rohypnol-tabletter |newspaper=Aftenposten.no |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627021428/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2507100.ece |archivedate=27 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, 9 individuals were hospitalised in Perth, Western Australia, after reportedly ingesting hyoscine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-04/toxicology-results-from-perth-mass-overdose-expected-today/9303330|title=Perth backpacker overdose linked to common anti-nausea drug|date=2018-01-04|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interrogation===
The effects of hyoscine were studied for use as a [[truth serum]] in interrogations in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = House |first = R.

===Crime===
In 1910, hyoscine was detected in the remains believed to be those of Cora Crippen, wife of Dr. [[Hawley Harvey Crippen]], and was accepted at the time as the cause of her death, since her husband was known to have bought some at the start of the year.&lt;ref name="Crippen"&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Filson |editor1-last=Young |year=1920 |title=The Trial of Hawley Harvey Crippen |series=Notable Trials Series |location=Edinburgh |publisher=William Hodge &amp; Company |page=xxvii; see also evidence, pp. 68–77 |oclc=22125100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVpLjoLpI0C&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=hyoscin |access-date=6 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003845/https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVpLjoLpI0C&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=hyoscin |archivedate=4 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug is known to produce [[anterograde amnesia|loss of memory following exposure]] and [[somnolence|sleepiness]], similar to the effect of [[benzodiazepines]] or [[alcohol poisoning]], which affects the ability of a person to resist criminal aggression.  A travel advisory published by the United States Department of State in 2012 stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use in order to rob a victim is through the use of drugs. The most common [in Colombia] has been hyoscine. Unofficial estimates put the number of annual hyoscine incidents in Colombia at approximately 50,000. Hyoscine can render a victim unconscious for 24 hours or more. In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death. It is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in night clubs and bars, and usually men, perceived to be wealthy, are targeted by young, attractive women. To avoid becoming a victim of hyoscine, one should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances or leave food or beverages unattended. Victims of hyoscine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12118 |title=Colombia 2012 Crime and Safety Report: Cartagena |date=4 March 2012 |publisher=[[Overseas Security Advisory Council]], [[United States Department of State]] |access-date=6 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315175638/https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12118 |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About one in five emergency room admissions for poisoning in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], have been attributed to hyoscine.&lt;ref name="Uribe_et_al_2005"/&gt;  Most commonly, the victim has been poisoned by a robber who  gave the victim a scopolamine-laced beverage, in the hope that the victim would become unconscious or unable to effectively resist the robbery.&lt;ref name="Uribe_et_al_2005"/&gt;

The '''International Bible Training Institute''' (IBTI) is an evangelical, Pentecostal [[Bible college]] based in [[Burgess Hill]], [[West Sussex]], United Kingdom. It is a [[residential college]] and has been involved with [[Christian mission]] work and relief work abroad since it was founded by Fred H. Squire in 1947. The college offers three types of [[Biblical studies]]. The current directors are John and Eliana Whyte.

As a Bible college, the IBTI is run as a [[Charitable organization|charity]] and accredited by [[Accreditation Service for International Colleges|ASIC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asic.org.uk/institution-profiles/international-bible-training-institute-ibti/|title=Welcome to ASIC|last=|first=|date=2013-09-04|work=ASIC - Accreditation Service for International Schools, Colleges &amp; Universities|access-date=2017-05-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lists the IBTI as being one of their “Premiere Colleges”. Two of the study courses in Applied [[Theology]] offered by the IBTI are accredited by [[Northern Council for Further Education|NCFE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncfe.org.uk/|title=Home|website=www.ncfe.org.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The college was started the college in 1947 by [[Evangelism|evangelist]] Fred H. Squire in the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Squire believed people's biggest need was faith in [[Jesus Christ]]. Following the first World Pentecostal Conference organised by the [[Pentecostal World Fellowship]] in 1947 in [[Zurich]], Squire began the project. In the same year, the first students from England, Italy, Holland, Indonesia and Switzerland were taken in free of charge for two years. They came .

As the number of students increased annually, in 1947 it moved from [[Leamington Spa]] to Hook Place in Burgess Hill where it is still based today. The IBTI became increasingly involved with relief work, in Europe especially during the [[postwar reconstruction]] and the [[Cold War]], but later expanding its mission work to countries in Africa and other parts of the world.

Every summer from 1952 to 1999, the IBTI ran a ten-day camp convention to raise awareness for missions and funds for the college, and ministering to hundreds of people who came to IBTI for the occasion.

In 1974, the Field Office of the European Evangelistic Society was located at the IBTI, which later became the Administrative Offices of the [[Assemblies of God in Great Britain|AOG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aog.org.uk/|title=Assemblies of God {{!}} Great Britain|website=www.aog.org.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action Europe branch of Missions. Eventually, the whole department of AOG Overseas Missions was based at IBTI, with John P. Wildrianne fulfilling the role as AOG Mission Director for many years. Today the IBTI still cooperates with AOG GB (page/website) as well as other denominations and churches.

During 1976, the IBTI's leaders (John P. Wildrianne and Jean-Jacques Zbinden) established the “Burgess Hill Pentecostal Church” which moved to a different venue in the [[town centre]] of Burgess Hill once it grew beyond the capacity of the IBTI chapel. It later became Mid-Sussex Christian Centre and is now called “Centre Church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://centrechurch.uk/about-us/history/|title=Our History - Centre Church|work=Centre Church|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The college is midway through building a new facility which will include new accommodation for students, and provide a hub for networking between students, staff and the community, a larger [[chapel]], and an IT and media room.

== Study courses ==
The IBTI offers three courses in Applied Theology which differ: in duration, the extent of modules covered and the award issued after completion. None of the IBTI awards are for a nationally regulated qualification, they are internal awards. Applied Theology is a sub-field of [[practical theology]].
* Certificate in Applied Theology: The Certificate in Applied Theology is a one-year course combining introductory teaching in theology with opportunities to make first practical steps into Christian ministry. This course is awarded with an IBTI Certificate in Applied Theology when completed.
* Diploma in Applied Theology: This is the two-year course in Applied Theology. In the first year of this course, the modules are identical to the Certificate in Applied Theology course. Students completing this course are awarded an IBTI internal Diploma in Applied Theology and a Certificate of Achievement accredited by NCFE.
* Missional Leadership Course: The Missional Leadership Course is a six months course designed specifically for people who have already been involved in Christian ministry or for non-EU students who can apply for a UK student visitor visa for six months. Some of the second-year modules of the Diploma Course are contained within this course. This study programme is awarded with an IBTI Certificate in Missional Leadership and a Certificate of Achievement in Missional Leadership accredited by NCFE.

[[Irreligion]] and [[atheism]] have a long history and a large demographic constitution in [[France]], with the advancement of atheism and the deprecation of theistic religion dating back as far as the [[French Revolution]]. In 2015, according to estimates, at least 29% of the country's population identifies as atheists and 63% identifies as non-religious.&lt;ref name="obs2015"&gt;{{Fr}} [http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2015/01/18/carte-latheisme-monde-france-numero-4-257171 La carte de l’athéisme dans le monde : la France numéro 4], [[L'Obs]], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Renaissance and Reformation===
The word ''atheism'' was derived from the French ''{{lang|fr|[[wikt:athéisme|athéisme]]}}'' in about 1587.&lt;ref name="Golding"&gt;Rendered as ''Athisme'': {{cite book |last=Golding |first=Arthur |author2=[[Philip Sidney]]  |authorlink=Arthur Golding |title=[[Philippe de Mornay|Mornay's]] Woorke concerning the Trewnesse of the Christian Religion, written in French; Against Atheists, Epicures, Paynims, Iewes, Mahumetists, and other infidels |publisher=London |year=1587 |pages=xx. 310 |quote=Athisme, that is to say, vtter godlesnes.}} Translation of ''De la verite de la religion chrestienne'' (1581).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''atheist'' (from Fr. ''{{lang|fr|[[wikt:athée|athée]]}}''), in the sense of "one who denies or disbelieves the existence of God",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50014052 atheist}}&lt;/ref&gt; predates ''atheism'' in English, being first attested in about 1571.&lt;ref&gt;Rendered as ''Atheistes'': {{cite book |last=Golding |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Golding |title=The Psalmes of David and others, with [[John Calvin|J. Calvin]]'s commentaries |year=1571 |pages=Ep. Ded. 3 |quote=The Atheistes which say..there is no God.}} Translated from French.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecutions===
[[File:Chevalier de la barre statuecouleur.png|230px|thumb|Monument to the Chevalier de La Barre - Paris, 18th arr. at  Sacré-Cœur de Montmartre, circa 1906.]]
Until the Enlightenment, those who embraced a non-theistic belief were regarded as being immoral or amoral, and profession of atheism was considered to be a punishable crime.

Scholar [[Étienne Dolet]] was [[Strangling|strangled]] and burnt in 1546 on a charge of atheism; in 1766, the French nobleman [[François-Jean de la Barre]], was [[torture]]d, beheaded, and his body burned for alleged [[vandalism]] of a [[crucifix]], a case that became celebrated because [[Voltaire]] tried unsuccessfully to have the sentence reversed.

Among those accused of atheism was [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784), one of the Enlightenment's most prominent ''philosophes'', and editor-in-chief of the [[Encyclopédie]], which sought to challenge religious, particularly Catholic, dogma: "Reason is to the estimation of the ''philosophe'' what grace is to the Christian", he wrote. "Grace determines the Christian's action; reason the ''philosophe's''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinzler.com/ushistory/diderotsupp.html "The Philosophe"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot was briefly imprisoned for his writing, some of which was banned and burned.

===Enlightenment-era atheism===
{{main article|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment}}

====French Revolution====
{{main article|Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution}}
The French Revolution marked a turning point for the ascendancy of atheism to a preeminent position as a cognitive and cultural stance against papal supremacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] across Europe and throughout the world. Now known as the atheist [[Cult of Reason]] ideology, established by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and [[Hébertists|their supporters]] and intended as a replacement for Christianity, and was replete with ceremonious destruction of Christian relics, conversion of churches into Temples of Reason and the personification of Reason as a goddess; it also held such festivities as the Festival of Reason (or Festival of Liberty), dated on 10 November (20 Brumaire) 1793. The Cult of Reason, which strongly advocated the destruction of Christian and theistic cultural influences by force, was opposed to [[Robespierre]]'s [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], which was considered a deistic cult which referred back to the theism of Christianity. The [[Cult of Reason]] was finally ended by Robespierre and the [[Committee of Public Safety]] through their execution of Hébert and several of his followers on 24 March 1794, having ascended just seven months earlier.

===19th century===
Even after the Thermidorean Reaction ended the revolutionary anti-clerical manifestations, the movement for secularization continued during the [[Napoleonic era]] and onward. French atheists participated in the increasingly popular political movements which sought for greater economic and political parity in society, the most notable being the [[French Revolution of 1848]] and the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871.

In 1877, the [[Grand Orient de France]] (GOdF), the largest Masonic body, at the instigation of the Protestant priest [[Frédéric Desmons]], allowed those who had no belief in a Supreme being to be admitted as members, resulting in an ongoing schism between the GOdF and the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] (and their respective affiliated lodges) due to the departure of the GOdF from the theistic requirement of belief in a Supreme Being for all members.

===20th century===
In 1905, the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|law on the Separation of the State and the Church]] was passed, establishing state secularism in the country and preventing interaction between religious communities and the government, except through religious organizations. Atheists were among the many French citizens put to death and tortured in the concentration camps run by the German Nazi regime.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Following the war, atheists and secular humanists became increasingly involved in defining and interpreting the existence of humanity and the individual, among them being [[existentialism|existentialist]] writer and philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

===21st century===
{{Pie chart

The 21st century, beginning with the advent of the American-led [[War on Terror]], has enlivened the debate over the issue of religious liberty, expression and atheistic rationalism in France.

To this day, the GOdF ([[Grand Orient de France]]) maintains a strongly secular stance in the public eye and has been frequently accused of a strong anti-Christian position by Roman Catholic apologists and clergy.

In 2010, in a [[Eurobarometer]] poll,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Eurobarometer |authorlink1=Eurobarometer |title=Eurobarometer report on Biotechnology |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |date=2010 |page=381 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215001129/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 27% of respondents answered "I believe there is a God", 27% answered "I believe there is some sort of spirit or life force", and 40% answered "I don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force".

President [[François Hollande]] is an atheist despite his Catholic upbringing. President [[Emmanuel Macron]] is agnostic, although he converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] as a teenager. Mayor of Paris [[Anne Hidalgo]] is openly and an outspoken [[Atheism|Atheist]].

'''Jack Fiddler''', also known as '''Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow''' (from the [[Oji-Cree language|Oji-Cree]]: ''Zhaawano-giizhigo-gaabaw'' meaning  "He who stands in the southern sky") and as '''Maisaninnine''' or '''Mesnawetheno''' (in [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]]&lt;!--''Mesinawininiw'' or ''Mesinawiðiniw''?--&gt; meaning "Stylish man") (c. 1839-September 30, 1907) was an ''ogimaa'' (chief and shaman) of the Sucker [[Anishinaabe clan system|doodem]] among the [[Anishinaabe]] in what is now [[northwestern Ontario]].  His arrest in 1906 for the alleged murder of a [[wendigo]] and his suicide before trial marked the beginning of the imposition of [[Canada|Canadian]] law on the Sucker People. Until then, Fiddler's people had been among the last [[aboriginal peoples]] living in North America completely under their own law and custom.

== Background ==

Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow was born in the [[boreal forest]]s of the upper [[Severn River (northern Ontario)|Severn River]] near [[Sandy Lake, Ontario|Sandy Lake]], [[Deer Lake, Ontario|Deer Lake]], and [[North Spirit Lake, Ontario|North Spirit Lake]] in the 1830s or 1840s.  His father [[Peemeecheekag]] (Porcupine [Standing] Sideways), a mysterious figure from the east who was adopted into the Sucker clan during the previous century, was a respected political and spiritual leader.  The Suckers were not the only group in the area, as they were allied with the Pelican and Sturgeon clans, and had contact with the Cranes as well.  The clans spoke a unique form of the [[Oji-Cree language|Oji-Cree]] dialect of the [[Anishinaabe language]] and had contact with the [[Ojibwa]] at [[Lake Winnipeg]] and the [[Oji-Cree]] farther to the north and east.  

Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow grew up during a period of difficulty.  Over-trapping for the [[fur trade]] of the previous centuries had left the boreal forests of Northern Ontario depleted of animals.  With declining numbers of furs, lower demand abroad, and more opportunities in the west, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) abandoned their post at [[Island Lake, Manitoba|Island Lake]] for much of the early 19th century, forcing the Suckers to travel to [[Big Trout Lake, Ontario|Big Trout Lake]] or [[Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba|Little Grand Rapids]] for trade.  As a young man, Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow likely worked on the [[York boats]] bringing furs to [[York Factory]].

By the 1860s, the number of fur-bearing animals increased enough for the HBC to re-open the Island Lake post, and Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow emerged as one of the leaders of the Sucker people.  At his brief visits at the posts, he developed the ability to fiddle and built quality instruments. HBC traders frequently gave English nicknames to individual Natives and designated whole clans by the name of a primary leader or an arbitrary English surname.  Thus, the Sturgeons were known to traders (and later Canadian authorities) by the surname Rae or Mamakeesick, the Pelicans after their leader [[Meekis]], and the Cranes after their leaders [[Kakegamic]] and [[Kakepetum]].  Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow and his brother [[Pesequan]] became Jack and Joseph Fiddler, and the Suckers often appear in the records as the Fiddler tribe.

Jack Fiddler took five wives:  Kakakwesic, Nakwasasive, Nocome, Kaopasanakitiyat, and Kayakatopicicikec and had 13 children.  [[Polygamy]] was common, out of necessity if for no other reason, as young men died often in the dangers of the times.

== The wendigo ==

Like his father before him, Jack Fiddler became a famous [[shaman]] for his alleged ability to conjure animals and protect his people from spells.  Most importantly to the people of the region, he could allegedly successfully defeat the [[wendigo]], a cannibalistic spirit that would possess people during all-too-frequent bouts of famine and disease.  In his life, Jack Fiddler claimed to have defeated fourteen wendigos.  Apparently some were sent against his people by enemy shamans, and others were members of his own band who were taken with an insatiable, incurable desire to eat human flesh.  In the latter case, Fiddler was usually asked by family members to kill a very sick loved one before they turned wendigo.  In some cases, the "Wendigo" him or herself would ask to be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]] according to the necessary rites.  Fiddler's own brother, Peter Flett, was killed after turning wendigo when the food ran out on a trading expedition. 

HBC traders and [[Cree]] and [[missionaries]] were well aware of the Wendigo legend, though they often explained it as mental illness or superstition.  Regardless, several incidents of people turning wendigo and eating human flesh are documented in the records of the company.  Jack Fiddler's reputation also grew among these groups, and he was approached multiple times by Cree ministers at Island Lake and asked to bring Christianity to his people.  Though he respectfully heard their requests, Fiddler did not convert.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the Sucker people were among the only Indigenous people in North America living in a traditional manner with almost no government imposition on legal and religious matters.

== Arrest and trial ==
In early 1907, two members of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] visiting Island Lake heard of Jack Fiddler's power against the wendigo from Norman Rae, an in-law of the Fiddlers.  Seeking to introduce Canadian law in the North, the Mounties went to the Sucker camp at Deer Lake and arrested Jack and Joseph Fiddler for murder.  Before leaving, they took an eyewitness and declared that each man must give up any extra wives.  For most of the Sucker people, the Mounties were the first whites they had ever seen.

The elderly brothers were charged with murdering Wahsakapeequay, Joseph's daughter-in-law, the year before.  They were held at [[Norway House, Manitoba|Norway House]] to await trial.  Meanwhile, newspapers across Canada picked up the story and printed sensational headlines of murder and devil-worship.  Across the country, people demanded convictions, while the police conducting the trial saw an opportunity for fame and advancement.

On September 30, Jack Fiddler escaped captivity during a walk outside.  He hanged himself nearby and was found dead later in the day.
[[Image:ChiefRobertFiddler.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Robert Fiddler, son of Jack Fiddler and successor as chief of the Sucker people]]
Joseph Fiddler still went to trial, however.  Angus Rae, the eyewitness, testified that Wahsakapeequay was killed while in deep pain and incurably sick according to the custom of the people who were not aware of Canadian law.  Pressed on the wendigo issue, Rae admitted that it was a belief among his people and that Jack and Joseph were the ones who were usually asked to euthanize the very sick and prevent wendigos.  Despite some other unreliable testimony from Rae, and the pleas of missionaries and HBC traders, Joseph was convicted and sentenced to death by [[Aylesworth Perry]], the stipendary magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;John Marlowe 'The Flesh-Hungry Wendigo' in 'Canadian Mysteries of the Unexplained' (London: Arcturus 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Further appeals secured his release, but the order came three days after his death in 1909.

== Aftermath ==

Without their most prominent leaders, the people of the upper Severn River had no choice but to accept government rule.  Robert Fiddler, Jack's son, signed an addition to [[Treaty 5]] as "chief of the Deer Lake Band" in 1910 and chose to settle at Deer Lake.  Later, several families including the Fiddlers, moved to Sandy Lake and became part of [[Treaty 9]].  

Today, most of the descendants of Jack Fiddler live in the Sandy Lake First Nation with others at the [[Deer Lake First Nation]], and [[North Spirit Lake First Nation]] in Ontario, and the three reserves at Island Lake in Manitoba.

{{Jesus}}
'''Jesus in the Talmud''' refers to passages in the [[Talmud]] which are believed by some scholars to be references to Jesus. The name used in the Talmud is "[[Yeshu]]", the  Aramaic form of the [[Hebrew]] name ''[[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ilan |first=Tal |title=Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity Part I: Palestine 330 BCE–200 CE (Texte und Studien zum Antiken Judentum 91) |publisher=J.C.B.

The identification of Yeshu as Jesus is problematic. For example, the Talmud mentions [[Yeshu#Yeshu ben Pandera|Yeshu ben Pandera/ben Stada]]'s stepfather, Pappos ben Yehuda, speaking with [[Rabbi Akiva]],&lt;ref name="Talmud Berakhot 61b"&gt;Talmud Berakhot 61b&lt;/ref&gt; who was executed at the climax of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash [[Genesis Rabbah]] 53; Midrash [[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]] 1:10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Midrash Shoher Tov'', on Proverbs (§ 9), Jerusalem 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Yeshu#Yeshu the student of Joshua ben Perachiah|Yeshu the Pharisee student]] is described as being a student of the second-century BCE [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]] [[Joshua ben Perachiah]], as well as being among the exiled [[Pharisees]] returning to Israel following their persecution&lt;ref&gt;Nickelsburg, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Berakhot'' 29a)&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John Hyrcanus]],&lt;ref name="Talmud Sanhedrin 107b, Sotah 47a"&gt;Talmud Sanhedrin 107b, Sotah 47a&lt;/ref&gt;, an event which occurred in 74 BC. Additionally,  [[Yeshu#Yeshu the sorcerer|Yeshu the sorcerer]] was executed by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|royal government]] which lost legal authority in 63 BC. These events would place the lifetime of either Yeshu decades before or after the birth and death of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusnarr.html |title=The Jesus Narrative In The Talmud - Gil Student |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Patterson, "Origin of the Name Panthera", JTS 19 (1917–18), p. 79–80, cited in Meier, p. 107 n. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Still, there are numerous other passages pertaining to an individual named "Yeshu" that either don't provide a specific time period or else specify a time where it is reasonable to assume mentioning of Jesus would even be possible (take for example a notable passage, Gittin 57a mentioning the nobleman [[Onkelos]] conjuring the tormented spirit of "Yeshu" – Onkelos lived more than a century after Jesus, thus making it possible the Yeshu mentioned could indeed be Jesus, though the likelihood of this is still questionable) still opening the possibility that whichever Yeshu mentioned might be Jesus.

The first Christian censorship of the Talmud happened in the year 521.&lt;ref&gt;Reverend James Parkes, ''The Conflict of the Church and the Synagogue'', p.392&lt;/ref&gt; However, far better documented censorship began during the [[disputations]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. Advocates for the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that the Talmud contained blasphemous references to [[Jesus]] and his mother, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. Jewish apologists during the disputations said there were no references to Jesus in the Talmud. They claimed Joshua was a common Jewish name, along with its derivations, and that the citations referred to individuals other than Jesus. The disputations led to many of the references being removed (censored) from subsequent editions of the Talmud.

In the modern era there has been a variance of views among scholars of the possible references to Jesus in the Talmud, depending partly on presuppositions as to the extent to which the ancient rabbis were preoccupied with Jesus and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' p220  Delbert Burkett - 2010 "That is to say, varying presuppositions as to the extent to which the ancient rabbis were preoccupied with Jesus and Christianity can easily predetermine which texts might be identified and interpreted as having him in mind."&lt;/ref&gt; This range of views among modern scholars on the subject has been described as a range from "minimalists" who see few passages with reference to Jesus, to "maximalists" who see many passages having reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus,'' ed. Burkett p220 2010 "Accordingly, scholars' analyses range widely from minimalists (e.g., Lauterbach 1951) – who recognize only relatively few passages that actually have Jesus in mind – to moderates (e.g., Herford [1903] 2006), to maximalists (Klausner 1943 .. especially Schafer"&lt;/ref&gt; These terms "minimalist" and "maximalist" are not unique to discussion of the Talmud text; they are also used in discussion of academic debate on other aspects of Jewish vs. Christian and Christian vs. Jewish contact and polemic in the early centuries of Christianity, such as the ''Adversus Iudaeos'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;Papers presented at the Thirteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies p398  Maurice Wiles, Edward Yarnold, P.

==History==
[[Image:Disputation.jpg|thumb|Woodcut carved by Johann von Armssheim (1483). Portrays a disputation between Christian and Jewish scholars]]
During the [[Middle Ages]] a series of debates on Judaism were staged by the Christian church – including the [[Disputation of Paris]], the [[Disputation of Barcelona]], and [[Disputation of Tortosa]] – and during those disputations, Jewish converts to Christianity, such as [[Pablo Christiani]] and [[Nicholas Donin]] claimed the Talmud contained insulting references to Jesus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maccoby, Hyam, ''Judaism on Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;  An early work describing Jesus in the Talmud was ''[[Pugio Fidei]]'' ("Dagger of Faith") (c. 1280) by the Catalan Dominican [[Ramón Martí]], a Jewish convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Shaefer, p 3"&gt;Shaefer, p 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1681 [[Johann Christoph Wagenseil]] translated and published a collection of anti-Christian polemics from Jewish sources, with the title ''Tela Ignea Satanæ, sive Arcani et Horribiles Judæorum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri'' (''Flaming Arrows of Satan, that is, the secret and horrible books of the Jews against Christ, God, and the Christian religion'') which discussed Jesus in the Talmud.&lt;ref name="Shaefer, p 3"/&gt;  The first book devoted solely to the topic of Jesus in the Talmud was the Latin work ''Jesus in Talmude'' published in 1699 by [[Rudolf Martin Meelführer]], a student of Wagenseil at [[University of Altdorf|Altdorf]].&lt;ref name="Shaefer, p 4"&gt;Shaefer, p 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1700, [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger]] published ''Entdecktes Judenthum'' (''Judaism Unmasked''), which included descriptions of Jesus in the Talmud, and which would become the basis of much anti-Semitic literature in later centuries such as ''[[The Talmud Unmasked]]'' written in 1892 by [[Justinas Pranaitis|Justinas Bonaventure Pranaitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodkinson, pp 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 20th century the topic of Jesus in Judaic literature became subject to more unbiased, scholarly research, such as ''Das Leben Jesu nach jüdischen Quellen'' written in 1902 by [[Samuel Krauss]], which was the first scholarly analysis of the Judaic anti-Christian polemic ''[[Toledot Yeshu]]'' (''The Biography of Jesus'').&lt;ref name="Shaefer, p 4"/&gt;  In 1903, Unitarian scholar [[R. Travers Herford]] wrote ''Christianity in Talmud and Midrash'', which became the standard work on the topic in the Christian world, and he concluded that a large number of references referred to Jesus, not as a historical individual, but instead as the messiah of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shaefer, p 4; Lasker p xxi:
:Lasker writes that Herford "argues that the Talmudic Yeshus do indeed, refer to Jesus of Nazareth, but the citations concerning him reflect non-historical oral traditions which circulated among Jews and are not based on the written Gospels or other more authentic records of the life of Jesus. One can learn nothing about the historical Jesus from rabbinic accounts; at most one can learn form them something about rabbinic attitudes towards Jesus. In sum, the Talmud does make reference to the Christian Jesus but has nothing to offer the searcher for the historical Jesus. Such a position [says Lasker about Herford] seems eminently reasonable …"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, [[Hermann Strack]] wrote ''Jesus, die Häretiker und die Christen nach den ältesten jüdischen Angaben'',  which found no evidence of a historical Jesus in the Talmud.&lt;ref name="Shaefer, p 4"/&gt;  In 1922 [[Joseph Klausner]] wrote ''Yeshu ha-Notzri'' (''Jesus of Nazareth'') which concluded that "the evidence [for a historical Jesus] in the Talmud is scanty and does not contribute much to our knowledge of the historical Jesus; much of it is legendary and reflects the Jewish attempt to counter Christian claims and reproaches" but he did conclude some material was historically reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Shaefer, p 5 Theissen, p 75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 [[Morris Goldstein]] wrote ''Jesus in the Jewish Tradition'', including sections on the [[Toledoth Yeshu]]. In 1951, [[Jacob Z. Lauterbach]] wrote the essay ''Jesus in the Talmud''.&lt;ref&gt;Shaefer, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 [[Johann_Maier_(talmudic_scholar)|Johann Maier]] wrote ''Jesus von Nazareth in der talmudischen Überlieferung'', in which he concludes that there is virtually no evidence of the historical Jesus in the Talmud, and that the references to Jesus were "legendary" and probably added late in the Talmudic era "as a reaction to Christian provocations".&lt;ref&gt;Theissen, pp 74–75 Shaefer, p 5&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, [[Peter Schäfer]] wrote ''Jesus in the Talmud'' in which he tried to find a middle ground between "anti-Jewish Christian" and "apologetic Jewish" interpretations. He concluded that the references to Jesus (as the messiah of Christianity) were included in the early (3rd and 4th century) versions of the Talmud, and that they were parodies of New Testament narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 6ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the context of Christian-Judaic polemics==
In the first few centuries CE, there were many sects of Judaism (such as [[Pharisees]], [[Essenes]], and [[Sadducees]]) each claiming to be the correct faith.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, pp 1–3;  Boyarin cites the Talmud as saying there were 24 sects&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars treat Christianity, during that era, referred to as [[Early Christianity]], as simply one of many sects of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, pp 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Some sects wrote polemics advocating their position, and occasionally disparaging rival sects.  Some scholars view the depictions of Jesus in the Talmud as a manifestation of those inter-sect rivalries – thus the depictions can be read as polemics by the rabbinic authors of the Talmud which indirectly criticized the rival sect (Christianity), which was growing and becoming more dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer p 7–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to New Testament===
Peter Schäfer concluded that the references were not from the early [[tannaitic]] period (1st and 2nd centuries) but rather from the 3rd and 4th centuries, during the [[amoraic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, p 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that the references in the Babylonian Talmud were "polemical counter-narratives that parody the New Testament stories, most notably the story of Jesus' birth and death"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 9&lt;/ref&gt; and that the rabbinical authors were familiar with the Gospels (particularly the Gospel of John) in their form as the [[Diatessaron]] and the [[Peshitta]], the New Testament of the Syrian Church. Schäfer argues that the message conveyed in the Talmud was a "bold and self-confident" assertion of correctness of Judaism, maintaining that "there is no reason to feel ashamed because we rightfully executed a blasphemer and idolater."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 9: "I agree that much of our Jesus material is relatively late; in fact, I will argue that the most explicit Jesus passages (those passages that deal with him as a person) appear only in the Babylonian Talmud and can be dated, at the earliest, to the late third-early fourth century C.E. … I propose that the (mainly) Babylonian stories about Jesus and his family are deliberate and highly sophisticated counternarratives to the stories about Jesus' life and death in the Gospels – narratives that presuppose a detailed knowledge of the New Testament in particular the Gospel of John, presumably through the Diatessaron and/or the Peshitta, the New Testament of the Syrian Church. More precisely, I will argue – following indeed some of the older research – that they are polemical counternarratives that parody the New Testament stories, most notably the story of Jesus' birth and death. They ridicule Jesus' birth from a virgin, as maintained by the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, and they contest fervently the claim that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God. Most remarkably, they counter the New Testament Passion story with its message of the Jews' guilt and shame as Christ killers. Instead, they reverse it completely: yes, they maintain, we accept responsibility for it, but there is no reason to feel ashamed because we rightfully executed a blasphemer and idolater. Jesus deserved death, and he got what he deserved. Accordingly, they subvert the Christian idea of Jesus' resurrection by having him punished forever in hell and by making clear that this fate awaits his followers as well, who believe in this impostor. There is no resurrection, they insist, not for him and not for his followers; in other words, there is no justification whatsoever for this Christian sect that impudently claims to be the new covenant and that is on its way to establish itself as a new religion (not least as a "Church" with political power). This, I will posit, is the historical message of the (late) Talmudic evidence of Jesus. A proud and self-confident message that runs counter to all that we know from Christian and later Jewish sources. I will demonstrate that this message was possible only under the specific historical circumstances in Sasanian Babylonia, with a Jewish community that lived in relative freedom, at least with regard to Christians – quite different from conditions in Roman and Byzantine Palestine".&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of comparison the [[New Testament]] itself also documents conflict with rabbinical Judaism, for example in the John 8:41 charge "We are not born of fornication."&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1995, p. 992 ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley "And in Jn. 8:41 Jesus' opponents insist, "We were not born of fornication." Here "we" (Gk. hemeis) is emphatic, perhaps by way of contrast: "not we, but you?" Thus Jn. 8:41 may reflect early suspicions about Jesus' parentage, which Jewish polemics later made explicit. ... Origen, too. had to contend with the taunt of Celsus that the Virgin Birth was invented to cover up Mary's adultery with ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Kalimi ''Early Jewish exegesis and theological controversy'', 2002, p. 57 "The last part of the verse from the Gospel of John, "For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans" (verse 9b), ... "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?". "&lt;/ref&gt; and in return in the description in Revelation of a "synagogue of Satan."&lt;ref&gt;Ekkehard Stegemann, Wolfgang Stegemann, ''The Jesus Movement: A Social History of its First Century'', 1999, p. 346 "Other interpreters understand the author's anti-Jewish polemic as an expression of his conviction that believers in Christ are the true Jews, ... Thus in connection with the "synagogue of Satan" and based on linguistic usage in Revelation, the catchword blasphemia should be understood first of all as a blaspheming of God"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early anti-Christian sentiments===
In contrast to Peter Schäfer, Daniel J. Lasker suggests that the Talmudic stories about Jesus are not deliberate, provocative polemics, but instead demonstrate "embryonic" Jewish objections to Christianity which would later "blossom into a full-scale Jewish polemical attack on Christianity [the [[Toledoth Yeshu]]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lasker, p xxiv: "What does emerge from the material presented by Herford is that even if Christianity was not a fundamental worry of emerging Rabbinic Judaism, basic Jewish objections to this religion, which hundreds of years later would blossom into a full-scale Jewish polemical attack on Christianity [Lasker is referring to the Toledot Yeshu "The History of Jesus"], are already present in embryonic form in Rabbinic literature. Thus, Jesus was the product of adultery between his engaged mother and a man not her hsuband, not a result of miraculous birth. … God does not have a Son…. One can add to these arguments the Jewish accusations against Christianity and Jesus in the New Testament itself, for instance that if Jesus could not save himself, how could he save others (Matt 27:42)."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambivalent relationship===
Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued that the accounts in ''[[Chullin]]'' and ''[[Avodah Zarah]]'' ("Idolatry") reveal an ambivalent relationship between rabbis and Christianity. In his view the [[tosefta]] account reveals that at least some Jews believed Christians were true healers, but that the rabbis saw this belief as a major threat. Concerning the Babylonian Talmud account in ''Avoda Zarah'', Boyarin views Jacob of Sechania as a Christian preacher and understands Rabbi Eliezer's arrest for ''[[minuth]]'' ("heresy") as an arrest by the Romans for practising Christianity. When the Governor (the text uses the word for chief judge) interrogated him, the rabbi answered that he "trusted the judge." Boyarin has suggested that this was the Jewish version of the [[Br'er Rabbit]] approach to domination, which he contrasts to the strategy of many early Christians, who proclaim their beliefs in spite of the consequences (i.e. martyrdom). Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the Governor interpreted him to be referring to the Governor himself, and freed the rabbi. According to them the account also reveals that there was greater contact between Christians and Jews in the 2nd century than commonly believed. They view the account of the teaching of Yeshu as an attempt to mock Christianity. According to Rubenstein, the structure of this teaching, in which a biblical [[prooftext]] is used to answer a question about [[biblical law]], is common to both the rabbis and early Christians. The vulgar content, however, may have been used to parody Christian values. Boyarin considers the text to be an acknowledgment that rabbis often interacted with Christians, despite their doctrinal antipathy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jeffrey Rubenstein ''Rabbinic Stories'' (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputations and censorship==
{{see also|Criticism of the Talmud}}
Between 1239 and 1775 the Roman Catholic Church at various times either forced the censoring of parts of the Talmud that were theologically problematic or the destruction of copies of the Talmud.&lt;ref name="expunged"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bunHURgi7FcC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=talmud+censorship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lxf9Ut6IFYmMyQHnvYCgCw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=talmud%20censorship&amp;f=false| title=Encyclopedia of Censorship| authors= Jonathon Green, Nicholas J. Karolides|publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=110 |year=2009 |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] a series of debates on Judaism were staged by the Roman Catholic – including the [[Disputation of Paris]] (1240), the [[Disputation of Barcelona]] (1263), and [[Disputation of Tortosa]] (1413–14) – and during those disputations, Jewish converts to Christianity, such as [[Nicholas Donin]] (in Paris) and [[Pablo Christiani]] (in Barcelona) claimed the Talmud contained insulting references to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James, ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Naomi, ''Faithful Renderings: Jewish-Christian Difference and the Politics of Translation'', University of Chicago Press, 2006 p 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohn-Sherbok, Dan, Judaism and other faiths, Palgrave Macmillan, 1994, p 48&lt;/ref&gt;

During these disputations the representatives of the Jewish communities offered various defences to the charges of the Christian disputants. Notably influential on later Jewish responses was the defence of [[Yechiel of Paris]] (1240) that a passage about an individual named [[Yeshu]] in the Talmud was not a reference to the Christian Jesus, though at the same time Yechiel also conceded that another reference to Yeshu was. This has been described as the "theory of two Jesuses" though Berger (1998) notes that Yehiel in fact argues for three Jesuses.&lt;ref&gt;Berger D. "On the Uses of History in Medieval Jewish Polemic against Christianity: The Search for the Historical Jesus." In ''Jewish History and Jewish Memory: Essays in Honor of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi'', 1998, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This defence featured again in later Jewish defences during the medieval period, such as that of [[Nachmanides]] at the [[Disputation of Barcelona]], though others such as [[Profiat Duran]] at the [[Disputation of Tortosa]] did not follow this argument.&lt;ref&gt;Berger p33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amy-Jill Levine]] notes that even today some rabbinical experts do not consider that the Talmud's account of Jesus' death is a reference to the Jesus of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy-Jill Levine]]. ''The Historical Jesus in Context, Princeton University Press'', 2008, p. 20. "Similarly controversial is the Babylonian Talmud's account of Jesus' death (to the extant that some Rabbinic experts do not think the reference is to the Jesus of the New Testament!)"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustaf Dalman]] (1922),&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustaf Dalman]], ''Jesus-Jeshua'', London and New York, 1922, 89, cited in [[Joachim Jeremias]], ''Eucharistic Words of Jesus'', 1935, 3rd German ed. 1960, English 1966, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joachim Jeremias]] (1960),&lt;ref&gt;[[Joachim Jeremias]], ''Eucharistic Words of Jesus'', 1935, 3rd German Ed. 1960, English 1966 p. 19, footnote 7. "On the other hand, as [[Gustaf Dalman|G. Dalman]], ''Jesus-Jeshua'', London and New York, 1922 (ET of ''Jesus-Jeschua'', Leipzig, 1922), 89, rightly supposed, the often quoted passage b. Sanh. 43a (Bar.): 'on the day of preparation Jeshu was hanged' does not refer to Jesus but to a namesake, a disciple of R. [[Joshua ben Perachyah|Joshua b. Peraiah]] (c. 100 BC), cf. b.Sanh. 107b ( Bar.) par. b.Sot 47a."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Allen Powell]] (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Mark Allan Powell, ''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'', [[Westminster John Knox]], 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IJP4DRCVaUMC&amp;pg=PA34 p. 34]. "Scholars debate whether there may be obscure references to Jesus in some of the collections of ancient Jewish writings, such as the Talmud, the Tosefta, the targums, and the midrashim... 'On the eve of Passover, they hanged Yeshu [= Jesus?] and the herald went before him 40 days... (Sanhedrin 43a)."&lt;/ref&gt; and Roger T. Beckwith (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Beckwith, ''Calendar and Chronology, Jewish and Christian'', [[Brill Academic Publishers]], 2005, p. 294. "... the rest of the baraita, which states he was first stoned, and that his execution was delayed for forty days while a herald went out inviting anyone to say a word in his favour, suggest that it may refer to a different Yeshu altogether." footnote citing Jeremias 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; were also favourable to the view the Yeshu references in the Talmud were not to Jesus. [[Richard Bauckham]] considers Yeshu a legitimate, if rare, form of the name in use at the time, and writes that an [[ossuary]] bearing both the names ''Yeshu'' and ''Yeshua ben Yosef'' shows that it "was not invented by the rabbis as a way of avoiding pronouncing the real name of Jesus of Nazareth"&lt;ref name=Bauckham2008p81&gt;[[Richard Bauckham|Bauckham, Richard]], "The Names on the Ossuaries", in Quarles, Charles.

Numerous times between 1239 and 1775 all copies of the Talmud were ordered destroyed. In 1280 following the Disputation of Barcelona the Talmud was order censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=imcpl1111&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX2587502023&amp;&amp;docId=GALE |title=Encyclopedia Judaica - Barcelona, Disputation of |date=2007 |editors=Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik.

All printed editions of the Talmud, including the Basel Talmud and the [[Vilna Edition Shas]], were censored. In 1559 the Talmud was placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Roman Index]] and banned. In 1564 under the Tridentine Index an expunged version of the Talmud was allowed. In 1592 the pope ordered all copies of the Talmud and other heretical writing destroyed expunged or not. The total prohibition would stay in place until 1775. Even then the censorship system would remain in force.&lt;ref name="expunged" /&gt; As a result of these disputations many manuscript editions had references to Jesus removed or changed, and subsequent manuscripts sometimes omitted the passages entirely. Few copies would survive.

In the 20th century, new editions began restoring the censored material, such as in the 1935 English Soncino edition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text-criticism, versions, and alterations===
Starting in the 13th century, manuscripts of the Talmud were sometimes altered in response to the criticisms made during the disputations, and in response to orders from the Christian church. Existing manuscripts were sometimes altered (for example, by erasure) and new manuscripts often omitted the passages entirely. Peter Schäfer compared several editions and documented some alterations as illustrated in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;English translations from Peter Schäfer, pp 133–140&lt;/ref&gt;

==As evidence of the historical Jesus==
[[Bart Ehrman]], and separately Mark Allan Powell, state that the Talmud references are quite late (hundreds of years) and give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life. Ehrman clarifies that the name "Son of Panthera" (Roman who allegedly was the seducer of Mary) was a tradition, as scholars have long recognized, that represented an attack on the Christian view, that he was the son of a virgin. In Greek, the term for virgin is ''parthenos'', which is similar to ''panthera'', implying that "son of panthera" is a pun on "son of a virgin".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]]'' by Bart Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (Nov 1, 1998) {{ISBN|0664257038}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; The name "ben Stada", used for the same figure, is explained by [[Peter Schäfer]] as a reference to his mother's supposed adultery:

{{quote|His mother's true name was Miriam, and "Stada" is an epithet which derives from the Hebrew/Aramaic root sat.ah/sete' ("to deviate from the right path, to go astray, to be unfaithful"). In other words, his mother Miriam was also called "Stada" because she was a sotah, a woman suspected, or rather convicted, of adultery."&lt;ref name=PeterS141/&gt;}}

Peter Schäfer states that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are from a later [[Amoraic]] period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them.&lt;ref name=PeterS141&gt;''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (Aug 24, 2009) {{ISBN|0691143188}} pp.9, 17, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars debate whether the Talmud provides any evidence of [[historical Jesus|Jesus as a historical individual]]. Van Voorst (2000) describes this as a spectrum of opinion:
* On one side stand [[Johann Maier (talmudic scholar)|Johann Maier]] (1978) and those broadly sympathetic to his conclusions such as [[John P. Meier]] and [[Jacob Neusner]]. Maier discounts accounts with no mention of the name Jesus, and further discounts those that do mention Jesus by name, such as Sanh. 43a and 107b, as later medieval changes.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst 2000 - see also Thiessen and Merz mention [[Gustaf Dalman]] (1893), [[Johann Maier (talmudic scholar)|Johann Maier]] (1978), and Thoma (1990) in favour of this conclusion.* Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. ''The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide''. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). p. 74-76. *See also Jeffrey Rubenstein,  ''Rabbinic Stories (The Classics of Western Spirituality)''  New York: The Paulist Press, 2002 &amp; Daniel Boyarin, ''Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism'', Stanford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against the current form of Talmudic references to Jesus being evidence of a historical individual include contextual evidence, such as chronological inconsistencies, for example the original contexts of accounts in the Tosefta and Talmud take place in different historical periods. Maier also views that the tradition first seen in the writings of [[Celsus]] can not be regarded as a reliable reference to the historical [[Jesus]].
* On the other side stand scholars such as [[Joseph Klausner]] (1925), following [[R. Travers Herford]] (1901) and [[Bernhard Pick]] (1887), who believed that the Talmud gives some insight into [[Historical Jesus|Jesus as a historical individual]].&lt;ref&gt;Theissen p 75: "[some authors conclude that the Talmud's passages] have no independent historical value.  In contrast to this, other authors, e.g. Klausner, believe that they can discover at least some old and historically reliable traditions in the Talmud". Theissen cites Klausner, ''Jesus of Nazareth'', pp 18–46&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these researchers  contend that the Talmud's importance and credibility as an early source lies in the fact that it gives the "opposition view" to Jesus, and they have used the Talmud to draw the conclusions about the historical Jesus, such as:
**Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 111–120
**Norman Perrin, ''The New Testament, An Introduction: Proclamation and Parenesis, Myth and History'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982. pp 407–408

==Possible Talmudic references==
There are several Talmudic passages that are said to be referring to [[Jesus]]. The following are among those considered the most controversial, contested, and possibly the most notable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=Talmud+Jesus+most+OR+controversial+OR+contested+OR+notable&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;num=100&amp;lr=&amp;ft=i&amp;cr=&amp;safe=images&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq= |title=Google Link |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Pick]], ''The Talmud: What It Is and What It Knows of Jesus and His Followers'', publisher? 1887 (reprint Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007. p v–ix)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar V.

There are still noticeable challenges to the identification of Yeshu as Jesus, as elsewhere in the Talmud his stepfather, Pappos ben Yehuda, is mentioned as being martyred with [[Rabbi Akiva]]&lt;ref name="Talmud Berakhot 61b"/&gt; and is himself mentioned as being among the Pharisees returning to Israel following their persecution by [[John Hyrcanus]],&lt;ref name="Talmud Sanhedrin 107b, Sotah 47a"&gt;Talmud Sanhedrin 107b, Sotah 47a&lt;/ref&gt; which would place Yeshu's lifetime anywhere between 130 and 70 years before the birth of Jesus.

===Summary===
Scholars have identified the following references in the Talmud that some conclude refer to Jesus:&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer"&gt;Peter Schäfer&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus as a sorcerer with disciples (b Sanh 43a–b)
* Healing in the name of Jesus (Hul 2:22f; AZ 2:22/12; y Shab 124:4/13; QohR 1:8; b AZ 27b)
* As a Torah teacher (b AZ 17a; Hul 2:24; QohR 1:8)
* As a son or disciple that turned out badly (Sanh 103a/b; Ber 17b)
* As a frivolous disciple who practiced magic and turned to idolatry (Sanh 107b; Sot 47a)
* Jesus' punishment in afterlife (b Git 56b, 57a)
* Jesus' execution (b Sanh 43a-b)
* Jesus as the son of Mary (Shab 104b, Sanh 67a)

===As a sorcerer with disciples===
''Sanhedrin 43a'' relates the trial and execution of Jesus and his five disciples.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of this passage, see Theissen, pp 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Jesus is a sorcerer who has enticed other Jews to apostasy. A [[herald]] is sent to call for witnesses in his favour for forty days before his execution. No one comes forth and in the end he is stoned and hanged on the Eve of [[Passover]]. His five disciples, named Matai, Nekai, Netzer, Buni, and Todah are then tried. Word play is made on each of their names, and they are executed. It is mentioned that leniency could not be applied because of Jesus' influence with the royal government (''malkhut'').

===Healing in the name of Jesus===
Scholars have identified passages in the Talmud and associated Talmudic texts that involve invoking Jesus' name, as the messiah of Christianity, in order to perform magical healing:&lt;ref name="English translations from Peter Schäfer"&gt;English translations from Peter Schäfer&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Tosefta [[Hullin]] 2:22f'' – "Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pantera" - this section exists in variant spellings of Jesus: ''mi-shem Yeshu ben Pantera'' (principal edition), ''mi-shem Yeshu ben Pandera'' (London MS), ''mi-shem Yeshua ben Pantera'' (Vienna MS)&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé Dan, S''tudies in Rabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity: Text and Context'', p. 56 footnote&lt;/ref&gt;*''Jerusalem [[Abodah Zarah]] 2:2/12'' – "Jacob ... came to heal him.  He said to him:  we will speak to you in the name of Jesus son of Pandera" (Editions or MS: Venice)
*''Jerusalem [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabboth]] 14:4/13'' – "Jacob ... came in the name of Jesus Pandera to heal him" (Editions or MS: Venice)
*''[[Kohelet Rabbah|Qohelet Rabbah]] 1:8(3)'' – "Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera" (Editions or MSs: Vatican 291, Oxford 164, Pesaro 1519)
*''Babylonian [[Abodah Zarah]] 27b'' – "Jacob ... came to heal him" (Editions or MSs: New York 15, Pearo, Vilna)
*''Jerusalem [[Abodah Zarah]] 2:2/7'' – "someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera" (Editions or MS:  Venice)
*''Jerusalem [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabboth]] 14:4/8'' – "someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera" (Editions or MS: Venice)

===Torah teacher===
Scholars have identified passages that mention Jesus, as the messiah of Christianity, in the context of a Torah teacher:&lt;ref name="English translations from Peter Schäfer"/&gt;

*''Babylonian [[Abodah Zarah]] 17a'' – "One of the disciples of Jesus the Nazarene found me" (Editions or MSs: Munich 95, Paris 1377, New York 15)
*''Tosefta [[Hullin]] 2:24'' – "He told me of a word of heresy in the name of Jesus son of Pantiri"
*''[[Kohelet Rabbah|Qohelet Rabbah]] 1:8(3)'' – "He told me a word in the name of Jesus son of Pandera" (Editions or MSs: Oxford 164, Vatican 291, Pesaro 1519)
*''Babylonian [[Abodah Zarah]] 17a'' – "Thus I was taught by Jesus the Nazarene" (Editions or MSs: Munich 95, Paris 1337)

===The son or disciple who turned out badly===
''Sanhedrin 103a'' and ''Berachot 17b'' talk about a Yeshu ha-Nosri (Jesus of Nazareth) who "burns his food in public", possibly a reference to pagan sacrifices or a metaphor for apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Joachim Schoeps, ''The Jewish-Christian Argument'', 1961, pp 24 (English language edition)&lt;/ref&gt; The account is discussing [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] the king of Judah infamous for having turned to idolatry and having persecuted the Jews (2 ''Kings'' 21). It is part of a larger discussion about three kings and four commoners excluded from paradise. These are also discussed in the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] where the son who burns his food is explicitly stated to be Manasseh.  The passages identified by scholars in this context are:&lt;ref name="English translations from Peter Schäfer"/&gt;

*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 103a'' – "that you will not have a son or disciple ... like Jesus the Nazarene" (Editions or MSs: Firenze II.1.8–9, Barco, Munich 95)
*''Babylonian [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakoth]] 17b'' – "that we will not have a son or disciple ... like Jesus the Nazarene" (Editions or MS: Oxford 23)

===As a sinful student who practiced magic and turned to idolatry===
Passages in ''Sanhedrin 107b'' and ''Sotah 47a'' refer to an individual ([[Yeshu]]) that some scholars conclude is a reference to Jesus, regarded as the messiah of Christianity.  In these passages, Jesus is described as a student of [[Joshua ben Perachiah]] (second half of the 2nd century BCE), and he (Jesus) was sent away for misinterpreting a word that in context should have been understood as referring to the Inn; he instead understood it to mean the innkeeper's wife (the same word can mean "inn" and "hostess").&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, p 24&lt;/ref&gt;  His teacher said "Here is a nice inn", to which he replied "Her eyes are crooked", to which his teacher responded "Evil one! Is this what you are occupied in?" (Gazing at women was considered sinful.) &lt;ref&gt;(This happened during their period of refuge in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the persecutions of [[Pharisees]] 88–76 BCE ordered by [[Alexander Jannæus]]. The incident is also mentioned in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] in ''Chagigah 2:2'' but there the person in question is not given any name.)&lt;/ref&gt; After several returns for forgiveness he mistook Perachiah's signal to wait a moment as a signal of final rejection, and so he turned to idolatry.   Some passages that have been identified by scholars as mentioning Jesus, as the messiah of Christianity, in this context include:&lt;ref&gt;English translations from Scheafer&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 107b'' – "not as Yehoshua b. Perahya who pushed Jesus the Nazarene away" (Editions or MSs: Barco, Vilna)
*''Babylonian [[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]] 47a'' – "not as Yehoshua b. Perahya who pushed Jesus the Nazarene away" (Editions or MSs: Vatican 110, Vilna, Munich 95)
*''Babyonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 107b'' – "Jesus said to him: Rabbi, her eyes are narrow" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1)
*''Babylonian [[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]] 47a'' – "Jesus the Nazarene said to him: Rabbi, her eyes are narrow" (Editions or MS: Oxford 20)
*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 107b'' – "The master said: Jesus the Nazarene practiced magic (Editions or MSs: Firenze II.1.8–9, Barco )
*''Babylonian [[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]] 47a'' – "The master said: Jesus the Nazarene because he practiced magic" (Editions or MS: Munich 95)

The full passage is:
{{quote|In all circumstances (one should exercise) use the left hand to push (away) and the right (to) bring closeward ... not like Yehoshua ben Perachya who pushed him—to Yeshu—with both hands... (here the Talmud begins a narration) at the time that Yannai the king was executing the Rabbis, Shimon ben Shatach('s sister) hid Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachya, he (then, subsequently was able to) go and run (escape) to Alexandria of Egypt. When there was (came) and (an era of) peace, Shimon ben Shatach sent to him (a letter:) "from me Yerushalayim the holy city to you Alexander of Egypt -my sister, my husband dwells amongst you and I am sitting lonely" said (Rabbi Yeshushua ben Perachya) "I deduce (from the letter) that he (is enjoying)peace. As he (Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachya) came they went up to a lodge, (they -at the lodge) stood for him with exemplary honor and did for him extended goodness. He sat and was in the midst of praising 'how beautiful is this lodging (which also means innkeeper in Aramaic)', (Yeshu) said to him "My master, her eyes are misshaped". He said to him "Evil one!, is this how you conduct yourself?!" he brought out four hundred [[Shofar]]s and [[excommunicate]]d him.
Every day he would come before him (intent on being readmitted,) and he did not accept him.  One day he was reciting [[Shema Yisroel#Recitation and reading|Kriat Shema]],&lt;ref&gt;the reciting of Shema being a spiritually intense moment&lt;/ref&gt; he (Yeshu) came before him (the Rabbi)—it was on his (the Rabbi's) mind to accept him—he (the Rabbi) showed him with his hand, he (Yeshu) thought 'he is pushing him', (Yeshu  then) went erected a [[Ichthys|fish worship]], he (his Rabbi) said to him 'return yourself' he (Yeshu) said to him '(so) I learnt from you; 'all who sin and cause others to sin we do not give (are not given) him the ability to repent'.
|Sotah 47a, Sanhedrin 107}}

The story ends by invoking a [[Mishna]]ic era teaching that Yeshu practised black magic, deceived and led Israel astray. This quote is seen by some as an explanation in general for the designation ''Yeshu''.

According to Dr. Rubenstein, the account in ''Sanhedrin'' 107b recognizes the kinship between Christians and Jews, since Jesus is presented as a disciple of a prominent Rabbi. But it also reflects and speaks to an anxiety fundamental to Rabbinic Judaism. Prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70, Jews were divided into different sects, each promoting different interpretations of the law. Rabbinic Judaism domesticated and internalized conflicts over the law, while vigorously condemning any sectarianism. In other words, rabbis are encouraged to disagree and argue with one another, but these activities must be carefully contained, or else they could lead to a schism. Although this story may not present a historically accurate account of Jesus' life, it does use a fiction about Jesus to communicate an important truth about the Rabbis. Moreover, Rubenstein sees this story as a rebuke to overly harsh Rabbis. Boyarin suggests that the Rabbis were well aware of Christian views of the Pharisees and that this story acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus was forgiving and the Pharisees were not (see Mark 2:1–2), while emphasizing forgiveness as a necessary Rabbinic value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Punishment in the afterlife===
In ''Gittin 56b–57a'' a story is recorded in which [[Onkelos]], a nephew of the Roman emperor Titus who destroyed the [[Second Temple]], intent on converting to Judaism, summons up the spirits of Yeshu and others to help make up his mind. Each describes his punishment in the afterlife.

The complete passage from the 1935 Soncino edition is:
{{quote|

Onkelos son of Kolonikos ... went and raised [[Titus]] from the dead by magical arts, and asked him; 'Who is most in repute in the [other] world? He replied: Israel. What then, he said, about joining them? He said: Their observances are burdensome and you will not be able to carry them out. Go and attack them in that world and you will be at the top as it is written, Her adversaries are become the head  etc.; whoever harasses Israel becomes head. He asked him: What is your punishment [in the other world]? He replied: What I decreed for myself. Every day my ashes are collected and sentence is passed on me and I am burnt and my ashes are scattered over the seven seas. He then went and raised [[Balaam]] by incantations. He asked him: Who is in repute in the other world? He replied: Israel. What then, he said, about joining them? He replied: Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. He then asked: What is your punishment? He replied: With boiling hot semen.  He then went and raised by incantations [[Jesus]] [in Vilna edition: "the sinners of Israel"; "Jesus" appears in Munich 95 and Vatican 140 manuscripts and "he went and brought up Jesus the Nazarene" (Editions or MSs: Vatican 130)]. He asked them: Who is in repute in the other world? They replied: Israel. What about joining them? They replied: Seek their welfare, seek not their harm. Whoever touches them touches the apple of his eye. He said: What is your punishment? They replied: With boiling hot excrement, since a Master has said: Whoever mocks at the words of the Sages is punished with boiling hot excrement. Observe the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the other nations who worship idols. It has been taught: Note from this incident how serious a thing it is to put a man to shame, for God espoused the cause of [[Kamsa and Bar Kamsa|Bar Kamza]] and destroyed His House and burnt His Temple.
|Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 56b-57a}}

===Execution===
Scholars have identified passages that mention Jesus in the context of  his execution:

*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 43a–b'' – "on the eve of Passover they hanged Jesus the Nazarene" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1, Karlsruhe 2)
*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 43a–b'' – "Jesus the Nazarene is going forth to be stoned" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1, Firenze II.1.8–9, Karlsruhe 2)
*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 43a–b'' – "Do you suppose Jesus the Nazarene was one for whom a defense could be made?" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1, Firenze II.1.8–9, Karlsruhe 2)
*''Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 43a–b'' – "With Jesus the Nazarene it was different" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1, Firenze II.1.8–9, Karlsruhe 2)

The complete passage is: "On (Sabbath eve and) the eve of Passover Jesus the Nazarene was hanged and a herald went forth before him forty days heralding, 'Jesus the Nazarene is going forth to be stoned because he practiced sorcery and instigated and seduced Israel to idolatry. Whoever knows anything in defense may come and state it.' But since they did not find anything in his defense they hanged him on (Sabbath eve and) the eve of Passover. Ulla said: Do you suppose that Jesus the Nazarene was one for whom a defense could be made? He was a mesit (someone who instigated Israel to idolatry), concerning whom the Merciful [God]says: Show him no compassion and do not shield him (Deut. 13:9). With Jesus the Nazarene it was different. For he was close to the government."&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer 2007. p 64-65"&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''Jesus in the Talmud'', Princeton University Press, 2007. p 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Pick]], ''The Talmud: What It Is and What It Knows of Jesus and His Followers'', publisher? 1887 (reprint Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007. p 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Florence]] manuscript of the Talmud (1177 CE) an addition is made to ''Sanhedrin 43a'' saying that Yeshu was hanged on the eve of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mother and father===
[[File:Pantera Grabstein.jpg|thumb|300px|Tombstone of [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera]], a soldier who has been claimed to be the "Pantera" named by Talmud.]]
Some Talmudic sources include passages which identify a "son of Pandera" (''ben Pandera'' in Hebrew), and some scholars conclude that these are references to the messiah of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Herford, Peter Schäfer&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Hebrew midrashic literature contain the "Episode of Jesus" (known also as ''Maaseh Yeshu''), in which Jesus is described as being the son of Joseph, the son of Pandera  (see: [[s:Translation:Story of Jesus|''Episode of Jesus'']]). The account portrays Jesus as an impostor.

The Talmud, and other talmudic texts, contain several references to the "son of Pandera".  A few of the references explicitly name Jesus ("Yeshu") as the "son of Pandera": these explicit connections are found in the [[Tosefta]], the [[Kohelet Rabbah|Qohelet Rabbah]], and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], but not in the Babylonian Talmud.&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer, pp 15-24, 133-141"&gt;Peter Schäferr, pp 15–24, 133–141&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit connections found in the Jerusalem Talmud are debated because the name "Jesus" ("Yeshu") is found only in a marginal gloss in some manuscripts, but other scholars conclude that it was in the original versions of the Jerusalem Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, pp 138–139, 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts include several spellings for the father's name (Pandera, Panthera, Pandira, Pantiri, or Pantera) and some scholars conclude that these are all references to the same individual,&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer, pp 15-24"&gt;Peter Schäfer, pp 15–24&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars suggest that they may be unrelated references.&lt;ref&gt;Maier&lt;/ref&gt; In some of the texts, the father produced a son with a woman named Mary. Several of the texts indicate that the mother was not married to Pandera, and was committing adultery and – by implication – Jesus was a bastard child.&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer, pp 15-24"/&gt; Some of the texts indicate that Mary's husband's name was Stada.

Some Talmudic sources include passages which identify a "son of Stada"  or "son of Stara" (''ben Stada'' or ''ben Stara'' in Hebrew), and some scholars conclude that these are references to the messiah of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;
*Such as Peter Schäfer
*References are Shabbat 104b and Sanhedrin 67a in the Babylonin Talmud
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Son of Pantera / Pandera in a healing context====
Two talmudic-era texts that explicitly associate Jesus as the son of Pantera/Pandera are:

*Tosefta [[Hullin]] 2:22f "Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pantera"
*[[Kohelet Rabbah|Qohelet Rabbah]] 1:8(3) "Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"

Both of the above passages describe situations where Jesus' name is invoked to perform magical healing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, pp 52–62&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some editions of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] explicitly identify Jesus as the son of Pandera:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, pp 52–62, 133–141&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jerusalem Abodah Zarah 2:2/7 "someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"
*Jerusalem Shabboth 14:4/8 "someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"
*Jerusalem Abodah Zarah 2:2/12 "Jacob ... came to heal him. He said to him: we will speak to you in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"
*Jerusalem Shabboth 14:4/13 "Jacob ... came in the name of Jesus Pandera to heal him"

However, some editions of the Jerusalem Talmud do not contain the name Jesus in these passages, so the association in this case is disputed.  The  parallel passages in the Babylonian Talmud do not contain the name Jesus.

====Son of Pantiri / Pandera in a teaching context====
Other Talmudic narratives describe Jesus as the son of a Pantiri or Pandera, in a teaching context:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, pp 41–51&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tosefta [[Hullin]] 2:24 "He told me of a word of heresy in the name of Jesus son of Pantiri"
*Qohelet Rabbah 1:8(3) "He told me a word in the name of Jesus son of Pandera"

However, the parallel accounts in the Babylonian Talmud mention Jesus but do not mention the father's name:
*Babylonian Abodah Zarah 17a "One of the disciples of Jesus the Nazarene found me"
*Babylonian Abodah Zarah 17a "Thus I was taught by Jesus the Nazarene"

====Pandera and alleged adultery by Mary====
The Babylonian talmud contains narratives that discuss an anonymous person who brought witchcraft out of Egypt, and the person is identified as "son of Pandera" or "son of Stada".  The Talmud discusses whether the individual (the name Jesus is not present in these passages) is the son of Stada, or Pandera, and a suggestion is made that the mother Mary committed adultery.&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer, pp 15-24, 133-141"/&gt;

*Babylonian [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104b "Was he the son of Stara (and not) the son of Pandera?" (Editions or MSs: Oxford 23, Soncino)
*Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 67a "Was he the son of Stara (and not) the son of Pandera?" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1, Karlsruhe 2, ...)
*Babylonian [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104b "husband Stada, lover Pandera" (Editions or MSs: Vatican 108, Munich 95, Vilna)
*Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 67a "husband Stara, lover Pandera" (Editions or MSs: Herzog 1, Barco)
*Babylonian [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104b "husband Pappos, mother Stada" (Editions or MSs: Vilna, Munich 95)
*Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 67a "husband Pappos, mother Stada" (Editions or MSs: Vilna, Munich 95)
*Babylonian [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104b "his mother Miriam who let grow (her) women's hair" (Editions or MSs:  Vilna, Oxford 23, Soncino)
*Babylonian [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 67a "his mother Miriam who let grow (her) women's hair" (Editions or MSs:  Karlsruhe 2, Munich 95)

====Mary as the mother====
There is no Talmudic text that directly associates Jesus with Mary (Miriam), instead the association is indirect:  Jesus is associated with a father ("son of Pandera"), and in other passages, Pandera is associated with Mary (as her lover).&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer, p 18"&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christians====
Typically both Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds use the generic ''[[minuth|minim]]'' for heretics. Aside from mentions of the five disciples of "Yeshu ha Notzri," the plural ''Notzrim,'' "Christians," are only clearly mentioned once in the Babylonian Talmud, (where it is amended to ''Netzarim'', people of the watch) in B.[[Ta'anit]] 27b with a late parallel in [[Masekhet Soferim]] 17:4.&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Y. Teppler, Susan Weingarten ''[[Birkat haMinim]]: Jews and Christians in conflict in the ancient world'' 2007 Page 48  -  "The only clear mention is as follows: The rabbis said: the people of the watch used to pray for their brothers' offering to be acceptable, and the people of the course used to assemble in the synagogue and sit there '""&lt;/ref&gt; And then "The day of the Notzri according to Rabbi Ishmael is forbidden for ever" in some texts of B.[[Avodah Zarah]] 6a.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter judaistische Beiträge  35  Gesellschaft zur Feorderung Judaistischer Studien in Frankfurt am Main - 2009 [Yaakov Y. Teppler, Susan Weingarten] S. 49 zitiert bAZ 6a: "The day of the Notzri according to Rabbi Ishmael is forbidden for ever", ohne auf die Textprobleme hinzuweisen; ed. Wilna liest ____ was als Ergebnis der Zensur gesehen werden kann; MS Paris 1337 und JTS lesen ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the Toledot Yeshu==
The'' [[Toledot Yeshu]]'' (''History of Jesus'') is a Jewish anti-Christian polemic that purports to be a biography of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, p 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is an early account of Jesus, based on contemporary Jewish views, in which Jesus is described as being the son of Joseph, the son of Pandera  (see a translation of the Yemenite text: [[s:Translation:Story of Jesus|''Episode of Jesus'']], or what is also known as ''Toledot Yeshu''). Some scholars conclude that the work is merely an expansion and elaboration on anti-Christian themes in the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;
*Lasker, p xxiv
*Rubenstein, SBT, p 272&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Gero suggests that an early version of the Toledot Yeshu narrative preceded the Talmud, and that the Talmud drew upon the Toledot Yeshu, but Rubenstein and Schäfer discount that possibility, because they date the origin of the ''Toledot Yeshu'' in the early Middle Ages or Late Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;
*Rubenstein, SBT, p 272
*Peter Schäfer p 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related narrative from Celsus==
The [[Platonism|Platonistic]] philosopher [[Celsus]], writing circa 150 to 200 CE, wrote a narrative describing a Jew who discounts the story of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Celsus'  treatise is ''Alethes Logos'', cited in Peter Schäfer, p 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have remarked on the parallels (adultery, father's name "Panthera", return from Egypt, magical powers) between Celsus' account and the Talmudic narratives.&lt;ref name="Peter Schäfer, p 18"/&gt;  In Celsus' account, the Jew says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... [Jesus] came from a Jewish village and from a poor country woman who earned her living by spinning. He says that she was driven out by her husband, who was a carpenter by trade, as she was convicted of adultery. Then he says that after she had been driven out by her husband and while she was wandering about in a disgraceful way she secretly gave birth to Jesus. He states that because he [Jesus] was poor he hired himself out as a workman in Egypt, and there tried his hand at certain magical powers on which the Egyptians pride themselves; he returned full of conceit, because of these powers, and on account of them gave himself the title of God ... the mother of Jesus is described as having been turned out by the carpenter who was betrothed to her, as she had been convicted of adultery and had a child by a certain soldier named Panthera."&lt;ref&gt;Celsus' quote from Peter Schäfer, ''Jesus in the Talmud'', Princeton University Press, 2007. p 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Pick, ''The Talmud: What It Is and What It Knows of Jesus and His Followers'', 1887 (reprint [[Kessinger Publishing]], LLC, 2007. p 117–120)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:ArcoDelleAzimelleInGhettoByRoeslerFranz.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An 1880 watercolour of the Roman Ghetto by [[Ettore Roesler Franz]].]]
In the [[Jewish diaspora]], a '''Jewish quarter''' (also known as '''jewry''', '''''juiverie''''', '''''Judengasse''''', '''Jewynstreet''', or '''proto-[[ghetto]]'''&lt;ref name="Arkel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dik Van Arkel|title=The Drawing of the Mark of Cain: A Socio-historical Analysis of the Growth of Anti-Jewish Stereotypes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a58GYjAzg0oC&amp;pg=PA298|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-8964-041-3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the area of a city traditionally inhabited by [[Jew]]s. Jewish quarters, like the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe]], were often the outgrowths of segregated [[ghetto]]s instituted by the surrounding Christian authorities. A [[Yiddish]] term for a Jewish quarter or neighborhood is ''"Di yiddishe gas"'' ({{lang-yi|די ייִדדישע גאַס }} ), or "The Jewish quarter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Vilnius.html |title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour - Vilnius |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Ladino language|Ladino]], they are known as ''[[wikt:Special:Search/maalé yahudí|maalé yahudí]]'', meaning "The Jewish quarter".  Many [[Europe]]an and [[Middle East]]ern cities once had a historical Jewish quarter and some still have it.

Jewish quarters in Europe existed for a number of reasons. In some cases, Christian authorities wished to segregate Jews from the Christian population so that Christians would not be "contaminated" by them {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  or so as to put psychological pressure on Jews to convert to Christianity. From the Jewish point of view, concentration of Jews within a limited area offered a level of protection from outside influences or mob violence. In many cases, residents had their own justice system. When political authorities designated an area where Jews were required by law to live, such areas were commonly referred to as [[ghetto]]s, and were usually coupled with many other disabilities and indignities. The areas chosen usually consisted of the most undesirable areas of a city. In the 19th century, Jewish ghettos were progressively abolished, and their walls taken down, though some areas of Jewish concentration continued and continue to exist. In some cities, Jewish quarters refer to areas which historically had concentrations of Jews. For example, many maps of Spanish towns mark a "Jewish Quarter", though Spain hasn't had a significant Jewish population for over 500 years.

However, in the course of [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] reestablished [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe]] (which they called Jewish quarters) for the purpose of segregation, persecution, terror, and exploitation of Jews, mostly in Eastern Europe. According to USHMM archives, "The Germans established at least 1,000 ghettos in German-occupied and annexed Poland and the Soviet Union alone."&lt;ref name="ushmm-7445"&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/sp/article.php?ModuleId=10007445 Types of Ghettos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1863">The '''Khairaha''' are a [[Hindu]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India. They have [[Scheduled Caste]] status.

==Origin==

The Khairaha are sub-group of the Khairwar tribe of central India. Small groups of Khairwar tribesmen are said to migrated to the [[Mirzapur district]] in the 18th century. They are now entirely separate from their parent community, now speaking [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. The Khairaha are now found mainly in Mirzapur and [[Allahabad District|Allahabad]] districts.&lt;ref name="poi"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 784 to 789 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

Their habitat is hilly undulating terrain, and extremely forested. They speak Hindi and have Scheduled Caste status. The Khairaha are divided into a number of exogamous clans known as kuris, of which the following are the main ones, Chouria, Nagria and Tengriha. They use the surname Kashyap. Like other Hindu castes, they are strictly endogamous.&lt;ref name="poi"/&gt;

The Khairaha are now a community of small and medium sized farmers. Animal husbandry and fishing are subsidiary occupations. Many are also employed in the mines that are found throughout southern Uttar Pradesh. They have a number of tribal deities like Goerdevi and Dulhadeo.&lt;ref name="poi"/&gt;

The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Khairaha Scheduled Caste population as 892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix - Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli 004a.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]], a 13th-century Christian theologian best known for his classic ''[[Summa Theologica]]'']]

In North America, the '''Master of Theology''' ({{lang-la|Theologiae Magister}}, abbreviated '''ThM''') is a post graduate or doctoral degree considered by the [[Association of Theological Schools]] to be the minimum educational credential for teaching theological subjects in accredited seminaries and graduate schools. The ThM is equivalent to the [[Master of Sacred Theology]] and the [[Association of Theological Schools]] classifies both degrees as "Advanced Programs Oriented Toward Theological Research and Teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Program Standards|url=https://www.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/degree-program-standards.pdf|website=ATS|publisher=Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
A '''Master of Theology''' (ThM) is an advanced theological research degree offered by [[universities]], [[divinity school]]s, and [[seminaries]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/Degrees.aspx|title=ATS - Approved Degrees|publisher=[[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]]|accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree is usually earned after the [[Master of Divinity]] (MDiv) or an equivalent of three years of graduate studies in theology. This degree can range from one or two years of specialized advanced studies in theological research (i.e. Counseling, Church History, Systematic Theology, etc.). It may or may not require comprehensive subject exams and a research thesis, but is required to produce "learning outcomes that demonstrate advanced competency in one area or discipline of theological study and capacity to conduct original research in that area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Program Standards|url=https://www.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/degree-program-standards.pdf|website=ATS|publisher=Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Theology is usually designed as an advanced academic degree with an emphasis on academic research.  The ThM often functions as a terminal and/or doctoral level degree, dependent upon one's particular educational route or institution of study.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=http://www.asburyseminary.edu/admissions/apply/apply-advanced-research-programs/|title=Advanced Research Programs (Th.M., Ph.D.)|publisher=[[Asbury Theological Seminary]]|accessdate=2012-12-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113213722/http://www.asburyseminary.edu/admissions/apply/apply-advanced-research-programs/|archivedate=2012-11-13|df=}} and {{citation|url=http://divinity.duke.edu/academics/degrees/master-theology|title=Master of Theology (Th.M.)|publisher=[[Duke University]]|accessdate=2012-12-08}} for examples.&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions award a ThM en route to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctor of Philosophy|url=http://www.sbts.edu/doctoral/doctor-of-philosophy/|website=SBTS|publisher=Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Doctor of Theology]] in addition offering stand alone ThM programs.

'''Mount Katahdin''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|t|ɑː|d|ɪ|n}} {{Respell|kə|TAH|din}}) is the highest mountain in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] at {{convert|5267|ft|m|0}}.

Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is located within [[Northeast Piscataquis, Maine|Northeast Piscataquis]], [[Piscataquis County, Maine|Piscataquis County]], and is the centerpiece of [[Baxter State Park]]. It is a steep, tall [[masiff]] formed from a [[laccolith|granite intrusion]] weathered to the surface. The flora and fauna on the mountain are typical of those found in northern [[New England]].

Katahdin was known to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the region, and was known to Europeans at least since 1689. It has inspired hikes, climbs, journal narratives, paintings, and a piano sonata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.classical-music.com/review/hovhaness-0 |publisher=Classical-music.com |title=Hovhaness: Khaldis; Mount Katahdin; Fantasy, Op. 16 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area around the peak was protected by Governor [[Percival P. Baxter|Percival Baxter]] starting in the 1930s. Katahdin is the northern terminus of the [[Appalachian Trail]], and is located near a stretch known as the [[Hundred-Mile Wilderness]].

The mountain is commonly called just "Katahdin",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark|first=Stephen |title=Katahdin: A Guide to Baxter State Park &amp; Katahdin |year=2003 |publisher=Clark Books |isbn=0-9741677-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the official name is "Mount Katahdin" as decided by the US Board on Geographic Names in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:579940|title=GNIS Detail - Mount Katahdin|website=geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

Katahdin is in Baxter State Park, which is in east central Piscataquis County, about {{convert|25|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Millinocket, Maine|Millinocket]]. It is on the [[drainage divide]] between the [[East Branch Penobscot River|East]] and [[West Branch Penobscot River|West branches]] of the [[Penobscot River]].

The mountain massif itself consists of multiple peaks. Baxter Peak is the tallest, and is the official northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.  South Peak and Pamola Peak are southeast and east of Baxter Peak, respectively, along the notorious Knife Edge ridgeline, while [[Hamlin Peak]] lies to the north.

The third highest mountain in Maine, [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Maine)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] at 1,295 m (4,250&amp;nbsp;ft), is over one hundred miles to the southwest. There is low lake country to the south and west of Katahdin, and lowlands extending east to the Atlantic and north to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in Canada.

It is commonly thought that Katahdin is the first place in the United States mainland to receive sunlight in the morning, but this is incorrect. Other mountains, lower in elevation but farther to the east or southeast, depending on the season, see the first sunrise of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Natural history==
Katahdin is part of a [[laccolith]] that formed in the [[Acadian orogeny]], when an [[island arc]] collided with eastern [[North America]] approximately 400 million years ago. On the sides of Katahdin are four glacial [[cirque (landform)|cirques]] carved into the granite by alpine [[glacier]]s and in these cirques behind [[moraine]]s and [[esker]]s are several ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/bedrock/katahdin/glacial-erosion.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012113831/http://www.maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/bedrock/katahdin/glacial-erosion.htm |archivedate=2008-10-12 |title=Geology of Baxter State Park |work=Maine Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baxter State Park, many outcrops of [[sedimentary rock]]s have [[Glacial striation|striations]], whereas Katahdin [[Granite]] and Traveler [[Rhyolite]] [[lava]] have weathered surfaces on which striations are commonly not preserved. Bedrock surfaces of [[igneous rock]]s which have been buried by glacial sediments and only recently exposed have well preserved striations, as in the vicinity of Ripogenus Dam. Several outcrops of sedimentary rocks along the Patten Road show striations, especially on the north side of the road at Hurricane Deck. A few outcrops near the Pattern Road just north of Horse Mountain are striated, as are several outcrops of sedimentary rocks along the road from Trout Brook Farm northward to [[Second Lake Matagamon]].

[[Fauna]] include [[American black bear|black bear]], [[deer]] and [[moose]] as well as [[black fly|black flies]] and [[mosquito]]s in the spring.  A subspecies of Arctic butterfly, known as the Katahdin Arctic (''[[Oeneis polixenes]] katahdin'') is specific to the area, and is currently listed as endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/species/endangered_species/katahdin_arctic/index.htm|title=Katahdin Arctic|publisher=Maine Dept of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330044243/http://www.maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/species/endangered_species/katahdin_arctic/index.htm|archivedate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the birds are [[Bicknell's thrush]] and various songbirds and raptors. A study of the animal communities was published by Irving H. Blake in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=Irving H.|title=A comparison of the animal communities of coniferous and deciduous forests|journal=Illinois Biological Monographs|date=October 1926|volume=10|issue=4|pages=10–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flora includes [[pine]], [[spruce]], [[fir]], [[eastern hemlock|hemlock]], [[beech]], [[maple]], [[birch]], [[aspen]], and ''[[Diapensia lapponica]]''.

==Human history==
[[File:Frederic Edwin Church - Mount Katahdin from Millinocket Camp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Mount Katahdin from Millinocket Camp'',  by [[Frederic Edwin Church]], 1895]]

Katahdin is referred to 60 years after Field's climb of Agiokochuk ([[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]]) in the writings of [[John Gyles]], a teenage colonist who was captured near [[Portland, Maine]] in 1689 by the [[Abenaki]].  While in the company of Abenaki hunting parties, he traveled up and down several Maine rivers including both branches of the [[Penobscot River|Penobscot]], passing close to "Teddon".  He remarked that it was higher than the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Hills]] above the [[Saco River]].

Among some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], Katahdin was believed to be the home of the storm god [[Pamola]], and thus an area to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North to Katahdin |url=http://www.ericpinder.com/html/pamola.html |chapter=Of Moose and Men...and Mountains |author=Eric Pinder |publisher=EricPinder.com |accessdate=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106215712/http://www.ericpinder.com/html/pamola.html |archive-date=2013-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded climb of "Catahrdin" was by Massachusetts surveyors Zackery Adley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umaine.edu/mainestudies/projects-special-programs/mount-katahdin-history-geology-and-culture/|title=Mount Katahdin – History, Geology, and Culture|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=2013-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120546/http://umaine.edu/mainestudies/projects-special-programs/mount-katahdin-history-geology-and-culture/|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Turner, Jr.]] in August 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Description of Mount Catardin |year=1804 |first=C.|last=Turner |publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society |edition=Second Series Vol. viii |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1840s [[Henry David Thoreau]] climbed Katahdin, which he spelled "Ktaadn"; his ascent is recorded in a well-known chapter of ''The Maine Woods''.&lt;ref name="Thoreau1864"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry David Thoreau|title=The Maine woods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxEIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=25 July 2013|year=1864|publisher=Ticknor and Fields|location=Boston|pages=1–84|chapter=Ktaadn|oclc=12015878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few years later [[Theodore Winthrop]] wrote about his visit in ''Life in the Open Air''.  Painters [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and [[Marsden Hartley]] are well-known artists who created landscapes of Katahdin. On 30 November 2011, Christie's auctioned Church's 1860 painting ''Twilight (Katahdin)'' for $3.1 million.

In the 1930s [[Governor of Maine|Governor]] [[Percival P. Baxter|Percival Baxter]] began to acquire land and finally deeded more than 200,000 [[acre]]s (809&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to the State of Maine for a park, named [[Baxter State Park]] after him.   The summit was officially recognized by the US Board on Geographic Names as "Baxter Peak" in 1931.

[[File:Katahdin assent.JPG|thumb|upright|The Appalachian Trail on Katahdin's Hunt Spur]]

==Recreation opportunities==
As the northern terminus of the [[Appalachian Trail]] and southern terminus of the [[International Appalachian Trail]], Katahdin is a popular hiking and backpacking destination and the centerpiece of [[Baxter State Park]]. 
Baxter State Park is open year-round, though strictly regulated in winter.  The overnight camping season is from May&amp;nbsp;15 to October&amp;nbsp;15 each year.  Capacity limits have been placed on day use parking at the trailheads to minimize the overuse of trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baxterstateparkauthority.com/hiking/parking.php |archiveurl=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:QWUCkK7ycEsJ:baxterstateparkauthority.com/hiking/parking.php+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |title=Parking lot capacities at Katahdin Trailheads |publisher=Baxter State Park Authority |archivedate=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mt. Katahdin has several trails leading up to either Pamola or Baxter Peak. There are two trails, Hunt and Abol, accessible from the south side of the mountain, each with its own separate parking lot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.baxterstateparkauthority.com/hiking/hikeKathadin.htm|title = Baxter State Park Authority|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These trails start right up the mountain, but each trail on the mountain ends up taking eight to ten hours round-trip depending on ability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://actoutwithaislinn.bangordailynews.com/2013/07/16/one-minute-hikes/1-minute-hike-katahdin-helon-taylor-knife-edge-abol-trails/|title = One Minute Hikes: Helon Taylor, Knife Edge, Abol|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://actoutwithaislinn.bangordailynews.com/2014/09/30/one-minute-hikes/1-minute-hike-cathedral-trail-of-katahdin/|title = One Minute Hikes: Cathedral|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://actoutwithaislinn.bangordailynews.com/2012/08/14/one-minute-hikes/1-minute-hike-saddle-trail-mount-katahdin-maine/|title = One Minute Hikes: Saddle|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the trails go up the north side or west side of the mountain. These are accessed from the Chimney Pond Trail. For these trails, hikers must park at the Roaring Brook Campground and hike in. All trails are maintained by the Baxter State Park Authority, which runs the State Park. All of the trails on the mountain are classified as very strenuous, the highest classification the Park Authority gives, except for Saddle (strenuous), Hamlin Ridge trail (moderate), and Chimney Pond (moderate).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The most famous hike to the summit goes along Knife Edge, which traverses the ridge between Pamola Peak and Baxter Peak.  The mountain has claimed 23&amp;nbsp;lives since 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baxterstateparkauthority.com/hiking/tips.htm |title=Hiking Tips &amp; Wilderness Considerations |publisher=Baxter State Park Authority |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from exposure in bad weather and falls from the Knife Edge. For about 3/10 of a mile the trail is 3 feet wide, with a drop off on either side.  The Knife Edge is closed during periods of high wind.

The '''Nazarenes''' (in [[hebrew]]: נַצְרָתִים) ([[transliteration]]: ''Natzratim'') or '''Nazarene Judaism''' are followers of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] ([[Yeshua]]) and practice a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://natzratim.com/fundacion/Natzratim-Articulo-I.pdf  www.natzratim.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazarenes are part of the Jewish people, but they are not part of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The Nazarenes have some ideological differences with [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]].

== Messianic Judaism ==
[[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]] believe in the [[Holy Trinity]], they believe that Jesus of Nazareth is [[Elohim]], they believe that the [[Torah]], the [[Tanakh|Tanach]], and the [[New Covenant]], are part of the divine [[revelation]]. The messianic [[liturgy]] is based on [[Judaism]], but can incorporate some elements of evangelical [[Christianity]].

== Nazarene Judaism ==
The Nazarenes do not believe in the Trinity, they believe that Jesus of Nazareth was a [[human]] being, they believe in the Torah and the Tanach, but they do not believe that the New Covenant is a sacred [[book]]. The Nazarene liturgy is based on the application of the Torah, according to the interpretation of [[Rabbi]] Jesus of Nazareth.

'''Our Lady of Sorrows of Batong Paloway''' is an image of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] on a stone, venerated in [[Catanduanes]], [[Philippines]]. 

The image on the stone &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gmanews.tv, 'Miraculous' stone with image of Mary 'grows' in Bicol|ref=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/101031/hashtag/miraculous-stone-with-image-of-mary-grows-in-bicol}}&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the Spanish icon of "Our Lady of the Finger" (''Nuestra Señora del Dedo''), which shows her finger coming out from underneath her veil. Since this title was not yet known or popular in the Philippines at the turn of the 20th century (when the image was discovered), devotees conflated it with [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], a form more popular especially during [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}From 1900 to 1910, the town of [[San Andres, Catanduanes|Calolbon]] felt the strains of the transition to American rule. The people slowly adjusted the new era, hoped for the lesser cruelty and prayed for a total change. Religion at that times was their consolation, their weapon and solace toward off evils, their source of hope for a better place to live in only through the power of prayers that their wishes be granted. 

Religious as they were, villagers did not miss reciting the [[Angelus]] at six o’clock in the morning and in the evening of each day. By nature, the natives were resilient, hardworking and God-fearing. Their means of living primarily came from farming, supplemented fishing. This was the picture of Calolbon and its people, where graft and corruption and various crimes were unheard of.

It was harvest season (October to November); the people were busy harvesting the palay. One late morning, another happening was in the making. Pacio Socao, together with his companion, was herding carabaos in the Culapnit, a few kilometers away from the [[Poblacion]].

After placing their carabaos in a grassy plain, Pacio started to look for a place where he might rest, and he chose an ''iba'' or ''kamiás'' (''[[Averrhoa bilimbi]]'') tree. When he started to climb, he was attracted by a luminous object sthat shone in the morning sun. He picked up the object and saw it was a stone imprinted with the features of an enchanting woman. He showed it to his companion, who remarked that it might be an ''[[aswang]]'' or something evil. Pacio thus threw the stone away, and it landed in carabao [[mud hole]] (''lab-ogan'') surrounded by thick bushes and [[guava]] trees. The boys then forgot about the incident.

[[File:Close up Batong Paloway.jpg|thumb|left|Closeup of the image]]
One afternoon before they went home, Pacio went near the same ''iba'' tree and there he saw again the stone with a picture. This time he put it in his pocket, and the  started to go home. When he reached home, he kept the stone up between the [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] thatchings of their house. Early in the evening, his mother María, known to most as Bengge, was surprised by a shimmering light in their roof. She called Pacio and asked him to see what the light was; the boy obeyed and found out that it was the stone he had hid. His mother stored the image inside their trunk, which contained some of their clothes and valuables.

At this point, Bengge remembered that as she was in the fields with other villagers harvesting rice, she heard churchbells pealing loudly out of nowhere. She surmised that his happened the moment Pacio found the image. Sometime later, the Socao family started smelling an unidentifiable yet sweet odour. They later discovered that the fragrance was emanating from the trunk where the image was kept. They removed the image and enthroned it on their home altar. The picture started to radiate more beautifully, with her forehead prominently and partly covered by a blue white veil. A mole is sometimes seen on the forehead and many have seen the image wink. The lady has long eyelashes which made her even prettier. Natives of the place were ready to accept the apparition yet reluctant to openly manifest it, had it not been for the first wave of the pilgrims coming from the different coastal towns of [[Camarines]] and [[Albay]]. These people rode in sailing boats called ''parao''. With them were sick people who were carried in [[hammock]]s. Asked why they came, they all answered, they were sick and they can only be healed by Maria. A middle aged woman, nicknamed “Bengge”, came to their houses to ask for alms and many forms of material aid, so she could start building an ermita in honor of “Our Lady of Sorrows” (Nuestra Señora de Dolor). The replay of the pilgrims surprised the natives for never had Bengge travelled far to reach the mainland, except the places within the confines of Calolbon.

==Devotion==

Wave after the wave of people the normal, the infirmed and the sick from distant towns of [[Catanduanes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Catanduanes|title=Website|ref=http://catanduanes.gov.ph/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mainland came bringing with them the [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] shingles [[rattan]], money, rice, oil and animals like pigs, [[carabao]]s and many more. They prayed before the image of Our Lady of Sorrows, Pacio was asked to massage the afflicted parts of the sick people. Some got leaves, stem and branches, barks, and roots of Iba tree and used it as medicine. Many of them got cured and relieved. The relief and cure of the sick was evident. No doubt, to these people it was a miracle. For so many months, many sick went there and donations, as days passed is now enough to build a chapel on the spot where the miraculous picture was found. The place was at that time called Culapnit (now part of Batong Paloway). When the venerated miraculous image of Our Lady of Sorrows was enshrined there, another miracle happened. At the base of the iba tree (foot of the altar), there came out a spring of clear water. At that time, Iba tree was almost extinct down to its deepest roots and with no more parts of the tree to get as medicine, perhaps Our Lady of Sorrows could only explain the occurrence. The water from the spring was curative. There were instances of miracles experienced by those who came to the place where the miraculous picture was.

==Description==

The picture of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] looks like it was perfectly glued and laminated to a small hard stone, the other side with a flat surface. The picture seemed laminated and the texture is indeed smooth with glossy surface. The image now is properly adorned in a glass frame and put in the Ermita where devotees go and pray and offer masses. Meanwhile, when the miracle of Our Lady of Sorrows was known far and wide, the family who found the image lived in abundance. They had tray of coins and baskets of donations, unfortunately, their wealth and abundance became their obsession, and they spent money for luxury. They even defied the order of the parish priest not to slaughter pigs and carabaos as it was the eve of the feast day of St. Peter and St. Paul. The priest was furious and ordered that the image should be brought to the town and be enshrined in the town’s church.Another miracle was when the image was brought to the town and presented to the priest in the convent. From nowhere was water that dropped in front of the image of Our Lady of Sorrows forming a [[cross]].

==Current Devotion==
[[File:Batong Paloway Chapel facade.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of Sorrows Chapel, San Andres [[Catanduanes]]]] 
The picture of Our Lady of Sorrows remained for a long time in the Parish Church. Only during the start of the [[Novena]] in preparation of the Barrio Fiesta that the venerated image of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores was permitted to be brought back at her original place with a condition to be returned after the “Celebra”. Even then, many people flocked to Batong Paloway during the feast day celebrated in December. The image was returned only during the term of Rev. Fr. Andres Tablizo in 1938-1941 upon the appeal of the natives of Batong Paloway. These people were insistent to get back their patroness, Our Lady of Sorrows for they experienced and witnessed bright rays of light coming from their altar at the chapel. This happened usually after six in the evening. These signs were enough to strengthen the natives’ rights to claim for their own patroness. The miracles perhaps of later times were only felt and received by those who came and prayed and favors were granted. However, in subsequent years, for many felt and received relief and thorough recovery, the devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows did not wane. Despite the absence of documented events and experiences on the miracles and favors granted to the faithful, still devotees flock to the place where she resides. Friday is the special day preferred for it was the day when the stone was found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">The term '''Parmalim''' or '''malim''' describes the followers of the ''Malim religion'' (''Ugamo Malim'' or Batak nation religion), the modern form of the traditional [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] religion. People who are not familiar with the Batak language may erroneously assume Parmalim is the name of the religion rather than its practitioners.

At the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century the Parmalim movement, which originated in [[Toba Batak people|Toba]] lands spread to other areas of the Batak lands. Especially in the lower [[Karo Plateau|Karo]] lands, the 'dusun' the Malim religion, became very influential as an expression of anti-colonial sentiments at the turn of the 20th century. Today the majority of Parmalim are [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]]. The largest of the several existing Parmalim groups has its centre in Huta Tinggi in the vicinity of [[Laguboti]] on the south shore of [[Lake Toba]].&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/16/malim-the-batak%E2%80%99s-native-religion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018185652/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/16/malim-the-batak%E2%80%99s-native-religion.html |archivedate=2010-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sahalana7o.blogspot.com/2008/08/parmalim-antara-agama-dan-budaya-batak.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malim religion has some similarities with Islam, including a prohibition on the consumption of pork and of blood, and the practice of wearing turbans. Modern Malim deny that these practices were derived from Islam.&lt;ref name=jpost /&gt;

One of the first leaders of the Parmalim movement was Raja Mulia Naipospos. Modern Parmalim trace their heritage to [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], a Batak leader in the fight against the Dutch, whose spirit is still alive in his successors. According to Raja Marnakkok Naipospos, a modern Parmalim leader, the faith has often be slandered as devil worship 'Campaigns branding Parmalim as devil worshippers still exist today', he said, 'Batak not familiar with Malim regard it as a heresy. But in fact, Malim recognizes the existence of the one and only Almighty God'.&lt;ref name=jpost /&gt; (Mula Jadi Na Bolon in [[Batak mythology]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">A '''religious reform''' (from Latin ''re'': back, again, and ''formare'': to form; i.e. put together: ''to restore, reconstruct, or rebuild'') aims at the reform of religious teachings. It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.

== Definition ==

Religious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Johnstone: [https://books.google.de/books/about/Religion_in_Society.html?id=11LuAAAAMAAJ Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion], Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2006. pp. 134 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: ''re-formare'', reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for [[ethics|ethical]] prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Hassan Butt: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/comment.religion1 My plea to fellow Muslims: you must renounce terror], in: The Guardian 01 July 2007; citation: "If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists, Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I'd like to term the Land of Co-existence. And when this new theological territory is opened up, Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world, rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a "final" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by [[Karl Barth]] in 1947: ''[[Ecclesia semper reformanda est]]'', i.e. ''The church is always to be reformed.''&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mahlmann: ''Ecclesia semper reformanda''. Eine historische Aufarbeitung. Neue Bearbeitung, in: Torbjörn Johansson, Robert Kolb, Johann Anselm Steiger (Hrsg.): Hermeneutica Sacra. Studien zur Auslegung der Heiligen Schrift im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert, Berlin - New York 2010, pp. 382-441, here pp. 384-388&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|restore paganism as state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. the struggle for the meaning of ''[[Aggiornamento]]'' in the Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]]. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. title of: J. Schacht: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282132 Modernism and Traditionalism in a History of Islamic Law], in:  Middle Eastern Studies Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul., 1965), pp. 388-400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous examples of religious reforms ==
* The [[Buddhist councils]] for the clarification of the teachings of the Buddha.
* The [[First Council of Nicaea]] for the clarification of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], 325 AD.
* The movement of the Muslim [[Muʿtazila]] rejected wrong traditions, 9th to 11th century.
* The [[Protestant Reformation]] of 1517 by [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and others.
* The introduction of the [[Historical Criticism#History|Historical-Critical Method]] in Christianity in the 19th and 20th century.
* The [[Second Vatican Council]] of the [[Catholic Church]], 1962-1965.

==Christian orthodoxy==
Newton was born into an Anglican family three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. When Newton was three, his mother married the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]] of the neighbouring parish of [[North Witham]] and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Newton's religious views developed as a result of participation in an investigative discourse with Nature (the nature of the world), and developed from the apparent [[dichotomy]] between biblical reality and the increasing revelation of the structure of reality from investigation. Newton saw these truths of nature as challenging established religion, particularly as embodied in Christian scriptural belief.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Goldish 1998 -  ''Judaism in the theology of Sir Isaac Newton'' - 239 pages ''Volume 157 of Archives internationales d'histoire des idées'' [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nRKUNkeFFJMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Isaac+Newton+and+christianity&amp;ots=iC9NabEGs9&amp;sig=xNOLJpmKoGAZwpSn5G_JrtzrTcI#v=onepage&amp;q=Isaac%20Newton%20and%20christianity&amp;f=false Springer, 1998] Retrieved 28 January 2012 {{ISBN|0-7923-4996-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christianity Today International - [http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1991/issue30/3038.html archives ] Retrieved 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Unorthodoxy was made necessary for Newton, and those affiliated with him, by the need for rediscovery of a  ''[[Wikt:prisco|prisca]]'' truth that had been hidden somewhere in the time of classical history.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Boyd Haycock]] 2004 - 'The long lost truth' Sir Isaac Newton and the Newtonian pursuit of long lost knowledge [http://www.cefetrn.br/~zanoni/Arquivos_licenciatura/historia_da_ciencia/The_long_lost_truth.pdf Elsevier 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324062304/http://www.cefetrn.br/~zanoni/Arquivos_licenciatura/historia_da_ciencia/The_long_lost_truth.pdf |date=24 March 2012 }} Retrieved 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By this they might have the capacity to engage in open dialogue with an investigation into Nature.

As is found among some of the established intellectuals of the [[Renaissance]] age, Newton believed that ancient philosophers and religious persons had gained insight into the truth of the nature of the world and universe, but this truth having become hidden within the language of the recording of the truth at the time and by later medieval scholars ([[Albertus Magnus]], [[Arnold of Villanova]] and [[Roger Bacon]]) that required deciphering in order to be understood. The belief in the wisdom of the ancients, that thinking was intelligent and knowing in the civilization of classical religious figures (Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet Isaiah and [[Solomon]]) and writers (Plato and Democritus) is known as ''prisca sapientia''.&lt;ref name=" Christianson  "/&gt;

Like many contemporaries (e.g., [[Thomas Aikenhead]]) he lived with the threat of severe punishment if he had been open about his religious beliefs. Heresy was a crime that could have been punishable by the loss of all property and status or even death (see, e.g., the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]]). Because of his secrecy over his religious beliefs, Newton has been described as a [[Nicodemite]].&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt;

==God as masterful creator==
Newton saw God as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, R.K. ed. Knud Haakonssen. "The emergence of Rational Dissent." Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1996. p19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he rejected [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the ''Opticks'', Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:
{{quote| For while comets move in very eccentric orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the planets move one and the same way in orbs concentric, some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have arisen from the mutual actions of comets and planets on one another, and which will be apt to increase, till this system wants a reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 1706 ''Opticks'' (2nd Edition), quoted in H. G. Alexander 1956 (ed): ''The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'', University of Manchester Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This passage prompted an attack by Leibniz in a letter to his friend [[Caroline of Ansbach]]:
{{quote|Sir Isaac Newton and his followers have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of God. According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, first letter, in Alexander 1956, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz' letter initiated the [[Leibniz-Clarke correspondence]], ostensibly with Newton's friend and disciple [[Samuel Clarke]], although as Caroline wrote, Clarke's letters "are not written without the advice of the Chev. Newton".&lt;ref&gt;Caroline to Leibniz, 10 January 1716, quoted in Alexander 1956, p. 193. (Chev. = Chevalier i.e. Knight.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Clarke complained that Leibniz' concept of God as a "supra-mundane intelligence" who set up a "pre-established harmony" was only a step from atheism: "And as those men, who pretend that in an earthly government things may go on perfectly well without the king himself ordering or disposing of any thing, may reasonably be suspected that they would like very well to set the king aside: so, whosoever contends, that the beings of the world can go on without the continual direction of God...his doctrine does in effect tend to exclude God out of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, first reply, in Alexander 1956 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to stepping in to re-form the solar system, Newton invoked God's active intervention to prevent the stars falling in on each other, and perhaps in preventing the amount of motion in the universe from decaying due to viscosity and friction.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Alexander 1956, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; In private correspondence Newton sometimes hinted that the force of Gravity was due to an immaterial influence:
{{quote|Tis inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should (without the mediation of something else which is not material) operate upon &amp; affect other matter without mutual contact.&lt;ref&gt;Newton to Bentley, 25 Feb 1693&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz jibed that such an immaterial influence would be a continual miracle; this was another strand of his debate with Clarke.

Newton's view has been considered to be close to [[deism]] and several biographers and scholars labeled him as a deist who is strongly influenced by Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays on the Context, Nature, and Influence of Isaac Newton's Theology|year=1990|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780792305835|first=James E.|last= Force|first2= Richard Henry |last2=Popkin|editor-first=James E. |editor-last=Force|editor2-first= Richard Henry |editor2-last=Popkin|page=53|quote=Newton has often been identified as a deist. ...In the 19th century, William Blake seems to have put Newton into the deistic camp.

Cragg views Newton as a kind of proto-deist and, as evidence, points to Newton's belief in a true, original, monotheistic religion first discovered in ancient times by natural reason. This position, in Cragg's view, leads to the elimination of the Christian revelation as neither necessary nor sufficient for human knowledge of God. This agenda is indeed the key point, as Leland describes above, of the deistic program which seeks to "set aside" revelatory religious texts. Cragg writes that, "In effect, Newton ignored the claims of revelation and pointed in a direction which many eighteenth-century thinkers would willingly follow." John Redwood has also recently linked anti-Trinitarian theology with both "Newtonianism" and "deism."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Innermost Kernel: Depth Psychology and Quantum Physics.

On the other hand, [[latitudinarian]] and Newtonian ideas taken too far resulted in the millenarians, a religious faction dedicated to the concept of a mechanical universe, but finding in it the same enthusiasm and mysticism that the Enlightenment had fought so hard to extinguish.&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, Margaret C.

==The Bible==

Newton spent a great deal of time trying to discover [[Bible code|hidden messages within the Bible]].  After 1690, Newton wrote a number of [[religious tracts]] dealing with the literal interpretation of the [[Bible]]. In a manuscript Newton wrote in 1704 he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible. He estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite news |title=Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse |agency=Associated Press |date=19 June 2007 |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton%27s_Religious_Side%2C_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070629231937/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton's_Religious_Side,_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm |archivedate=29 June 2007 |accessdate=2018-05-17 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prophecy===
Newton relied upon the existing Scripture for prophecy, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be, "so little understood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Newton  | first = Isaac  | title = The First Book Concerning the Language of the Prophets  | publisher = The Newton Project  | date = 5 April 2007  | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&amp;mode=normalized  | accessdate = 15 August 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210637/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&amp;mode=normalized  | archivedate = 8 November 2007  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he would never write a cohesive body of work on Prophecy, Newton's beliefs would lead him to write several treatises on the subject, including an unpublished guide for prophetic interpretation entitled ''Rules for interpreting the words &amp; language in Scripture''. In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.

===End of The World vs Start of The Millennial Kingdom===

In his posthumously-published ''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John'', Newton expressed his belief that Bible prophecy would not be understood "until the time of the end", and that even then "none of the wicked shall understand". Referring to that as a future time ("the last age, the age of opening these things, be now approaching"), Newton also anticipated "the general preaching of the Gospel be approaching" and "the Gospel must first be preached in all nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world".&lt;ref&gt;''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John'' by Sir Isaac Newton, 1733, J. DARBY and T. BROWNE, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16878/16878-h/16878-h.htm#NtpJohI_41 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, a large amount of media attention and public interest has circulated regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, that indicate he believed the world could end in 2060. While Newton also had many other possible dates (e.g. 2034),&lt;ref name=Snobelen&gt;{{cite web

Like most Protestant theologians of his time, Newton believed that the Papal Office, (and not any one particular Pope) was the fulfillment of the Biblical predictions about [[Antichrist]], whose rule was predicted to last for 1,260 years. They applied the [[day-year principle]] (in which a day represents a year in prophecy) to certain key verses in the books of Daniel&lt;ref&gt; the "time, times and half a time" of Daniel 7:25 and 12:7 &lt;/ref&gt; and Revelation&lt;ref&gt; the "42 months" of Revelation 11:2 and 13:5 equals the "1260 days" of Revelation 11:3 and 12:6 &lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the Apocalypse), and looked for significant dates in the Papacy's rise to power to begin this timeline. Newton's calculation ending in 2060 is based on the 1,260-year timeline commencing in 800 AD when [[Charlemagne]] became the first Holy Roman Emperor and reconfirmed the earlier (756 AD) [[Donation of Pepin]] to the Papacy.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;

=== 2016 vs 2060 ===

However, between the time he wrote his 2060 prediction (about 1704) until his death in 1727 Newton conversed, both first hand and by correspondence, with other famous theologians of his time. Those contemporaries who knew him during the remaining 23 years of his life appear to be in agreement that Newton, and the "best interpreters" including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)| Jonathan Edwards]], [[Robert Fleming the younger | Robert Fleming]], [[Moses Lowman]], [[Phillip Doddridge]], and Bishop [[Thomas Newton]], were eventually "pretty well agreed" that the 1,260-year timeline should be calculated from the year 756 AD.&lt;ref&gt; Jonathan Edwards ”History of Redemption” New York: T. and J. Swords (1793) page 431: "The Beginning of the reign of Antichrist.] The best interpreters (as Mr. Fleming, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Lowman, Dr. Doddridge, Bp. Newton, and Mr. Reader) are pretty well agreed that this reign is to be dated from about A. D. 756, when the Pope began to be a temporal power, (that is, in prophetic language, a beast) by assuming temporal dominion; 1260 years from this period will bring us to about A. D. 2000, and about the 6000th year of the world, which agrees with a tradition at least as ancient as the epistle ascribed to the apostle Barnabas (f 15.] which says, that " in six thousand years shall all things be accomplished." &lt;/ref&gt;

F.A. Cox also confirmed that this was the view of Newton and others, including himself:

{{bquote | ''“The author adopts the hypothesis of Fleming, Sir Isaac Newton, and Lowman, that the 1260 years commenced in A.d. 756; and consequently that the millennium will not begin till the year 2016.”''&lt;ref&gt; Rev. F.A. Cox “Outlines of Lectures on the Book of Daniel” London: Westley and Davis (1833) 2nd Edition Page 152 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Williams (1755–1839)|Thomas Williams]] stated that this timeline had become the predominant view among the leading Protestant theologians of his time:

{{bquote | ''“Mr. Lowman, though an earlier commentator, is (we believe) far more generally followed ; and he commences the 1260 days from about 756, when, by aid of Pepin, King of France, the Pope obtained considerable temporalities. This carries on the reign of Popery to 2016, or sixteen years into the commencement of the Millennium, as it is generally reckoned.”''&lt;ref&gt; Thomas Williams “The Cottage Bible and family expositor” Hartford: D.F.

In April of 756 AD, [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]], King of France, accompanied by [[Pope Stephen II]] entered northern Italy, forcing the Lombard King [[Aistulf]] to lift his siege of Rome, and return to [[Pavia]]. Following Aistulf's capitulation, Pepin gave the newly conquered territories to the Papacy by means of the [[Donation of Pepin]], thereby elevating the Pope from being a subject of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to [[head of state]], with [[temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] over the newly constituted [[Papal States]]. 

The end of the timeline is based on Daniel 8:25 which reads ''"...but he shall be broken without hand"'' and is understood to mean that the end of the Papacy with not be caused by any human action.&lt;ref&gt; Bishop Thomas Newton "DISSERTATIONS ON THE PROPHECIES" London: J.F. and C. Rivington (1789) 8th Edition Page 327: "As the stone in Nebuchadnezzar's dream was cut out of the mountain without hands, that is not by human, but by supernatural means; so the little horn shall be broken without hand, not die the common death, not fall by the hand of men, but perish by a stroke from heaven."&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic activity is described as the means by which Rome will be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt; East Apthorp, D.D. "Discourses on Prophecy" (1786) Discourse XI,  Page 273: "Rome the seat of Antichrist will be consumed with fire, at the coming of Christ, or when the period of her apostacy is expired, in 1260 years from the rise of Antichrist." Page 275: "...present Rome, when by an eruption of fire the mountainous soil, being undermined, will fall into an abyss, and be covered with the sea* &lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text= ''"Antichrist will retain some part of his dominion over the nations till about the year 2016." "And when the 1260 years are expired, Rome itself, with all its magnificence, will be absorbed in a lake of fire, sink into the sea, and rise no more at all for ever*."&lt;ref&gt; Rev. David Simpson "A Plea for Religion and the Sacred Writings" London: W. Baynes, and Paternoster-Row. (1808) 5th Edition, pages 131 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1870 the newly formed [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the remaining [[Papal States]], depriving the Popes of any temporal rule for the next 59 years. Unaware that Papal rule would be restored, (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the [[Vatican City]] state, the historicist view that the Papacy is the Antichrist, and the associated timelines delineating his rule rapidly declined in popularity as one of the defining characteristics of the Antichrist (i.e. that he would also be a political temporal power at the time of the return of Jesus) were no longer met. 

Eventually, the prediction was largely forgotten and no major Protestant denomination currently subscribes to this timeline.

Despite the dramatic nature of a prediction of the end of the world, Newton may not have been referring to the 2060 date as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the earth and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian theology, this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of [[Paradise]] by The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=Snobelen/&gt;

[[Henry More]]'s belief in the universe and rejection of [[Cartesian dualism]] may have influenced Newton's religious ideas.  Later works—''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' (1728) and ''Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John'' (1733)—were published after his death.&lt;ref name="Westfall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Westfall|first=Richard S.|title=Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England|year=1973| publisher=U of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06190-7|origyear=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]'s mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox clergy as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians.&lt;ref name="jacob" /&gt; The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way in which to combat the emotional and mystical superlatives of superstitious enthusiasm, as well as the threat of atheism.&lt;ref name="jacob" /&gt;

The attacks made against pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[magical thinking]], and the [[mystical]] elements of [[Christianity]], were given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe.  Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion through [[mathematical proof]]s, and more importantly was very successful in popularizing them.&lt;ref name="Westfall" /&gt;  Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Martin. ed.

'''Samādhi''' (Hindi: समाधि) or '''samadhi mandir''' is the [[Hindi]] name for a temple commemorating the dead (similar to a [[tomb]] or [[mausoleum]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-SAMADHI-in-hindi.html|title=Hindi dictionary (Samadhi)|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/samadhi?q=Samadhi|title=Oxford Dictionary - American English|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/samadhi|title=Oxford Dictionary - English|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may or may not contain the body of the deceased. Samadhi sites are often built in this way to honor people regarded as [[saint]]s or [[guru]]s in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious traditions, wherein such souls are said to have passed into ''[[Mahasamādhi|mahāsamādhi]]'', or were already in ''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]'' (non-dualistic state of consciousness) at the time of death. 

The tradition of India is [[cremation]] for most Hindu people at the time of death, while samadhi is generally reserved for very advanced souls, such as yogis and saints, who have already been "purified by the fire of yoga"&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein, ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'' (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 2011 ), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; or who are believed to have been in the state of ''samadhi'' at time of death. Samadhi doesn’t involve cremation.

One of the popular site of pilgrimage in India is the town of [[Alandi]] in the state of [[Maharashtra]] where the 13th century [[Varkari]] saint [[Dnyaneshwar]] took Sanjivan Samadhi or entombed himself in the state of Samadhi.His devotees believe that he is still alive{{sfn|Novetzke|2009|p=218}}{{sfn|Glushkova|2014|p=116}}.

[[File:Shitao-autoportrait.jpg|thumb|right|Shitao, ''Master Shi Planting Pines'', c. 1674, ink and color on paper. [[National Palace Museum]]]]

'''Shitao''' or '''Shi Tao''' ({{zh|t=石濤|s=石涛|p=Shí Tāo|w='''Shih-t'ao'''}}; 1642–1707), born into the [[Ming dynasty]] imperial clan as '''Zhu Ruoji''' (朱若極), was a Chinese [[Landscape painting|landscape painter]] in the early [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911).&lt;ref name="Hay"&gt;{{harvnb|Hay|2001|pp=1, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Quanzhou County]] in [[Guangxi]] province, Shitao was a member of the royal house descended from the elder brother of [[Zhu Yuanzhang]]. He narrowly avoided catastrophe in 1644 when the Ming Dynasty fell to invading [[Manchus]] and civil rebellion. Having escaped by chance from the fate to which his lineage would have assigned him,&lt;ref&gt;His uncle remained in Guilin as the Prince of Jingjiang and took the fate of committing suicide when (a traitor of Ming China) general Kong Youde assaulted the lineage's homeland in the name of Qing in 1650.&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed the name Yuanji Shitao no later than 1651 when he became a Buddhist monk.

He moved from [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], where he began his religious instruction, to [[Anhui]] in the 1660s. Throughout the 1680s he lived in [[Nanjing]] and [[Yangzhou]], and in 1690 he moved to [[Beijing]] to find patronage for his promotion within the monastic system. Frustrated by his failure to find a patron, Shitao converted to [[Daoism]] in 1693 and returned to Yangzhou where he remained until his death in 1707. In his late years, he is said to have greeted [[Kangxi Emperor]] visiting Yangzhou. [[Geyuan Garden]] grows Chinese bamboo variations that Shitao himself loved.

[[File:Shitao-Qinhuai.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Reminiscences of Qin-Huai by Shih T'ao, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]
Shitao used over two dozen [[courtesy name]]s during his life. Both like and unlike [[Bada Shanren]], his feelings for his family history can be deeply felt from these.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1978|pp=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most commonly used names were '''Shitao''' (Stone Wave -  石涛), '''Daoji''' (道濟; '''Tao-chi'''), '''Kugua Heshang''' (Bitter Gourd Monk -苦瓜和尚), '''Yuan Ji''' (Origin of Salvation - 原濟), '''Xia Zunzhe''' (Honorable Blind One - 瞎尊者, blind to worldly desires), '''Dadizi''' (The Cleansed One - 大滌子).

As a buddhist convert, he was also known with the monastic name Yuan Ji (原濟)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China: five thousand years of history and civilization|year=2007|publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-93-7140-1|page=761|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Da Dizi was taken when Shitao renounced his [[Buddhism]] and turned to [[Daoism]]. It was also the name he used for his home in Yangzhou (Da Di Hall - 大滌堂).

==Art==
Shitao is one of the most famous individualist painters of the early Qing years. The art he created was revolutionary in its transgressions of the rigidly codified techniques and styles that dictated what was considered beautiful. Imitation was valued over innovation, and although Shitao was clearly influenced by his predecessors (namely [[Ni Zan]] and [[Li Yong (artist)|Li Yong]]), his art breaks with theirs in several new and fascinating ways.

His formal innovations in depiction include drawing attention to the act of painting itself through his use of washes and bold, impressionistic brushstrokes, as well as an interest in subjective perspective and the use of negative or white space to suggest distance. Shi Tao's stylistic innovations are difficult to place in the context of the period. In a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] dated 1686, Shitao wrote: "In painting, there are the Southern and the Northern schools, and in [[calligraphy]], the methods of the Two Wangs ([[Wang Xizhi]] and his son [[Wang Xianzhi (calligrapher)|Wang Xianzhi]]). [[Zhang Rong]] (443–497) once remarked, 'I regret not that I do not share the Two Wangs' methods, but that the Two Wangs did not share my methods.' If someone asks whether I [Shitao] follow the Southern or the Northern School, or whether either school follows me, I hold my belly laughing and reply, 'I always use my own method!'"&lt;ref name="Hay2"&gt;{{harvnb|Hay|2001|pp=243, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Paraphrased. The colophon was added to a 1667 hanging scroll of [[Mount Huang|Huang Shan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The poetry and calligraphy that accompany his landscapes are just as beautiful, irreverent, and vivid as the paintings they complement. His paintings exemplify the internal contradictions and tensions of the literati or scholar-amateur artist, and they have been interpreted as an invective against art-historical canonization.

'''"10,000 Ugly Inkblots"''' is a perfect example of Shitao's subversive and ironic aesthetic principles. This uniquely apperceptive work challenges accepted standards of beauty. As the carefully painted landscape degenerates into [[Pollock]]-esque splatters, the viewer is forced to recognize that the painting is not transparent (immediate, in the most literal sense meaning without media) in the way it initially purports to be. Solely because they are labeled "ugly," the ink dots begin to take on a sort of abstract beauty.

'''"Reminiscences of Qinhuai"''' is another of Shitao's unique paintings. Like many of the paintings from the late Ming Dynasty and early Manchurian sovereignty it deals with man's place in nature. Upon a first viewing, however, the craggy peak in this painting seems somewhat distorted. What makes this painting so unique is that it appears to depict the mountain bowing. A monk stands placidly on a boat that floats along the [[Qinhuai River|Qin-Huai river]], staring up in admiration at the genuflecting stone giant. The economy of respect that circulates between man and nature is explored here in a sophisticated style reminiscent of [[surrealism]] or [[magical realism]], and bordering on the absurd. Shitao himself had visited the river and the surrounding region in the 1680s, but it is unknown whether the album that contains this painting depicts specific places. Re-presentation itself is the only way the feeling of mutual respect that Shitao depicts in this painting could be communicated; the subject of a personified mountain simply defies anything simpler.

The shrine, after [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s death, was occupied by [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] and his supporters, who forcibly took the keys to the shrine in January 1922.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah: Its Continuing Place In History | last = Wilson | first = Helen T. | date = April 2000 | url = http://bahai-library.com/wilson_dispensation_bahaullah | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | publisher = bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of Acre ordered the keys to be returned to the authorities and a guard was posted at the shrine.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; In early 1923 the keys were returned to [[Shoghi Effendi]].&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; In the 1950s, Shoghi Effendi had made plans for a future superstructure, which would surround the whole area and would include a platform with 95 marble columns, each 6 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ugo |last=Giachery | authorlink=Ugo Giachery |year=1973 |title=Shoghi Effendi&amp;nbsp;— Recollections |publisher=George Ronald |location=[[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]] | isbn=0-85398-050-0 |pages=132–134, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoghi Effendi has called the shrine the Daryá-yi-Núr (Ocean of Light), which has taken the Kúh-i-Núr (Mountain of Light, the [[Shrine of the Báb]]) under its shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bahá'u'lláh and His Most Holy Shrine | first = Dhikru'llah | last = Khadem | authorlink = Dhikru'llah Khadem | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1976 | page = 15 | url = http://bahai-library.com/bahai_news | issue = 540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrine and its surrounding gardens, as well as the [[Mansion of Bahjí]], was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/452 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 | date = 2008-07-08 | title = Three new sites inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List | author = UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2007/whc07-31com-8be.pdf | title = Convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage | page = 34 | author = World Heritage Committee | date = 2007-07-02 | accessdate = 2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh's son [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Díyá'u'lláh|Díyá'u'lláh]], who died in 1898, was initially buried next to his father.  However, having been declared a [[Covenant-breaker]], Díyá'u'lláh's remains were disinterred in a process of "purification" through "cleansing" the inner sanctuary of the shrine, occasionally referred to as the "[[Qiblih]]" of the Bahá'í World at the request of relatives who were opposed to the Covenant-breaker faction of family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Marks |editor1-first=Geoffry W. |date=1996 |title=Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963-86: The Third Epoch of the Formative Age |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full&amp;chapter=3#66 |location= |publisher=Baha'i Publishing Trust |page=66 |isbn=978-0877432395}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shunfeng'er''' is a [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] [[sea god|sea]] and [[door god]]. He usually appears with [[Qianliyan]] as a guardian of the [[list of Mazu temples|temples]] of the [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]].
{{anchor|Etymology}}
==Name==
The name "Shunfeng'er" literally means "He with Ears that Follow the Wind" in reference to his ability to hear any sound carried upon the wind. The unusual idiom is translated variously as "Ears that Hear with the Wind",&lt;ref name=hopee/&gt; "Ears that Hear what Comes on the Wind",&lt;ref name=naddy/&gt; "Ears that Hear the Sounds Taken with the Wind",&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt; "Wind-Accompanying Ears",&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt; "Downwind Ears",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hanan |first=Patrick |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=3CsPWQOkzTwC&amp;pg=PA97 97] |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=3CsPWQOkzTwC |title=Chinese Fiction of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries |series=''Masters of Chinese Studies'', Vol. II |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |date=2004 |contribution=The First Novel Translated into Chinese }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or even "Sharp Ears",&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; "Far-Hearing",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/ |contribution-url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/07/27/2003371538 |contribution=The Good, the Bad, and the Divine |title=Taipei Times |last=Ho |first=Yi |authormask=Ho Yi }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Omniscience|All-Hearing]]".&lt;ref name=bspot/&gt; The god's role in helping sailors distinguish favorable winds also prompts the translations "Fair-Wind Ears"&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt; and "Favorable-Wind Ears".&lt;ref name=szhen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Ma-zu |contribution-url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=gfUK2ESprh0C&amp;pg=PT318 |title=Dictionary of Chinese Symbols |last=Eberhard |first=Wolfram |author2=G.L. Campbell |display-authors=1 |location=London |date=1986 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It also appears as {{nowrap|'''Shunfeng Er'''}}&lt;ref name=hopee&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA857 |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC |contribution=Tianhou |title=Holy People of the World, ''Vol. II'' |last=Giuffrida |first=Noelle |editor=Phyllis G. Jestice |display-editors=0 |publisher=ABC Clio |location=Santa Barbara |date=2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nowrap|'''Shen Feng Er'''.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Guardian of the South Seas: Thian Hock Keng and Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan |p=28 |location=Singapore |date=2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His partner Qianliyan's name similarly means "Sharp-Eyed" or "All-Seeing".

Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], Shunfeng'er was also known as '''Shi{{nbsp}}Kuang'''.{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} He is also sometimes known as '''Wanli'er''',&lt;ref name=sausages/&gt; which has similar meaning, as the Chinese word ''wàn''—like the English "[[myriad]]"—simultaneously means the number 10,000 and "innumerable" or "uncountably vast".

==History==
Shunfeng'er is first attested in the early-16th century [[Four Classic Novels|novel]] ''[[Journey to the West]]'',{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} where he appears as the [[personification|personified form]] of the [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] [[Jade Emperor]]'s ears&lt;ref name=bspot/&gt; and one of his lieutenants.{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} There is, however, an earlier depiction of him in a [[Sichuan]] cave which has been dated to the [[Southern Song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hu |first=Wenhe |authormask=Hu Wenhe |title=Taoist and Buddhist Sichuan Rock Cave Art ''[四川道教仏教石窟芸術,'' Sichuan Daojiao Fojiao Shiku Yishu'']'' |publisher=Sichuan People's Publishing |date=1994 |p=16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese [[Fable|folk tale]] about the [[Ten Brothers]] also probably long predates its first publication during the Ming Dynasty; in it, the eldest two brothers have powers just like those of [[Qianliyan]] and Shunfeng'er.&lt;ref name=macky&gt;{{citation |last=Sam |first=Chris W.C |author2=Eliza S.K. Leong |display-authors=1 |contribution-url=http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/archive-2007-2009/the-goddess-of-the-sea-and-her-guardians.html |contribution=The Goddess of the Sea and Her Guardians |url=http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/ |title=The Macau Daily Times |location=Macao |date=28 September 2008 |publisher=Macau Times Publications }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shunfeng'er next appeared as a lieutenant of the [[Huaguang Dadi|Emperor of Flowering Brightness]] {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|華|光|大|帝}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|华|光|大|帝}}}},}} ''Huáguāng Dàdì'') in [[Yu Xiangdou]]'s ''[[Journey to the South]]''{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} and as a character in [[Xu Zhonglin]]'s ''[[Creation of the Gods]]''.&lt;ref name=macky/&gt; He was confused with the [[door god]] [[Yulü (deity|Yulü]] {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|鬱壘}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|郁垒}}}},}} ''Yùlǜ'').{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}}

==Religion stories==
[[File:China Tianjin 5227631.jpg|thumb|200px|A green-skinned Shunfeng'er at [[Tianjin]]'s [[Tianhou Palace (Tianjin)|Queen of Heaven Palace]].]]
Shunfeng'er's sharp hearing is employed to help sailors distinguish favorable winds from coming storms.&lt;ref name=szhen/&gt; In some accounts, he is capable of hearing everything in the world, no matter how quietly spoken, and was therefore also worshipped as a witness and guarantor of oaths and contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=_W7sCgAAQBAJ |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=_W7sCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA644 644] |title=The Boxer Codex |date=2016 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill |location=Leiden }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shunfeng'er is most often portrayed as a [[Chinese demon|demon]] defeated and tamed or befriended by the [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]]. By one account, he and Qianliyan appeared off [[Meizhou Island]] during a storm and were defeated by Mazu's magical silk scarf, which blew clouds of sand into their ears and eyes. After their submission, they pledged their loyalty when she kindly healed them of the damage she had caused them.&lt;ref name=rmb&gt;{{harvp|Yuan|2006|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=UBHQC_Iz6OMC&amp;pg=PA123 123–4]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another, the two were Song generals who competed for her hand at Peach Blossom Mountain {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|桃花山}},}} ''Táohuā Shān'') but were both defeated by her [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/2008/09/02/mazu-the-princess-of-tides.html/ |contribution=Mazu: The Princess of Tides |date=2008 |url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/ |title=China Expat |last=Devonshire-Ellis |first=Chris |publisher=Asia Briefing }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another, the two were the brothers Gao Jue and Gao Ming. Ruthless generals, they fell at Peach Blossom Mountain and subsequently haunted it as demons. They appeared to Mazu when she traveled nearby and challenged her to battle, with the loser to do the winner's bidding. They intended to have her marry them both but were defeated by her magic and became her servants.&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt;&lt;ref name=bspot&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://chinesefolktales.blogspot.hk/2011/06/some-legends-about-sea-goddess-mazu.html |contribution=Mazu and General Sees All and General Hears All |date=2011 |title=Chinese Folktales |url=http://chinesefolktales.blogspot.hk |last=Lobb |first=Fred |publisher=Blogspot |location=Hong Kong }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In still another, the Gao brothers were bandits during the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] before they began to haunt the mountain.&lt;ref name=szhen&gt;{{citation |last=Baquet |first=James |date=2015 |contribution=Mazu's Consorts |contribution-url=http://www.szdaily.com/content/2015-06/29/content_11821624.htm |url=http://www.szdaily.com/ |title=Shenzhen Daily |location=Shenzhen }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In still another account, the pair were originally warriors or guards of [[King Zhou of Shang|King&amp;nbsp;Zhou]] of Shang.&lt;ref name=qingan&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nbqahg.com/ |title=''Official site'' |contribution-url=http://www.nbqahg.com/info.aspx?id=36731 |contribution=A Guide to Qing'an Guild Hall |location=Ningbo |publisher=East Zhejiang Maritime Affairs Folk Custom Museum |date=2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this version of the story, they are sometimes said to have already possessed their superhuman powers and to have used them to foil the first moves towards rebellion by the [[Zhou Empire|Zhou]]. Ji Fa's advisor [[Jiang Ziya]] is made out to have been a [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] adept, however, who uses the esoteric knowledge he received from the [[Yuanshi Tianzun|Primordial Lord of Heaven]] on {{nowrap|[[Mount Kunlun (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]]}} to defeat them. Their powers fail them when he covers them in the blood of a black dog and Ji Fa is able to triumph at [[Battle of Muye|Muye]] and finally establish himself as the [[King Wu of Zhou|Martial King of Zhou]] ("King Wu").&lt;ref name=macky/&gt;

===Worship===
Shunfeng'er most often appears as a [[door god]] at [[Mazuist]] temples&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; or as a guardian beside [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] at her altars&lt;ref name=hopee/&gt; or on her yellow paper charms.{{sfnp|Soo|1990|p=41}} He is separately worshipped in some villages&lt;ref name=sausages&gt;{{harvp|Dean|2010|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=zOB_X10kjYMC&amp;pg=PA147 147]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or by mariners for assistance avoiding danger. During the 8-day, {{convert|250|km|sp=us|adj=on|0}} annual pilgrimages from [[Dajia Jenn Lann Temple|Dajia]] to [[Chaotian Temple|Beigang]], Mazu's idol is accompanied by {{convert|10|ft|sp=us|adj=on|0}} figures of Shunfeng'er and Qianliyan played by masked men on [[stilts]].&lt;ref name=naddy&gt;{{citation |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&amp;pg=PA375 375] |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions |editor=Randall L.

===In art===
Shunfeng'er typically appears as a red- or brown-skinned demon cupping a hand to one of his ears. He also occasionally appears with three heads and six arms.&lt;ref name=thailex&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.thailex.info/thailex/thailexeng/lexicon/s.HTM |contribution=Shun Feng Er |title=ThaiLex |last=Masure |first=Yves |url=http://www.thailex.info/thailex/thailexeng/lexicon/Homepage.htm }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He usually appears to the left of his companion [[Qianliyan]]. Sometimes Shunfeng'er appears as the green demon, in which case he usually has one horn and [[ruby]] eyes.{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=319}}

{{Sikhism sidebar}}
The '''Sikh diaspora''' is the modern Punjabi [[Sikh]] migration from the traditional area of the [[Punjab region]]. [[Sikhism]] is (de facto) an [[ethnic religion]], the [[Punjab region]] being the historic homeland of Sikhism. The Sikh diaspora is largely a subset of the '''[[Punjabi diaspora]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encarta]]'' {{cite web |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566784/sikhism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002063119/http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566784/Sikhism.html |archivedate=2 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point of the diaspora is commonly accepted to have begun after the fall of the [[Sikh Empire]] in 1849 and the Empire's subsequent annexation into the [[British Raj]].  The most famous personification of the Sikh diaspora was the first, [[Duleep Singh|Maharajah Duleep Singh]], the last Emperor of the Sikhs who was coerced into a lifetime exile by the [[British Raj]].  Since Duleep Singh's exile, the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high; however the destination for Punjabi Sikh migrants has changed during the ensuing 150 years. The development of the Punjabi Sikh diaspora concept has given diaspora Sikhs a conscious political and cultural identity, which forms a reference point for their 'Sikhism'.

With approximately 27 million worldwide{{cn|date=January 2018}} Sikhs are adherents to the fifth-largest religion in the world, Sikhism, making up 0.39% of the world population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html CIA Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}  The 2011 Indian census reported approximately 20.8 million Sikhs living in India.&lt;ref name="Census2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikh Religion Census 2011|url=https://www.census2011.co.in/data/religion/4-sikhism.html|publisher=census2011|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 16 million, or 76% of all Indian Sikhs, live in the northern state of [[Punjab (India)]], where they form 58% of the population.  Substantial communities of Sikhs, more than 200,000, live in the Indian states and union territories of [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Delhi]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Census2011" /&gt;

==Historical migration patterns==

The Sikhs as a political entity, distinct from other Indian traditions, can be said to have begun with the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru, [[Arjan Dev|Guru Arjan Dev Ji]] in 1606, Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Sikh 'Pure' brotherhood or [[Khalsa]] (ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ), by [[Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh Ji]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/history/history_1.shtml BBC History of Sikhiam - The Khalsa]&lt;/ref&gt;  This gives the Sikhs, as an organized political grouping, a relatively recent history of around 400 years.  Migrations of Sikhs during the era of the Gurus were limited to the boundaries of modern-day India and [[Pakistan]], and in particular restricted to the Sikh tribal heartland of the [[Punjab Region]].  The development of the [[Sikh Confederacy]] and the development of the [[Sikh Empire]] (1716–1849), led to Sikhs migrating to conquered parts of their empire such as [[Ladakh]] and [[Peshawar]].  However these migrations were limited, transitory and unsustained, depending on the [[Sikh Empire|Empire's]] fluctuating boundaries.  During the time of the [[Sikh Empire]], there was a net cultural immigration, with [[Napoleonic]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] influences vying for the 'ear' of the then Sikh Maharajah [[Ranjit Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers (French Sources of Indian History Series) by Jean-Marie Lafont. Pub. by Oxford University Press (2002). Pp. 23-29. {{ISBN|0-19-566111-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the Sikh diaspora, the most important political aspect of this period was the historical establishment of a Sikh homeland; the idea of a powerful Sikh state was a reality.

==Annexation of the Punjab==
[[File:Dalip singh winterhalter.jpg|thumb|left|Maharajah [[Duleep Singh]], the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora]]
Sikh migration from the Punjab began in earnest in the second half of the 19th century when the [[British Raj]] had successfully completed its annexation of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].  The pivotal action in the British annexation was the lifetime exile of the then eleven-year-old Maharaja, [[Duleep Singh]], thus making Singh the first (although unwilling) member of the Sikh diaspora.

Although a largely secular figure who did little for the Sikh body politic, Axel (2001)&lt;ref name="The Nation's Tortured Body 2001"&gt;''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pub. by Duke University Press (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Duleep Singh's exile has had a major impact on the Sikh diaspora psyche.  Axel(2001)&lt;ref&gt;''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pub. by Duke University Press (2001). Pp. 48-65&lt;/ref&gt; says that [[Duleep Singh]] is the archetypal 'tragic hero' figure in Sikh culture, "a King without a Kingdom, a Sikh separated from his people"; the contrast between [[Duleep Singh]] and his strong ruler father, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] Ji, makes [[Duleep]]'s exile even more 'galling' for the Sikhs and results in a strong sense of communal injustice, which is a later trait in the diaspora's development.

Having annexed the [[Sikh Kingdom]], the [[British Raj]] preferentially recruited Sikhs in the [[Indian Civil Service]] and, in particular, the [[British Indian Army]], which led to migration of Sikhs to different parts of [[India|British India]] and the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffusion of Sikhism and recent migration patterns of Sikhs in India by A. K. Dutt1 and S. Devgun. Pub. GeoJournal Volume 1, Number 5 / September,1977.Pp 81-89. Available online [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p726g4t656018333/]&lt;/ref&gt; Semiskilled artisans were transported from the Punjab to British [[East Africa]] to help in the building of railways, while many Sikhs found themselves in [[Sikhism in Australia|Australia]] working as [[Ghans]], or cameleers and as labourers on cane plantations.

==20th century==

The Sikhs made tremendous contributions to Punjab from 1857 to 1947. Sikhs founded the city of [[Rawalpindi]]. Sikh agricultural and entrepreneurial skills brought prosperity to [[Sheikhupura]], [[Sialkot]], [[Jhelum (city)|Jhelum]], [[Multan]], [[Sargodha]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Amritsar]], [[Jullundar]]. [[Lahore]], the capital of undivided Punjab, had thriving Sikh neighborhoods.

The era of peace and prosperity turned into a nightmare in 1947. The partition of Punjab between India and [[Pakistan]] was a seminal tragedy for Sikhs. The Sikh communities were practically wiped out from Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Sialkot, [[Faisalabad|Lyallpur]], Jhelum, Gujrat, Sargodha, Sheikhupura and other districts of West Punjab. The birthplace of Sikhism, Nankana Sahib, was split away in West Punjab. Millions of Sikhs fled to freedom and safety in East Punjab in India. Such intense violence in East Punjab had caused  many villages and cities to go through construction.

In 1960s and beyond many Sikhs migrated to the [[Sikhism in United Kingdom|UK]] and North America in search of economic opportunities. Some of the Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan leader [[Idi Amin]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Sikhism. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 12 Sept. 2007 [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-253167]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikhs are primarily an agrarian community and with the pressures of having only a limited amount of land, high birth rates and the desire to make a better living, the male offspring of Sikh farmers were encouraged to migrate to foreign countries.  Subsequently, the main 'push' factor for Sikh migration has been economic with significant Sikh communities now being found in [[Philippines]], Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, [[Malaysia]], [[East Africa]], [[Sikhism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Thailand]].

==Agitation for a homeland==
{{Further information|Khalistan movement}}
[[File:Punjab flag.svg|thumb|Sikh Flag- The [[Nishan Sahib]]]]

Axel (2001)&lt;ref name="The Nation's Tortured Body 2001"/&gt; argues that the Sikh diaspora community, having established themselves in foreign countries, begin to fetishize the past and nurture idealized designs for their 'lost and imaginary' Sikh empire.  This comes into fruition to a certain degree with the establishment of [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]] in 1966 as a Sikh majority state.  However, Tatla(1998)&lt;ref&gt;The Sikh Diaspora Search for Statehood by Darshan Singh Tatla(1998). Pp. 16-33. Pub. by University of Washington Press. 10-295-97715-9&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the marginalization and sense of grievance that Indian Sikhs were facing due to [[Indira Gandhi]]'s heavy-handed tactics were amplified in the Sikh diaspora.  Subsequently, the Sikh diaspora, especially in South Vancouver, Canada&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver: Three Generations Amid Tradition, Modernity, and Multiculturalism]]'' by Kamala Elizabeth Nayar. Pub. by [[University of Toronto Press]] (April 8, 2004) Pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=NShXfaNbRyEC&amp;pg=PA34 34]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=NShXfaNbRyEC&amp;pg=PA57 57].  {{ISBN|0-8020-8631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK become willing suppliers of logistical and financial support when the organic agitation for a separate Sikh nation, [[Khalistan]], began in the late 1970s.  The actions taken by the Indian government to counter the Sikh separatist movement, via 1984's [[Operation Blue Star]], had a seismic effect on the Sikh diaspora.  Axel (2001) &lt;ref&gt;''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pp.68 - 72. Pub. by Duke University Press (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the desecration of the Sikh's holiest shrine, [[Harimandir Sahib]], and the following Sikh Genocide in which thousands of Sikhs were massacred; led to a resurgence in Sikh religiosity and a strengthening of ties with their Sikh brethren in Punjab.  Diaspora Sikhs felt betrayed by India, and the events of 1984 defined their Sikhism and underlined a distinct commonality shared with other diaspora Sikhs.  Mark Tully&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/171_afterbluestar/ BBC Archives: After Blue Star]&lt;/ref&gt; describes 1984's [[Operation Blue Star]] as the Sikh's '[[9/11]]', this was certainly the case for diaspora Sikhs, who in the main could only watch on in horror as the events of 1984 played out on TV.

In 1971 Dr Jagit Singh Chohan, an ex-minister in a short-lived government of [[Akali Movement|Akali]] dissidents, saw an alignment of like-minded Sikhs.  Chohan placed a half-page advertisement in ''The New York Times'' of 12 October 1971, making several claims about Punjab as a Sikh homeland.  However, Chohan won little sympathy from ordinary Sikhs&lt;ref name="Sikh Religion"&gt;

[[File:Thousands-Sikhs-protest-in-London.jpg|thumb|Sikhs in [[London]] protest against Indian government actions]]
Tatla summarises the change in Sikh diaspora community leaders post 1984 a being a "painful transition from a self-confident community with haughty discourse, to the self-defensive strategies of a vulnerable minority".&lt;ref name ="Sikh Religion"/&gt;  Organisations such as the [[International Sikh Youth Federation]] (ISYF), the [[Babbar Khalsa]] and the Council of Khalistan emerged within the diaspora, and these agencies rallied against "Hindu imperialism" or "Indian nationalism" and lobbied to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization [[UNPO]] aligning the Sikh cause with other ethnic groups seeking freedom, citing cases of Jews, Palestinians, Kurds, Balochis, Kashmiris and Sri Lankan Tamils.

Axel (2001)&lt;ref name="The Nation's Tortured Body 2001"/&gt; argues that the history of the Sikh diaspora, its psyche of grievance and the violence inflicted on it, means that the notion of the Sikh diaspora as a community today inevitably converges on the notion of Khalistan.  In addition to this, Axel points out the 'nightmare' scenario facing the Sikh diaspora; the Indian state 'demands' the 'Unity-in-Diversity' model of 'rashtriya ekta' (national integration) which Axel contends is signified by "the denial of difference through surrender, assimilation and integration".

Since the formation of the Khalsa, the Sikhs have defined themselves though their 'separateness' and have differentiated themselves philosophically and physically from other Indian religious communities, thus the process of 'rashtriya ekta' is a threat to Sikhi itself.  Any 'weakening' or 'dilution' Sikhi in the Punjab, is doubly painful for the Sikh diaspora for it means a corresponding weakness in Khalistan, which, both real and imaginary, epitomizes the Sikh diasporic place today.

Whilst the rate of Sikh migration from the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration that favored English speaking countries, particularly the United Kingdom, has changed in the past decade due to factors such as stricter immigration procedures.

The largest North American Sikh community is thought to be located in South [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] and nearby [[Surrey, British Columbia]], while [[Brampton, Ontario]] also has a large Sikh population. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The Sikh migration to [[Australasia]] has also increased to a large extent in the first decade of the 21st century.

In the post-9/11 era, the Sikh diaspora in Europe and North America stand out as a visible minority often confused with radical Islamic groups because of their turbans. There have been numerous hate crimes targeted at Sikhs. France banned turban-wearing Sikh students from publicly funded schools as part of a broader policy originally intended to restrict Muslim head-scarves. Western security think-tanks quote the [[Air India Flight 182|Air India bombing]] to justify profiling of Sikh travellers at airports. Countering this train of thought, on January 16, 2018, [[Gurbir Grewal]] became attorney general of [[New Jersey]] - the first practicing Sikh in the US to become a State Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/nj_gets_first_sikh_attorney_general_in_us_history.html N.J. gets first Sikh attorney general in U.S. history]&lt;/ref&gt;The soft influences of popular culture and the need for fitting in with peers are driving many young Sikhs to shed Khalsa symbols such as the turban and beard. Some second-generation Sikhs growing up in the West do not have proficiency in the Punjabi language. On the other hand, small groups of Westerners have converted to Sikhism.&lt;ref name="rt2009-07-16"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-07-16/_White_Sikhs____foreigners_who_found_faith_in_Sikhism.html?fullstory|title="White Sikhs" – foreigners who found faith in Sikhism|last=Sharma|first=Nidhi|date=2009-07-16|publisher=[[Russia Today]]|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now Sikh Gurduwaras (equilvalent of churches and temples) scattered across Europe, North America, Australia and Malaysia. The combination of these factors creates a new and more complex Sikh identity that may slowly emerge in the 21st century.

[[File:Les Mystères de la franc-maçonnerie dévoilés par Léo Taxil.jpg|thumb|right|Poster advertising the work of Leo Taxil]]

==Taxil and Freemasonry==
Léo Taxil was the pen name of Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès, who had been accused earlier of [[libel]] regarding a book he wrote called ''The Secret Loves of Pope Pius IX''. On April 20, 1884, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published an [[Papal encyclical|encyclical]], ''[[Humanum genus]]'', that said that the human race was
{{quote|
separated into two diverse and opposite parts, of which the one steadfastly contends for truth and virtue, the other of those things which are contrary to virtue and to truth. The one is the kingdom of God on earth, namely, the true Church of Jesus Christ... The other is the kingdom of Satan... At this period, however, the partisans of evil seems to be combining together, and to be struggling with united vehemence, led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the Freemasons.}}

After this encyclical, Taxil underwent a public, feigned conversion to Roman Catholicism and announced his intention of repairing the damage he had done to the true faith.

The first book produced by Taxil after his conversion was a four-volume history of Freemasonry, which contained fictitious eyewitness verifications of their participation in [[Satanism]]. With a collaborator who published as "Dr. Karl Hacks", Taxil wrote another book called ''The Devil in the Nineteenth Century'', which introduced a new character, Diana Vaughan, a supposed descendant of the Rosicrucian alchemist [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]]. The book contained many tales about her encounters with incarnate [[demon]]s, one of whom was supposed to have written prophecies on her back with its tail, and another who played the piano in the shape of a crocodile.&lt;ref&gt;

Diana was supposedly involved in Satanic freemasonry but was redeemed when one day she professed admiration for [[Joan of Arc]], at whose name the demons were put to flight. As Diana Vaughan, Taxil published a book called ''Eucharistic Novena'', a collection of prayers which were praised by the Pope.

On April 19, 1897, Taxil called a press conference at which he said he would introduce Diana Vaughan to the press. He instead announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious. He thanked the clergy for their assistance in giving publicity to his wild claims.&lt;ref name=Confession&gt;{{cite web |url= http://altreligion.about.com/library/texts/bl_confessiontaxil.htm

[[File:Le Frondeur.jpg|thumb|Parisian newspaper with the account of Leo Taxil's confession to the Taxil hoax]]
The confession was printed, in its entirety, in the Parisian newspaper ''Le Frondeur'', on April 25, 1897, titled: ''Twelve Years Under the Banner of the Church, The Prank Of Palladism. Miss Diana Vaughan–The Devil At The Freemasons. A Conference held by M. Léo Taxil, at the Hall of the Geographic Society in Paris''.&lt;ref&gt;''Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry?''

The hoax material is still used to this day. [[Chick Publications]] publishes such a tract called ''The Curse of [[Baphomet]]''&lt;ref&gt;also called "That's Baphomet?"&lt;/ref&gt; and Randy Noblitt's book on [[satanic ritual abuse]], ''[[Cult and Ritual Abuse]]'', also cites the Taxil hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.masonicinfo.com/books/cultritualabuse.htm | title = Book review:  Cult &amp; Ritual Abuse&amp;nbsp;— Its History, Anthropology, and Recent Discovery in Contemporary America | accessdate = 2009-04-05 | last = King | first = EL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A later interview with Taxil==
In the magazine ''National Magazine, an Illustrated American Monthly'', Volume XXIV: April – September, 1906, pages 228 and 229, Taxil is quoted as giving his true reasons behind the hoax. Ten months later, on March 31, 1907, Taxil died.

{{quote|Members of the Masonic orders understand the false exposure heaped upon that organization in anti-Mason wars. The Catholic church and many other religious orders have been the victims of these half-written and oftentimes venomous attacks. The confession of Taxil, the French Free-thinker, who first exposed Catholics and then Masons, makes interesting reading bearing on the present situation today. Similar motives actuate some of the [[Muckraker|"muck rakes"]] of today, as indicated in the following confession:

"The public made me what I am; the arch-liar of the period," confessed Taxil, "for when I first commenced to write against the Masons my object was amusement pure and simple. The crimes I laid at their door were so grotesque, so impossible, so widely exaggerated, I thought everybody would see the joke and give me credit for originating a new line of humor. But my readers wouldn't have it so; they accepted my fables as gospel truth, and the more I lied for the purpose of showing that I lied, the more convinced became they that I was a paragon of veracity.

"Then it dawned upon me that there was lots of money in being a Munchausen of the right kind, and for twelve years I gave it to them hot and strong, but never too hot. When inditing such slush as the story of the devil snake who wrote prophecies on Diana's back with the end of his tail, I sometimes said to myself: 'Hold on, you are going too far,' but I didn't. My readers even took kindly to the yarn of the devil who, in order to marry a Mason, transformed himself into a crocodile, and, despite the masquerade, played the piano wonderfully well.

"One day when lecturing at Lille, I told my audience that I had just had an apparition of Nautilus, the most daring affront on human credulity I had so far risked. But my hearers never turned a hair. 'Hear ye, the doctor has seen Nautulius,' they said with admiring glances. Of course no one had a clear idea of who Nautilus was, I didn't myself, but they assumed that he was a devil.

"Ah, the jolly evenings I spent with my fellow authors hatching out new plots, new, unheard of perversions of truth and logic, each trying to outdo the other in organized mystification. I thought I would kill myself laughing at some of the things proposed, but everything went; there is no limit to human stupidity".}}

==The Luciferian quote==
A series of paragraphs about Lucifer are frequently associated with the Taxil hoax. They read:
{{quote|That which we must say to the world is that we worship a god, but it is the god that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the higher degrees, maintained in the Purity of the Luciferian doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would [[Adonay]] and his priests calumniate him?

Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods; darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive....

Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy, and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.}}

While this quotation was published by [[Abel Clarin de la Rive]] in his ''Woman and Child in Universal Freemasonry'', it does not appear in Taxil's writings proper, though it is sourced in a footnote to Diana Vaughan, Taxil's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= de Hoyos |first= Arturo |author2= Morris, S.

'''The Light of Kailasa''' is a [[Hindu]] movement originally from [[Belarus]]. It is a part of the [[Saivite]] movement. It was banned by government authorities in Belarus. 

In 2002, the main activists of the movement — Tatiana Akadanova (now in USA as refugee), Sergei Akadanov (now in USA as refugee) and Sergei Olisevich — were sentenced to prison terms. Hindu activists Sergei Romanchik, Tatiana Zhilevich, Sergei Silybins, Irina Silybins, Igor Yusupov and Irina Golovina were also imprisoned. In 2003 group leader Natalya Solovyova and other followers were attacked by police. Many of the followers were imprisoned, while the rest fled to USA and other countries. Now there is no organized activity of this movement in Belarus.

In [[Hinduism]], '''Valuka Iswar''' is an [[Avatar]] or form of Lord [[Shiva]], which literally means an idol made of sand, [[Sanskrit]]:''valuka''= Sand, [[Ishwara]]= Lord, ({{lang-hi|Balu}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gsbkerala.com/gsbmutt.htm |title=The Saraswat Mutt samsthans |access-date=2013-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028052817/http://www.gsbkerala.com/gsbmutt.htm |archive-date=2012-10-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zhiyi''' ({{CJKV|c=智顗 |p=Zhìyǐ|w=Chih-i|r=Chigi|k=지의|v=Trí Nghĩ}}) (538–597 CE) is traditionally listed as the fourth patriarch, but is generally considered the founder of the [[Tiantai]] tradition of [[Buddhism]] in China. His standard title was [[Śramaṇa]] Zhiyi (Ch. 沙門智顗), linking him to the broad tradition of Indian asceticism. Zhiyi is famous for being the first in the history of [[Chinese Buddhism]] to elaborate a complete, critical and systematic classification of the Buddhist teachings. He is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system.

==Biography==
Born with the [[Chinese surname|surname]] Chen ({{lang|zh-Hant|陳}}) in [[Huarong District]], Jing Prefecture (now [[Hubei]]), Zhiyi left home to become a monk at eighteen, after the loss of his parents and his hometown Jiangling that fell to the Western Wei army when Zhiyi was seventeen. At 23, he received his most important influences from his first teacher, [[Nanyue Huisi]] (515&amp;ndash;577 CE), a [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditation]] master who would later be listed as Zhiyi's predecessor in the Tiantai lineage. After a period of study with Huisi (560&amp;ndash;567), he spent some time working in the southern capital of [[Jiankang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|title="Tiantai Zhiyi", in Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=911|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 575 he went to Tiantai mountain for intensive study and practice with a group of disciples. Here he worked on adapting the Indian meditation principles of [[samatha|śamatha]] and [[vipassana|vipaśyanā]] (translated as "zhi" and "guan") into a complex system of self-cultivation practice that also incorporated devotional rituals and confession/repentance rites. Then in 585 he returned to Jinling, where he completed his monumental commentarial works on the [[Lotus Sutra]], the Fahua wenzhu (587 CE), and the Fahua xuanyi (593 CE).

[[David W. Chappell|Chappell]] holds that Zhiyi: "...provided a religious framework which seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, David W. (1987). 'Is Tendai Buddhism Relevant to the Modern World?' in ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'' 14/2-3, 247-266.

Zhiyi and [[Bodhidharma]] were contemporaneous,&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"&gt;Swanson, Paul L. (2002). ''Ch'an and Chih-kuan: T'ien-t’ai Chih-i's View of &lt;nowiki&gt;“&lt;/nowiki&gt;Zen&lt;nowiki&gt;”&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the Practice of the Lotus Sutra''.

==Important works==
Zhiyi's ''Lesser treatise on Concentration and Insight'' (''Xiao Zhiguan''/''Hsiao chih-kuan'') was probably the first practical manual of meditation available to the Chinese &lt;ref&gt;Sekiguchi, Shindai, Tendai sho shikan no kenkyu, Tōkyō: Sankibō Busshorin (1954; repr. 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; and with its direct influence on the [[Tso-chan-i]] was very influential in the development of [[Zazen|Chan meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Peter N (1986), Ch 'ang-lu Tsung-tse and Zen Meditation; in 'Traditions of Meditation in Chinese Buddhism', Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Swanson states that Zhiyi in the ''Mohe Zhiguan'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...is critical of an unbalanced emphasis on “meditation alone,” portraying it as a possible “extreme” view and practice, and offering instead the binome zhi-guan 止觀 (calming/cessation and
insight/contemplation, śamatha-vipaśyanā) as a more comprehensive term for Buddhist practice.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Paul L. (2002).

==The Five Periods and Eight Teachings of the Buddha==

In order to provide a comprehensive framework for Buddhist doctrine, Zhiyi classified the various Buddhist sutras into the Five Periods and Eight Teachings ({{zh | t=五時八教| s=五时八教| p=wǔshí bājiào| w=| first=t}}).  These were also known as ''goji hakkyō'' in Japanese and ''osi palgyo'' (오시팔교)  in Korean.  According to Zhiyi, the five periods of the Buddha's teachings were as follows:&lt;ref name="buswell"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Buswell | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Lopez | first2 = Donald S. | title ="Wushi" and "Wushi bajiao", in The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2013 | isbn = 0691157863 | page=1003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book | last = English Buddhist Dictionary Committee | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title ="Five Periods", in: The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass | year = 2009 | location = Delhi| pages = | url = http://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/F/75 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160226210224/http://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/F/75 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2016-02-26 | doi = | id = | isbn = 9788120833340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The five periods were based on quotations from various sutras. cf {{cite journal |authors=林志欽 |date=2001 |script-title=天台智顗教觀思想體系 |journal=Chung-Hwa Buddhist Studies |issue=5 |language=Chinese |trans-title=Tiantai Zhiyi's System of Teachings |pages=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''The Flower Garland period''' – taught immediately after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, lasting 3 weeks.  The teachings at this time were incomprehensible to all but advanced bodhisattvas, and thus Shakyamuni Buddha started over with more basic (the Agama) teachings.
# '''The Agama Period''' – taught at Deer Park, and lasting 12 years.  These consisted of the most elementary teachings of the Buddha including karma, rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, etc.
# '''The Correct and Equal Period''' – lasting 8 years.  This marks the Buddha's teachings that begin to transition from so-called "[[Hinayana]]" teachings to [[Mahayana]] ones.
# '''The Wisdom Period''' – lasting 22 years.  The teachings here consist of the [[Perfection of Wisdom]] teachings among others.  Here, the teachings were intended to demonstrate that the classifications of Hinayana and Mahayana were expedient only, and that were ultimately empty.
# '''The Lotus and Nirvana Period''' – lasting 8 years. The teachings of this final period mark the most "perfect" teachings, namely the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the Mahayana [[Nirvana Sutra]], which encompass the Buddha's original intention.

These were compared in order to the five stages of milk: fresh milk, cream, curds, butter and [[ghee]] (clarified butter).&lt;ref name="buswell" /&gt;

Further. the teachings of the Buddha were organized into four types based on the capacity of listener:&lt;ref name="buswell" /&gt;
* Sudden teachings
* Gradual teachings
* Indeterminate teachings
* Secret or "esoteric" teachings.

and four types of sources:
* Hinayana
* Mahayana
* Teachings found in both
* Teachings that transcend both (e.g. Lotus Sutra)

Together these were the Eight Teachings of the Buddha attributed to Zhiyi.

==Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life==
Zhiyi taught the principle of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment (一念三千) (J. ''Ichinen Sanzen'') in his 'Great Concentration and Insight', based on the [[Lotus Sutra]]. The number 'Three Thousand' is derived from the Ten Worlds, multiplied by ten [because of the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds], which gives 100, multiplied by ten [the [[Ten suchnesses|Ten Factors]] listed in Ch. 2 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] which gives 1,000. 1,000 multiplied by 3 [the Three Realms of Existence: Self, Other, and Environment] which gives 3,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life"&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 5 of Great Concentration and Insight states: {{quote|Life at each moment is endowed with the Ten Worlds. At the same time, each of the Ten Worlds is endowed with all Ten Worlds, so that an entity of life actually possesses one hundred worlds. Each of these worlds in turn possesses thirty realms, which means that in the one hundred worlds there are three thousand realms. The three thousand realms of existence are all possessed by life in a single moment. If there is no life, that is the end of the matter. But if there is the slightest bit of life, it contains all the three thousand realms.... This is what we mean when we speak of the 'region of the unfathomable'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}
