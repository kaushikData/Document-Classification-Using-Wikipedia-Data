The '''''AFI Catalog of Feature Films''''',&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/default.aspx |title= About the AFI Catalog of Feature Films |publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |accessdate= September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''''AFI Catalog'''''&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; is an ongoing project by the [[American Film Institute]] to catalog all commercially made and theatrically exhibited American motion pictures, from the earliest days of the industry to the present. It has begun as a series of hardcover books known as '''''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures''''',&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;  and subsequently became an [[online]] [[database]] exclusively.

Each entry in the catalog typically includes the film's title, physical description, production and distribution companies, production and release dates, personal credits, a plot summary, and notes on the film's history. The films are indexed by personal credits, production and distribution companies, year of release, and major and minor plot subjects.

To qualify for the "Feature Films" volumes, a film must have been commercially made by an American company, and given a theatrical release in [[35 mm]] or larger [[film gauge|gauge]] to the general public, with a running time of at least 40 minutes.

==Publications ==
The hardcover volumes published:
* A, ''Film Beginnings, 1893–1910'' (1995)
** Subtitled "A Work in Progress" due to the scant information available on many films released in this era. Foreign-made films are included if they were released by American companies.
* F1, ''Feature Films, 1911–1920'' (1988)
* F2, ''Feature Films, 1921–1930'' (1971)
* F3, ''Feature Films, 1931–1940'' (1993)
** With this volume, the project began to include plot summaries written especially for the catalog from viewing the movie itself, whenever possible, instead of relying on plot summaries taken from copyright registrations, studio publicity materials, or reviews.
* F4, ''Feature Films, 1941–1950'' (1997)
* F6, ''Feature Films, 1961–1970'' (1976)
** Due to the large number of co-productions between American and foreign companies in the 1960s, and the difficulty of determining any particular film's nationality, this volume includes all feature films released theatrically in the United States in that period. The hardcover edition includes pornographic features, although they have been excluded from the electronic database edition.  Errors in the print editions have been carried over to the online version, despite published criticisms, and there is no means by which users can offer discussions or corrections.

The publication of the hardcover volumes was suspended due to budgetary reasons after volume F4 in 1997. Feature films released from 1951 through 1960, and from 1971 through 1973 have been cataloged only in the online database. The project estimates that additional years will be cataloged at six-month intervals.  Film School students are offered the opportunity to provide plot synopses and original research, but input from other, experienced film researchers is not encouraged.

The project will also eventually catalog short films (beyond 1910) and [[newsreel]]s.

'''''A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland''''', also known by its standard abbreviation '''''Spec. Bot. New Holland''''', was the first published book on the [[flora of Australia]].&lt;ref name="SLQ"&gt;{{cite web | title = A specimen of the botany of New Holland | url = http://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=SLQ&amp;docId=slq_voyager659417 | publisher = [[State Library of Queensland]] | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[James Edward Smith]] and illustrated by [[James Sowerby]], it was published by Sowerby in four parts between 1793 and 1795. It consists of 16 colour plates of paintings by Sowerby, mostly based on sketches by [[John White (surgeon)|John White]], and around 40 pages of accompanying text. It was presented as the first volume in a series, but no further volumes were released.&lt;ref name="IPNI"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=16215-2 | title = Specimen of the Botany of New Holland | work = International Plant Names Index ([[IPNI]]) | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==

The work began as a collaboration between Smith and [[George Shaw]]. Together they produced a two-part work entitled ''[[Zoology and Botany of New Holland]]'', with each part containing two zoology plates and two botany plates, along with accompanying text. These appeared in 1793, although the publications themselves indicate 1794. The collaboration then ended, and Shaw went on to independently produce his ''[[Zoology of New Holland]]''. Smith's contributions to ''Zoology and Botany of New Holland'' became the first two parts of ''A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland'', a further two parts of which were issued in 1795.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atlante Veneto''' (1690-1701) was a comprehensive [[atlas]] published by the Franciscan geographer [[Vincenzo Maria Coronelli]] and intended as a continuation of the ''[[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu Atlas Maior]]''.  This monumental work was published in thirteen folios and provided a wealth of detail covering ancient and modern cartographers and geographers, together with astronomical and historical data. These maps were engraved in a bold style and printed on fine white paper, the more important ones spread over two sheets, allowing for great detail.

The first part comprises an introduction to geography with engravings of globes, wind roses, and cosmographic systems through the ages from [[Ptolemy]], [[Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] to [[Descartes]].

The second part deals exclusively with the earth, starting with a map by [[Ptolemy]], and two modern maps, each covering a [[Hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere]], followed by two double-page maps of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], ending with maps of the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]].

The third part deals with [[hydrography]] - the oceans, rivers, lakes and deltas. Here are to be found maps of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, the [[Bosporus]], [[Gulf of Venice]] and rivers such as the [[Niger River]], [[Amazon River]], [[Rhine]], [[Danube]], and [[Volga]].

The final part describes the ships that explored these waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = worldviewmaps.com|url = http://www.worldviewmaps.com/fresh/details.aspx?pi=348|website = www.worldviewmaps.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27553">{{About|the Cold War-era abbreviation for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany)|the current country|Germany}}

'''BRD''' ({{lang-de|'''&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;undes&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;epublik &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;eutschland'''}}; English: Federal Republic of Germany); ({{Audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is an unofficial abbreviation commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|communist regime]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) to refer to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], informally known at the time as [[West Germany]]. The East German regime previously used the term "[[German Federal Republic]]" to refer to its western counterpart.

Unlike the [[English language|English]] equivalent '''FRG''', which was used as an [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country code]] and a [[List of FIFA country codes|FIFA trigramme]], the use of ''BRD'' was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory [[communist]] term.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40606777.html Wer BRD sagt, richtet Unheil an], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 25 September 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTThlFv55ksC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=R4upIEECw6&amp;dq=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;f=true ''Dialectics, Dogmas, and Dissent: Stories from East German Victims of Human Rights Abuse''], John Rodden, Penn State Press, 2010, page xi&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany.&lt;ref name="schulrecht"&gt;[http://www.schulrecht-sh.de/texte/b/brd.htm Erlass der Schulbehörde Schleswig-Holstein], RdErl. vom 4. Oktober 1976 (NBl. KM. Schl.-H. S. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; After [[German reunification]], the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (''{{lang|de|Deutschland}}''), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany was its [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "DE", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.

==History==
[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Allied occupation zones in post-war Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), French (blue)]]

===Background===
The official name was and is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' ("Federal Republic of Germany"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' ("Germany"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''Länder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Württemberg-Baden]], and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|"new states"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.

Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=duden+brd+1967&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or "West Germany" (abbreviated "WD") for the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;dq=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600&lt;/ref&gt; but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or "German Federal Republic" (abbreviated "DBR"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name "Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen für die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in East Germany===
This changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name ''BRD'' was introduced as a [[propaganda]] counter-term to the term ''DDR'', trying to express the equality of the states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Deutschland%20%E2%80%93%20ein%20Name%20im%20Wandel.%20Die%20deutsche%20Frage%20im%20Spiegel%20der%20Sprache&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=BRD&amp;f=false ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the West would speak of the ''sogenannte DDR'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html Vom Sogenannten], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 21 October 1968, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; or "so-called 'DDR'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;dq=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-M_NkMnKAhXEPxoKHUj4BrIQ6AEIIDAA ''Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany''], 1959 - Germany (West), page 20&lt;/ref&gt; when it had to be belittled.

At that time, the initialism ''BRD'' had been adopted by ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]'s daily newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nd-archiv.de/ausgabe/1970-12-08 ''Neues Deutschland'', 8 December 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms ''Deutschland'' ("Germany") and ''deutsch'' ("German") in a number of terms, for example:

However, the ruling party's full name, ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or "Socialist Unity Party of Germany" remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' ("New Germany") .

[[File:DDR_international_vehicle_registration_oval.svg|thumb|upright|DDR international vehicle registration oval, used between 1974 and 1990.]]
Therefore,  using the abbreviation ''BRD'' fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|vehicle registration code]] ''D'', hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for ''DDR'' and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41667247.html Kennzeichen BÄÄH], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 12 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was rejected by the West, where some motorists  displayed bumper stickers with the slogan ''BRD - Nein Danke!'' ("BRD? No Thanks!").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkI3mUhsrDQC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;ots=l0RQx0j75Q&amp;dq=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;f=false ''Kontroverse Begriffe: Geschichte des öffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Georg Stötzel, Martin Wengeler
Walter de Gruyter, 1995, page 320&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;
 
As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' ("Federal Republic", or "Federal Territory") to refer to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' ("Federal Citizen[s]") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective ''bundesdeutsch'' ([[Federal Germans|federally German]]).

===Opposition to use in West Germany===
To distance themselves from the term ''BRD'', until [[German reunification]], the [[Cabinet of Germany|government of the Federal Republic of Germany]] and media sometimes used the abbreviations ''BR Deutschland,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7SQun-nAqJAC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=BR%20Deutschland&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q=BR%20Deutschland&amp;f=false ''Konfession und Wahlverhalten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Karl Schmitt, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1989, page 307&lt;/ref&gt; ''BR-Dt.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJeAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22BR+Dt.%22+deutschland&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22BR+Dt.%22+ ''Deutschland-Jahrbuch, Volume 2''], Klaus Mehnert, Heinrich Schulte

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004665-0003, Walter Hallstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Hallstein]]
West Germany had always claimed to be ''the'' Germany, and did not like the comparison to ''DDR'', or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after [[Walter Hallstein]], State secretary at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1989/sep/15/berlinwall.germany The Two Germanies: Rivals struggle for Germany's soul - As worries surface in Bonn about the influx from the East, there are anxieties across Europe about the likely economic and international effects], ''[[The Guardian]]', 15 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an [[exclusive mandate]] over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established ''de facto'' diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] in 1972, [[Bonn]] and [[East Berlin]] exchanged "permanent missions",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/.../Start/Index/id/652004 History of the Berlin Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by "permanent representatives",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0908/090859.html East-West German trade up 8 percent] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 8 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''de jure'' embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations]], to which the East German mission was accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFK7RkdQG14C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Ministry+of+Intra-German+Relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TeP4ln6BSF&amp;sig=kapXyUfDiTZORzMuCqPzs9Rzm10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWtKGmxMvKAhUDwxQKHWR-AewQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=true ''Germany Divided: From the Wall to Reunification''], A. James McAdams
Princeton University Press, 1994, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;ots=CdUG2w_KQz&amp;dq=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=false ''Detente in Europe: Real or Imaginary?''], Josef Korbel, Princeton University Press, 2015, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending that the use of ''BRD'' be avoided.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] agreed not to use the initialism.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, "Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»", in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.)], No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of [[Bavaria]], forbidden it.&lt;ref name="preute"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9KEttd2OaPAC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;f=false ''Rechts um--zum Abitur: der geistige Wandel an deutschen Oberschulen''], Michael Preute
Ch. Links Verlag, 1995, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be ''nicht wünschenswert'' or "undesirable".&lt;ref name="schulrecht" /&gt; The [[Kultusministerkonferenz|conference of all the states ministers for school education]] decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; with pupils being required to write ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' in full and use of the term being deemed an error.&lt;ref name="preute" /&gt; The different usages were so ingrained that one could [[Shibboleth|deduce]] a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4QnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brd+imperialismus&amp;dq=brd+imperialismus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt_7HTuMnKAhWKXRQKHdw9De4Q6AEIKjAB ''Kampf dem BRD-Imperialismus''], Liga gegen den Imperialismus, 1972, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

==Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany==
[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|thumb|Map of divided Berlin, indicating by the broken line at Berlin's western border the territorial redeployment decided by the Allies.]]
A similar ideological question was the question whether to use "Berlin (West)" (the officially preferred name) or "West Berlin", and even whether to write "West Berlin" in [[German language|German]] as two hyphenated words - ''West-Berlin'' - or as one word - ''Westberlin''.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7kGqJGbaI4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Berlin+(West)%22+westberlin+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic28LjsMbKAhVFvRoKHRFoCQwQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Berlin%20(West)%22%20westberlin%20name&amp;f=true ''Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police''], Andreas Glaeser
University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Westerners called the [[West Berlin|Western sectors]] "Berlin", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin ''Groß-Berlin'' or "Greater Berlin",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Article 127 [Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}
Within one year after promulgation of this Basic Law the Federal Government, with the consent of the governments of the Länder concerned, may extend to the Länder of Baden, Greater Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and Württemberg Hohenzollern any law of the Administration of the Combined Economic Area, insofar as it remains in force as federal law under Article 124 or 125.]&lt;/ref&gt; but changed this "Berlin (West)", although it also used the hyphenated "West-Berlin". However, the East German government commonly referred to it as "Westberlin".&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term ''Democratic Berlin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;pg=PA344#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Berlin", by East Germany, and "Berlin (Ost)" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included ''Ost-Berlin'' and ''Ostberlin'' (both meaning "East Berlin") as well as ''Ostsektor'' or "Eastern Sector".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FMmOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;dq=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif8MfN8sjKAhVJPRQKHXPQA_EQ6AEI3AEwGw ''Der Rechtsstatus des Landes Berlin''], Ernst Renatus Zivier, Berlin Verlag, 1974, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' using "Ost-Berlin" and the centre-left ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' using "Ostberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ost+Berlin%22,+%22Ostberlin%22,+or+%22Ostsektor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dUlLgVcMcg&amp;sig=yg5HL2-Z23u3emp_z7D_ikH9sc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoo6r-yrbKAhWGwxQKHeiNBxIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ost%20Berlin%22%2C%20%22Ostberlin%22%2C%20or%20%22Ostsektor%22&amp;f=true ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names [[Middle Germany|''Mitteldeutschland'' ("Middle Germany")]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv_GCXcA8IYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;ots=H0OlpCONF6&amp;dq=%22BRd%22%20mitteldeutschland&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=mitteldeutschland&amp;f=false ''Die Agrarpolitik in Mitteldeutschland: und ihre Auswirkung auf Produktion und Verbrauch landwirtschaftlicher Erzeugnisse''], Edgar Tümmler, Konrad Merkel, Georg Blohm, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone)]] abbreviated as ''SBZ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8uGOqBCek8C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=sbz%20deutschland&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=sbz%20deutschland&amp;f=true ''Das Widerstandsrecht: Entwickelt anhand d. höchstrichterl.

In 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent [[Slovakia]], as Germany objected to the use of the [[Slovak language]] name ''Nemecká spolková republika'' (literally  "German Federal Republic") owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of ''Spolková republika Nemecko''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_20393-544-2-30.pdf?100831124854 Proven Partnerships with Development Potential: Germany’s relations with the Czech Republic and Slovakia], Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung, September 2010, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost identical to the equivalent ''Spolková republika Německo'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], a language closely related to Slovak,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/encyklopedie_statu/evropa/nemecko/ Německo], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt; but the Slovak authorities claimed that "Federal Republic of Germany" could not be translated grammatically into Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/semantic-spat-pits-german-against-slovak/336090.html Semantic Spat Pits German Against Slovak], ''[[Moscow Times]]'', Tony Barber, 10 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Government of Slovakia|Slovak government]] had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper ''Narodna Obroda'' that they were using "German Federal Republic" to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/name-calling-upsets-the-federal-republic-1594837.html Name-calling upsets the Federal Republic], ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Ain Dara''' took place in the town of [[Ain Dara, Lebanon|Ain Dara]] in 1711 between the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Qaysi and Yamani]] tribo-political factions. The Qays were led by Emir Haydar of the [[Shihab dynasty]] and consisted of the [[Druze]] clans of [[Jumblatt]], Talhuq, Imad and Abd al-Malik and the [[Maronites|Maronite]] clan of [[Khazen]]. The Yamani faction was led by Mahmoud Abi Harmoush and consisted of the Druze Alam ad-Din, [[Arslan family|Arslan]] and al-Sawaf clans. The Yamani faction also had backing from the Ottoman provincial authorities of [[Sidon Eyalet|Sidon]] and [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]]. The battle ended in a rout for the Yamani faction and resulted in the consolidation of Qaysi political and fiscal domination over [[Mount Lebanon]]. The battle's outcome also precipitated a mass migration of pro-Yamani Druze nobility and peasants from Mount Lebanon to the eastern [[Hauran]], in a mountainous area today known as [[Jabal al-Druze]].

==Background==
{{Druze|History}}
In 17th-century [[Mount Lebanon]], the [[Druze]] were the major demographic group of the region. The Druze had been divided into political factions based on the pre-Islamic Arab tribal divisions of the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Qays and Yaman]]. The [[Maan family|Ma'an]]s, whose [[emir]]s (princes) consistently held the [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farms]] of Mount Lebanon's districts ([[Chouf District|Chouf]], [[Matn]], [[Keserwan]], Gharb and Jurd),&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2012, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Qaysi faction,&lt;ref name="Harris110"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their allies, the Druze clans of [[Jumblatt]], Imad, Talhuq and Abu'l Lama, the [[Maronites|Maronite]] [[Khazen]] clan of Keserwan,&lt;ref name="Harris115"&gt;Harris, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sunni Muslim]] [[Shihab dynasty|Shihab]] clan of [[Wadi al-Taym]].&lt;ref name="Harris113"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the Yamani faction was the Druze Alam ad-Din clan, whose members occasionally gained the tax farms of Mount Lebanon during times of conflict between the Ma'ans and the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref name="Harris114"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Other families belonging to the Yamani faction were the Druze clans of [[Arslan family|Arslan]] and al-Sawaf.&lt;ref name="Harris110"/&gt;

In 1697, Emir Ahmad Ma'an died without a male heir, and as a result, the Druze sheikhs of the Qaysi faction decided to appoint a strong and unifying family to head the faction to prevent a potential Yamani rise to power. The Qaysi sheikhs ultimately chose Bashir Shihab I to succeed Emir Ahmad due to the military strength of the Shihab clan, their distance from the intra-Qaysi disputes, and their marital kinship with Emir Ahmad (Bashir was Ahmad's maternal nephew).&lt;ref name="Harris113"/&gt; The Ottoman authorities confirmed the Ma'an-Shihab transition, but decided to invest Emir Ahmad's tax farms to Emir Haydar Shihab (Emir Ahmad's grandson). Due to Emir Haydar's youth, Emir Bashir served as regent.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202"/&gt; Emir Bashir strengthened Qaysi dominance in Mount Lebanon and installed the Qaysi sheikh [[Umar al-Zaydani]] of the Sunni Muslim [[Al-Zayadina|Zaydani]] clan as the tax farmer of [[Safad]] and its region, while securing the allegiance of the Shia Muslim Sa'ab and Munkir clans of [[Jabal Amil]] (the Wa'il clan of Jabal Amil was pro-Yamani).&lt;ref name="Harris114"/&gt;

After Emir Bashir died from poisoning, allegedly on Emir Haydar's orders, the Ottomans rescinded the power of the Shihabs in Jabal Amil (the Munkirs and Sa'abs then defected to the pro-Yamani coalition) and the [[Galilee]]. Moreover, in 1709, the Ottoman governor of [[Sidon Eyalet]], which included Mount Lebanon, [[Beirut]] Galilee and Jabal Amil, deposed Emir Haydar from the tax farm of Chouf and transferred to it Emir Haydar's erstwhile associate-turned-enemy, Mahmoud Abu Harmoush. Abu Harmoush joined forces with the Alam ad-Din-led Yamani faction and the latter soon after gained dominance in Mount Lebanon. However, the popular support for the Yamani faction in Chouf was not deep. Abu Harmoush, with the backing of Sidon's governor, pursued Emir Haydar, who had since fled to [[Ghazir]] where he found protection from the Maronite Hubaysh clan. Ghazir was plundered and Emir Haydar fled northeast to [[Hermel]] in the northern [[Beqaa Valley]].&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;

===Prelude===
The Qaysi clans of Mount Lebanon sent appeals to Emir Haydar to return and restore their control over the region. Buoyed by the Qaysi rallying of support, Emir Haydar relocated to Matn in 1711 where he sought safe haven with the Abu'l Lama, who controlled the subdistrict. Emir Haydar and the Abu'l Lama mobilized their forces at the village of [[Ras el Matn|Ras al-Matn]], where they were soon joined by the heads of the various Qaysi clans of Mount Lebanon and their forces. They included Sheikh Ali Jumblatt, Qabalan al-Qadi al-Tanukhi, Sayyid Ahmad Imad, Ali Abi Nakad, Janbulat Abd al-Malik and Muhammad Talhuq. Hearing of the Qaysi mobilization, Abu Harmoush called on the Yamani nobles of the Alam ad-Din and Arslan clans to mobilize at the Jurd village of [[Ain Dara, Lebanon|Ain Dara]], and they were also joined by the Shia Muslim [[Harfush clan|Harfush]] clan of the Beqaa Valley.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;

==Battle==
The Ottoman governor of Sidon sent troops through Beirut to aid the Yamani coalition, while the governor of [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]] did the same, but his troops were led through the Beqaa Valley. Through these maneuvers, the Ottoman provincial authorities and the Yamani faction intended to launch a [[pincer movement|pincer assault]] against the Qaysi camp at Ras al-Matn. However, on 20 March, Emir Haydar launched an all-out assault against the Yamani camp at Ain Dara to preempt the arrival of Ottoman reinforcements and being subsequently attacked from different directions.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202"&gt;Abu Izzeddin 1998, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing battle, the Qaysi coalition dealt a blow to the Yamani camp,&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; which suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202"/&gt; Seven sheikhs of the Alam ad-Din clan were killed, while Abu Harmoush was captured. Emir Haydar subsequently sent kind-worded notices to the governors of Sidon and Damascus, who ultimately accepted the Qaysi victory and withdrew their forces.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;

==Role of Harfush clan==
The Harfushes appear to have been back in control of Baalbek by
1702, when local accounts indicate that a Christian sheikh of ‘Aqura in Mt
Lebanon entered emir Husain’s (Harfush) service as yazıcı, or secretary, on account of his
Turkish skills. In 1711, French consular reports suggest, Husayn Harfush gave shelter to
Haydar Shihabi and then supplied 2,500 troops to help him wipe out his Druze
rivals at ‘Ain Dara and establish himself as sole emir of the Chouf. This is
curiously not addressed by H. A. al-Shihabi or any other chronicles of the period.&lt;ref&gt;•	Stefan Winter (11 March 2010). The Shiites of Lebanon under Ottoman Rule, 1516–1788. Cambridge University Press, Page 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

And professor Winter said in his Doctoral thesis:&lt;ref&gt;THE SHIITE EMIRATES OF OTTOMAN SYRIA (MID-17m -MID-18m CENTURY), [[Stefan Helmut Winter]], THE UNlVERSIlY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, ILUNOIS AUGUST 2002,pages 225:226.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Harfushes do not seem to have joined the Hamadas who had already been at war with the vali of Tripoli for nearly a year. Instead, they gave emir Haydar al-Shihabi refuge when it became clear that the state intended to replace him with a rival Druze household, and provided 2500 troops to enable him to crush his enemies and establish the Shihabi as the sole tribal ruler ship of Sidon."

==Aftermath==
The Qaysi victory at Ain Dara led to major political, social and demographic changes in Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202" /&gt; The Yamani faction was removed as a political force in Mount Lebanon,&lt;ref name="Harris116"&gt;Harris, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and Emir Haydar proceeded to reorganize the local leadership of the region, distributing ''muqata'at'' (tax collection districts, sing. ''muqata'a'') to his Qaysi partisans in the various subdistricts of Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; He confirmed his allies as the leaders of their home districts and promoted them to higher social ranks.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"&gt;Abu Izzeddin 1998, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Abu'l Lama sheikhs of Matn became emirs, joining the ranks of the Shihabs and Arslans.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; Jumblatt authority, normally centered in the Chouf, was extended to [[Jezzin]] and southern Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"/&gt; The Nakad, Imad, and Abd al-Malik leaders were promoted to the rank of sheikhs,&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; and were confirmed as the ''muqata'jis'' (tax farm holders) of the Manasif, Arqub and Jurd ''muqata'at'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"/&gt; The Talhuq clan leaders were also promoted to the rank of sheikhs,&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; and were given the upper part of the Arslan's ''muqata'a'' of Gharb, while the Arslans were kept in the lower Gharb.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"/&gt; The Arslans had their ''muqata'a'' reduced because of their allegiance with the Yamani faction. However, they were permitted by Emir Haydar to remain in Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"/&gt; Emir Haydar did not sublease his holdings at [[Deir al-Qamar]], Ain Dara, Batloun, [[Niha Chouf|Niha]] and [[Ammatour]], preferring to keep these key villages under his direct fiscal authority.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"/&gt; In the northern Keserwan district of Mount Lebanon, Emir Haydar confirmed the Maronite Khazen and Hubaysh sheikhs as ''muqata'jis''.&lt;ref name="Harris116"/&gt;

The defeat of the Alam ad-Din clan at Ain Dara consolidated the power of the Shihab dynasty in Mount Lebanon, to the point that it became an "established custom in the land of the Druze that no one would raise a weapon against a Shihabi emir unless he had another [Shihabi] emir with him", according to Mishaqa. Nonetheless, Shihabi power was dependent on their alliances and patronage networks with various Druze clans.&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qaysi victory also strengthened the hand of the Shihabs' allies, the Shia Hamade of the Tripoli hinterland. The Hamade sheikhs were the landlords of the Maronite-dominant areas of [[Jubail]], [[Batroun]] and [[Bsharri]]. Like the Shihab emirs, the Hamade [[muqaddam]]s (a social rank higher than sheikh, but lower than emir) were virtually left to their own devices by the governors of Tripoli as long as the latter were paid the annual taxes of the region.&lt;ref name="Harris116"/&gt; Though the Yamani faction was eliminated, a new rivalry gradually emerged among the remaining Druze clans consisting of the Jumblatti and Yazbaki factions; the former was led by its namesake, Sheikh Ali Jumblatt, and the latter was led Sheikh Abd al-Salam Yazbak Imad. Each took sides with different Shihabi emirs contesting control of the emirate in the years following Emir Haydar's death in 1732. The rivalry escalated after the resignation of Haydar's eldest son and successor, Emir Mulhim Shihab.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin203"/&gt;

With the exception of the Arslans, Emir Haydar forced the Yamani Druze to leave Mount Lebanon, leading to a mass exodus to the [[Hauran]] region south of Damascus,&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202" /&gt; where a previous wave of Druze from Mount Lebanon had begun settling in 1685.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; In the Druze emigrants' place came Maronite peasants from the region of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], to the north of Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202" /&gt; While Christian growth in the region was a long-term trend,&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt; the Yamani Druze exodus significantly contributed to a demographic shift in Mount Lebanon, with Maronites and other Christians, namely from the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Melkite]] sects, making up a large share of the population at the expense of the Druze.&lt;ref name="Harris115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202" /&gt; Nonetheless, the Druze ''muqata'jis'' remained the major political power, and Maronites, Melkites and Greek Orthodox Christians increasingly became the tenant farmers of the mostly Druze landlords of Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Izzeddin202" /&gt;

'''Robert Deroy Windham''' (November 26, 1942 – April 7, 2016), better known by his [[ring name]] '''Blackjack Mulligan''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], author, and [[American football]] player. He was the father of wrestlers [[Barry Windham|Barry]] and [[Kendall Windham]], father-in-law of [[Mike Rotunda]], and the maternal grandfather of [[Bray Wyatt]] and [[Bo Dallas]].

==American football career==
As a young man, Windham played [[UTEP Miners football|football at Texas Western College]], now known as the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]. Windham served a tour of duty in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He then went on to play for the [[New York Jets]] during the 1966 pre-season and received tryouts with the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Denver Broncos]].

==Professional wrestling career==
After football, at the urging of [[Wahoo McDaniel]], Windham trained with Joe Blanchard in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]] and later with [[Verne Gagne]] and became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] in the [[American Wrestling Association]]. Billed as being 6' 9" and over 300 pounds, Windham was a rawboned cowboy in the vein of [[Bobby Duncum, Sr.|Bobby Duncum]] or [[Stan Hansen]].

His training complete, he prepared to move on to the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) and was transformed into '''Blackjack Mulligan'''. Mulligan donned black trunks, black hat, a black fingerless glove, and used the [[Professional wrestling holds#Clawhold|iron claw]] submission hold.

When he arrived in the WWWF, he was managed by [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]. Early stills of the two actually identify him as '''Big Bob Windham'''. Mulligan went on to great success in the Northeast and was an early challenger to newly crowned champion [[Pedro Morales]]. His push was interrupted when he was slashed in the thigh by a fan at the Boston Garden and required hundreds of stitches to close the wound. The culprit was actually captured by [[Gorilla Monsoon]], who threw him at the ringside police – who promptly let him go because they thought "it was part of the show".

Before he left to recover from his wound, Mulligan participated in a Madison Square Garden match against [[Bruno Sammartino]], who was making his first appearance at the arena since the end of his nearly 8 year championship reign. Mulligan attacked Sammartino before the bell. Sammartino quickly recovered, slammed Mulligan twice and pinned him in 64 seconds. In wrestling terms, everybody "got over" - the building was sold out to the delight of promoter [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince McMahon]] the elder, Sammartino made a strong return to New York and Mulligan, who was in no condition to work an actual match, received a large pay-off to aid his recovery.

Once he healed, Mulligan returned to the Midwest and tagged with Lanza to form [[The Blackjacks]]. The duo went on to capture numerous [[tag team]] championships in various NWA affiliated promotions as well as the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]] in August 1975.

Blackjack returned to singles wrestling in the [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] where he would go on to hold the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] and the Mid-Atlantic's version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with [[Ric Flair]].

Mulligan often battled [[André the Giant]], feuding in many different regions in the early 1980s. When they brought their feud to the WWF (formerly the WWWF) in 1982, Windham was noted as saying Andre had no limit to his strength. Mulligan then wrestled in Florida. He often teamed with [[West Texas]] stars [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Dick Murdoch]], and his son [[Barry Windham]]. Mulligan returned to the WWF as a full-time performer in 1984, hosting an interview segment titled ''Blackjack's Barbecue'' on ''[[WWF All-Star Wrestling]]'', the counterpart to [[Roddy Piper]]'s ''Piper's Pit''.

In 1986, Mulligan wrestled under a mask as "'''Big Machine'''", part of a team with "The Giant Machine" (André the Giant) and "Super Machine" ([[Bill Eadie]]) collectively known as [[The Machines (wrestling)|The Machines]]. They won several high-profile matches against the Heenan family, later recruiting members such as 'Hulk Machine' and 'Piper Machine'. After that angle ended, Mulligan wrestled for the WWF as himself, until he finally left in 1987. Later on, Jack traveled to Dallas and competed in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], wrestling against [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]] and [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]] and [[Kevin Vaughn|Lance Von Erich]]. Mulligan also returned to Florida in 1987 to fight against the Funk brother, teaming with Kevin Sullivan.

Mulligan worked as a match booker and promoter all around the South, eventually co-owning the Amarillo, Texas-based [[Western States Sports]] promotion with [[Dick Murdoch]] after purchasing it from Dory and Terry Funk. Mulligan and his Blackjacks partner, Jack Lanza were inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006 by their manager, [[Bobby Heenan]].

==Personal life==
In 1990, Blackjack Mulligan and his son Kendall Windham were arrested by the US Secret Service in a joint investigation with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) for counterfeiting. The authorities found close to $500,000 in phony $20 bills. As a result of a plea agreement, both father and son spent 24 months in a federal [[prison]] and were released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackjack, The Nature Boy, and More Memories|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2008/mar/23/blackjack_nature_boy_and_more_memories/|work=The Post and Courier|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|accessdate=2010-02-13|date=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Windham published his book titled ''True Lies and Alibis'', which tells about his personal life and his professional wrestling career.

In 2012, Windham, a born again Christian, was ordained a minister by Divine Hearts Ministry located in Lake Saint Louis, Missouri. He was very devoted to spending the time he had remaining to spreading the word of God. He felt his ordination could help him in this endeavor.

In July 2015, Windham was named as a defendant in a 2015 lawsuit filed by WWE after they received a letter from him indicating that he intended to sue them for concussion-based injuries sustained during his tenure with them.  He was represented by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who is involved in several other lawsuits involving former WWE wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

A '''business letter''' is usually a letter from one company to another, or between such organizations and their customers, clients and other external parties. The overall style of letter depends on the relationship between the parties concerned. Business letters can have many types of contents, for example to request direct information or action from another party, to order supplies from a supplier, to point out a mistake by the letter's recipient, to reply directly to a request, to apologize for a wrong, or to convey goodwill. A business letter is sometimes useful because it produces a permanent written record, and may be taken more seriously by the recipient than other forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, Rhodes and Rogin. ''Business Communication: Process and Product''. Third Brief Canadian Edition. Thomson-Nelson, 2010. p.&amp;nbsp;183–214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman &amp; Ober. ''Business Communication: In Person, In Print, Online''. South-Western, 2013. p.&amp;nbsp;503–506.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== General format ==

=== Margins ===
Side, top and bottom margins should be 1 to 1 1/4 inches (the general default settings in programs such as Microsoft Word). One-page letters and memos should be vertically centered.

=== Font formatting ===
No special character or font formatting is used, except for the subject line, which is usually underlined.

=== Punctuation ===
The [[salutation]] or greeting is generally followed by a [[comma]] in British style, whereas in the United States a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used. The [[valediction]] or closing is followed by a [[comma]].

=== Form ===
The following is the general format, excluding indentation used in various formats:
&lt;pre&gt;
[SENDER'S COMPANY NAME]
[SENDER'S ADDRESS (optional if placed at bottom)]
[SENDER'S PHONE]
[SENDER'S E-MAIL (optional)]

[DATE]

[RECIPIENT W/O PREFIX]
[RECIPIENT'S COMPANY]
[RECIPIENT'S ADDRESS]

(Optional) Attention [DEPARTMENT/PERSON]

Dear [RECIPIENT W/ PREFIX]
[First Salutation then Subject in Business letters]

[CONTENT]

[CONTENT]

[COMPLIMENTARY CLOSING (Sincerely, Respectfully, Regards, etc.)]

[SENDER]
[SENDER'S TITLE](Optional)
[SENDER'S ADDRESS (optional if placed at top)]

Enclosures ([NUMBER OF ENCLOSURES])
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Indentation formats ==
Business letters conform to generally one of six indentation formats: standard, open, block, semi-block, modified block, and modified semi-block. Put simply, "semi-" means that the first lines of paragraphs are indented; "modified" means that the sender's address, date, and closing are significantly indented.

=== Standard ===
The standard-format letter uses a colon after the salutation and a comma after the complimentary closing.

=== Open ===
The open-format letter does not use punctuation after the salutation and no punctuation after the complimentary closing.

=== Block ===
In a block-format letter, all text is left aligned and paragraphs are not indented.

=== Modified block ===
In a modified-block format letter, all text is left aligned (except the author's address, date, and closing), paragraphs are not indented, and the author's address, date, and closing begin at the center point.

=== Semi-block ===
Semi-block format is similar to the Modified block format, except that the first line of each paragraph is indented.

=== Modified semi-block ===
In a modified semi-block format letter, all text is left aligned (except the author's address, date, and closing), paragraphs are indented, and the author's address, date, and closing are usually indented in same position.

[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich Das Kapital Marx 1867.jpg|thumb|The first edition of ''Capital, Volume I'', published in German]]

'''''Capital. Volume I: The Process of Production of Capital''''' ({{lang-de|Das Kapital. Erster Band. Buch I: Der Produktionsprocess des Kapitals}}) is an 1867 economics book by German philosopher [[Karl Marx]]. In ''Volume I'', the only part of Marx's multi-volume ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]'' to be published during his lifetime, Marx critiques [[capitalism]] chiefly from the standpoint of its [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|production processes]]. After Marx's death, [[Friedrich Engels]] compiled and expanded his friend's notes into volumes [[Capital, Volume II|''II'' (1885)]] and [[Capital, Volume III|''III'' (1894)]].

In the years since its publication ''Capital. Volume I'' has come to be considered as a major work of [[History of economic thought|modern economic thought]], alongside the likes of Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) and Keynes's ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]'' (1936).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} It is the central text of the field of [[Marxian economics]].

[[File:Das Kapital. Kritik der politischen Ökonomie. Band 1.pdf|page=53|thumb|First edition of volume 1 of Karl Marx’s 'Das Kapital' from 1867, from the collection of the [[International Institute of Social History]] in Amsterdam. This edition contains Marx’s own handwritten corrections and marginals.]]

==Part One: Commodities and Money==
Chapters 1, 2, and 3 are a theoretical discussion of the [[commodity (Marxism)|commodity]], [[theory of value(economics)|value]], [[exchange value|exchange]], and the genesis of [[money]]. As Marx writes, "Beginnings are always difficult in all sciences ... the section that contains the analysis of commodities, will therefore present the greatest difficulty."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=89}}  The modern reader is often perplexed about Marx going on about "one coat is equal to twenty yards of linen". Professor [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] reminds us that "the purchase of a coat by an average citizen was an action comparable in modern times to the purchase of an automobile or even a house."{{sfn|Galbraith|1977|p=12}}

===Chapter 1: The Commodity===

;Section 1. The Two Factors of the Commodity
A "[[commodity (Marxism)|commodity]]" according to Marx is a use-value and also an exchange-value. Marx explains that, as a use-value, the commodity is something that meets a human want or need of any kind; it is a useful thing. The use-value of the commodity is determined by how useful the commodity is.{{sfn|Locke|1997|p=28}}{{refn| "The natural worth&lt;sup&gt;[[#worth|*]]&lt;/sup&gt; of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities, or serve the conveniencies of human life."{{sfn|Locke|1997|p=28}}
*{{anchor|worth}}In English writers of the 17th century we frequently find "worth" in the sense of value in use, and "value" in the sense of exchange-value.}}  The actual use-value, however, is immeasurable.  He explains that use-value can only be determined "in use or consumption".  After determining the commodity as being a use-value, he explains that a commodity is also an "exchange-value". He explains this as the quantity of other commodities that it will exchange for.{{sfn|Le Trosne|1846|p=889}}{{refn| "La valeur consiste dans le rapport d'echange qui se trouve entre telle chose et telle autre, entre telle mesure d'une production et telle mesure d'une autre." ("The value consists in the exchange ratio between one thing and another, between the measure of a production process and another."){{sfn|Le Trosne|1846|p=889}}}}  He gives the example of [[cereal|corn]] and [[iron]].  No matter their relationship, there will always be an equation where a certain amount of corn will exchange for a certain amount of iron.  He sets up this example to say that all commodities are in essence parallel in that they can always be exchanged for certain quantities of other commodities.  He also explains that one cannot determine the exchange-value of the commodity simply by looking at it or examining its natural qualities.  The exchange-value is not material but a measure made by humans.  In order to determine the exchange-value, one must see the commodity being exchanged with other commodities.  Marx explains that these two aspects of commodities are at the same time separate but also connected in that one cannot be discussed without the other.  Marx explains that while the use-value of something can only change in quality, the exchange-value can only change in quantity.

Marx then goes on to explain that the exchange-value of a commodity is merely an expression of its value.  [[Theory of value (economics)|Value]] is what connects all commodities so that they can all be exchanged with each other.  The value of a commodity is determined by its [[socially necessary labour time]], defined as "the labour time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production, normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society."  Therefore, Marx explains, the value of a commodity does not stay constant as it advances or it varies in [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]], which may occur for many reasons.  However, value does not mean anything unless it conjoins back to use value.  If a commodity is produced and no one wants it or it has no use, then "the labour does not count as labour," and therefore it has no value.  He also says that one can produce use-value without being a commodity.  If one produces a commodity solely for his own benefit or need, he has produced use-value but no commodity.  Value can only be derived when the commodity has use-value for others.  Marx calls this social use-value.  He writes all of this to explain that all aspects of the commodity (use-value, exchange-value, and value) are all separate from each other, but are also essentially connected to each other.

;Section 2. The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities
Marx in this section discusses the [[Labour theory of value|relationship]] between labour and value.  He states if there is a change in the quantity of labour expended to produce an article, the value of the article will change.  This is a direct correlation.  Marx gives as an example the value of [[linen]] versus cloth&lt;!--Should this be "thread" as in the next sentence rather than "cloth"?--&gt; to explain the worth of each commodity in a capitalist society.  Linen is hypothetically twice as valuable as thread because more socially necessary labour time was used to create it.  Use-value of every commodity is produced by useful labour.  Use-value measures the actual usefulness of a commodity, whereas value is a measurement of exchange value.  Objectively speaking, linen and thread have some value.  Different forms of labour create different kinds of use-values.  The value of the different use-values created by different types of labor can be compared because both are expenditures of human labour.  One coat and twenty yards of linen take the same amount of socially necessary labour time to make, so they have the same value.
As we have expected in the production of the commodities, it lessen the capacity to create a high value of products.

;Section 3. The Value-Form or Exchange-Value
;(a) The Simple, Isolated, or Accidental Form of Value
In this section Marx explains that commodities come in double form: [[Natural resource|natural form]] and [[value-form|value form]].  We do not know commodities' value until we know how much human labor was put in it.{{sfn|Franklin|1836|p=267}}{{refn| "Trade in general being nothing else but the exchange of labour for labour, the value of all things is ... most justly measured by labour."{{sfn|Franklin|1836|p=267}}}}   Commodities are [[trade]]d for one another after their values are decided socially.  Then there is value-relation, which lets us trade between different kind of commodities.  Marx explains value without using money.  Marx uses 20 yards of linen and a coat to show the value of each other (20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat).  The statement "20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat" label two forms of value.  The first form, the relative form of value, is the commodity that comes first in the statement (the 20 yards of linen in the example).  The second form, the equivalent form of value, is the commodity that comes second in the statement (the 1 coat in the example).    He adds that comparing 20 yards of linen to itself (20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen, or 20 yards of linen are worth 20 yards of linen) is meaningless, because there is no expression of value.  Linen is an object of utility whose value cannot be determined until it is compared to another commodity.  Determining the value of a commodity depends on its position in the expression of comparative [[exchange value]].

;(b) The Total or Expanded Form of Value
Marx begins this section with an [[equation]] for the expanded form of value: "z commodity A = u commodity B or = v commodity C or = w commodity D or = x commodity E or = etc." where the lower case letters (z, u, v, w, and x) represent quantities of a commodity and upper case letters (A, B, C, D, and E) represent specific commodities so that an example of this could be: "20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lb. tea or = 40 lb. coffee or = 1 quarter of corn or = 2 ounces of gold or = ½ ton of iron or = etc."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=155}}  Marx explains that with this example of the expanded form of value the linen "is now expressed in terms of innumerable other members of the world of commodities. Every other commodity now becomes a mirror of linen's value."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=155}}  At this point, the particular use-value of linen becomes unimportant, but rather it is the [[Order of magnitude|magnitude of value]] (determined by socially necessary labor time) possessed in a quantity of linen which determines its exchange with other commodities.  This chain of particular kinds (different commodities) of values is endless: it contains every commodity and changes constantly as new commodities come into being.

;(c) The General Form of Value
Marx begins this section with the table:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &amp; \mbox{coat}\\
        10 &amp; \mbox{lb. of tea}\\
        40 &amp; \mbox{lb. of coffee}\\
        1 &amp; \mbox{quarter of corn}\\
        2 &amp; \mbox{ounces of gold}\\
        1/2 &amp; \mbox{ton of iron}\\
        x &amp; \mbox{commodity A, etc.}\\
    \end{bmatrix}
=
20 \mbox{ yards of linen}
&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=157}}

Then he divides this sub-set of section 3 into three parts:

(1) ''The changed character of the form of value.''  After highlighting the previous two sub-sets Marx explains that these commodities now have a unified exchange-value, expressed through comparisons to one single kind of commodity. All commodities are now differentiated from their use-values and are equated to each other as exchange-values. {{sfn|Marx|1990|p=158}} The general value-form, which represents all products of labour, shows that it is the social resume of the world of commodities.  In the world of commodities the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its specific social character.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=160}}

(2) ''The development of the relative and equivalent forms of value: their interdependence.''  Here Marx writes about the interrelatedness of the relative form and the equivalent form.  He first explains that there is a correlation between them even though they are polar opposites.  He states that we must also realize that the equivalent form is a representation and an offshoot of the relative form.

: "This equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other commodities; its value is rather, expressed relatively in the infinite series of all other physical commodities."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=161}}

Things cannot be either completely relative or completely equivalent.  There must be a combination to express the magnitude and [[If and only if|universal equivalency]].  That form is the expanded relative form of value, which is a "specific relative form of value of the equivalent commodity."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=161}}

(3) ''The transition from the general form of value to the money form.''  This is the transitional idea between taking the general form (the universal equivalent form for all general commodities) and turning it into the money form.  Here Marx describes how there can be a commodity so universal to all commodities that it actually excludes itself to the point of no longer being an equivalent commodity but rather a representation of a commodity.  [[Acceptance#Social acceptance|Acceptance]] of its commodity exchange value is so universal that it can transition into a form of money, for example, [[gold]].

;(d) The Money Form
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &amp; \mbox{coat}\\
        10 &amp; \mbox{lb. of tea}\\
        40 &amp; \mbox{lb. of coffee}\\
        1 &amp; \mbox{quarter of corn}\\
        20 &amp; \mbox{yards of linen}\\
        1/2 &amp; \mbox{ton of iron}\\
        x &amp; \mbox{commodity A, etc.}\\
    \end{bmatrix}
=
2 \mbox{ ounces of gold}
&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=162}}

Here Marx illustrates the shift to "money form".  Universal equivalent form or universal exchangeability has caused gold to take the place of linen in the socially accepted customs of exchange.  Once it had reached a set value in the world of commodities gold became the money commodity.  Money form is distinct from Sections A, B, and C.

Now that gold has a [[Relative value (economics)|relative value]] against a commodity (such as linen), it can attain price form:

: "The ‘price form' of linen is therefore: 20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold, or, if 2 ounces of gold when coined are £2, 20 yards of linen = £2."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=163}}

This illustrates the application of price form as a universal equivalent.  Marx concludes this section by pointing out that "the simple commodity-form is therefore the germ of the money-form."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=163}} And, the simplified application of this idea is then illustrated as:

'''x of commodity A = y of commodity B'''

;Section 4. The Fetishism of the Commodity and Its Secret
Marx's inquiry in this section focuses on the nature of the commodity, apart from its basic use-value.  In other words, why does the commodity appear to have an exchange-value as if it was an intrinsic characteristic of the commodity instead of a measurement of the homogenous human labor spent to do the commodity?  Marx explains that this sort of fetishism, which attributes to a thing a characteristic when it is actually a social product, originates in the fact that under a commodity based society the social labour, the social relations between producers and their mutual interdependence, solely manifest in the market, in the process of exchange. Therefore, the value of the commodity is determined independently from private producers so it seems that it is the market which determines the value apparently based on a characteristic of the commodity; it seems as if there are relations between commodities instead of relations between producers.

Marx also explains that due to the [[History of capitalism|historical circumstances]] of capitalist society, the values of commodities are usually studied by political economists in their most advanced form: money.  These economists see the value of the commodity as something metaphysically autonomous from the social labor that is the actual determinant of value.  Marx calls this [[commodity fetishism|fetishism]]—the process whereby the society that originally generated an idea eventually, through the distance of time, forgets that the idea is actually a social and therefore all-too-human product.  This society will no longer look beneath the veneer of the idea (in this case the value of commodities) as it currently exists.  The society will simply take the idea as a natural and/or God-given inevitability that they are powerless to alter it.

Marx compares this fetishism to the manufacturing of religious belief: people initially create a [[deity]] to fulfill whatever desire or need they have in present circumstances, but then these [[Imagination|products of the human brain]] appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own and enter into a relations both with each other and with the human race.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=165}} Similarly, commodities only enter into relation with each other through exchange, which is a purely social phenomenon.  Before that, they are simply useful items, but not commodities.  Value itself cannot come from use-value because there is no way to compare the usefulness of an item; there are simply too many potential functions.

Once in exchange, commodities' values are determined by the amount of socially useful labor-time put into them, because labor can be generalized.  For example, it takes longer to mine [[diamond]]s than it does to dig [[quartz]], so diamonds are worth more.  Fetishism within capitalism occurs once labor has been socially divided and centrally coordinated, and the worker no longer owns the [[means of production]].  They no longer have access to the knowledge of how much labor went into a product, because they no longer control its distribution.  The only obvious determinant of value remaining to the mass of people is the value that was assigned in the past.  Thus, the value of a commodity seems to arise from a mystical property inherent to it, rather than from labor-time, the actual determinant of value.

===Chapter 2: Exchange===
In chapter 2 Marx explains the social and private characteristics of the process of exchange. According to Marx, owners of commodities must recognise one another as owners of commodities which embody value. He explains exchange not merely as a swapping of items, but as a contract between the two. It is this exchange which also allows the commodity in question to realise its [[exchange value]], and he explains that the realisation of exchange value always precedes that of use value because one must obtain the item in question before its actual utility is realised. Furthermore, Marx explains that the use value in question can only be realised by he who purchases the commodity, whereas he who is selling a commodity must find no utility in the item, save the utility of its exchange value. Marx concludes the chapter with an abstraction about the necessitated advent of money wherever exchange takes place, starting between nations, and gradually becoming more and more domestic. This money form which arises out of the necessity of liquidating exchange becomes the universal equivalent form which is set aside from all commodities as a mere measure of value, creating a money-commodities dualism.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch02.htm Chapter 2]

===Chapter 3: Money, or the Circulation of Commodities===

;Section 1. The Measure of Values
;a) Functions of Metallic Money
In chapter 3, section I Marx examines the functions of money commodities.  According to Marx the main function of money is to provide commodities with the medium for the expression of their [[value (economics)|value]]s, i.e. [[socially necessary labor time|labor time]].  The function of money as a [[Valuation (finance)|measure of value]] serves only in an imaginary or ideal capacity.  That is, the money that performs the functions of a measure of value is only imaginary because it is society that has given the money its value.  The value of one ton of iron for example, is expressed by an imaginary quantity of the money commodity, which contains the same amount of labor as the iron.

;(b) Multiple Forms of Metallic Money
As a measure of value and a standard of price, [[Marxian economics#Money|Money]] performs two functions.  First, it is the measure of value as the social incarnation of human labor.  Second, it serves as a standard of price as a quantity of metal with a fixed weight.  As in any case where quantities of the same denomination are to be measured the stability of the measurement is of the utmost importance.  Hence the less the unit of measurement is subject to [[Price Variance|variations]] the better it fulfills its role.  Metallic currency can only serve as a measure of value because it is itself a product of human labor.

Commodities with definite prices appear in this form: a commodity A = x [[gold]]; b commodity B = y gold; c commodity C = z gold, etc. where a, b, c represent definite quantities of the commodities A, B, C and x, y, z definite quantities of gold.

In spite of the varieties of commodities their values become magnitudes of the same denomination: gold-magnitudes.  Since these commodities are all magnitudes of gold they are comparable and interchangeable.

;(c) Price
[[Price]] is the money-name of the labor objectified in a commodity.  Like the relative form of value in general, price expresses the value of a commodity by asserting that a given quantity of the equivalent is directly interchangeable.  The price form implies both the exchangeability of commodities for money and the necessity of exchange.  Gold serves as an ideal measure of value only because it has already established itself as the money commodity in the process of exchange.

;Section 2. The Means of Circulation
;(a) The Metamorphosis of Commodities
In this section Marx further examines the paradoxical nature of the exchange of commodities.  The contradictions that exist within the process of exchange provide the structure for "[[social metabolism]]".  The process of social metabolism "transfers commodities from hands in which they are non-use-values to hands in which they are [[use value|use-values]]."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=198}}  Commodities can only exist as "values" for a [[Sales|seller]] and "use-values" for a buyer.  In order for a commodity to be both a "value" and a "use-value" it must be produced for exchange.  The process of exchange alienates the ordinary commodity when its antithesis, the "money commodity" becomes involved.  During exchange, the money commodity confronts the ordinary commodity disguising the true form of the ordinary commodity.  Commodities as use-values, and money as exchange-value are now on the opposite poles, and exist as separate entities.  In practice, in the process of exchange, gold or money functions as "exchange-value" while commodities function as "use-values."  A commodity's existence is only validated through the form of money, and money is only validated through the form of a commodity.  This dualistic phenomenon involving money and commodities is directly related to Marx's concept of "use-value" and "value."

: '''Commodity-Money-Commodity'''
:: '''&lt;math&gt;C \to M \to C&lt;/math&gt;'''

Marx examines the two metamorphoses of the commodity through sale and purchase.  In this process, "as far as concerns its material content, the movement is C-C, the exchange of one commodity for another, the metabolic interaction of social labor, in whose result the process itself becomes extinguished."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=200}}

'''First metamorphosis of the commodity, or sale.'''

: '''&lt;math&gt;C \to M&lt;/math&gt;'''

In the process of sale, the value of a commodity, which is measured by socially necessary labor-time, is then measured by the universal equivalent, gold.

'''The second or concluding metamorphosis of the commodity: purchase.'''

: '''&lt;math&gt;M \to C&lt;/math&gt;'''

Through the process of purchase all commodities lose their form by the universal alienator, money.  "Since every commodity disappears when it becomes money it is impossible to tell from the money itself how it got into the hands of its possessor, or what article has been changed into it".{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=205}}

: '''&lt;math&gt;M \to C&lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;C \to M&lt;/math&gt;'''

A purchase represents a sale although they are two separate transformations.  This process allows for the movement of commodities and the [[Money circulation|circulation of money]].

;(b) The Circulation of Money
The [[circulation (currency)|circulation]] of money is first initiated by the transformation of a commodity into money.  The commodity is taken from its natural state and transformed into its monetary state.  When this happens the commodity "falls out of circulation into consumption."  The previous commodity now in its monetary form replaces a new and different commodity continuing the circulation of money.  In this process, money is the means for the movement and circulation of commodities.  Money assumes the measure of value of a commodity, i.e. the socially necessary labor-time.  The repetition of this process constantly removes commodities from their starting places, taking them out of the sphere of circulation.  Money circulates in the sphere and fluctuates with the sum of all the commodities that co-exist within the sphere.  The price of commodities varies by three factors: "the movement of prices, the quantity of commodities in circulation, and the velocity of circulation of money."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=218}}

;(c) Coin: The Symbol of Value
Money takes the shape of a [[coin]] because of how it behaves in the sphere of circulation.  Gold became the universal equivalent by the measurement of its weight in relation to commodities.  This process was a job that belonged to the [[State (polity)|state]].  The problem with gold was that it wore down as it circulated from hand to hand, so the state introduced new circulating media: [[silver]], [[copper]], and [[banknote|inconvertible paper money issued by the State]] as a representation of gold. Marx views money as a "symbolic existence" which haunts the sphere of circulation and arbitrarily measures the product of labor.

;Section 3. Money
;(a) Hoarding
The exchange of money is a continuous flow of sales and purchase.  Marx writes, "In order to be able to buy without selling, [one] must have previously sold without buying."  This simple illustration demonstrates the essence of hoarding.  In order to potentially buy without selling a commodity in your possession, you must have hoarded some degree of money in the past.  Money becomes greatly desired due to potential [[purchasing power]].  If one has money, one can exchange it for commodities, and vice versa.  However, while satisfying this newly arisen fetish for gold, the hoard causes the hoarder to make personal sacrifices and explains its [[amorality]] "doing away all distinctions" by citing ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' by [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold!... Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair, wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant. ... Why this? what this, you gods? Why this will lug your priests and servants from your sides, pluck stout men's pillows from below their head: This yellow slave will knit and break religion, bless the accused.'' from ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', Act IV Scene III&lt;/ref&gt;

;(b) Means of Payment
In this section Marx analyzes the relationship between [[debtor]] and [[creditor]] and exemplifies the idea of the [[balance transfer|transfer of debt]].  In relation to this, Marx discusses how the [[#(d) The Money Form|money-form]] has become a means of incremental [[payment]] for a service or purchase.  He states that the "function of money as means of payment begins to spread out beyond the sphere of circulation of commodities.  It becomes the universal material of [[contract theory|contracts]]."  Due to fixed payments and the like, debtors are forced to hoard money in preparation for these dates.  "While hoarding, as a distinct mode of acquiring [[wealth|riches]], vanishes with the progress of [[civil society]], the formation of reserves of the means of payment grows with that progress."

;(c) World Money
[[Countries]] have reserves of gold and silver for two purposes: (1) Home Circulation, and (2) External Circulation in [[International finance|World Markets]]. Marx says that it is essential for countries to hoard, as money is needed "as the medium of the home circulation and home payments, and in part out of its function of money of the world."  Accounting for this hoarding in the context of hoarded money's inability to contribute to the [[economic growth|growth]] of a [[capitalist]] society, Marx states that [[bank]]s are the relief to this problem:

{{quote|Countries in which the bourgeois form of production is developed to a certain extent, limit the hoards concentrated in the strong rooms of the banks to the minimum required for the proper performance of their peculiar functions. Whenever these hoards are strikingly above their average level, it is, with some exceptions, an indication of stagnation in the circulation of commodities, of an interruption in the even flow of their metamorphoses.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=244}}}}

==Part Two: The Transformation of Money into Capital==
In Part II of Volume I of Capital, Karl Marx explains the three components necessary to create capital through the process of circulation: the first section of Part II, Chapter 4, explains the general formula for capital; Chapter 5 delves further by explaining the contradictions of the general formula; and the last section of Part II, Chapter 6, describes the sale and purchase of labor power within the general formula.

Money, as described by Marx, can only be transformed into capital through the circulation of commodities.  Money originates not as capital, but only as means of exchange.  Money becomes capital when it is used as a standard for exchange.  The circulation of commodities has two forms that make up the general formula: C-M-C and M-C-M.  C-M-C represents the process of first selling a commodity for money (C-M) and then using that money to buy another commodity (M-C): "selling in order to buy".{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=247}}  M-C-M describes transacting money for a commodity (M-C) and then selling the commodity for more capital, (C-M).

The largest distinction between the two forms appears through the result of each.  During C-M-C, a commodity sold will be replaced by a commodity bought.  In this form money only acts as a means of exchange.  The transaction ends there, with the exchange of use-values and the money has, according to Marx, "been spent once and for all."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=249}}  The C-M-C form facilitates the exchange of one use-value for another.  On the contrary, during M-C-M, money is essentially exchanged for more money.  The person who invested money into a commodity sells it for money.  The money returns to the initial starting place, so the money is not spent, as in the C-M-C form of exchange, but instead advanced.  The only function of this process lies in its ability to valorize.  By withdrawing more money from circulation than the amount put in, money can be reinvested in circulation creating repeated accumulation of monetary wealth—a never ending process.  Thus M-C-M' becomes the objective of M-C-M.  M' stands for the money returned in the circulative process (M) plus the additional [[Economic surplus|surplus]] value gained (M∆): M'=M+M∆.  Capital can only be created once the process of M-C-M has been completed and money returns to the starting point to be re-entered into circulation.

Karl Marx points out that, "in its pure form, the exchange of commodities is an exchange of equivalents, and thus it is not a method of increasing value,"{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=261}} and so a contradiction reveals itself.  If the participating individuals exchanged equal values, neither of the individuals would increase capital.  The needs being satisfied would be the only gain.  The creation of surplus-value then becomes rather peculiar for Marx, because commodities, in accordance with socially assigned necessary values, should not create surplus-value if traded fairly.  Marx investigates the matter and concludes, "surplus-value cannot arise from circulation, and therefore that, for it to be formed, something must take place in the background which is not visible in the circulation itself."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=268}}  According to Marx, labor determines the value of a commodity.  Through the example of a piece of leather, Marx then describes how humans can, through the means of labor, increase the value of a commodity.  Turning the leather into boots increases the value of the leather, because now more labor has been applied to the leather.  Marx then explains the contradiction of the general formula.  Capital cannot be created from circulation because equal exchange of commodities creates no surplus value, and unequal exchange of commodities changes the distribution of wealth, but still does not produce surplus-value.  Capital cannot be created without circulation either, because labor creates value within the general formula.  Marx writes, "It must have its origin both in circulation and not in circulation."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=268}}  A "double result" remains: The capitalist must buy commodities at their value, sell them at their value, and yet conclude the process with more money than at the beginning.  The profit seemingly originates both inside and outside the general formula.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=268}}

'''The intricacies of the general formula relate to the role of labor-power.'''

In the last section of Part II, Marx investigates labor-power as a commodity. Labor-power existing on the market depends on two fulfillments: the workers must offer it for temporary sale on the [[Market economy|market]] and the workers must not possess the means to their own subsistence.  As long as the labor-power is sold temporarily then the worker is not considered a [[slave]].  Worker dependence for a means of subsistence ensures a large working force, necessary for the production of capital.  The value of labor bought on the market as a commodity represents the definite amount of socially necessary labor objectified in the worker, or according to Marx, "the labor-time necessary for the production [of the worker],"{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=274}} which means the [[food]], [[education]], [[Homelessness|shelter]], [[Health care|health]], etc., required to create and maintain a worker.  The capitalists need workers to combine with their means of production to create a sell-able commodity, and workers need capitalists to provide a wage that pays for a means of subsistence.  Within the capitalist mode of production it is custom to pay for labor-power only after it has been exercised over a period of time, fixed by a contract (i.e. the work week).

==Part Three: The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value==
In Part Three of Capital Volume I, Karl Marx explores the production of [[Surplus value#Absolute vs. relative|Absolute Surplus Value]].  To understand this one must first understand the labor process itself.  According to Marx, the production of absolute surplus value arises directly out of the labor process.

There are two sides to the labor process.  On one side there is the buyer of labor power, or the capitalist.  On the other side there is the worker.  For the capitalist the worker possesses only one use-value, that of labor power.  The capitalist buys from the worker his labor power, or his ability to do work, and in return the worker receives a wage, or a means of subsistence.

Marx says this of the labor process: "In the labor process, therefore, man's activity, via the instruments of labor, effects an alteration in the object of labor…. The product of the process is a use-value, a piece of natural material adapted to human needs by means of change in its form. Labor has become bound up in its object: labor has been objectified, the object has been worked on"{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=287}}  The labor that the worker has put forth to produce the object has been transferred to the object, thus giving it value.

Under capitalism it is the capitalist who owns everything in the production process such as: the [[raw material]]s that the commodity is made of, the means of production, and the labor power (worker) itself.  At the end of the labor process it is the capitalist who owns the product of their labor, not the workers who produced the commodities.  Since the capitalist owns everything in the production process he is free to sell it for his own [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  The capitalist wants to produce: "An article destined to be sold, a commodity; and secondly he wants to produce a commodity greater in value than the sum of the values of the commodities used to produce it, namely the means of production and the labor-power he purchased with his good money on the open market.  His aim is to produce not only a use-value, but a commodity; not only use-value, but value; and not just value, but also surplus value."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=293}}

The goal of the capitalist is to produce surplus value.  However, producing surplus value proves to be difficult.  If all goods are purchased at their full price then profit cannot be made.  Surplus value cannot arise from buying the inputs of production at a low price and then selling the commodity at a higher price.  This is due to the economic [[law of one price]] which states "that if trade were free, then identical goods should sell for about the same price throughout the world".{{sfn|Cowen|2009|p=418}}  What this law means is that profit cannot be made simply through the purchase and sale of goods.  Price changes on the [[open market]] will force other capitalists to adjust their prices in order to be more competitive, resulting in one price.

So, where does surplus value originate?  Quite simply, the origin of surplus value arises from the worker.  To better understand how this happens consider the following example from Marx's Capital Volume I.  A capitalist hires a worker to spin ten pounds of cotton into yarn.  Suppose the value of the cotton is one dollar per pound.  The entire value of the cotton is 10 dollars.  The production process naturally causes wear and tear on the machinery that is used to help produce the yarn.  Suppose this wearing down of machinery costs the capitalist two dollars.  The value of labor power is three dollars per day.  Now also suppose that the working day is six hours.  In this example the production process yields up 15 dollars, and also costs the capitalist 15 dollars.  Thus there is no profit.

Now consider the process again, but this time the working day is 12 hours.  In this case there is 20 dollars produced from the 20 pounds of cotton.  Wear and tear on machinery now costs the capitalist four dollars.  However, the value of labor power is still only three dollars per day.  The entire production process costs the capitalist 27 dollars.  However, the capitalist can now sell the yarn for 30 dollars.  This is because the yarn still holds 12 hours of socially necessary labor time in it (equivalent to six dollars).

The key to this is that workers exchange their labor power in return for a means of subsistence.  In this example, the means of subsistence has not changed; therefore the wage is still only 3 dollars per day.  Notice that while the labor only costs the capitalist 3 dollars, the labor power produces 12 hours worth of socially necessary labor time.  The secret of surplus value resides in the fact that there is a difference between the value of labor power and what that labor power can produce in a given amount of time.  Labor power can produce more than its own value.

So, by working on materials during the production process the worker both preserves the value of the material and adds new value to the material.  This value is added because of the labor that is necessary to transform the raw material into a commodity.  But, according to Marx, value only exists in use-values, so how does the worker transfer value to a good?  It is because "Man himself, viewed merely as the physical existence of labor power, is a natural object, a thing, although a living, conscious thing, and labor is the physical manifestation of that power."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=310}}  In order for commodities to be produced with surplus value two things must be true.  Man must be a living commodity, a commodity that produces labor power, and it must be the nature of this labor power to produce more than its own value.

When capitalists begin production they initially spend their money on two inputs.  These inputs can be represented with the capital advanced equation: &lt;math&gt;C = c + v&lt;/math&gt;; where C is capital advanced, c is [[constant capital]], and v is variable capital.  Constant capital is nothing more than the means of production ([[Factory|factories]], [[machine]]ry, raw materials, etc.).  [[Constant capital]] has a fixed value which can be transferred to the commodity, though the value added to the commodity can never be more than the value of constant capital itself.  The source of surplus value comes instead from Variable capital or labor power.  Labor power is the only commodity capable of producing more value than it possesses.

The [[Capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]] occurs after the production process is completed.  The equation for the accumulation of capital is &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;'&lt;math&gt; = c + v + s&lt;/math&gt;.  Here C' is the value created during the production process.  C' is equal to constant capital plus variable capital plus some extra amount of surplus value (s), which arises out of variable capital.  Marx says that surplus value is "merely a congealed quantity of surplus labor-time… nothing but objectified surplus labor."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=325}}

To better understand the rate of surplus value one must understand that there are two parts to the [[Working time|working day]].  One part of the working day is the time necessary in order to produce the value of the workers labor power.  The second part of the working day is surplus labor time, which produces no value for the laborer, but produces value for the capitalist.  The rate of surplus value is a ratio of surplus labor time (s) to necessary labor time (v).  The rate of surplus value (s/v) is also referred to by Marx as the [[rate of exploitation]].

Capitalists often maximize profits by manipulating the rate of surplus value, which can be done through the increase of surplus labor time.  This method is referred to as the production of absolute surplus value.  In this case capitalists merely increase the length of the working day.  Though there are physical restrictions to the working day, such as general human needs, the working day is by no means fixed.  This allows for great flexibility in the number of hours worked per day.
 
This [[Labour market flexibility#Internal numerical flexibility|flexibility in working hours]] leads to a [[class struggle]] between capitalist and worker. The capitalist argues that they have the right to extract all of the value from a day's labor, since that is what they bought. By contrast, the worker demands a limited working day. &lt;ref&gt;For analysis, see Furner 2018, p.425-447.&lt;/ref&gt; The worker needs to be able to renew his labor power so that it can be sold again anew.  The capitalist sees working fewer hours as theft from capital, and the worker see working too many hours as theft from laborers.  This class struggle can be seen throughout history, and eventually [[Labour law|laws]] such as [[Factory Acts]] were put in place to limit the length of a working day and [[child labour]].  This forced capitalists to find a new way in which to exploit workers.

==Part Four: The Production of Relative Surplus-Value==
Part Four of Capital, Volume I consists of four chapters: 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value, 13: Co-operation, 14: Division of Labour and Manufacture, and 15: Machinery and Modern Industry.  In Chapter 12, Marx explains a decrease in the value of labour power by increasing production.  Chapters 13–15 examine ways in which the productivity of this labour is increased.

===Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value===
: '''A – – – – – – – – – – B – – C'''

The section from A to B represents the necessary labour, and the section from B to C represents the surplus labour.  Remember, the value of labour-power is "the labour-time necessary to produce labour-power."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=490}}  What is of interest to Marx is, "How can the production of surplus-value be increased, i.e. how can surplus labour be prolonged, without any prolongation, or independently of any prolongation, of the line AC?"{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=429}}  Marx says it is in the best interest of the capitalist to divide the working day like this:

: '''A – – – – – – – – – B' – B – – C'''

This is showing that the amount of surplus labour is increased, while the amount of necessary labour is decreased.  Marx calls this decrease in necessary labour and increase in surplus value as relative surplus-value (whereas when there is an actual lengthening in the working day and surplus value is produced, this is called absolute surplus-value.)  For this to happen, the productivity of labour must increase.  The perpetual drive of capital, according to Marx, is to increase the productivity of labor, leading to a decrease in the value of commodities.  In this, the value of the workers means of subsistence decreases, resulting in a decrease in the value of his labour power.

===Chapter 13: Co-operation===
According to Marx, [[Cooperation|co-operation]] happens "when numerous workers work together side by side in accordance with a plan, whether in the same process, or in different but connected processes."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=443}}  Co-operation also shortens the time needed to complete a given task. Marx says, "If the labour process is complicated, then the sheer number of the co-operators permits the apportionment of various operations to different hands, and consequently their simultaneous performance.  The time necessary for the completion of the whole work is thereby shortened."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=445}}  The effort by the capitalist to organize co-operation is simply for reasons of increasing production.  While this is the case, Marx is quick to note that the collective powers of co-operation are not created by Capital. This, according to Marx, is a disguise or a fetish.  Marx cites the building of the [[pyramid]]s, which occurred prior to the organization of a [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].

===Chapter 14: The Division of Labour and Manufacture===
;Section 1. The Dual Origin of Manufacture
In this section 1, '''The Dual Origin of Manufacture''', Marx examines manufacture as a method of production involving specialized workers, or craftsmen, working on their own detailed task.  Marx cites the assembly of a carriage as an example of the first way this is brought about. In this, multiple skilled workers are brought together to produce specialized parts once unique to their craft, contributing to the overall production of the commodity.  Another way this manufacture arises is by splitting up a single [[handicraft]] into multiple specialized areas, further introducing a [[division of labour]].

;Section 2. The Specialized Worker and his Tools
In this section, Marx argues that a worker who performs only one task throughout his life will perform his job at a faster and more productive rate, forcing capital to favor the specialized worker to the traditional craftsman.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=458}}  Marx also states that a specialized worker doing only one task can use a more specialized tool, which cannot do many jobs but can do the one job well, in a more efficient manner than a traditional [[Master craftsman|craftsman]] using a multi-purpose tool on any specific task.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=460}}

;Section 3. The Two Fundamental Forms of Manufacture- Heterogeneous and Organic
In this section, Marx argues that a division of labour within  production produces a hierarchy of labor, skilled and unskilled, and also a variation in wages.  Yet according to Marx, this division within the labour process reduces a workers skills collectively, which devalues their labour power.

;Section 4. The Division of Labour in Manufacture and the Division of Labour in Society
In this section, Marx states that division of labour has existed in society long before the establishment of a capitalist mode of production.  Marx argues that despite its existence prior to capital, division of labor is unique under capital because its goal is to increase the rate and mass of surplus value, not create a "combined product of specialized labours."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=475}}

;Section 5. The Capitalist Character of Division
In this section, Marx discusses an increased class struggle that is brought about by capital, or in this case in the division of labour.  By creating such a division, it disguises the efforts and work of such a division as that of the capitalist.  Division of labour under capitalism, according to Marx, is a subdivision of a workers potential and sets limitations on his mental and physical capacity, making him reliant upon the capitalist to exercise his specialized skill.

===Chapter 15: Machinery and Large-Scale Industry===
;Section 1. Development of Machinery
In this section, Marx explains the significance of machinery to capitalists and how it is applied to the [[workforce]].  The goal of introducing machinery into the workforce is to [[Productivity#Increases in productivity|increase productivity]].  When [[productivity]] is increased, the commodity being produced is cheapened.  Relative surplus value is amplified because machinery shortens the part of the day that the worker works for his or her means of subsistence and increases the time that the worker produces for the capitalist.

[[File:CircularLoom Manlove IllustratedExhibitor1851.jpg|thumb|120px|Chevalier Claussen's circular hand-loom]]
Marx discusses tools and machines and their application to the process of production.  Marx claims that many experts, including himself, cannot distinguish between [[tool]]s and machines.  Marx states that they "call a tool a simple machine and a machine a complex tool."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=492}}  Marx continues to elaborate on this misinterpretation of definition, explaining that some people distinguish between a tool and a machine "by saying that in the case of the tool, man is the motive power, whereas the power behind the machine is a natural force independent of man, for instance an animal, water, wind and so on."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=493}}  Marx explains a flaw with this approach comparing two examples.  He points out that a [[Plough|plow]], which is powered by an animal, would be considered to be a machine and Claussen's [[circular loom]], which is able to weave at a tremendous speed, is in fact powered by one worker and therefore considered to be a tool.  Marx gives a precise definition of the machine when he says "The machine, therefore, is a mechanism that, after being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operation as the worker formerly did with similar tools.  Whether the motive power is derived from man, or in turn from a machine, makes no difference here."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=495}}

There are three parts to fully developed machinery:

# The motor mechanism powers the mechanism.  Be it a [[steam engine]], [[water wheel]] or a [[Manual labour|person's caloric engine]].
# The transmitting mechanism, [[wheel]]s, [[screw]]s, and [[Inclined plane|ramps]] and [[pulley]]s.  These are the moving parts of the machine.
# The working machine uses itself to sculpt whatever it was built to do.

Marx believes the working machine is the most important part of developed machinery.  It is in fact what began the [[industrial revolution]] of the eighteenth century and even today it continues to turn [[craft]] into [[industry]].

The machine is able to replace a worker, who works at one specific job with one tool, with a mechanism that accomplishes the same task, but with many similar tools and at a much faster rate.  One machine doing one specific task soon turns into a fleet of co-operating machines accomplishing the entire process of production.  This aspect of [[automation]] enables the capitalist to replace large numbers of human workers with machines which creates a large pool of available workers that the capitalist can choose from to form his human workforce.  The worker no longer needs to be skilled in a particular trade because their job has been reduced to oversight and maintenance of their mechanical successors.

The development of machinery is an interesting cycle where [[inventor]]s started inventing machines to complete necessary tasks.  The machine making industry grew larger and worker's efforts started focusing toward creating these machines, the objects which steal work from its own creator.  With so many machines being developed, the need for new machines to create old machines increased.  For example, the [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning machine]] started a need for [[Printing press|printing]] and [[dyeing]], and the [[design]]ing of the [[cotton gin]].  "Without steam engines, the [[hydraulic press]] could not have been made.  Along with the press, came the mechanical [[lathe]] and an iron cutting machine.  Labor assumes a material mode of existence which necessitates the replacement of human force by natural forces."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=508}}

;Section 2. The Value Transferred by Machinery to the Product
As seen in the previous section, the machine does not replace the tool, which is powered by man.  The tool multiplies and expands into the working machine that is created by man.  Workers now go to work not to handle the tools of production but to work with the machine, which handles the tools.  It is clear that large-scale industry increase the productivity of labor to an extraordinary degree by incorporating its fast paced efficiency within the process of production.  What is not as clear is that this new increase in productivity does not require an equal increase in expended labor by the worker.  Machinery creates no new value.  The machine accumulates value from the labor, which went into producing it, and it merely transfers its value into the product it's producing until its value is used up.

Only labor power, which is bought by capitalists, can create new value.  Machinery transfers its value into the product at a rate, which is dependent upon how much the total value of the machinery is.  "The less value it gives up, the more productive it is, and the more its services approach those rendered by natural forces."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=512}}  The general rule of machinery is that the labor used to create it must be less than how much human work it replaces when it is used in the process of production.  Otherwise, the machinery would not be effective in raising surplus value and instead depreciate it.  This is why some machinery is not chosen to replace actual human workers because it would not be cost effective.

;Section 3. The Proximate Effects of Machinery on the Workman

Section Three examines some of the effects of the industrial revolution on the individual worker. It is divided into three subsections, the first of which discusses how the use of industrial equipment enables capitalists to appropriate supplementary labor. Marx notes that, since machinery can reduce the reliance upon a worker's physical strength, it enables the employment of women and children to carry out work that could previously only be done by men. It thus depreciates an individual's labour-power by introducing many more potential workers into the exploitable pool of laborers.

The second subsection describes how mechanisation, by increasing labor productivity, can effectively shorten the working-time needed to produce an individual commodity item. However, because of the need to recoup the capital outlay required to introduce a given machine, it must be productively operated for as long as possible every day.

In the third subsection, Marx discusses how mechanization influences the intensification of labor. Although the introduction of the [[Factory Acts]] limited the allowable length of the work day, it did nothing to halt the drive for more efficiency. Control over workers' tools is transferred to the machine, which prevents them from setting their own work pace and rhythm. As the machines are continuously adapted and streamlined, the effect is an ever-increasing intensification of the laborer's work activity.

;Section 4. The Factory
Marx begins this section with two descriptions of the factory as a whole.

"Combined co-operation of many orders of workpeople, adult and young, in tending with assiduous skill, a system of productive machines, continuously impelled by a central power" (the prime mover); on the other hand, as "a vast automaton, composed of various mechanical and intellectual organs, acting in uninterrupted concert for the production of a common object, all of them being subordinate to a self-regulated moving force."{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=544–545}}

This twofold description shows the characteristics of the relationship between the collective body of labor power and the machine.  In the first description, the workers, or collective labor power, are viewed as separate entities from the machine.  In the second description, the machine is the dominant force, with the collective labor acting as mere appendages of the self operating machine.  Marx uses the latter description to display the characteristics of the modern factory system under capitalism.

In the factory, the tools of the worker disappear, and the worker's skill is passed on to the machine.  The division of labor and specialization of skills re-appear in the factory, only now as a more exploitative form of capitalist production (work is still organized into co-operative groups.)  Work in the factory usually consists of two groups, people who are employed on the machines and those who attend to the machines.  The third group, outside of the factory, is a superior class of workers, trained in the maintenance and repair of the machines.

Factory work begins at childhood to ensure that a person may adapt to the systematic movements of the automated machine, therefore increasing productivity for the capitalist.  Marx describes this work as being extremely exhausting to the [[nervous system]] and void of intellectual activity.  Factory work robs workers of basic working conditions like [[clean air]], [[light]], [[space]], and [[Personal protective equipment|protection]].  Marx ends this section by asking if [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]] was wrong when he called factories ‘mitigated jails'?

;Section 5. The Struggle between Worker and Machine

This section opens with a historical summary of workers' revolts against the imposition of mechanical instruments of production, such as ribbon weaving. Marx notes that, by the early nineteenth century, the introduction of [[power looms]] and other manufacturing equipment resulted in widespread destruction of machinery by the [[Luddite]] movement. These attacks in turn gave the government at the time a pretext for severe crackdowns. "It took both time and experience before workers learned to distinguish between machinery and their employment by capital, and therefore to transfer their attacks from the material instruments of production to the form of society which utilizes those instruments."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=554}}

Marx describes the machine as the instrument of labor for the capitalists' material mode of existence.  The machine competes with the worker, diminishing the use-value of the worker's labor-power.  Marx also points out that with the advance in technology of machines led to the substitution of less skilled work for more skilled work which ultimately led to a change in wages.  During the progression of machinery the numbers of skilled workers decreased, while [[child labor]] flourished, increasing profits for the capitalist.

;Section 6. The Compensation Theory, With Regard to the Workers Displaced by Machinery
In this section, Marx sets forth to illuminate the error within the compensation theory of the political economists.  According to this theory, the displacement of workers by machinery will necessarily "set free" an equal stable, amount of variable capital previously used for the purchase of labor-power and remains available for the same purpose.  However, Marx argues that the introduction of machinery is simply a shift of variable capital to constant capital.  The capital "set free" cannot be used for compensation since the displacement of variable capital available becomes embodied in the machinery purchased.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=565}}

The capital that may become available for the compensation will always be less than the total amount of capital previously used to purchase labor-power before the addition of machinery.  Furthermore, the remainder of variable capital available is directed towards hiring workers with the expertise skills to operate new machinery.  Therefore, the conversion of the greater part of the total capital is now used as constant capital, a reduction of variable capital necessarily follows.  As a result of machinery, displaced workers are not so quickly compensated by employment in other industries but are forced into an expanding labor-market at a disadvantage and available for greater capitalist exploitation without the ability to procure the means of [[Fundamental human needs|subsistence for survival]].{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=566–568}}

Furthermore, Marx argues that the introduction of machinery may increase employment in other industries, yet this expansion "has nothing in common with the so-called theory of compensation."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=570}}  Greater productivity will necessarily generate an expansion of production into peripheral fields that provide raw materials.  Conversely, machinery introduced to industries that produce raw materials will lead to an increase in those industries that consume them.  The production of greater surplus-value leads to greater wealth of the [[ruling class]]es, an increase in the labor-market, and consequently the establishment of new industries.  As such Marx cites the growth of the [[Economy of the United Kingdom#Service industries|domestic service industry]] equated to greater [[Slavery|servitude]] by the [[Working class|exploited classes]].{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=570–575}}

;Section 7. Repulsion and Attraction of Workers Through The Development of Machine Production, Crises in the Cotton Industry
The political economist apology for the displacement of workers by machinery asserts that there is a corresponding increase in employment.  Marx is quick to cite the example of the [[silk]] industry in which an actual decrease of employment appears simultaneously with an increase of existing machinery.  On the other hand, an increase in the number of factory workers employed is the result of "the gradual annexation of neighboring branches of industry" and "the building of more factories or the extension of old factories in a given industry."{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=576–577}}

Furthermore, Marx argues that an increase in factory workers is relative since the displacement of workers creates a proportionately wider gap between the increase of machinery and a proportionate decrease of labor required to operate that machinery.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=578}}  The constant expansion of capitalism and ensuing technical advances leads to extension of markets until it reaches all corners of the globe thus creating [[Business cycle|cycles]] of economic [[prosperity]] and [[Financial crisis|crisis]].{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=580}}  Finally, the "repulsion and attraction" of workers therefore results as a cycle in which there is a constant displacement of workers by machinery which necessarily leads to increased productivity followed by a relative expansion of industry and higher employment of labor.  This sequence renews itself as all components of the cycle lead to novel technological innovation for "replacing labor-power."{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=582–583}}

==Part Five: The Production of Absolute and Relative Surplus-Value==
Chapters 16-18 examine how the capitalist strategies for the production of both absolute and relative surplus-value are combined and can function simultaneously.

===Chapter 16: The Rise of Surplus Value===
Marx describes the process of taking the worker's individual productive actions and making them a collective effort of many workers.  This action takes the worker further away from the actual production of the commodity and then allows the capitalist to use the worker only to create surplus value.  The surplus value is increased first through absolute methods, such as extending the work day, then through relative methods, such as increasing worker productivity.  These actions are the general [[Perspectives on capitalism#Marxist political economy|foundations of capitalism]] as described by Marx.{{sfn|Burnham|2003}}

The worker's transformation from producer of commodities for use in survival to producer of surplus value is necessary in the progression to capitalism.  In production outside the capitalist system the worker produces everything they need to survive.  When the worker moves beyond producing what they need to survive, they can provide their work for a wage and create part of some product in return for a wage to buy what they need to survive.  Capitalism takes advantage of this extra time by paying the worker a wage that allows them to survive but is less than the value the same worker creates.  Through large scale manufacturing and [[economies of scale]] the workers are placed progressively further away from manufacturing products themselves and only function as part of a whole collective that creates the commodities.  This changes the concept of [[Productive and unproductive labour|productive labor]] from the production of commodities to the production of surplus value.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=644}}  The worker is only productive to the capitalist if they can maximize the surplus value the capitalist is earning.

Not simply content with the transformation of the worker from a creator of commodities to creator of surplus value, capitalist must devise new ways to increase the surplus that he is receiving.  The first, or absolute, way the capitalist can increase surplus value is through the prolongation of the working day so the worker has more time to create value.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=646}}  The second, or relative, way the capitalist can increase surplus value is to revolutionize changes in the production method.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=646}}  If the worker can only produce the means for himself in the time he works during the day there would be no extra time for him to create surplus value for the capitalist.  The capitalist must then either enable the worker to complete the paid work time more quickly through relative means, or he must increase the work day in absolute terms.  Without enabling unpaid work to exist the capitalist system would not be able to sustain itself.

With surplus labor resting on a natural basis, there are no natural obstacles preventing one man from imposing his labor burden on another.  As a worker looks into the possible options of getting out of [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalist exploitation]] or the initial "animal condition", one of the obvious options is becoming a capitalist himself.  This is called socialized labor which exists when the surplus labor of one worker becomes necessary for the existence of another.

Marx mentions two natural conditions of wealth that are helpful in understanding the progression of socialized labor over time.  The two conditions are natural wealth in the means of [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence]] and natural wealth in the instruments of labor.  Over time, society has moved more from the former to the latter.  It was not that long ago that the majority of society produced for themselves and did not have to be concerned about producing surplus labor for others.  We did labor for others, but it was not in effort to create surplus value, it was to help others.

Marx uses the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] as an example to illustrate a society's potential when there is extra time that does not have to be used toward creating surplus value.  The Egyptians lived in a very fertile land (natural subsistence wealth) so could raise children at a very low cost.  This is the main reason why the population grew so large.  One might think all the great Egyptian structures were possible because of the large population, but is due to the availability of labor time.

In regards to capitalism, you might think that a greater natural wealth of subsistence would result in greater growth and capitalist production (like the Egyptians), but that is not the case.  So why is capitalism so strong in many countries that do not have excess natural resources?  The answer is the necessity of bringing a natural force under the control of society (irrigation in [[Iran|Persia]] and India, flow of [[water]] in [[Egypt]], etc.)  As Marx says, "favourable conditions provide the possibility, not the reality of [[surplus labour]]."

Marx displays an example of surplus labor occurring in these favorable conditions in the case of the [[East Indies]].  The inhabitants would be able to produce enough to satisfy all of his needs with only twelve working hours per week.  This provides for more than enough leisure time until capitalist production takes hold.  Then he may be required to work six days per week to satisfy his needs—there can be no explanation of why it is necessary for him to provide the extra five days of surplus labor.

Marx then critiques famed economist [[David Ricardo]] and the lack of addressing the issue of surplus-value.  Ricardo does not take the time to discuss the origin of surplus-value and sidestepped the entire issue altogether.  Agreeing with classical economists, [[John Stuart Mill]] finds that the productive power, surplus value, is the source of profits, but adds that the necessities of life take less time to produce than is required by society.  Therefore, this becomes the reason capital will realize a profit.  Mill goes on to assert that profit can only be gleaned from productive power and not exchange which falls in line with Marx's theories.

The next critique of Mill goes on to the percentage that is gained from the laborer.  Marx finds it to be "absolutely false" in the fact that the percentage of surplus labor will always be more than the profits.  This is due to the amount of [[Invested Capital|capital invested]].  Following his conclusions, Marx calls Mill's ideas an [[optical illusion]] as he looks into the advancing of capital.  Mill looks at laborers and considers them to be a form of capitalist—they are advancing the capitalist their labor ahead of time and receiving it at the end of the project for more of a share.  Marx hits the idea out with the analogy of the [[People of the United States|American]] [[peasant]] being his own slave as he is doing forced labor for himself.

Karl Marx examined surplus value and showed it to be a necessity in capitalism.  This surplus value is derived from the difference between the value the worker creates and the wage he earns.  Chapter 16 looked into the ways in which the capitalist is able to increase surplus-value and takes a direct attack against economists David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill.

===Chapter 17: Changes of Magnitude in the price of Labor-Power and in Surplus-Value===
The Value of Labor power, also known as wage, is the first thing that Marx begins to re-explain in the opening of the chapter, stressing that it is equal to the quantity of the "necessaries of life habitually required by the average laborer."  By re-stressing the importance of this concept he is building a foundation on which he can begin to elaborate his argument on the changing price of labor.  In order to make his argument, Marx states that he will leave out two certain factors of change (the expenses of labor power that differ with each mode of production and the diversity of labor power between men and women, children and adults) and that he will also be making two assumptions.  The two assumptions made are first, the commodities are sold at their values, and second, the price of labor-power occasionally rises above its value, but never falls beneath it.

Given these assumptions Marx begins to formulate his argument by first establishing the three [[determinant]]s of the price of labor power.  These three determinants, or circumstances as Marx calls them, are: the length of the working day, the normal [[Labor intensity|intensity of labor]], and the productiveness of labor.  Formulating these three circumstances into different combinations of [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s and [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s Marx begins to clarify the changes in [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] in the price of labor-power.  The majority of Chapter XVII is dedicated to the chief combinations of these three factors.

;I. Length of the working day and Intensity of labor constant; Productiveness of labor variable.

Starting out with these assumptions Marx explains that there are three laws that determine the value of labor-power.  The first of these three laws states that a working day of given number of hours will always produce the same amount of value.  This value will always be a constant, no matter the productiveness of labor, or the price of the commodity produced.  The second states that the surplus-value and labor-power are negatively correlated or that when surplus-value increases a unit and value stays the same labor-power must decrease one unit also.  The third of these laws is that a change in surplus-value presupposes a change in that of the labor-power.

Given these three laws Marx explains how the productiveness of labor, being the variable, changes the magnitude of labor-value.  Marx explains saying "a change in the magnitude of surplus-value, presupposes a movement in the value of labour-power, which movement is brought about by a variation in the productiveness of labour."  This variation in the productiveness of labor is what eventually leads to the developing change in value, which is then divided by either the laborers, through extra labor-value, or the capitalist, through extra surplus value.

;II. Working-day constant; Productiveness of labor constant; Intensity of labor variable.

The Intensity of labor is the expenditure that the laborer puts into a commodity.  The increase in the intensity of labor results in the increase of value that the labor is producing.  This increase that the laborer is producing is again divided amongst the capitalist and laborer in the form of either surplus-value or an increase in the value of labor power.  Though they may both increase simultaneously the addition to the labor may not be an addition if the extra payment received from his increase in intensity does not cover the wear and tear it has on the laborer.

;III. Productivity and Intensity of Labor Constant; Length of Working Day variable.

In this example it is possible to change the length of the working day by either lengthening of shortening the time spent at work.  Leaving the other two variables constant, reducing the length of the work day leaves the labor-power's value the same as it was before.  This reducing of the length of the work day will reduce the surplus labor and surplus value dropping it below its value.

The other option in changing the workday is to lengthen it.  If the labor-power stays the same with a longer workday then the surplus-value will increase relatively and absolutely.  The relative value of labor-power will fall even though it will not absolutely.  With the lengthening of the workday and the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal price]] staying the same, the price of labor-power possibly could fall below its value.  The value is estimated to be what is produced by the worker and a longer workday will affect the production and therefore the value.

It is fine to assume the other variables stay constant, but a change in the work day with the others constant will not result in the outcomes supposed here.  A change in the work day by the capitalists will most definitely affect the productivity and intensity of the labor.

;IV. Simultaneous Variations in the Duration, Productivity and Intensity of Labor.

In the real world it is almost never possible to isolate each of the aspects of labor.  Two or even three of the variables may vary and in different aspects.  One may move up while another moves down, or in the same direction.  The combinations are endless, but may be characterized by the first three examples.  However, Marx limits his analysis to two cases.

# "Diminishing productivity of labor with a simultaneous lengthening of the workday."  This example is one where workers are working longer hours paying less attention or dedication on the job and productivity is in turn reduced; or productivity decreases, increasing the workday to achieve the same output.  Therefore, the magnitude of these changes will continue on its path causing longer and longer workdays with lower productivity until the system can sustain no more.
# "Increasing intensity and productivity of labor with simultaneous shortening of the working day."  Productivity and intensity are closely related and offer similar outcomes.  Higher productivity and intensity will increase the workers output allowing for the workday to be shorter as they will achieve their necessary subsistence.  The working day can shrink multiple times so long as the other elements live up to their sides of the [[Bargaining|bargain]].

The price of labor-power is affected by many things that can be broken down.  The three main elements of intensity, productivity and length of workday were broken down and analyzed separately and then together.  From the examples presented it is possible to see what would happen in any and all situations.

==Part Six: Wages==
In part six, Chapters from 19 to 22, Marx examines the ways in which capital manipulates the money wage as ways of both concealing exploitation and of [[Extortion|extorting]] increased amounts of unpaid labor from workers.

===Chapter 19: The Transformation of the Value (and Respective Price) of Labour-Power into Wages===
In this Chapter, Marx discusses how the "value of labor-power is represented in its converted form as wages."  The form of wages is intended to disguise the division of the working day into "necessary labor" (labor that is for the value of labor-power) and "surplus labor" (labor that is totally toward the profit of the capitalist).  In other words, paid and unpaid labor for the worker.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=680}}  The worker in this situation feels as though he is using his labor as means of producing surplus for his own consumption, when in [[reality]] his labor-power has already been purchased by the capitalist and he merely works as a means to produce surplus value for the capitalist.

There are two distinct forms of wages that is used in the production of capital: Time-wages and Piece-wages.  These forms facilitate the illusion of the actual value of labor-power and the increase of productivity from the worker employed.

===Chapter 20: Time-Wages===
Marx presents the [[units of measurement|unit]] for [[measurement]] of time-wages to be the value of the day's labour-power divided by the number of hours in the average working day.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=685}}  However, an extension in the period of labour produces a fall in the price of labour, culminating in the fall in the daily or weekly wage.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=688}}  Yet as Marx specifies this is to the advantage of the capitalist, as more hours of production leads to surplus value for the capitalist. "If one man does the work of 1½ or 2 men, the supply of labor increases, although the supply of labor-power on the market remains constant.  The competition thus created between the workers allows the capitalist to force down the price of labor, while the fall in price allows him, on the other hand, to force up the hours of work even further."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=689}}  To make the worker feel his [[Overtime|extra time]] and labour is well spent, the capitalist employs the trick of "overtime".

===Chapter 21: Piece-Wages===
Marx explains the exploitative nature of the piece-wage system.  Under this system workers are paid a pre-determined amount for each piece they produce, creating a modified form of the time-wage system.  A key difference is in the fact that the piece-wage system provides an exact measure of the intensity of labor.  Meaning that the capitalists' know about how long it takes to produce one piece of finished product.  Those who cannot meet these standards of production will not be allowed to keep their jobs.  This system also allows for middlemen ([[wholesale]]r or [[reseller]]) to usurp positions between the capitalists and laborers.  These middlemen make their money solely from paying labor less than capitalists are actually allotting, thus, bringing about worker on worker exploitation.

[[Logic]] would lead a laborer to believe that straining one's labor power "as intensely as possible" works in one's own interests because the more efficiently they produce the more they will be paid.  Therefore, the workday will lengthen to the extent that worker's allow and necessitate.  However, prolongation in the workday requires the price of labor to fall.  Marx elucidates that, "the piece-wage therefore has a tendency, while raising the wages of individuals above the average, to lower this average itself," and "it is apparent that the piece-wage is the form of wage most appropriate to the capitalist mode of production."  Marx gives examples of the [[weaving]] industry around the time of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Anti-Jacobin War]] where "piece-wages had fallen so low that in spite of the very great lengthening of the working day, the daily wage was then lower than it had been before."  So in this example we are able to see how piece-wages do nothing but decrease the value of labor and better disguise the true way the workers are exploited.{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=697–698}}

==Part Seven: The Process of Accumulation of Capital==
In Part Seven, Chapters from 23 to 25, Marx explores the ways in which profits are used to recreate [[Social class#Capitalist class structures|capitalist class]] relations on an ever expanding scale and the ways in which this expansion of capitalism creates periodic crises for capitalist accumulation.  For Marx, these crises in accumulation are also always crises in the perpetuation of the class relations necessary for capitalist production and so are also opportunities for [[Transformative Social Change|revolutionary change]].

===Chapter 23: Simple Reproduction===
"The economic character of capitalist becomes firmly fixed to a man only if his money constantly functions as capital." - 711
"surplus-value acquires the form of a revenue arising out of capital. If this revenue serves the capitalist only as a fund to provide for his consumption, and if it is consumed as periodically as it is gained, then, other things being equal, simple reproduction takes place." - 712

"When a person consumes the whole of his property, by taking upon himself debts equal to the value of that property, it is clear that his property represents nothing but the sum total of his debts. And so it is with the capitalist; when he has consumed the equivalent of his original capital, the value of his present capital represents nothing but the total amount of surplus-value appropriated by him without payment. Not a single atom of the value of his old capital continues to exist." - 715

"The fact that the worker performs acts of individual consumption in his own interest, and not to please the capitalist, is something entirely irrelevant  to the matter. The consumption of food by a beast of burden does not become any less a necessary aspect of the production process because the beast enjoys what it eats." - 718

"The reproduction of the working class implies at the same time the transmission and accumulation of skills from one generation to another." - 719

"In reality, the worker belongs to capital before he has sold himself to the capitalist. His economic bondage is at once mediated through and concealed by, the periodic renewal of the act by which he sells himself, his change of masters, and the oscillations in the market-price of his labour." - 723-4

===Chapter 24: The Transformation of Surplus-Value into Capital===
- Capitalist production on a progressively increasing scale. The inversion which converts the property laws of commodity production into laws of capitalist appropriation

"surplus-value can be transformed into capital only because the surplus product, whose value it is, already comprises the material components of a new quantity of capital." - 727

"All capital needs to do is to incorporate this additional labour-power, annually supplied by the working class in the shape of labour-powers of all ages, with the additional means of production comprised in the annual product" - 727

"the working class creates by the surplus labour of one year the capital destined to employ additional labour in the following year. And this is what is called creating  capital out of capital." - 729

"The constant sale and purchase of labour-power is the form;the content is the constant appropriation by the capitalist, without equivalent, of a portion of the labour of others which has already been objectified, and his repeated exchange of this labour for a greater quantity of the living labour of others." - 730

- The political economists' erroneous conception of reproduction on an increasing scale

"The classical economists are therefore quite right to maintain that the consumption of surplus product by productive, instead of unproductive, workers is a characteristic feature of the process of accumulation." - 736

"The movements of the individual capitals and personal revenues cross and intermingle, and become lost in a general alternation of positions, i.e. in the circulation of society's wealth." - 737

- Division of surplus-value into capital and revenue. The abstinence theory

"One part of the surplus-value is consumed by the capitalist as revenue, the other part is employed as capital, i.e. it is accumulated...the ratio of these parts determines the magnitude of accumulation." - 738

"the development of capitalist production makes it necessary constantly to increase the amount of capital laid out in a given industrial undertaking, and competition subordinates every individual capitalist to the immanent laws of capitalist production as external and coercive laws. It compels him to keep extending his capital, so as to preserve it, and he can only extend it by means of progressive accumulation." - 739

"Accumulation is the conquest of the world of social wealth." - 739

"Accumulation for the sake of accumulation, production for the same of production: this was the formula in which classical economics expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie in the period of its domination." - 742

- The circumstances which, independently of the proportional division of surplus-value into capital and revenue, determine the extent of accumulation:

*the degree of exploitation of labour-power
*the productivity of labour
*the growing difference in amount between capital employed and capital consumed
*the magnitude of the capital advanced

===Chapter 25, Sections 3 and 4: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation===
The accumulation of capital, though originally appearing as its quantitative extension only, is effected, as we have seen, under a progressive qualitative change in its composition, under a constant increase of its constant, at the expense of its variable constituent.

Capitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labour-power which the natural increase of population yields. It requires for its free play an industrial reserve army independent of these natural limits.

Up to this point it has been assumed that the increase or diminution of the variable capital corresponds rigidly with the increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed.

The number of labourers commanded by capital may remain the same, or even fall, while the variable capital increases. This is the case if the individual labourer yields more labour, and therefore his wages increase and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls, only more slowly than the mass of labour rises. Increase of variable capital, in this case, becomes an index of more labour, but not of more labourers employed. It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about the same. In the latter case, the outlay of constant capital increases in proportion to the mass of labour set in action; in the former that increase is much smaller. The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the [[accumulation of capital]].

We have seen that the development of the capitalist mode of production and of the [[productive force|productive power]] of labour—at once the cause and effect of accumulation—enables the capitalist, with the same outlay of variable capital, to set in action more labour by greater exploitation (extensive or intensive) of each individual labour-power. We have further seen that the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of labour-power, as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled, mature labour-power by immature, male by female, that of adults by that of young persons or children.

On the one hand, therefore, with the progress of accumulation, a larger variable capital sets more labour in action without enlisting more labourers; on the other, a variable capital of the same magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labour-power; and, finally, a greater number of inferior labour-power by displacement of higher.

The production of a relative surplus-population, or the setting free of labourers, goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies, and is accelerated by, the advances of accumulation; and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant. If the means of production, as they increase in extent and effective power, become to a less extent means of employment of labourers, this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases, capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for labourers. The over-work of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to over-work and to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of one part of the working-class to enforced idleness by the over-work of the other part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists,17 and accelerates at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation. How important is this element in the formation of the relative surplus-population, is shown by the example of England. Her technical means for saving labour are colossal. Nevertheless, if to-morrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount, and proportioned to the different sections of the working-class according to age and sex, the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale. The great majority of the labourers now "unproductive" would have to be turned into "productive" ones.

This is the place to return to one of the grand exploits of economic apologetics. It will be remembered that if through the introduction of new, or the extension of old, machinery, a portion of variable capital is transformed into constant, the economic apologist interprets this operation which “fixes” capital and by that very act sets labourers “free,” in exactly the opposite way, pretending that it sets free capital for the labourers. Only now can one fully understand the effrontery of these apologists. What are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out by the machines, but also their future substitutes in the rising generation, and the additional contingent, that with the usual extension of trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed. They are now all “set free,” and every new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose of them. Whether it attracts them or others, the effect on the general labour demand will be nil, if this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw upon it. If it employs a smaller number, that of the supernumeraries increases; if it employs a greater, the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed over those “set free.” The impulse that additional capital, seeking an outlet, would otherwise have given to the general demand for labour, is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent of the labourers thrown out of employment by the machine. That is to say, the mechanism of capitalistic production so manages matters that the absolute increase of capital is accompanied by no corresponding rise in the general demand for labour. And this the apologist calls a compensation for the misery, the sufferings, the possible death of the displaced labourers during the transition period that banishes them into the [[reserve army of labour|industrial reserve army]] out of antagonism of capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital, Volume I", Chapter 25, where he cites his book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (Chapter II, Section 1, 7) to explain this in relation with [[relations of production]]&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for labour is not identical with increase of capital, nor supply of labour with increase of the working class. It is not a case of two independent forces working on one another. Les dés sont pipés.

Capital works on both sides at the same time. If its accumulation, on the one hand, increases the demand for labour, it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the “setting free” of them, whilst at the same time the pressure of the unemployed compels those that are employed to furnish more labour, and therefore makes the supply of labour, to a certain extent, independent of the supply of labourers. The action of the law of [[supply and demand]] of labour on this basis completes the [[despotism]] of capital. As soon, therefore, as the labourers learn the secret, how it comes to pass that in the same measure as they work more, as they produce more wealth for others, and as the productive power of their labour increases, so in the same measure even their function as a means of the self-expansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them; as soon as they discover that the degree of intensity of the competition among themselves depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surplus population; as soon as, by Trades’ Unions, &amp;c., they try to organise a regular co-operation between employed and unemployed in order to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of this natural law of capitalistic production on their class, so soon capital and its sycophant, Political Economy, cry out at the infringement of the “eternal” and so to say “sacred” law of supply and demand. Every combination of employed and unemployed disturbs the “harmonious” action of this law. But, on the other hand, as soon as (in the colonies, e.g.) adverse circumstances prevent the creation of an [[reserve army of labour|industrial reserve army]] and, with it, the absolute dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class, capital, along with its commonplace Sancho Panza, rebels against the “sacred” law of supply and demand, and tries to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and State interference.

==Part Eight: Primitive Accumulation==

===Chapter 26: The Secret of Primitive Accumulation===
In order to understand the desire for and techniques utilized by the [[bourgeoisie]] to accumulate capital before the rise of capitalism itself, one must look to the notion of [[Primitive accumulation of capital|primitive accumulation]] as the main impetus for this drastic change in [[Human history|history]].  Primitive accumulation refers to the essential lucrative method employed by the capitalist class that brought about the transition in to the capitalist mode of production following the end of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]].{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=874}}  Karl Marx states that the means of production and a bare level of subsistence must be stripped from the common producer to allow for this to take place.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=875}}  The means of production refers to the tools or processes used to create a [[product (business)|product]] or provide a [[service (economics)|service]].

===Chapter 27: Expropriation of the Agricultural Population From the Land===
The central process for and secret behind primitive accumulation involved the [[Enclosure|expropriation of agricultural lands]] and any form of wealth from the population of commoners by the capitalists, which typically was characterized by brutal and violent struggles between the two opposing classes.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=885}}  Since the peasantry was not subjected to the laws of feudalism any longer, they were ultimately freed from their [[Landlord|lords]] and the land to assimilate into this new mode of production as a wage laborer.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=874}}  Every freed [[proletariat]] as a result had only their labor power to sell to the bourgeoisie to meet their needs to simply survive.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=874}}

Marx refers to the [[Inclosure Act 1489]],&lt;ref&gt;Act of Henry VII., 1489, cap. 19&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Inclosure Act 1533]],&lt;ref&gt;Act, 25 Henry VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Poor Relief Act 1601]].&lt;ref&gt;43 Eliz. 1 c. 2, introducing the poor rate, declared perpetual by the statute of the 16th year of Charles I., ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 28: Bloody Legislation Against the Expropriated, from the End of the 15th Century. Forcing Down of Wages by Acts of Parliament===
Unfortunately, the integration process into this new mode of production came at a cost to the proletariat since the strenuous demands of finding alternative work proved to be too much of a burden for most.  As a result, the working class often initially resorted to [[Theft|thievery]] and [[begging]] to meet their needs under this new form of human existence.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=888}}  To make matters worse, harsh legislation seen in England and France as Marx points out declared these individuals to be [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s and [[Rogue (vagrant)|rogues]] subject to the laws of the state.{{sfn|Marx|1990|pp=887–889}}  Furthermore, the working class also suffered due to legislative measures taken in England to keep working wages astonishingly low while the [[cost of living]] rose.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=901}}

Marx refers, in particular, to the [[Vagabonds Act of 1530]],&lt;ref&gt;22 Henry VIII c.12, beggars had to be licensed, but if somebody begged and they were well, they would be whipped.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Act for Punishment of Sturdy Vagabonds and Beggars 1536]],&lt;ref&gt;27 Hen VIII c. 25&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vagabonds Act 1547]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Edw. VI c. 3, allowing someone to take as a slave the person they accurately denounce as an idler if they refused to work&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vagabonds Act 1572]],&lt;ref&gt;14 Eliz. I c. 5, providing unlicensed beggars above 14 years of age are to be severely flogged&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Poor Act 1575]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx cites 18 Elizabeth, c. 13, although it appears to be c. 3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vagabonds Act 1597]],&lt;ref&gt;9 Eliz. c. 4, introducing [[penal transportation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vagabonds Act 1603]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Jas. I c. 7&lt;/ref&gt; which was only repealed by the [[Vagrants Act 1713]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx cites this as 12 Anne, c. 23. although it appears to be c. 26 in other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx also recounts wage fixing legislation, including the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]], the [[Statute of Apprentices]] (which was extended to weavers by James I), the [[Journeymen Tailors, London Act 1720]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx appears to refer to this (forbidding "a higher day’s wage than 2s. 71⁄2d. for journeymen tailors in and around London"), but cites "8 George II." where there does not appear to be such a law. The 1720 Act was 7 Geo. 1 St. 1 c. 13&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Silk Manufacturers Act 1772]],&lt;ref&gt;13 George III., c. 68, leaving silk weaver wages to be regulated by justices of the peace.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Colliers (Scotland) Act 1799]].&lt;ref&gt;39 Geo. 3 c. 56, stating "wages of the Scotch miners should continue to be regulated by a statute of Elizabeth and two Scotch acts of 1661 and 1671."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 29: Genesis of the Capitalist Farmer===
The origin of the capitalists in England spawned out of the "[[Landed property|great landed proprietors]]" who reaped the benefits of the surplus value made from the expropriated land they had acquired at practically no cost.  The progressive fall of the value of [[precious metals]] and money brought more profit to the capitalist farmers as the wage laborers beneath them were forced to accept lower wages.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=906}}  It comes as no surprise that the class of capitalist farmers in England became enormously wealthy given the circumstances of the time.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=907}}

===Chapter 30: Reaction of the Agricultural Revolution on Industry. Creation of the Home-Market for Industrial Capital===
The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] (17th–19th centuries) not only caused many changes in the way people worked but in social structure as well. When industrialization provided the cheapest and most efficient tools for agricultural production, it caused a reduced need for the peasant [[Farmworker|farm workers]], which displaced most of the working class from the countryside.  Faced with the choice of selling their labor for a wage or becoming a capitalist, there emerged a class of [[entrepreneur]]s who through the exploitation of wage laborers became the capitalist class.  As the system grew, there became a need for cheaper and more readily available materials.  Thus [[Colonialism|colonization]] was born.  By expanding into new territories and enslaving indigenous cultures, primitive accumulation became a source of quick and easy capital.  [[Famine]] even became a tool for capitalists in 1769–1770 when England raised the price of rice in India so that only the rich could afford it.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=917}}  [[Government debt|National debt]] soon became a tool of control for capitalists who turned unproductive money into capital through lending and exchange.  Encouraged to participate in the creation of debt, each worker participates in the creation of "[[Joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]], the [[Stock exchange|stock-exchange]], and modern [[bankocracy]]."{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=919}}  The international credit system conceals the source of its generation; the exploitation of slave and wage laborers.

===Chapter 31: The Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist===
The shift in the ownership of the means of production from the proletariat to the bourgeoisie left the common producer with only his labor power to sell.  This means they are free proprietors of the conditions of their labor.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=927}}  During this process of transference, [[private property]] was replaced by capitalist private property through the highest form of exploitation, and the shift from the days of free labor to wage labor had taken place.  Capitalist private property was formed from the capital mode of appropriation, which dwindled away the once existent private property founded on the personal labor of workers.

===Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation===
Marx states that as capitalism grows the number of wage laborers grows exponentially.  Therefore, ultimately there will be a revolution in which the capitalists are expropriated from their means of wealth by the majority.  In other words, the seeds of destruction are already implanted within capitalism.  Marx stresses that the demise of capitalism does not necessarily mean the return of feudalism and private property, but rather "it does indeed establish individual property on the basis of the achievements of the capitalist era: namely [[Cooperation|co-operation]] and the [[Cooperative|possession in common]] of the land and the means of production produced by labor itself".{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=929}}  That is to say that the transformation will revert to the time where private property is seen as social property.

===Chapter 33: The Modern Theory of Colonisation===
Marx claims that two types of private property exist in a [[political economy]].  The first form is the labor of the producer himself and the other form rests in a capitalist's exploitation of others.  In the industrialized capitalist world of [[Western Europe]], this is easily attained through the usage of laws and private property.  However, capitalists constantly find obstacles in the colonies where workers work for their own enrichment rather than that of the capitalist.  Capitalists overcome this obstacle by the use of force and by the political backing of the "mother land".  If domination over the workers free will cannot be achieved, Marx then asks, "how did capital and wage-labour come into existence?"{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=933}}  This comes about through the division of workers into owners of capital and owners of labor.  This system causes workers to essentially expropriate themselves in order to accumulate capital.{{sfn|Marx|1990|p=934}}  This self-expropriation served as primitive accumulation for the capitalists, and therefore, was the catalyst for capitalism in the [[colony|colonies]].

The chedipe is described as a vulgar woman riding on a tiger in the moonlit night.&lt;ref name="melton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaberryKramer2009"/&gt; The typical chedipe story carries out with them choosing a house and magically forcing the closed doors of the house open, to which she enters naked.&lt;ref name="melton"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "thurston"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Edgar Thurston]]|title=Omens and Superstitions of Southern India|year=1912|publisher=|url=https://archive.org/stream/omenssuperstitio00thur#page/260/mode/2up|pages=261–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She casts a spell on the residents of the home, putting them in a deep sleep.

He will be sapped of his virility and will feel uneasy and slightly intoxicated for the entirety of the following day. If he does not receive medical treatment, the chedipe will return.&lt;ref name="melton"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "thurston"/&gt; In another narrative, she is described as returning repeatedly before the victim can recover from the blood and energy loss, thus weakening him further. If he is not treated, the man withers away and dies.&lt;ref name="MaberryKramer2009"/&gt;

The chedipe also has sexual intercourse with the sleeping victim in many cases, resulting in suspicions of infidelity in the mind of the victim's wife. This shatters the marital concord of the household, ending love and trust in the family. The chedipe feasts on the resulting sadness and pain.&lt;ref name="MaberryKramer2009"/&gt; She may also pluck out the tongue of her victim, instantaneously killing him. The chedipe may also inflict wounds on the skin and insert sticks in the body of the man, which will burn like fire.&lt;ref name = "thurston"/&gt;

Sometimes, the chedipe undresses and turns into a tiger with one human leg and attacks men in the forest.&lt;ref name="melton"/&gt; This form is known as ''Murulupuli'' ("enchanting tiger"). If the man retaliates with a weapon, she flees. If someone recognizes her in the tiger form, she assumes her real form and pretends to be digging for roots in the jungle.&lt;ref name = "thurston"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8518">'''Colorsport Images Ltd''' is a sports photographic archive and agency, containing around 10 million images covering almost 150 years of sport, serving all forms of media outlets. The Colorsport partnership was set up in the late 1960s by [[photographers]] [[Colin Elsey]] and Stewart Fraser, and they were soon joined by Andrew Cowie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digbee.com/photoarchivenews/december03issue/|title=In Memory|publisher= Photo Archive News|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency – as its name suggests - was among the earliest to cover sport in colour as well as black and white, especially [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and the [[Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taylor |first= John |author2=Colin Elsey |title= [[Rugby In Focus]] |publisher= [[David &amp; Charles]] |date=November 1986 |isbn= 0-7153-8882-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The business was established in the late 1960s when two sports photographers, Colin Elsey and Stewart Fraser, started to work together. They were initially based in Kings Cross before the business became established at St Peter’s Street in [[Islington]] for many years as it continued to expand. During that time Colorsport was the official photographer for the [[Rugby Football Union]] and [[Arsenal Football Club]], as well as many sporting publications.

In 2003 the business, which had moved to Crouch End, lost [[Colin Elsey]] who died suddenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/2420875/Obituary-Elsey-leaves-a-lasting-image.html|title=Obituary - Elsey leaves a lasting image|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=24 January 2012|location=London|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|date=10 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time Stewart Fraser retired.

Colorsport gained new owners in late 2005, notably Nigel Wray, the owner of Saracens rugby club, and David Norrie, a former editor of [[Rugby World]] magazine and cricket and rugby correspondent of the [[News of the World]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/members-news/norrie-the-latest-to-join-wapping-exodus/|title=Norrie the latest to join Wapping exodus|publisher=Sports Journalists' Association|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became chairman. The business was moved to extensive new head offices in Surrey.

Andrew Cowie, who joined the business in 1972, is still active as a sports photographer and also now heads up Colorsport's library operations.

James Pinniger joined as Chief Executive at the start of 2009 from [[Reuters]].  Since that time Colorsport has revamped their online presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastwebmedia.com/news/fwm-in-the-frame-for-colorsport/2011-04-01/|title=FWM in the Frame for Colorsport|publisher=[[Fast Web Media]]|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2011/6/16/ibwm-and-colorsport.html|title=IBWM and Colorsport|publisher=In Bed With Maradona|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.tv/news/sis-picture|title=SIS in the picture|publisher=[[Satellite Information Services]]|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a network of international partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a24media.com/index.php/news/random/2740-partnership|title=Colorsport Partnership|publisher=A24 Media|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorsport photographers were nominated in two categories at the 2012 SJA British Sport Photography Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/photography/british-sports-photography-awards-the-shortlists//|title=British Sports Photography Awards: shortlists|publisher=Sports Journalists' Association|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Cowie's shot of [[Tony Woodcock (rugby player)|Tony Woodcock]]'s try for the [[All Blacks]] in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final]] was voted the Sports Picture of the Year at the 2012 NAPA Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napa.org.uk/users/awards.php|title=NAPA Awards 2012|publisher=National Association of Press Agencies|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Archive==
Colorsport Images has acquired a number of older photo archives, principally the Albert Wilkes Collection, The Provincial Press Archive, and the Barrett Collection.

Colorsport has [[digitizing|digitised]] these collections, enabling online distribution. They now operate a large [[Electronic commerce|commercial website]] which allows clients to search and browse for images, purchase usage rights and download images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.colorsport.co.uk|title=Colorsport International Sports Archive|publisher=Colorsport|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to a separate website that enables selected images from the archive to be ordered as consumer prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prints.colorsport.co.uk/|title=Colorsport Prints|publisher=Colorsport &amp; Media Storehouse|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wilkes Collection, which contains many thousands of glass plates (mainly football and cricket), had been set up in the 1890s by [[Albert Wilkes]], who played football for Aston Villa and England. Wilkes, and later his son, ran the business from West Bromwich for over sixty years.

Provincial Press had been based in Southport from the 1940s through to the 1970s, covering many FA Cup Finals, including the 1953 [[Matthews Final]], as well as having contracts with Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Arsenal football clubs among others.

==Photographers==
Colin Elsey’s reputation as one of rugby union's leading photographer was established with his work on the all-conquering [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa]] and confirmed on the [[1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand|next Lions tour to New Zealand]] three years later when he took the iconic “Mudman” image of Fran Cotton peering out of the Wellington mud, considered by many to be among the greatest rugby photos ever taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-1220638/THE-LIST-50-great-sporting-photographs-Nos-10-1.html|title=50 Great Sporting Photographs Number 5 - The Mudman|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=24 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/5252914/The-Lions-Dream-Team.html|title=The Lions Dream Team|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=24 January 2012|location=London|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Fraser, a winner of the 1967 World Press Photo sports award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.worldpressphoto.org/search/layout/result/indeling/detailwpp/form/wpp/start/3/q/ishoofdafbeelding/true/trefwoord/year/1967/trefwoord/nationality/United%20Kingdom|title=World Press Photo 1967, Stewart Fraser, 1st prize, Sports |publisher=World Press Photo|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a specialist in covering winter and summer [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sports.

Andrew Cowie took up the mantle as Colorsport's soccer specialist - in 2010 in South Africa he covered his eighth World Cup for the company.

Several other distinguished photographers learnt their trade and came through the Colorsport ranks, such as Stuart McFarlane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/meet-the-club-photographer-stuart-macfarlane|title=Stuart Macfarlane - Arsenal Club Photographer|publisher=Arsenal Football Club|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Impey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiredphotos.co.uk/about|title=Matthew Impey - Wired Photos|publisher=wiredphotos.co.uk|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Colorsport photographers include Dan Rowley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danrowley.co.uk/dr/|title=Dan Rowley |publisher=www.danrowley.co.uk|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian MacNicol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmediascotland.com/press_news/31282/strong-scots-presence-on-picture-editors--shortlist|title=Strong Scots Presence on Picture Editors' Shortlist  |publisher=AllmediaScotland|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shaun Boggust.

This '''Comparison of programming languages (associative arrays)''' compares the features of [[associative array]] [[data structure]]s or array-lookup processing for over 39 various computer [[programming language]]s.

==Language support==
{{Dynamic list}}
The following is a comparison of [[associative array]]s (also "mapping", "hash", and "dictionary") in various programming languages.

=== [[Awk]] ===
Awk has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays.

For example:

&lt;source lang=awk&gt;
phonebook["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999"
phonebook["John Doe"] = "555-1212"
phonebook["J. Random Hacker"] = "555-1337"
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also loop through an associated array as follows:

&lt;source lang=awk&gt;
for (name in phonebook) {
	print name, " ", phonebook[name]
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also check if an element is in the associative array, and delete elements from an associative array.

Multi-dimensional associative arrays can be simulated in standard Awk using concatenation and e.g. SUBSEP:

&lt;source lang=awk&gt;
{ # for every input line
	multi[$1 SUBSEP $2]++;
}
#
END {
	for (x in multi) {
		split(x, arr, SUBSEP);
		print arr[1], arr[2], multi[x];
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[C (programming language)|C]] ===
There is no standard implementation of an associative array in C, but a 3rd party library with BSD license is available [https://web.archive.org/web/20071015024120/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cwc22/hashtable/ here], archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20040902160534/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cwc22/hashtable/ here], with the source code available [https://github.com/davidar/c-hashtable/ here]. [[POSIX]] 1003.1-2001 describes the functions &lt;code&gt;hcreate()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hdestroy()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hsearch()&lt;/code&gt;.

Another 3rd party library, [http://uthash.sourceforge.net/ uthash], also creates associative arrays from C structures. A structure represents a value, and one of the structure fields acts as the key.

Finally, the [[GLib]] library also supports associative arrays, along with many other advanced data types and is the recommended implementation of the GNU Project.[https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Hash-Tables.html]

Similar to [[GLib]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s cross-platform [[Core Foundation]] framework provides several basic data types. In particular, there are reference counted CFDictionary and CFMutableDictionary.

=== [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] ===
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; dic = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
dic.Add("Sally Smart", "555-9999");
dic.Add("John Doe", "555-1212");
dic.Add("J. Random Hacker", "553-1337");

// access a phone number and display it in a message box
MessageBox.Show(dic["Sally Smart"]);
&lt;/source&gt;

The dictionary can also be initialized with all entries during construction. This is called "object initialization".
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
var dic = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;
            {
                {"Sally Smart", "555-9999"},
                {"John Doe", "555-1212"},
                {"J. Random Hacker", "553-1337"}
            };
&lt;/source&gt;

A [[foreach loop]] can enumerate through the entire collection. There is no guarantee of order. If order matters the programmer could choose to use a SortedDictionary or use a .Sort linq extension method.
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// loop through the collection and display each entry
foreach(KeyValuePair&lt;string,string&gt; kvp in dic)
{
    MessageBox.Show(String.Format("Phone number for {0} is {1}", kvp.Key, kvp.Value));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[C++]] ===
C++ also has a form of associative array called [[map (C++)|&lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt;]] (see [[Standard Template Library#Containers]]). One could create a map with the same information as above using C++ with the following code:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;
 
int main() {
	std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; phone_book;
	phone_book.insert(std::make_pair("Sally Smart", "555-9999"));
	phone_book.insert(std::make_pair("John Doe", "555-1212"));
	phone_book.insert(std::make_pair("J. Random Hacker", "553-1337"));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Or less efficiently as it creates temporary &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; values:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
 
int main() {
	std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; phone_book;
	phone_book["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999";
	phone_book["John Doe"] = "555-1212";
	phone_book["J. Random Hacker"] = "553-1337";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

With the extension of [[C++11#Initializer lists|initialization lists]] in C++11, entries can be added during a map's construction as shown below:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main() {
	std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; phone_book {
		{"Sally Smart", "555-9999"},
		{"John Doe", "555-1212"},
		{"J. Random Hacker", "553-1337"}
	};
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You can iterate through the list with the following code (C++03):

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt;::iterator curr, end;
for(curr = phone_book.begin(), end = phone_book.end();  curr != end;  ++curr)
	std::cout &lt;&lt;  curr-&gt;first &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; curr-&gt;second &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

The same task in new C++11:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
for(const auto&amp; curr : phone_book)
        std::cout &lt;&lt;  curr.first &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; curr.second &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using the structured binding available in [[C++17]]:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
for (const auto&amp; [name, number] : phone_book) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In C++, the &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; class is [[Generic programming#Templates in C.2B.2B|templated]] which allows the [[data type]]s of keys and values to be different for different &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; instances. For a given instance of the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; class the keys must be of the same base type. The same must be true for all of the values. Although &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; is typically implemented using a [[self-balancing binary search tree]], C++11 defines a second map called &lt;code&gt;[[std::unordered_map]]&lt;/code&gt; with the algorithmic characteristics of a hash table. This is a common vendor extension to the STL as well, usually called &lt;code&gt;hash_map&lt;/code&gt;, being available from such implementations as SGI and STLPort.

=== [[CFML]] ===
A structure in CFML is equivalent to an associative array:

&lt;source lang=CFS&gt;
dynamicKeyName = "John Doe";
phoneBook = {
	"Sally Smart" = "555-9999",
	"#dynamicKeyName#" = "555-4321",
	"J. Random Hacker" = "555-1337",	
	UnknownComic = "???"
};
writeOutput(phoneBook.UnknownComic); // ???
writeDump(phoneBook); // entire struct
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]] ===
Initializing an empty dictionary and adding items:

 dic as Dictionary&lt;of String, String&gt; = Dictionary&lt;of String, String&gt;()
 dic.add('Sally Smart', '555-9999')
 dic.add('John Doe', '555-1212')
 dic.add('J. Random Hacker', '553-1337')
 
 assert dic['Sally Smart'] == '555-9999'

Alternatively, a dictionary can be initialized with all items during construction:

 dic = {
           'Sally Smart':'555-9999',
           'John Doe':'555-1212',
           'J. Random Hacker':'553-1337'
       }

The dictionary can be enumerated by a for-loop, but there is no guaranteed order:

 for key, val in dic
     print "[key]'s phone number is [val]"

=== [[D programming language|D]] ===
D offers direct support for associative arrays
in the core language – they are implemented as a chaining hash table with binary trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalmars.com/d/2.0/hash-map.html |title=Associative Arrays |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent example would be:

&lt;source lang=D&gt;
int main() {
	string[ string ] phone_book;
	phone_book["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999";
	phone_book["John Doe"] = "555-1212";
	phone_book["J. Random Hacker"] = "553-1337";
	return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Keys and values can be any types, but all the keys in an associative array
must be of the same type, and the same for values.

You can also loop through all properties and associated values, i.e. as follows:

&lt;source lang=D&gt;
foreach (key, value; phone_book) {
        writeln("Number for " ~ key ~ ": " ~ value );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A property can be removed as follows:

&lt;source lang=D&gt;
phone_book.remove("Sally Smart");
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]] ===
Delphi supports several standard generic containers, including TDictionary&lt;T&gt;:
&lt;source lang=Delphi&gt;
uses
  SysUtils,
  Generics.Collections;

var
  PhoneBook: TDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;;
  Entry: TPair&lt;string, string&gt;;

begin
  PhoneBook := TDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;.Create;
  PhoneBook.Add('Sally Smart', '555-9999');
  PhoneBook.Add('John Doe', '555-1212');
  PhoneBook.Add('J. Random Hacker', '553-1337');

  for Entry in PhoneBook do
    Writeln(Format('Number for %s: %s',[Entry.Key, Entry.Value]));
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

Versions of Delphi prior to 2009 do not offer direct support for associative arrays. However, you can simulate associative arrays using the TStrings class. Here's an example:

&lt;source lang=Delphi&gt;
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  DataField: TStrings;
  i: Integer;
begin
  DataField := TStringList.Create;

  DataField.Values['Sally Smart'] := '555-9999';
  DataField.Values['John Doe'] := '555-1212';
  DataField.Values['J. Random Hacker'] := '553-1337';

  // access an entry and display it in a message box
  ShowMessage(DataField.Values['Sally Smart']);

  // loop through the associative array 
  for i := 0 to DataField.Count - 1 do
  begin
    ShowMessage('Number for ' + DataField.Names[i] + ': ' + DataField.ValueFromIndex[i]);
  end;

  DataField.Free;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] ===
Erlang offers many approaches to represent mappings, two of the most common in the standard library are keylists and dictionaries.

Keylists are lists of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is a key, and the second is a value. Functions for operating on keylists are provided in the &lt;code&gt;lists&lt;/code&gt; module.

&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
PhoneBook = [{"Sally Smart", "555-9999"},
             {"John Doe", "555-1212"},
             {"J. Random Hacker", "553-1337"}].
&lt;/source&gt;

Accessing an element of the keylist can be done with the &lt;code&gt;lists:keyfind/3&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
{_, Phone} = lists:keyfind("Sally Smart", 1, PhoneBook),
io:format("Phone number: ~s~n", [Phone]).
&lt;/source&gt;

Dictionaries are implemented in the &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; of the standard library. A new dictionary is created using the &lt;code&gt;dict:new/0&lt;/code&gt; function and new key/value pairs are stored using the &lt;code&gt;dict:store/3&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
PhoneBook1 = dict:new(),
PhoneBook2 = dict:store("Sally Smith", "555-9999", Dict1),
PhoneBook3 = dict:store("John Doe", "555-1212", Dict2),
PhoneBook = dict:store("J. Random Hacker", "553-1337", Dict3).
&lt;/source&gt;

Such a serial initialization would be more idiomatically represented in Erlang with the appropriate function:

&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
PhoneBook = dict:from_list([{"Sally Smith", "555-9999"}, {"John Doe", "555-1212"},
                       {"J. Random Hacker", "553-1337"}]).
&lt;/source&gt;

The dictionary can be accessed using the &lt;code&gt;dict:find/2&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
{ok, Phone} = dict:find("Sally Smith", PhoneBook),
io:format("Phone: ~s~n", [Phone]).
&lt;/source&gt;

In both cases, any Erlang term can be used as the key. Variations include the &lt;code&gt;orddict&lt;/code&gt; module, implementing ordered dictionaries, and &lt;code&gt;gb_trees&lt;/code&gt;, implementing general balanced trees.

=== [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] ===
F# constructs maps from lists, sequences or arrays of [[tuple]]s, using functions provided by the Map module. F# represents a tuple as two or more elements separated by a comma, and a list as a sequence of elements enclosed in square brackets, separated by semi-colons.

&lt;source lang=fsharp&gt;
let numbers = [ "Sally Smart", "555-9999"; 
                "John Doe", "555-1212";
                "J. Random Hacker", "555-1337" ] |&gt; Map.ofList
&lt;/source&gt;

Values can be looked up via one of the &lt;code&gt;Map object&lt;/code&gt; functions, such as &lt;code&gt;TryFind&lt;/code&gt;. This returns an [[option type]] with a value of &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt;, for a successful lookup, or &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, for an unsuccessful one. [[Pattern matching]] can then be used to extract the raw value, or a default, from the result.

&lt;source lang=fsharp&gt;
let sallyNumber = match numbers.TryFind("Sally Smart") with
  | Some(number) -&gt; number
  | None         -&gt; "n/a"
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the &lt;code&gt;sallyNumber&lt;/code&gt; value will now contain the string &lt;code&gt;"555-9999"&lt;/code&gt;.

Because F# is a .NET language, it also has access to all of the features of the [[.NET Framework]], including the &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt; objects and &lt;code&gt;HashTable&lt;/code&gt; objects that are used for the same purpose in both C# and Visual Basic. These objects may be preferred when writing code that is intended by be linked to from other languages on the .NET framework.

=== [[FoxPro]] ===
[[Visual FoxPro]] implements mapping with the Collection Class.

&lt;source lang="visualfoxpro"&gt;
mapping = NEWOBJECT("Collection")
mapping.Add("Daffodils", "flower2") &amp;&amp; Add(object, key) – key must be character
index   = mapping.GetKey("flower2") &amp;&amp; returns the index value 1
object  = mapping("flower2")        &amp;&amp; returns "Daffodils" (retrieve by key)
object  = mapping(1)                &amp;&amp; returns "Daffodils" (retrieve by index)
&lt;/source&gt;

GetKey returns 0 if the key is not found.

See Collection in FoxPro Help for all the details.

=== [[Go (programming language)|Go]] ===
Go has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays, called ''maps''. A map's key type may only be a boolean, numeric, string, array, struct, pointer, interface, or channel type. A map type is written like this: &lt;tt&gt;map[keytype]valuetype&lt;/tt&gt;.

Adding elements one at a time:
&lt;source lang=Go&gt;
phone_book := make(map[string] string) // make an empty map
phone_book["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999"
phone_book["John Doe"] = "555-1212"
phone_book["J. Random Hacker"] = "553-1337"
&lt;/source&gt;

A map literal:
&lt;source lang=Go&gt;
phone_book := map[string] string {
	"Sally Smart": "555-9999",
	"John Doe": "555-1212",
	"J. Random Hacker": "553-1337",
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Iterating over a map:
&lt;source lang=Go&gt;
// over both keys and values
for key, value := range phone_book {
	fmt.Printf("Number for %s: %s\n", key, value)
}

// over just keys
for key := range phone_book {
	fmt.Printf("Name: %s\n", key)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] ===
The Haskell programming language's report only provides one kind of associative container: a list of pairs:

&lt;source lang="Haskell"&gt;
m = [("Sally Smart", "555-9999"), ("John Doe", "555-1212"), ("J. Random Hacker", "553-1337")]

main = print (lookup "John Doe" m)
&lt;/source&gt;
output:
 Just "555-1212"

Note that the lookup function returns a "Maybe" value, which is "Nothing" if not found, or "Just ''result''" when found.

[[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]], the most commonly used implementation of Haskell, provides two more types of associative containers. Other implementations might also provide these.

One is polymorphic functional maps (represented as immutable balanced binary trees):

&lt;source lang="Haskell" highlight="1"&gt;
import qualified Data.Map as M

m = M.insert "Sally Smart" "555-9999" M.empty
m' = M.insert "John Doe" "555-1212" m
m'' = M.insert "J. Random Hacker" "553-1337" m'

main = print (M.lookup "John Doe" m'' :: Maybe String)
&lt;/source&gt;
output:
 Just "555-1212"

A specialized version for integer keys also exists as Data.IntMap.

Finally, a polymorphic hash table:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
import qualified Data.HashTable as H

main = do m &lt;- H.new (==) H.hashString
          H.insert m "Sally Smart" "555-9999"
          H.insert m "John Doe" "555-1212"
          H.insert m "J. Random Hacker" "553-1337"
          foo &lt;- H.lookup m "John Doe"
          print foo
&lt;/source&gt;
output:
 Just "555-1212"

Lists of pairs and functional maps both provide a purely functional interface, which is more idiomatic in Haskell. In contrast, hash tables provide an imperative interface in the IO monad.

=== [[Java (programming language)|Java]] ===
In Java associative arrays are implemented as "maps"; they are part of the [[Java collections framework]]. Since [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|J2SE]] 5.0 and the introduction of [[generic programming|generics]] into Java, collections can have a type specified; for example, an associative array mapping strings to strings might be specified as follows:

&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
Map&lt;String, String&gt; phoneBook = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
phoneBook.put("Sally Smart", "555-9999");
phoneBook.put("John Doe", "555-1212");
phoneBook.put("J. Random Hacker", "555-1337");
&lt;/source&gt;

The {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Map|get(java.lang.Object)|name=get}} method is used to access a key; for example, the value of the expression &lt;code&gt;phoneBook.get("Sally Smart")&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;"555-9999"&lt;/code&gt;.

This code above uses a hash map to store the associative array, by calling the constructor of the {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|HashMap}} class; however, since the code only uses methods common to the interface {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Map}}, one could also use a self-balancing binary tree by calling the constructor of the {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|TreeMap}} class (which implements the subinterface {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|SortedMap}}), without changing the definition of the &lt;code&gt;phoneBook&lt;/code&gt; variable or the rest of the code, or use a number of other underlying data structures that implement the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; interface.

The hash function in Java, used by HashMap and HashSet, is provided by the method {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Object|hashCode()}}. Since every class in Java [[Inheritance (computer science)|inherits]] from {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Object}}, every object has a hash function. A class can [[Method overriding (programming)|override]] the default implementation of &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; to provide a custom hash function based on the properties of the object.

The &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; class also contains the method {{Javadoc:SE|name=equals(Object)|java/lang|Object|equals(java.lang.Object)}} that tests the object for equality with another object. Hashed data structures in Java rely on objects maintaining the following contract between their &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; methods:

For two objects ''a'' and ''b'',
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)
if a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to maintain this contract, a class that overrides &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; must also override &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;, and maybe vice versa, so that &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; is based on the same properties (or a subset of the properties) as &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;.

A further contract that hashed data structures has with the object is that the results of the &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; methods will not change once the object has been inserted into the map. For this reason, it is generally a good practice to base the hash function on [[Immutable object|immutable]] properties of the object.

Analogously, TreeMap, and other sorted data structures, requires that an ordering be defined on the data type. Either the data type must already have defined its own ordering, by implementing the {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Comparable}} interface; or a custom {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Comparator}} must be provided at the time the map is constructed. As with HashMap above, the relative ordering of keys in a TreeMap should not change once they have been inserted into the map.

=== [[JavaScript]] ===
JavaScript (and its standardized version: [[ECMAScript]]) is a [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] language. In JavaScript an object is a mapping from property names to values—that is, an associative array with one caveat: since property names are strings, only string and (coerced) integer keys are allowed. Other than that difference, objects also include one feature unrelated to associative arrays: a prototype link to the object they inherit from. Doing a lookup for a property will forward the lookup to the prototype if the object does not define the property itself.

An object literal is written as &lt;code&gt;{ property1 : value1, property2 : value2, ... }&lt;/code&gt;. For example:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myObject = {
	"Sally Smart"      : "555-9999",
	"John Doe"         : "555-1212",
	"J. Random Hacker" : "553-1337"
};
&lt;/source&gt;

If the property name is a valid identifier, the quotes can be omitted, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myOtherObject = { foo : 42, bar : false }
&lt;/source&gt;

Lookup is written using property access notation, either square brackets, which always works, or dot notation, which only works for identifier keys:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
myObject["John Doe"]
myOtherObject.foo
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also loop through all enumerable properties and associated values as follows:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
for(var property in myObject) {
	var value = myObject[property];
	alert("myObject[" + property + "] = " + value);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A property can be removed as follows:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
delete myObject["Sally Smart"];
&lt;/source&gt;

As mentioned before, properties are strings. However, since every native object and primitive can be implicitly converted to a string, you can do:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
myObject[1]                                             // key is "1"; note that myObject[1] == myObject['1']
myObject[['a','b']]                                     // key is "a,b"
myObject[{toString:function(){return 'hello world';}}] // key is "hello world"
&lt;/source&gt;

Any object, including built-in objects such as Array, can be dynamically extended with new properties. For example:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
Array.prototype.removeAllObjects = function () {
	/* ... */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In modern JavaScript it's considered bad form to use the Array type as an associative array. Consensus is that the Object type is best for this purpose. The reasoning behind this is that if Array is extended via prototype and Object is kept pristine, 'for(in)' loops will work as expected on associative 'arrays'. This issue has been drawn into focus by the popularity of JavaScript frameworks that make heavy and sometimes indiscriminate use of prototype to extend JavaScript's inbuilt types.

See [http://blog.metawrap.com/2006/05/30/june-6th-is-javascript-array-and-object-prototype-awareness-day/ JavaScript Array And Object Prototype Awareness Day] for more information on the issue.

=== [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] ===

=== [[Korn Shell|KornShell]] 93 (and compliant shells: ksh93, bash4...) ===
&lt;!-- Tested in ksh93 r --&gt;

Definition:
&lt;source lang="ksh"&gt;
 typeset -A phonebook; # ksh93
 declare -A phonebook; # bash4
 phonebook=(["Sally Smart"]="555-9999" ["John Doe"]="555-1212" ["[[J. Random Hacker]]"]="555-1337");
&lt;/source&gt;
Dereference:
&lt;source lang="ksh"&gt;
 ${phonebook["John Doe"]};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] ===
Lisp was originally conceived as a "LISt Processing" language, and one of its most important data types is the linked list, which can be treated as an association list ("alist").

&lt;source lang=Lisp&gt;
'(("Sally Smart" . "555-9999")
  ("John Doe" . "555-1212")
  ("J. Random Hacker" . "553-1337"))
&lt;/source&gt;

The syntax &lt;code&gt;(x . y)&lt;/code&gt; is used to indicate a [[cons|&lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt;ed]] pair. Keys and values need not be the same type within an alist. Lisp and Scheme provide operators such as &lt;code&gt;assoc&lt;/code&gt; to manipulate alists in ways similar to associative arrays.

Because of their linear nature, alists are used for relatively small sets of data. [[Common Lisp]] also supports a [[hash table]] data type, and for [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] they are implemented in [[Scheme Requests for Implementation|SRFI]] 69. Hash tables have greater overhead than alists, but provide much faster access when there are many elements.

It is easy to construct composite abstract data types in Lisp, using structures and/or the object-oriented programming features, in conjunction with lists, arrays, and hash tables.

=== [[LPC (programming language)|LPC]] ===
LPC implements associative arrays as a fundamental type known as either map or mapping, depending on the driver. The keys and values can be of any type. A mapping literal is written as &lt;code&gt;([ key_1 : value_1, key_2 : value_2 ])&lt;/code&gt;. Procedural use looks like:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
mapping phone_book = ([]);
phone_book["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999";
phone_book["John Doe"] = "555-1212";
phone_book["J. Random Hacker"] = "555-1337";
&lt;/source&gt;

Mappings are accessed for reading using the indexing operator in the same way as they are for writing, as shown above. So phone_book["Sally Smart"] would return the string "555-9999", and phone_book["John Smith"] would return 0. Testing for presence is done using the function member(), e.g. &lt;code&gt;if(member(phone_book, "John Smith")) write("John Smith is listed.\n");&lt;/code&gt;

Deletion is accomplished using a function called either m_delete() or map_delete(), depending on the driver, used like: &lt;code&gt;m_delete(phone_book, "Sally Smart");&lt;/code&gt;

LPC drivers of the "Amylaar" family implement multivalued mappings using a secondary, numeric index. (Drivers of the MudOS family do not support multivalued mappings.) Example syntax:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
mapping phone_book = ([:2]);
phone_book["Sally Smart", 0] = "555-9999";
phone_book["Sally Smart", 1] = "99 Sharp Way";
phone_book["John Doe", 0] = "555-1212";
phone_book["John Doe", 1] = "3 Nigma Drive";
phone_book["J. Random Hacker", 0] = "555-1337";
phone_book["J. Random Hacker", 1] = "77 Massachusetts Avenue";
&lt;/source&gt;

LPC drivers modern enough to support a foreach() construct allow iteration over their mapping types using it.

=== [[Lua programming language|Lua]] ===
In Lua, table is a fundamental type that can be used either as array (numerical index, fast) or as associative array.
The keys and values can be of any type, except nil. The following focuses on non-numerical indexes.

A table literal is written as &lt;code&gt;{ value, key = value, [index] = value, ["non id string"] = value }&lt;/code&gt;. For example:

&lt;source lang=Lua&gt;
phone_book = {
	["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999", 
	["John Doe"] = "555-1212", 
	["J. Random Hacker"] = "553-1337", -- Trailing comma is OK
}

aTable = {
	-- Table as value
	subTable = { 5, 7.5, k = true }, -- key is "subTable"
	-- Function as value
	['John Doe'] = function (age) if age &lt; 18 then return "Young" else return "Old!" end end,
	-- Table and function (and other types) can also be used as keys
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the key is a valid identifier (not a keyword), the quotes can be omitted. They are case sensitive.

Lookup is written using either square brackets, which always works, or dot notation, which only works for identifier keys:

&lt;source lang=Lua&gt;
print(aTable["John Doe"](45))
x = aTable.subTable.k
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also loop through all keys and associated values with iterators or for loops:

&lt;source lang=Lua&gt;
simple = { [true] = 1, [false] = 0, [3.14] = math.pi, x = 'x', ["!"] = 42 }
function FormatElement(key, value)
	return "[" .. tostring(key) .. "] = " .. value .. ", "
end
-- Iterate on all keys
table.foreach(simple, function (k, v) io.write(FormatElement(k, v)) end)
print""
for k, v in pairs(simple) do io.write(FormatElement(k, v)) end
print""
k= nil
repeat
	k, v = next(simple, k)
	if k ~= nil then io.write(FormatElement(k, v)) end
until k == nil
print""
&lt;/source&gt;

An entry can be removed by setting it to nil:

&lt;source lang=Lua&gt;
simple.x = nil
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, you can overwrite values or add them:

&lt;source lang=Lua&gt;
simple['%'] = "percent"
simple['!'] = 111
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Mathematica]] and [[Wolfram Language]] ===

Mathematica uses the Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Association.html|title=Association ( &lt;-...-&gt; )—Wolfram Language Documentation|website=reference.wolfram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; expression to represent associative arrays.
&lt;source lang="mathematica"&gt;
 phonebook = &lt;| "Sally Smart" -&gt; "555-9999", 
                "John Doe" -&gt; "555-1212",
                "J. Random Hacker" -&gt; "553-1337" |&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;
To access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Key.html|title=Key—Wolfram Language Documentation|website=reference.wolfram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="mathematica"&gt;
 phonebook[[Key["Sally Smart"]]]
&lt;/source&gt;
If the keys are strings, the ''Key'' keyword is not necessary, so:
&lt;source lang="mathematica"&gt;
 phonebook[["Sally Smart"]]
&lt;/source&gt;
To list keys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Keys.html|title=Keys—Wolfram Language Documentation|website=reference.wolfram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Values.html|title=Values—Wolfram Language Documentation|website=reference.wolfram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Keys[phonebook]
 Values[phonebook]

=== [[MUMPS]] ===
In MUMPS every array is an associative array. The built-in, language-level, direct support for associative arrays
applies to private, process-specific arrays stored in memory called "locals" as well as to the permanent, shared arrays stored on disk which are available concurrently by multiple jobs. The name for globals is preceded by the circumflex "^" to distinguish it from local variable names.

 SET ^phonebook("Sally Smart")="555-9999"      ;; storing permanent data
 SET phonebook("John Doe")="555-1212"          ;; storing temporary data
 SET phonebook("J. Random Hacker")="553-1337"  ;;storing temporary data
 MERGE ^phonebook=phonebook                    ;;copying temporary data into permanent data

To access the value of an element, simply requires using the name with the subscript:

 WRITE "Phone Number :",^phonebook("Sally Smart"),!

You can also loop through an associated array as follows:

 SET NAME=""
 FOR  S NAME=$ORDER(^phonebook(NAME)) QUIT:NAME=""  WRITE NAME,"  Phone Number :",^phonebook(NAME),!

=== [[Objective-C]] (Cocoa/GNUstep) ===
[[Cocoa (API)]] and [[GNUstep]] handle associative arrays using &lt;code&gt;NSMutableDictionary&lt;/code&gt; (a mutable version of &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt;) class cluster. This class allows assignments between any two objects to be made. A copy of the key object is made before it is inserted into &lt;code&gt;NSMutableDictionary&lt;/code&gt;, therefore the keys must conform to the &lt;code&gt;NSCopying&lt;/code&gt; protocol. When being inserted to a dictionary, the value object receives a retain message to increase its reference count. The value object will receive the release message when it will be deleted from the dictionary (both explicitly or by adding to the dictionary a different object with the same key).

&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
NSMutableDictionary *aDictionary = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[aDictionary setObject:@"555-9999" forKey:@"Sally Smart"]; 
[aDictionary setObject:@"555-1212" forKey:@"John Doe"]; 
[aDictionary setObject:@"553-1337" forKey:@"Random Hacker"]; 
&lt;/source&gt;

To access assigned objects this command may be used:

&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
id anObject = [aDictionary objectForKey:@"Sally Smart"];
&lt;/source&gt;

All keys or values can be simply enumerated using &lt;code&gt;NSEnumerator&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
NSEnumerator *keyEnumerator = [aDictionary keyEnumerator];
id key;
while ((key = [keyEnumerator nextObject]))
{
  // ... process it here ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

On Mac OS X 10.5+ and iPhone OS, dictionary keys can also be enumerated more concisely using this [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSFastEnumeration_protocol/ NSFastEnumeration] construct:

&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
for (id key in aDictionary) {
  // ... process it here ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

What is even more practical, structured data graphs may be easily created using [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], especially &lt;code&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;NSMutableDictionary&lt;/code&gt;). This can be illustrated with this compact example:

&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
NSDictionary *aDictionary =
       [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                           [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                                   @"555-9999", @"Sally Smart",
                                   @"555-1212", @"John Doe",
                                   nil], @"students",
                           [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                                   @"553-1337", @"Random Hacker",
                                   nil], @"hackers",
                           nil];
&lt;/source&gt;

And relevant fields can be quickly accessed using key paths:

&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
id anObject = [aDictionary valueForKeyPath:@"students.Sally Smart"];
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[OCaml]] ===
The OCaml programming language provides three different associative containers. The simplest is a list of pairs:

&lt;source lang=OCaml&gt;
# let m = [
	"Sally Smart", "555-9999";
	"John Doe", "555-1212";
	"J. Random Hacker", "553-1337"];;
val m : (string * string) list = [
	("Sally Smart", "555-9999");
	("John Doe", "555-1212");
	("J. Random Hacker", "553-1337")
]
# List.assoc "John Doe" m;;
- : string = "555-1212"
&lt;/source&gt;

The second is a polymorphic hash table:

&lt;source lang=OCaml&gt;
# let m = Hashtbl.create 3;;
val m : ('_a, '_b) Hashtbl.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# Hashtbl.add m "Sally Smart" "555-9999";
  Hashtbl.add m "John Doe" "555-1212";
  Hashtbl.add m "J. Random Hacker" "553-1337";;
- : unit = ()
# Hashtbl.find m "John Doe";;
- : string = "555-1212"
&lt;/source&gt;

The code above uses OCaml's default hash function &lt;code&gt;Hashtbl.hash&lt;/code&gt;, which is defined automatically for all types. If you wanted to use your own hash function, you can use the functor interface &lt;code&gt;Hashtbl.Make&lt;/code&gt; to create a module, like with &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; below.

Finally, functional maps (represented as immutable balanced binary trees):

&lt;source lang=OCaml&gt;
# module StringMap = Map.Make(String);;
...
# let m = StringMap.add "Sally Smart" "555-9999" StringMap.empty
  let m = StringMap.add "John Doe" "555-1212" m
  let m = StringMap.add "J. Random Hacker" "553-1337" m;;
val m : string StringMap.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# StringMap.find "John Doe" m;;
 - : string = "555-1212"
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that in order to use &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;, you have to provide the functor &lt;code&gt;Map.Make&lt;/code&gt; with a module which defines the key type and the comparison function. The third-party library ExtLib provides a polymorphic version of functional maps, called [https://web.archive.org/web/20081211233540/http://ocaml-extlib.googlecode.com/svn/doc/apiref/PMap.html PMap], where you provide the comparison function when creating the map.

Lists of pairs and functional maps both provide a purely functional interface. In contrast, hash tables provide an imperative interface. For many operations, hash tables are significantly faster than lists of pairs and functional maps.

The OptimJ programming language is an extension of Java 5. As java, Optimj provides maps. But, OptimJ also provides true associative arrays: java arrays are indexed with 0-based integers; associative arrays are indexed with any collection of keys.

&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
String[String] phoneBook = {
"Sally Smart"      -&gt; "555-9999",
"John Doe"         -&gt; "555-1212",
"J. Random Hacker" -&gt; "553-1337"
};

// String[String] is not a java type but an optimj type:
// associative array of strings indexed by strings.

// iterate over the values
for(String number : phoneBook) {
System.out.println(number);
}

// The previous statement prints:  "555-9999" "555-1212" "553-1337"

// iterate over the keys
for(String name : phoneBook.keys) {
System.out.println(name + " -&gt; " + phoneBook[name]);
}
// phoneBook[name] access a value by a key (it looks like java array access)
// i.e. phoneBook["John Doe"] returns "555-1212"

&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, it is possible to define multi-dimensional arrays, to mix java array and associative arrays, to mix maps and associative arrays.

&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
 int[String][][double] a;
 java.util.Map&lt;String[Object], Integer&gt; b;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Perl 5]] ===
Perl 5 has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays. Modern Perl vernacular refers to associative arrays as ''hashes''; the term ''associative array'' is found in older documentation, but is considered somewhat archaic. Perl 5 hashes are flat: keys are strings and values are scalars. However, values may be [[reference (computer science)|references]] to arrays or other hashes, and the standard Perl 5 module Tie::RefHash enables hashes to be used with reference keys.

A hash variable is marked by a &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]], to distinguish it from scalar, array and other data types. A hash literal is a key-value list, with the preferred form using Perl's &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; token, which is mostly semantically identical to the comma and makes the key-value association clearer:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
my %phone_book = (
	'Sally Smart'      =&gt; '555-9999',
	'John Doe'         =&gt; '555-1212',
	'J. Random Hacker' =&gt; '553-1337',
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Accessing a hash element uses the syntax &lt;code&gt;$hash_name{$key}&lt;/code&gt; – the key is surrounded by ''curly braces'' and the hash name is prefixed by a &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the hash element itself is a ''scalar'' value, even though it is part of a hash. The value of &lt;code&gt;$phone_book{'John Doe'}&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;'555-1212'&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; sigil is only used when referring to the hash as a whole, such as when asking for &lt;code&gt;keys %phone_book&lt;/code&gt;.

The list of keys and values can be extracted using the built-in functions &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. So, for example, to print all the keys of a hash:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
foreach $name (keys %phone_book) {
	print $name, "\n";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

One can iterate through (key, value) pairs using the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
while (($name, $number) = each %phone_book) {
	print 'Number for ', $name, ': ', $number, "\n";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A hash ''reference'', which is a scalar value that points to a hash, is specified in literal form using curly braces as delimiters, with syntax otherwise similar to specifying a hash literal:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
my $phone_book = {
	'Sally Smart' =&gt; '555-9999',
	'John Doe' =&gt; '555-1212',
	'J. Random Hacker' =&gt; '553-1337',
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Values in a hash reference are accessed using the dereferencing operator:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
print $phone_book-&gt;{'Sally Smart'};
&lt;/source&gt;

When the hash contained in the hash reference needs to be referred to as a whole, as with the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; function, the syntax is as follows:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
foreach $name (keys %{$phone_book}) {
	print 'Number for ', $name, ': ', $phone_book-&gt;{$name}, "\n";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Perl 6]] ===
Perl 6 also has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays, which are referred to as ''hashes'' or as objects performing the ''Associative'' role.  By default, Perl 6 hashes are flat: keys are strings and values are scalars.  One can define a ''hash'' to not coerce all keys to strings automatically: these are referred to as ''object hashes'', because the keys of such hashes remain the original object rather than a stringification thereof.

A hash variable is typically marked by a &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]], to visually distinguish it from scalar, array and other data types, and to define its behaviour towards iteration. A hash literal is a key-value list, with the preferred form using Perl's &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; token, which makes the key-value association clearer:

&lt;source lang=Perl6&gt;
my %phone-book =
	'Sally Smart'      =&gt; '555-9999',
	'John Doe'         =&gt; '555-1212',
	'J. Random Hacker' =&gt; '553-1337',
;
&lt;/source&gt;

Accessing a hash element uses the syntax &lt;code&gt;%hash_name{$key}&lt;/code&gt; – the key is surrounded by ''curly braces'' and the hash name (note that the sigil does '''not''' change, contrary to [[Perl 5]]). The value of &lt;code&gt;%phone-book{'John Doe'}&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;'555-1212'&lt;/code&gt;.

The list of keys and values can be extracted using the built-in functions &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. So, for example, to print all the keys of a hash:

&lt;source lang=Perl6&gt;
for %phone-book.keys -&gt; $name {
	say $name;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, when iterating over a ''hash'', one gets key/value ''Pair''s.

&lt;source lang=Perl6&gt;
for %phone-book -&gt; $entry {
	say "Number for $entry.key(): $entry.value()";  # using extended interpolation features
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It's also possible to get alternating key and value values by using the ''kv'' method:

&lt;source lang=Perl6&gt;
for %phone-book.kv -&gt; $name, $number {
	say "Number for $name: $number";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Perl 6]] doesn't have any references.  Hashes can be passed around as single parameters that do not get flattened.  If you want to make sure that a subroutine only accepts hashes, use the ''%'' sigil in the ''Signature''.

&lt;source lang=Perl6&gt;
sub list-phone-book(%pb) {
    for %pb.kv -&gt; $name, $number {
        say "Number for $name: $number";
    }
}
list-phone-book(%phone-book);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[PHP]] ===
PHP's built-in array type is in reality an associative array. Even when using numerical indexes, PHP internally stores it as an associative array.&lt;ref&gt;About the implementation of [http://se.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php Arrays] in PHP&lt;/ref&gt; This is why one in PHP can have non-consecutive numerically indexed arrays. The keys have to be integer or string (floating point numbers are truncated to integer), while values can be of arbitrary types, including other arrays and objects. The arrays are heterogeneous; a single array can have keys of different types. PHP's associative arrays can be used to represent trees, lists, stacks, queues and other common data structures not built into PHP.

An associative array can be declared using the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=PHP&gt;
$phonebook                     = array();
$phonebook['Sally Smart']      = '555-9999';
$phonebook['John Doe']         = '555-1212';
$phonebook['J. Random Hacker'] = '555-1337';

// or

$phonebook = array(
    'Sally Smart'      =&gt; '555-9999',
    'John Doe'         =&gt; '555-1212',
    'J. Random Hacker' =&gt; '555-1337',
);

// or, as of PHP 5.4

$phonebook = [
    'Sally Smart'      =&gt; '555-9999',
    'John Doe'         =&gt; '555-1212',
    'J. Random Hacker' =&gt; '555-1337',
];

// or

$phonebook['contacts']['Sally Smart']['number']      = '555-9999';
$phonebook['contacts']['John Doe']['number']         = '555-1212';
$phonebook['contacts']['J. Random Hacker']['number'] = '555-1337';
&lt;/source&gt;

PHP can loop through an associative array as follows:

&lt;source lang=PHP&gt;
foreach($phonebook as $name =&gt; $number) {
    echo 'Number for ', $name, ': ', $number, "\n";
}

// For the last array example it is used like this
foreach($phonebook['contacts'] as $name =&gt; $num) {
   echo 'Name: ', $name, ', number: ', $num['number'], "\n";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

PHP has an [http://php.net/array extensive set of functions] to operate on arrays.

If you want an associative array that can use objects as keys instead of strings and integers, you can use the [http://php.net/SplObjectStorage SplObjectStorage] class from the Standard PHP Library (SPL).

=== [[Pike (programming language)|Pike]] ===
Pike has built-in support for Associative Arrays, which are referred to as mappings. Mappings are created as follows:

&lt;source lang=Pike&gt;
mapping(string:string) phonebook = ([
	"Sally Smart":"555-9999",
	"John Doe":"555-1212",
	"J. Random Hacker":"555-1337"
]);
&lt;/source&gt;

Accessing and testing for presence in mappings is done using the indexing operator. So &lt;code&gt;phonebook["Sally Smart"]&lt;/code&gt; would return the string &lt;code&gt;"555-9999"&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;phonebook["John Smith"]&lt;/code&gt; would return 0.

Iterating through a mapping can be done using either foreach:

&lt;source lang=pike&gt;
foreach(phonebook; string key; string value) {
	write("%s:%s\n", key, value);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Or using an iterator object:

&lt;source lang=pike&gt;
Mapping.Iterator i = get_iterator(phonebook);
while (i-&gt;index()) {
	write("%s:%s\n", i-&gt;index(), i-&gt;value());
	i-&gt;next();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Elements of a mapping can be removed using m_delete, which returns the value of the removed index:

&lt;source lang=pike&gt;
string sallys_number = m_delete(phonebook, "Sally Smart");
&lt;/source&gt;

=== PostScript ===
In [[PostScript]], associative arrays are called dictionaries. In Level 1 PostScript they must be created explicitly, but Level 2 introduced direct declaration using the double-brace syntax:

&lt;source lang="postscript"&gt;
  % Level 1 declaration
  3 dict dup begin
    /red   (rouge) def
    /green (vert)  def
    /blue  (bleu)  def
  end

  % Level 2 declaration
  &lt;&lt;
    /red   (rot)
    /green (gruen)
    /blue  (blau)
  &gt;&gt;

  % Both methods leave the dictionary on the operand stack
&lt;/source&gt;
Dictionaries can be accessed directly using '''get''' or implicitly by placing the dictionary on the dictionary stack using '''begin''':

&lt;source lang="postscript"&gt;
  % With the previous two dictionaries still on the operand stack
  /red get print    % outputs 'rot'

  begin
  green print       % outputs 'vert'
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Dictionary contents can be iterated through using '''forall''', though not in any particular order:

&lt;source lang="postscript"&gt;
  % Level 2 example
  &lt;&lt;
    /This  1
    /That  2
    /Other 3
  &gt;&gt; {exch =print ( is ) print ==} forall
&lt;/source&gt;
May well output:
&lt;source lang="postscript"&gt;
  That is 2
  This is 1
  Other is 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Dictionaries can be augmented (up to their defined size only in Level 1) or altered using '''put''', and entries can be removed using '''undef''':
&lt;source lang="postscript"&gt;
  % define a dictionary for easy reuse:
  /MyDict &lt;&lt;
    /rouge (red)
    /vert (gruen)
  &gt;&gt; def

  % add to it
  MyDict /bleu (blue) put

  % change it
  MyDict /vert (green) put

  % remove something
  MyDict /rouge undef
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Prolog ===

Some versions of [[Prolog]] include "dicts".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=dicts "Dicts: structures with named arguments"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Python (programming language)|Python]] ===
In Python, associative arrays are called ''[[Python syntax and semantics#Collection types|dictionaries]]''. Dictionary literals are marked with curly braces:

&lt;source lang=Python&gt;
phonebook = {
    'Sally Smart': '555-9999',
    'John Doe': '555-1212',
    'J. Random Hacker': '553-1337',
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To access an entry in Python simply use the array indexing operator. For example, 
&lt;source lang=Pycon&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; phonebook['Sally Smart']
'555-9999'
&lt;/source&gt;
An example loop [[iterator#Python|iterating]] through all the keys of the dictionary:

&lt;source lang=Pycon&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in phonebook:
...     print(key, phonebook[key])
Sally Smart 555-9999
J. Random Hacker 553-1337
John Doe 555-1212
&lt;/source&gt;

Iterating through (key, value) tuples:

&lt;source lang=Pycon&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for key, value in phonebook.items():
...     print(key, value)
Sally Smart 555-9999
J. Random Hacker 553-1337
John Doe 555-1212
&lt;/source&gt;

Dictionary keys can be individually deleted using the del statement. The corresponding value can be returned before the key-value pair are deleted using the pop method of dict types:

&lt;source lang=Pycon&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; del phonebook['John Doe']
&gt;&gt;&gt; val = phonebook.pop('Sally Smart')
&gt;&gt;&gt; phonebook.keys() # Only one key left
['J. Random Hacker']
&lt;/source&gt;

Python 2.7 and 3.x also supports dictionary comprehensions, a compact syntax for generating a dictionary from any iterator:
&lt;source lang=Pycon&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; square_dict = {i: i*i for i in range(5)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; square_dict
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
&gt;&gt;&gt; {key: value for key, value in phonebook.items() if 'J' in key}
{'J. Random Hacker': '553-1337', 'John Doe': '555-1212'}
&lt;/source&gt;

Strictly speaking, a dictionary is a super-set of an associative array since neither the keys or values are limited to a single datatype. One could think of a dictionary as an ''associative list'' using the nomenclature of Python. For example the following is also legitimate:

&lt;source lang=Python&gt;
phonebook = {
    'Sally Smart': '555-9999',
    'John Doe': None,
    'J. Random Hacker': -3.32,
    14: '555-3322',
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The dictionary keys must be of an [[Immutable object|immutable]] data type. In Python, strings are immutable due to their method of implementation.

=== [[REXX]] ===
In REXX, associative arrays are called ''Stem variables'' or ''Compound variables''.

&lt;source lang=REXX&gt;
KEY = 'Sally Smart'
PHONEBOOK.KEY = '555-9999'
KEY = 'John Doe'
PHONEBOOK.KEY = '555-1212'
KEY = 'J. Random Hacker'
PHONEBOOK.KEY = '553-1337'
&lt;/source&gt;

Stem variables with numeric keys typically start at 1 and go up from there. The 0 key stem variable
is used (by convention) as the count of items in the whole stem.

&lt;source lang=REXX&gt;
NAME.1 = 'Sally Smart'
NAME.2 = 'John Doe'
NAME.3 = 'J. Random Hacker'
NAME.0 = 3
&lt;/source&gt;

REXX has no easy way of automatically accessing the keys for a stem variable and typically the
keys are stored in a separate associative array with numeric keys.

=== [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] ===

In Ruby a [[hash table|hash]] is used as follows:

&lt;source lang=irb&gt;
irb(main):001:0&gt; phonebook = {
irb(main):002:1* 'Sally Smart' =&gt; '555-9999',
irb(main):003:1* 'John Doe' =&gt; '555-1212',
irb(main):004:1* 'J. Random Hacker' =&gt; '553-1337'
irb(main):005:1&gt; }
=&gt; {"Sally Smart"=&gt;"555-9999", "John Doe"=&gt;"555-1212", "J. Random Hacker"=&gt;"553-1337"}
irb(main):006:0&gt; phonebook['John Doe']
=&gt; "555-1212"
&lt;/source&gt;

Ruby supports hash looping and iteration with the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=irb&gt;
irb(main):007:0&gt; ### iterate over keys and values
irb(main):008:0* phonebook.each {|key, value| puts key + " =&gt; " + value}
Sally Smart =&gt; 555-9999
John Doe =&gt; 555-1212
J. Random Hacker =&gt; 553-1337
=&gt; {"Sally Smart"=&gt;"555-9999", "John Doe"=&gt;"555-1212", "J. Random Hacker"=&gt;"553-1337"}
irb(main):009:0&gt; ### iterate keys only
irb(main):010:0* phonebook.each_key {|key| puts key}
Sally Smart
John Doe
J. Random Hacker
=&gt; {"Sally Smart"=&gt;"555-9999", "John Doe"=&gt;"555-1212", "J. Random Hacker"=&gt;"553-1337"}
irb(main):011:0&gt; ### iterate values only
irb(main):012:0* phonebook.each_value {|value| puts value}
555-9999
555-1212
553-1337
=&gt; {"Sally Smart"=&gt;"555-9999", "John Doe"=&gt;"555-1212", "J. Random Hacker"=&gt;"553-1337"}
&lt;/source&gt;

Ruby also supports many other useful operations on hashes, such as merging hashes, selecting or rejecting elements that meet some criteria, inverting (swapping the keys and values), and flattening a hash into an array.

=== [[S-Lang (programming language)|S-Lang]] ===
S-Lang has an associative array type.

For example:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
phonebook = Assoc_Type[];
phonebook["Sally Smart"] = "555-9999"
phonebook["John Doe"] = "555-1212"
phonebook["J. Random Hacker"] = "555-1337"
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also loop through an associated array in a number of ways.
Here is one

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
foreach name (phonebook) {
	vmessage ("%s %s", name, phonebook[name]);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To print a sorted-list, it is better to take advantage of S-lang's strong
support for standard arrays:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
keys = assoc_get_keys(phonebook);
i = array_sort(keys);
vals = assoc_get_values(phonebook);
array_map (Void_Type, &amp;vmessage, "%s %s", keys[i], vals[i]);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] ===
Scala provides an immutable Map class as part of the scala.collection framework:

&lt;source lang=Scala&gt;
val phonebook = Map("Sally Smart" -&gt; "555-9999",
  "John Doe" -&gt; "555-1212",
  "J. Random Hacker" -&gt; "553-1337")
&lt;/source&gt;

Scala's [[type inference]] will work out that this is a &lt;code&gt;Map[String, String]&lt;/code&gt;. To access the array:

&lt;source lang=Scala&gt;
phonebook.get("Sally Smart")
&lt;/source&gt;

This returns an Option type, Scala's equivalent of a [[Monad (functional programming)#The Maybe monad|the Maybe monad]] in Haskell.

=== [[Smalltalk]] ===
In Smalltalk a dictionary is used:

&lt;source lang=Smalltalk&gt;
phonebook := Dictionary new.
phonebook at: 'Sally Smart' put: '555-9999'.
phonebook at: 'John Doe' put: '555-1212'.
phonebook at: 'J. Random Hacker' put: '553-1337'.
&lt;/source&gt;

To access an entry the message &lt;code&gt;#at:&lt;/code&gt; is sent to the dictionary object.

&lt;source lang=Smalltalk&gt;
phonebook at: 'Sally Smart'
&lt;/source&gt;

gives

&lt;source lang=Text&gt;
 '555-9999'
&lt;/source&gt;
Dictionary hashes/compares based on equality and holds 
[[Garbage collection (computer science)#Strong and weak references|strong references]] to both key and value. Variants exist which hash/compare on identity (IdentityDictionary) or keep [[Garbage collection (computer science)#Strong and weak references|weak references]] (WeakKeyDictionary / WeakValueDictionary).
Because every object implements #hash, any object can be used as key (and of course also as value).

=== [[SNOBOL]] ===
SNOBOL is one of the first (if not the first) programming languages to use associative arrays.
Associative arrays in [[SNOBOL]] are called Tables.

&lt;source lang="snobol"&gt;
PHONEBOOK = TABLE()
PHONEBOOK['Sally Smart'] = '555-9999'
PHONEBOOK['John Doe'] = '555-1212'
PHONEBOOK['J. Random Hacker'] = '553-1337'
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Standard ML]] ===
The SML'97 standard of the Standard ML programming language does not provide any associative containers. However, various implementations of Standard ML do provide associative containers.

The library of the popular [[Standard ML of New Jersey]] implementation provides a signature (somewhat like an "interface"), &lt;code&gt;ORD_MAP&lt;/code&gt;, which defines a common interface for ordered functional (immutable) associative arrays. There are several general functors, &lt;code&gt;BinaryMapFn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ListMapFn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RedBlackMapFn&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SplayMapFn&lt;/code&gt;, that allow you to create the corresponding type of ordered map (the types are a [[self-balancing binary search tree]], sorted [[association list]], [[red-black tree]], and [[splay tree]], respectively) using a user-provided structure to describe the key type and comparator. The functor returns a structure that follows the &lt;code&gt;ORD_MAP&lt;/code&gt; interface. In addition, there are two pre-defined modules for associative arrays with integer keys: &lt;code&gt;IntBinaryMap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IntListMap&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
- structure StringMap = BinaryMapFn (struct
                                       type ord_key = string
                                       val compare = String.compare
                                     end);
structure StringMap : ORD_MAP

- val m = StringMap.insert (StringMap.empty, "Sally Smart", "555-9999")
  val m = StringMap.insert (m, "John Doe", "555-1212")
  val m = StringMap.insert (m, "J. Random Hacker", "553-1337");
val m =
  T
    {cnt=3,key="John Doe",
     left=T {cnt=1,key="J. Random Hacker",left=E,right=E,value="553-1337"},
     right=T {cnt=1,key="Sally Smart",left=E,right=E,value="555-9999"},
     value="555-1212"} : string StringMap.map
- StringMap.find (m, "John Doe");
val it = SOME "555-1212" : string option
&lt;/source&gt;

SML/NJ also provides a polymorphic hash table:

&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
- exception NotFound;
exception NotFound
- val m : (string, string) HashTable.hash_table = HashTable.mkTable (HashString.hashString, op=) (3, NotFound);
val m =
  HT
    {eq_pred=fn,hash_fn=fn,n_items=ref 0,not_found=NotFound(-),
     table=ref [|NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,NIL,...|]}
  : (string,string) HashTable.hash_table
- HashTable.insert m ("Sally Smart", "555-9999");
val it = () : unit
- HashTable.insert m ("John Doe", "555-1212");
val it = () : unit
- HashTable.insert m ("J. Random Hacker", "553-1337");
val it = () : unit
HashTable.find m "John Doe"; (* returns NONE if not found *)
val it = SOME "555-1212" : string option
- HashTable.lookup m "John Doe"; (* raises the exception if not found *)
val it = "555-1212" : string
&lt;/source&gt;

Monomorphic hash tables are also supported using the &lt;code&gt;HashTableFn&lt;/code&gt; functor.

Another Standard ML implementation, [[Moscow ML]], also provides some associative containers. First, it provides polymorphic hash tables in the &lt;code&gt;Polyhash&lt;/code&gt; structure. Also, some functional maps from the SML/NJ library above are available as &lt;code&gt;Binarymap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Splaymap&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Intmap&lt;/code&gt; structures.

=== [[Tcl]] ===
There are two Tcl facilities that support associative array semantics. An array is a collection of ''variables''.  A '''dict''' is a full implementation of associative arrays.

'''dict'''

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
set phonebook [dict create {Sally Smart} 555-9999 {John Doe} 555-1212 {J. Random Hacker} 553-1337]
&lt;/source&gt;

To look up an item:

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
dict get $phonebook {John Doe}
&lt;/source&gt;

To iterate through a dict:

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
foreach {name number} $phonebook {
	puts "name: $name\nnumber: $number"
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''array'''

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
set {phonebook(Sally Smart)} 555-9999
set john {John Doe}
set phonebook($john) 555-1212
set {phonebook(J. Random Hacker)} 553-1337
&lt;/source&gt;

If there is a literal space character in the variable name, it must be grouped using either curly brackets (no substitution performed) or double quotes (substitution is performed).

Alternatively, several array elements can be set in a single command by providing their mappings as a list (words containing whitespace are braced):

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
array set phonebook [list {Sally Smart} 555-9999 {John Doe} 555-1212 {J. Random Hacker} 553-1337]
&lt;/source&gt;

To access one array entry and put it on standard output

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
puts $phonebook(Sally\ Smart)
&lt;/source&gt;

The result is here

&lt;source lang=Text&gt;
555-9999
&lt;/source&gt;

To retrieve the entire array as a dictionary:

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
array get phonebook
&lt;/source&gt;

The result can be (order of keys is unspecified, not because the dictionary is unordered, but because the array is):

&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
{Sally Smart} 555-9999 {J. Random Hacker} 553-1337 {John Doe} 555-1212
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Visual Basic]] ===
There is no standard implementation common to all dialects. Visual Basic can use the Dictionary class from the [[Windows Scripting Host|Microsoft Scripting Runtime]] (which is shipped with Visual Basic 6):

&lt;source lang=VB&gt;
' Requires a reference to SCRRUN.DLL in Project Properties
Dim phoneBook As New Dictionary
phoneBook.Add "Sally Smart", "555-9999"
phoneBook.Item("John Doe") = "555-1212"
phoneBook("J. Random Hacker") = "553-1337"
For Each name In phoneBook
	MsgBox name &amp; " = " &amp; phoneBook(name)
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Visual Basic .NET]] relies on the collection classes provided by [[.NET Framework]]:

&lt;source lang=VBNet&gt;
Dim phoneBook As New System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary(Of String, String)
phoneBook("Sally Smart") = "555-9999"
phoneBook("John Doe") = "555-1212"
phoneBook("J. Random Hacker") = "553-1337"
For Each entry As KeyValuePair(Of String, String) In phoneBook
	MessageBox.Show(entry.Key &amp; " = " &amp; entry.Value)
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[Windows PowerShell]] ===
Unlike many other [[command line interpreter]]s, PowerShell has built-in, language-level support for defining associative arrays.

For example:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$phonebook = @{
        'Sally Smart' = '555-9999';
	'John Doe' = '555-1212'; 
	'J. Random Hacker' = '553-1337'
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Like in JavaScript, if the property name is a valid identifier, the quotes can be omitted, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$myOtherObject = @{ foo = 42; bar = $false }
&lt;/source&gt;

Entries can be separated by either a semicolon or a newline, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$myOtherObject = @{ foo = 42
                    bar = $false ;
                    zaz = 3
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Keys and values can be any [[.NET Framework|.NET]] object type, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$now = [DateTime]::Now
$tomorrow = $now.AddDays(1)
$ProcessDeletionSchedule = @{ 
        (Get-Process notepad) = $now 
        (Get-Process calc) = $tomorrow
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to create an empty associative array and add single entries or even other associative arrays to it later on.

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$phonebook = @{}
$phonebook += @{ 'Sally Smart' = '555-9999' }
$phonebook += @{ 'John Doe' = '555-1212'; 'J. Random Hacker' = '553-1337' }
&lt;/source&gt;

New entries can also be added by using the array index operator, the property operator or the &lt;code&gt;Add()&lt;/code&gt; method of the underlying .NET object:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$phonebook = @{}
$phonebook['Sally Smart'] = '555-9999'
$phonebook.'John Doe' = '555-1212'
$phonebook.Add('J. Random Hacker', '553-1337')
&lt;/source&gt;

To dereference assigned objects the array index operator, the property operator or the parameterized property &lt;code&gt;Item()&lt;/code&gt; of the .NET object can be used:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$phonebook['Sally Smart'] 
$phonebook.'John Doe'
$phonebook.Item('J. Random Hacker')
&lt;/source&gt;

You can loop through an associative array as follows:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$phonebook.Keys | foreach { "Number for {0}: {1}" -f $_,$phonebook.$_ }
&lt;/source&gt;

An entry can be removed using the &lt;code&gt;Remove()&lt;/code&gt; method of the underlying .NET object:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$phonebook.Remove('Sally Smart')
&lt;/source&gt;

Hash tables can be added, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=PowerShell&gt;
$hash1 = @{ a=1; b=2 }
$hash2 = @{ c=3; d=4 }
$hash3 = $hash1 + $hash2
&lt;/source&gt;

==Data serialization formats support==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}

Many data serialization formats also support associative arrays (see [[Comparison of data serialization formats#Syntax comparison of human-readable formats|this table]])

=== [[JSON]] ===
In JSON, associative arrays are also referred to as objects. Keys can only be strings.
&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
{
    "Sally Smart": "555-9999",
    "John Doe": "555-1212",
    "J. Random Hacker": "555-1337"
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== [[YAML]] ===

YAML associative arrays are also called map elements or key-value pairs. YAML places no restrictions on the type of keys; in particular, they are not restricted to being scalar or string values.

&lt;source lang=YAML&gt;
Sally Smart: 555-9999
John Doe: 555-1212
J. Random Hacker: 555-1337
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Hassam v Jacobs NO and Others''''',&lt;ref&gt;2009 (5) SA 572 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in South African law, was heard in the Constitutional Court&lt;ref&gt;Langa CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Cameron J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, Nkabinde J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Skweyiya J, Van Der Westhuizen J and Yacoob J.&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 February 2009, with judgment handed down on 15 July. The applicant was a party to a polygamous Muslim marriage, whose husband had died intestate. The Constitutional Court held that precluding the applicant from inheriting unfairly discriminated on the grounds of religion, marital status and gender, and was therefore inconsistent with section 9 of the Constitution. Accordingly, it was held that the applicant could inherit. The ambit of this judgment extended the ruling in ''[[Daniels v Campbell]]'' to polygamous Muslim marriages.

== Facts ==
The question was whether or not the benefits provided by the [[Intestate Succession Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Act 81 of 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Maintenance Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Act 27 of 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; accrue to surviving spouses of polygynous Muslim marriages. The objective of the legislation is to ensure that widows receive at least a child's share of their spouse's estates instead of being left precariously dependant on family benevolence.

The Cape High Court found the Intestate Succession Act,&lt;ref&gt;s 1(4)(f).&lt;/ref&gt; in discriminating on grounds of gender and religion and marital status, to be inconsistent with the Constitution. The word "spouse" in the Act should be interpreted henceforth to include partners in polygynous Muslim marriages, while "survivor" in the Maintenance Act should be read to include surviving partners of polygynous Muslim marriages.

== Judgment ==
In the Constitutional Court, however, "spouse" was found not to be reasonably capable of being understood to include more than one partner in the context of a polygynous Muslim marriage. The words "or spouses," therefore, are henceforth to be read in after each use of the word "spouse" in the Act.

'''Ilio DiPaolo''' (November 7, 1926 – May 10, 1995), was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and restaurateur who lived in the [[Buffalo, New York]] area.

==Professional wrestling career==
DiPaolo was born in Italy and lived there until he moved to Venezuela in 1949.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; There, he met [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promoter|promoter]] [[Toots Mondt]], who taught him to wrestle.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; While waiting to get the proper paperwork to move to the United States, he relocated to the Dominican Republic to wrestle in the meantime.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; After the paperwork was completed, he moved to [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=rest/&gt; He then began to work for [[Frank Tunney]] out of the Toronto area.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Around this time he teamed with [[Whipper Billy Watson]] to win the  [[NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

After wrestling around the world, he returned to Toronto in 1968 to wrestle [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]] for the World Championship, but the match went to a one-hour time limit draw.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; His last match was against [[Lou Thesz]] for the same title; a match that also went to a one-hour time limit draw.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

==Personal life==
DiPaolo met his wife Ethel, stepdaughter of promoter Pedro Martinez, in 1952.&lt;ref name=rest/&gt; The couple had four children.&lt;ref name=rest/&gt;

He opened his first restaurant, a pizzeria, when he was in his 40s, but it was destroyed by a fire.&lt;ref name=rest/&gt; DiPaolo retired from wrestling full-time in 1965 and opened his second restaurant, an eponymous Italian restaurant now known as "[[Ilio DiPaolo's]]" in [[Blasdell, New York]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref name=rest/&gt; He died in 1995 after being struck by a car during a torrential downpour while trying to enter a restaurant with his wife.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; After his death, DiPaolo's oldest son Dennis began to run the restaurant.&lt;ref name=rest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/05/04/1025561.html|title=DiPaolo's Restaurant celebrates 40 years|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-12-28|date=May 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other children also worked in the restaurant.&lt;ref name=rest/&gt;

[[World Championship Wrestling]] held the [[Ilio DiPaolo Memorial Show]] for DiPaolo from 1996 through 1999. To this point over $750,000 has been raised for the Ilio DiPaolo Scholarship Fund and for other Buffalo charities like Children's Hospital and People Inc.

DiPaolo was selected as a New York State Award recipient by the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="pwhf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/dipaolo.asp|title=Ilio Dipaolo|author=Beyer, Dick|publisher=[[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=2009-12-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330194957/http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/dipaolo.asp|archivedate=2010-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DiPaolo family has also been inducted into the New York Chapter of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame for the creation of the Ilio DiPaolo Scholarship fund and continual contribution to high school wrestling.

==History==
IAML was founded after [[World War II]] to "promote international cooperation and standardization in such matters as [[cataloging]], standards of service, personnel training and the exchange of materials between [[libraries]]."&lt;ref name=Lonn&gt;Anders Lönn, "International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres," The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 12, p. 491. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of IAML was a three-year process from 1949 to 1951. It was part of the [[United Nations]]' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in [[Basel]] and [[Florence]] in 1949, in [[Lüneburg]] in 1950, and in [[Paris]] in 1951, the last one conducted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music Librarianship in the United Kingdom |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Turbet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |date=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=9780754605720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Accademia Nazionale [[Luigi Cherubini]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the [[International Musicological Society]] in 1927, but the [[Second World War]] prevented anything from taking shape.&lt;ref name="Pleßke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleßke|first=Hans-Martin|title=Geschichte und Funktion der Internationalen Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken (IVMB)|journal=Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen|date=1972|volume=86|issue=6|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused heavy losses at many [[libraries]], and international cooperation was of utmost importance. 

The goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Eitner's|de}} ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' ([[Leipzig]], 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for [[Microform|microfilming]] musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to [[Music librarianship#Cataloging and Classification|music cataloging]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]].

In 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The International Association of Music Libraries |journal=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] |first=Thor E. |last=Wood |pages=697–699 |volume=25 |issue=4 |date= June 1959 |jstor=896620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991,&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt; with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.

IAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, [[the International Association of Music Information Centres]] and the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.&lt;ref name=Lonn /&gt;

==Structure==
The IAML board of directors is made up of the [[president]], past president, [[Secretary (club)|secretary general]], [[treasurer]], and [[vice presidents]].&lt;ref name=Meinhold&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Alexandra|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110226379|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.

IAML is affiliated with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), the [[International Music Council]], and the IMS.&lt;ref name=Meinhold /&gt;

==Activities==
IAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the "R projects" of [[musicology]]: ''Répertoire international des sources musicales'' (RISM), ''[[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|Répertoire international de littérature musicale]]'' (RILM), ''Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale'' (RIdIM) and ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the "R projects".&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt;

===Annual Conferences===
IAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.&lt;ref name=Geering&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geering|first=Mireille|title=Geschichte und Gegenwart der AIBM|journal=Forum Musikbibliothek|date=1991|volume=3|pages=197–212.

==Early life==
Wolf was born in Santa Rosa, California. His parents, Len Harrison and Liz Wolf, divorced when he was a young child; he grew up in [[Wrightwood, California]] with his mother, an elementary school teacher. Wolf's middle name, Selassie, is in honor of Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]].&lt;ref name=sigsn/&gt; His mother was born into a Jewish family, and converted to Christianity, becoming a Messianic Jew and raising Wolf a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/interviews/wolf.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joshwolf.net/blog/2007/02/06/303/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825081715/http://joshwolf.net/blog/2007/02/06/303/ |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolf attended Wrightwood Elementary School in [[Wrightwood, California]] and Pinon Mesa Middle School in [[Phelan, California]]. He graduated from [[Serrano High School]] in Phelan, California in 2000. Wolf received a bachelor's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2006, and finished a master's degree at the [[UC Berkeley|University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism]] in 2011.

==The video==
Wolf, a video blogger who reported on numerous protest and progressive events, videotaped an anti-[[G8]] [[anarchist]] protest in [[San Francisco]] on July 8, 2005 in which some of the protesters wore masks and vandalized property. Later that same night, and over the next few days, Wolf edited his footage and posted the video to a local activist news website, Bay Area Indymedia, or [[Indybay]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Josh, [http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/07/09/17517591.php "Empires Must Fall"], ''[[Indybay]]'', July 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf also sold the video to the television broadcast station [[KRON]] the day after the protest. In the process of documenting protest actions, Wolf had recorded a tense scene of a protester being choked by a police officer and another officer threatening passersby with stun guns. The only other recording that was broadcast nearly as much was a still photograph of a bloody police officer who was injured during the protest, not taken by Wolf. Other activists who posted video and photographs to the Bay Area Indymedia website were contacted by the [[FBI]] seeking their original source materials, but it is unknown how many, if any, turned over their recordings to Federal authorities. Wolf's videotape is the only known source material from the protest to have been sought by subpoena after refusal to turn it over.&lt;ref&gt;"On the Media" report, February 16, 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/episodes/2007/02/16/segments/73800 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022250/http://www.onthemedia.org/episodes/2007/02/16/segments/73800 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 3, 2007, Wolf posted the unpublished footage on his blog&lt;ref&gt;Insurgent, [http://www.joshwolf.net/blog/?p=324 "Watch the Unedited Video"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406172741/http://www.joshwolf.net/blog/?p=324 |date=2007-04-06 }}, ''The Revolution Will Be Televised'', April, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; after being assured that he would not have to testify about the footage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Subpoena and arrest==
The [[US District Court]] empaneled a [[grand jury]] to determine whether [[arson]] charges should be brought against some of the protesters on the suspicion that they may have intended to damage a police car by firing a [[bottle rocket]] under it, even though the only official damage reported was a broken tail light. The premise for Federal intervention in a case involving a city police car was that the car was funded in part by Federal dollars. Josh Wolf did not shoot any footage of the car incident. But because he shot other video footage elsewhere during the protest, and the identities of some of the protesters were allegedly known to him, Wolf was targeted by Federal officials. Wolf was [[subpoena]]ed by the court, requiring him to turn over his footage and submit to testifying before the grand jury. Specifically, the FBI subpoenaed him to provide "all documents, writings and recordings related to protest activities conducted in San Francisco" between 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 8 as well any cameras, recording devices, and his computer.

Wolf refused to comply with the subpoena. His case was picked up by the [[National Lawyers Guild]] who asked a federal magistrate in San Francisco to block the grand jury subpoena, arguing that taking such action would have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on other journalists covering future protests. U.S. District Judge [[William Alsup]] rejected this argument and ordered Wolf be jailed on August 1, 2006 for [[contempt of court]] until he complied.

A federal appeals court granted him bail on August 31, 2006 and he was released on September 1, although Wolf again refused to comply with the district court order that he produce the videotape. On September 18, 2006 his bail was revoked and Wolf returned to prison on September 22, 2006. The entire [[en banc]] Court of Appeals refused Wolf's subsequent appeals.

February 7, 2007 marked the 169th day of Wolf's imprisonment, surpassing the time served by Vanessa Leggett, a [[Houston]]-based freelancer who was imprisoned for 168 days in 2001 and 2002 for declining to reveal unpublished material about a murder case. Wolf remained in jail for a total of 226 days, the longest time a U.S. journalist has been held in contempt for refusing to divulge sources or unpublished material.

==Release==
On April 3, 2007, according to Wolf's lawyer David Greene, prosecutors dropped their insistence that Wolf testify before a grand jury after he posted the unaired video online. With permission from the prosecution, U.S. District Judge William Alsup signed an order requiring Wolf's release from the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Central legal issues==
There were a number of important legal issues at dispute in this case, including:
* whether journalists can refuse to comply with [[grand jury]] subpoenas, and under what circumstances
* whether Wolf meets the legal definition of a journalist and is entitled to those protections
* whether the Federal government has [[standing (law)|standing]] in this case

Wolf argued that [[first amendment]] protections allow journalists to refuse to comply when a grand jury is not conducted in good faith. Specifically, Wolf believes that the government wants his video tapes to help them identify people who were participating in the protests, not for actual footage of a crime that was committed. He has also argued that the federal prosecutor's claim for standing is tenuous (based on the fact that federal funds helped to pay for a police car that was damaged), and that the case was brought before a federal grand jury in order to avoid California's [[shield law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=4085&amp;catid=&amp;volume_id=254&amp;issue_id=306&amp;volume_num=41&amp;issue_num=42 |title=Contemplating Wolf | author=Sarah Phelan | publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=2007-07-17 | accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no Federal Shield Law at this time.

The Federal prosecutor argued that Wolf does not meet the statutory definition of a journalist (under California law) or a common law journalist's privilege based on the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]. Further, they argued that even if he did, the protections afforded to journalists would not cover his activities in this case because he merely observed the incidents he recorded in a public place. He did not prompt them, nor did he offer anyone anonymity or confidentiality.

District Court Judge Alsup refused to address any of these issues in his written ruling. He simply signed an order written by the Federal prosecutor that ordered Wolf be jailed because it had been established that he was not complying with a grand jury subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/doc1/03513249561&lt;/ref&gt;

In their written ruling, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled against Wolf on all three issues.

Questions of Wolf's legitimacy as a journalist have been answered by support from various journalist groups. For example, on August 23, 2006 (22 days ''after'' Wolf was incarcerated), The [[Society of Professional Journalists]] awarded him their Journalist of the Year "for upholding the principles of a free and independent press."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spj.org/ldf-a.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  The SPJ described Wolf as "...a California blogger and freelance journalist..."  Josh Wolf was the only journalist jailed for his professional activities in the [[United States]] in 2006, according to [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpj.org/attacks06/pages06/imprison_06.html#usa&lt;/ref&gt; (this organization is a member of [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]]). Support in the journalistic community is not uniform, however. On February 28, 2007, syndicated columnist [[Debra Saunders]] attacked the credibility of Wolf's arguments, namely the lack of an expectation of privacy of those he was filming.

In a televised interview on February 9, 2007, Wolf and his attorney, [[Martin Garbus]], responded to the question of the legitimacy of federal involvement, by claiming that the legal efforts against Wolf were part of a broader attempt by the government to learn the identity of people within the video who are critical of the Bush administration and to suppress American journalism at large.

Wolf stated during his portion of the interview via phone from prison that he has offered to allow the judge to review "[[in camera]]" the raw footage to determine if there's any applicable evidence within the video and the U.S. Attorney's office refused the offer based on a legal technicality. Wolf also said that the raw video does not offer any more applicable evidence of the arson or assault charges.

The U.S. Attorney's office declined to participate in the interview but a spokesperson sent a statement saying they were obligated to gather evidence and that six separate judges have "... ruled that this office has issued a lawful subpoena for legitimate investigative purposes ...".

The Rise Up Network Legal Fund held a benefit to help free Josh Wolf and the media in general on September 21, 2006. Featured speakers included [[Ross Mirkarimi]], [[Chris Daly]], and [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]].

After Josh Wolf took a job as a general assignment reporter at the Palo Alto Daily Post in 2008, he had some choice words for critics who have questioned his claim of being a journalist.

"If the haters who said I wasn't a real journalist, are still lurking," Wolf wrote on his blog, "I hope you don't have too much indigestion after eating your words.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-20/news/17124347_1_video-blogger-police-officer-stories | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Video blogger Wolf now a real journalist | first=Justin | last=Berton | date=August 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candidacy for mayor==

On July 4, 2007, Wolf announced his candidacy for the office of Mayor of San Francisco, against incumbent [[Gavin Newsom]]. Promising an "open and transparent government", Wolf stated he would wear a video camera everywhere he does his mayoral business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cbs5.com/localwire/localfsnews/bcn/2007/07/05/n/HeadlineNews/MAYOR-WOLF/resources_bcn_html | title=SF: FORMERLY JAILED JOURNALIST JOSH WOLF TO RUN FOR MAYOR | publisher=Bay City News Wire | date=2007-07-05 | accessdate=2007-07-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023737/http://cbs5.com/localwire/localfsnews/bcn/2007/07/05/n/HeadlineNews/MAYOR-WOLF/resources_bcn_html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshwolf.net/blog/?p=350 |title=I'm running for mayor |author=Josh Wolf |work=The Revolution Will Be Televised |publisher=joshwolf.net |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824002314/http://joshwolf.net/blog/?p=350 |archivedate=2007-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also discussed homelessness, crime, transportation, public works, gay marriage, medical marijuana and other issues.

Wolf finished in 8th place with 1.24% of votes cast.

==International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS)==
Following the second World War ''([[World War II]])'', UNESCO adopted the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]] (1954) creating rules to protect cultural goods during armed conflicts. This Convention was the first international treaty aimed at protecting [[Cultural heritage]] in the context of war and which highlighted the concept of [[Common heritage]]. The International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS) is stated in the protocol of the Hague Convention and was created as the equivalent for Heritage of what the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) represents for Humanitarian actions. ICBS incorporates museums and archives, audiovisual supports, libraries, and monuments and sites. It brings together the knowledge, experience and international networks of the following non-governmental organisations dealing with cultural heritage: ICA, [[International Council on Archives]], ICOM, International Council of Museums, IFLA, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]], ICOMOS, [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and CCAAA, Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations.
Julien Anfruns was President of the International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS) between 2009 and 2013.

However, {{fb|GER}} (since 1949 officially [[Federal Republic of Germany]]) is since 1904 represented by the same governing body ([[German Football Association|Deutscher Fußball-Bund]], DFB), and FIFA officially attributes all international results of the DFB team since 1908 to Germany, including the results of 1954–1990, when the team was often called West Germany. Thus, the 1954 participation is counted as the third appearance of the team, as Germany had previously appeared in the 1934 and 1938 World Cups.}}&lt;!-- Please stop listing "West Germany" (FRG) in 1954, as that team is considered to be the same team as (and was controlled by the same governing body as) the "Germany" team which had already participated in 1934 and 1938. Per FIFA and UEFA statistics, the records of the pre-war "Germany" team were inherited by "West Germany" ("Germany FR") and then by the reunified "Germany". On the other hand, "Croatia" was a new team in 1998 as the records of "SFR Yugoslavia" were inherited by "FR Yugoslavia", then by "Serbia and Montenegro", and then by "Serbia". That's statistical convention of FIFA and UEFA which is widely applied on Wikipedia and elsewhere. Refer to the article [[List of men's national association football teams]] and more specifically the "Former national football teams" and "New names" sections thereof. --&gt;

'''Agenda''' is a [[DOS]]-based [[personal information manager]], designed by [[Mitch Kapor]], [[Ed Belove]] and [[Jerry Kaplan]], and marketed by [[Lotus Software]].

Lotus Agenda is a "free-form" information manager:  the information need not be structured at all before it is entered into the database.  A phrase such as "See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm" can be entered as is without any pre-processing.

Its distinguishing feature was the ability to allow users to input data before the creation of database tables, giving the program flexibility to accommodate the myriad pieces of information a person may need to keep track of.

The program was an attempt to create a "spreadsheet" for words.  The computing industry was at first quite taken by its audacious goal and the power it brought to users as they were given a tool that allowed them to structure "real life" information in any way they wished.

Its flexibility proved to be its weakness.  New users confronted with so much flexibility were often overpowered by the steep learning curve required to use the program.  Attempts to overcome this through packaging pre-built databases with the program were insufficient to lift sales to adequate levels.  In the end only several hundred thousand copies were sold.

The program reached version 2.0b.  Instead of [[porting]] Agenda to Windows, Lotus stopped development on this program and introduced a new PIM, [[Lotus Organizer]], that uses the paper-based organizer metaphor, in its place.

==The program==
The following jargon is used to describe Agenda's concepts:

An "Item" is a piece of free-form text

A "Category" is a way of organizing information and was the original '''[[virtual folder|smart folder]]''' concept used by Microsoft Outlook 2003 and by the [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] utility in [[Mac OS X v10.4]].  Items can be automatically or manually assigned (linked) to one or more Categories.

Categories can be organized hierarchically and viewed as a tree network.  "Parent" categories could inherit assignments from "child" categories. Agenda performs automatic categorization after it learns your associations. For example, if you link Project A to Mary, then every time you enter an item about Project A, the item is automatically assigned to Mary.

The information is presented in "views": in effect spreadsheet-like grids with items forming the rows and categories forming the columns. Users can create as many views as they like, selecting columns to include and how to sort the items. For example, you can create a People view that displays items sorted by the people to whom they are assigned and columns such as Project Name, Status and Due Date.

"Conditions" and "actions" allow users to set up assignment rules.

Once an item is entered, the program can interpret the text to assign it to various categories.  In every database a "When" category is included automatically so that if a date is embedded within the text, it is interpreted and an assignment is made.  For example, the item "See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm" is automatically assigned to the following Tuesday at 3pm.  If a category "Wendy" had also been created then an assignment could also have been made as well. You create a Wendy category by adding a Column called People and typing Wendy as a column entry. Then any time you type Wendy in any item, that item is also assigned to the Wendy category without your needing to make the assignment in a people column (and even if the view in which you enter the new item about Wendy does not include a People column).

This gives the user a quick ability to find every item that has an association to Wendy.

The program can be used for:

*  Time management
*  Project management
*  Research and information sifting
*  General purpose database
*  Accounting
*  Problem solving
*  Legal practice management
*  Managing legal litigation cases

==Technical description==
Agenda has some novel technical features.  Most notably, database views support item addition and modification, which means that Agenda must infer item attributes from the view.  For example, if a view contains the category ''Home,'' and the user creates an item "paint bathroom" in this view, then Agenda attaches the ''Home'' attribute to the item.  In some cases, assignment cannot be exactly determined and Agenda uses a set of heuristics to make reasonable assignment choices.

Agenda's designers described these core concepts in a 1990 CACM paper

==Current status==
The program has been released as freeware.  It can be downloaded from the links below.

Lotus Agenda can still be used on Windows 3.x/9x/ME/2000/XP computers and there are still many active users around the world (see the Pimlist email list on Yahoo groups).

It suffers from:
* Only handling textual information
* A lack of file compatibility with office applications and information from the Internet means that information must be transferred manually between them.
* The program cannot print directly to USB printers.

==Revival attempts==
* [[Beeswax (PIM)|Beeswax]] is free software "inspired by Lotus Agenda", allowing the similar functionality, and retaining a text-only interface. The last release was in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=beeswax |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/beeswax/files/ |website=Sourceforge |accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chandler (PIM)|Chandler]] was an ambitious fully-graphic project inspired by Agenda. Although Mitch Kapor was involved in the vision, management and funding, it ultimately foundered. It is free software, released under the GNU General Public License. The last release was in 2009.

The '''Prado Museum''' ({{Lang-es|Museo del Prado}}; {{IPA-es|muˈseo ðel ˈpɾaðo}}) is the main Spanish national [[art museum]], located in central [[Madrid]]. It is widely considered to have one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and the single best collection of [[Spanish art]]. Founded as a museum of [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]] in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and it is considered one of the greatest art museums in the world. The numerous works by [[Francisco Goya]], the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[El Greco]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Titian]], and [[Diego Velázquez]], are some of the highlights of the collection.

The collection currently comprises around 8,200 drawings, 7,600 paintings, 4,800 prints, and 1,000 sculptures, in addition to a large number of other works of art and historic documents. As of 2012, the museum displayed about 1,300 works in the main buildings, while around 3,100 works were on temporary loan to various museums and official institutions. The remainder were in storage.&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web| title=The Collection: origins| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/origins/| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012}}See also ''Museo del Prado, Catálogo de las pinturas'', 1996,  Ministerio de Educación y Cultura, Madrid, No ISBN, which lists about 7,800 paintings.  Many works have been passed to the Museo Reina Sofia and other museums over the years; others are on loan or in storage. On the new displays, see [http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-museo-prado-reordena-agranda-20090302171352.html El Prado se reordena y agranda. europapress.es here (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum received 2.8 million visitors in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/05/29/actualidad/1369838939_714010.html "El Prado perderá un cuarto de sus visitantes"] ''[[El País]]''. Retrieved 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums in Spain.

The best-known work on display at the museum is ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by Velázquez. Velázquez and his keen eye and sensibility were also responsible for bringing much of the museum's fine collection of Italian masters to Spain, now the largest outside Italy.

The museum is planning a 16% extension in the nearby [[Salón de Reinos]], to be opened in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/prado-hall-of-realms-architecture-competition-454448|title=Prado Hall of Realms Redesign Competition - artnet News|author=|date=21 March 2016|website=artnet.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building that is now the home of the Museo Nacional del Prado was designed in 1785 by architect of the [[Enlightenment in Spain]]  [[Juan de Villanueva]] on the orders of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] to house the Natural History Cabinet. Nonetheless, the building's final function was not decided until the monarch's grandson, [[Ferdinand VII]], encouraged by his wife, Queen [[Maria Isabel of Portugal|María Isabel de Braganza]], decided to use it as a new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures. The Royal Museum, which would soon become known as the National Museum of Painting and Sculpture, and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado, opened to the public for the first time in November 1819. It was created with the double aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown and to demonstrate to the rest of Europe that Spanish art was of equal merit to any other national school.

[[File:Grand hall d'exposition au Musée du Prado.JPG|thumb|left|320px|In the main exhibition hall, first floor]]
The first catalogue of the Museum, published in 1819 and solely devoted to Spanish painting, included 311 paintings, although at that time the Museum housed 1,510 from the various royal residences, the Reales Sitios, including works from other schools. The exceptionally important royal collection, which forms the nucleus of the present-day Museo del Prado, started to increase significantly in the 16th century during the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and continued under the succeeding Habsburg and Bourbon monarchs. Their efforts and determination led to the Royal Collection being enriched by some of the masterpieces now to be seen in the Prado. These include ''The Descent from the Cross'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' by Hieronymous Bosch, ''Knight with his Hand on his Breast'' by [[El Greco]], ''The Death of the Virgin'' by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], ''The Holy Family'', known as "La Perla", by [[Raphael]], ''Charles V at Mülhberg'' by [[Titian]], ''Christ Washing the Disciples’ Feet'' by [[Tintoretto]], [[Dürer]]'s ''Self-portrait'', ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by Velázquez, ''[[The Three Graces (Rubens)|The Three Graces]]'' by Rubens, and ''[[The Family of Charles IV]]'' by Goya.

  }}

In addition to works from the Spanish royal collection, other holdings increased and enriched the Museum with further masterpieces, such as the two Majas by Goya. Among the now closed museums whose collections have been added to that of the Prado were the Museo de la Trinidad in 1872, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1971. In addition, numerous legacies, donations and purchases have been of crucial importance for the growth of the collection. Various works entered the Prado from the Museo de la Trinidad, including ''The Fountain of Grace'' by the School of Van Eyck, the Santo Domingo and San Pedro Martír altarpieces painted for the monastery of Santo Tomás in Ávila by [[Pedro Berruguete]], and the five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio de doña María de Aragón. Most of the Museum's 19th-century paintings come from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the Madrazos, [[José de Madrazo y Agudo]] and [[Federico de Madrazo]], [[Vicente López Portaña|Vicente López]], [[Carlos de Haes]], [[Eduardo Rosales]] and [[Sorolla]].

Upon the deposition of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] in 1868, the museum was nationalized and acquired the new name of "Museo del Prado". The building housed the royal collection of arts, and it rapidly proved too small. The first enlargement to the museum took place in 1918. Since the creation of the Museo del Prado more than 2,300 paintings have been incorporated into its collection, as well as a large number of sculptures, prints, drawings and works of art through bequests, donations and purchases, which account for most of the New Acquisitions. Numerous bequests have enriched the Museum's holdings, such as the outstanding collection of medals left to the Museum by Pablo Bosch; the drawings and items of decorative art left by Pedro Fernández Durán as well as [[Van der Weyden]]'s masterpiece, ''The Virgin and Child''; and the Ramón de Errazu bequest of 19th-century paintings. Particularly important donations include Barón Emile d'Erlanger's gift of Goya's Black Paintings in 1881. Among the numerous works that have entered the collection through purchase are some outstanding ones acquired in recent years including two works by El Greco, ''The Fable'' and ''The Flight into Egypt'' acquired in 1993 and 2001, Goya's ''[[Countess of Chinchón]]'' bought in 2000, Velázquez's portrait of ''The Pope's Barber'', acquired in 2003 and Fra Angelico's ''Madonna of the Pomegranate'' purchased in 2016.

Between 1873 and 1900, the Prado helped decorate city halls, new universities, and churches. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] from 1931 to 1936, the focus was on building up provincial museums. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], upon the recommendation of the [[League of Nations]], the museum staff removed 353 paintings, 168 drawings and the Dauphin's Treasure and sent the art to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], then later to [[Girona]], and finally to [[Geneva]]. The art had to be returned across French territory in night trains to the museum upon the commencement of World War II. During the early years of the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], many paintings were sent to embassies.&lt;ref name="riding"&gt;{{cite news| author=Alan Riding| date=1 August 1990| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/arts/the-prado-finds-out-what-it-has-and-where.html| title=The Prado Finds Out What It Has and Where| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Velázquez en El Prado.JPG|left|thumb|150px|A main promenade entrance is dominated by this 1899 bronze statue of [[Diego Velázquez]], by Aniceto Marinas]]
The main building was enlarged with short pavilions in the rear between 1900 and 1960. The next enlargement was the incorporation of two buildings (nearby but not adjacent) into the institutional structure of the museum: the [[Casón del Buen Retiro]], which is equipped to display up to 400 paintings and  which housed the bulk of the 20th-century art from 1971 to 1997, and the [[Salón de Reinos]] (Throne building), formerly the Army Museum.

In 1993, an extension proposed by the Prado's director at the time, Felipe Garin, was quickly abandoned after a wave of criticism.&lt;ref name="expand"&gt;{{cite news| author=Alan Riding| date=1 May 1995| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/01/arts/the-prado-embarks-on-plans-to-expand-into-a-complex.html| title=The Prado Embarks On Plans to Expand Into a Complex| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, a $14 million roof work forced the Velázquez masterpiece ''Las Meninas'' to change galleries twice.&lt;ref name="goodman"&gt;{{cite news| author=Al Goodman| date=19 November 1998| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/19/arts/arts-abroad-at-long-last-expanding-spain-s-treasure-chest.html| title=At Long Last, Expanding Spain's Treasure Chest| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Prado annex in the nearby Casón del Buen Retiro closed for a $10 million two-year overhaul that included three new underground levels. In 2007, the museum finally executed [[Rafael Moneo]]'s project to expand its exposition room to 16,000 square meters, hoping to increase the yearly number of visitors from 1.8 million to 2.5 million.

A glass-roofed and wedge-shaped foyer now contains the museum's shops and cafeteria, removing them from the main building to make more room for galleries.&lt;ref name="goodman"/&gt; The 16th-century Cloister of Jerónimo has been removed stone by stone to make foundations for increased stability of surrounding buildings and will be re-assembled in the new museum's extension. Hydraulic jacks had to be used to prevent the basement walls from falling during construction.

In November 2016, it was announced that British architect [[Norman Foster]], in a joint project with Carlos Rubio Carvajal, is to renovate the Hall of Realms, which once formed part of the Buen Retiro palace and transform it into a $32 million extension of the Prado. The museum announced the selection of Foster and Rubio after a jury reviewed the proposals of the eight competition finalists – including [[David Chipperfield]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]] –,&lt;ref&gt;Hannah McGivern (November 25, 2016), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/norman-foster-to-design-prado-extension-in-historic-palace-/ Norman Foster to design Prado extension in historic palace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127024204/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/norman-foster-to-design-prado-extension-in-historic-palace-/ |date=27 November 2016 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who had already been shortlisted from an initial list of 47 international teams of architects.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Raphael Minder (November 25, 2016), [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/arts/design/norman-foster-to-remodel-palace-for-prado-extension.html Norman Foster to Remodel Palace for Prado Extension] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was acquired by the Prado in 2015, after having served as an army museum until 2005. The project is designed to give the Prado about 61,500 square feet of additional available space, of which about 27,000 square feet will be used to exhibit works.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Historic structure==
[[File:Museo del Prado (Madrid) 19.jpg|thumb|The Goya Gate in the north façade of the museum.]]

The Museo del Prado is one of the buildings constructed during the reign of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (Carlos III) as part of a grandiose building scheme designed to bestow upon [[Madrid]] a monumental urban space. The building that lodges the Museum of the Prado was initially conceived by [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|José Moñino y Redondo, count of Floridablanca]] and was commissioned in 1785 by Charles III for the ''reurbanización'' of the Paseo del Prado. To this end, Charles III called on one of his favorite architects, [[Juan de Villanueva]], author also of the nearby Botanical Garden and the City Hall of Madrid.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/index.php?id=904| title=Chronology of Museo del Prado, 1785| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''prado'' ("meadow") that was where the museum now stands gave its name to the area, the Salón del Prado (later [[Paseo del Prado]]), and to the museum itself upon [[nationalisation]]. Work on the building stopped at the conclusion of Charles III's reign and throughout the [[Peninsular War]] and was only initiated again during the reign of Charles III's grandson, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. The premises had been used as headquarters for the [[cavalry]] and a [[gunpowder]]-store for the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic troops based in Madrid during the war.

==Special exhibitions==
Between 8 November 2011 and 25 March 2012, a group of 179 works of art were brought to the Museo del Prado from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="hermitage"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/exhibitions/exhibitions/at-the-museum/tesoros-del-hermitage/| title=The Hermitage in the Prado| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable works included:
* ''[[:File:Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn - A Scholar.JPG|A Scholar]]'' (1631), by [[Rembrandt]]
* ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' (c. 1596), by [[Caravaggio]]
* ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' (1647), by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]]
* ''[[Game of Bowls]]'' (1908), by [[Henri Matisse]]
* ''Bouquet of Cornflowers with Stems of Oats in a Vase'' (c. 1900), by [[House of Fabergé]]
* ''[[List of works by Claude Monet|Pond at Montgeron]]'' (1876), by [[Claude Monet]]

* [[:File:Kandinsky - Composition VI (1913).jpg|Composition VI]] (1913), by [[Wassily Kandinsky]]
* ''Metaphysical Still life'' (1918), by [[Giorgio Morandi]]

Conversely, for the first time in its 200-year history, the Museo del Prado has toured an exhibition of its renowned collection of Italian masterpieces at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, from 16 May 2014 until 31 August 2014. Many of the works have never before left Spain.

==Nearby museums==
The Prado, with the nearby [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] and the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía|Museo Reina Sofía]], forms Madrid's [[Golden Triangle of Art]].

Nearby is the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. The [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|Museo Arqueológico]] houses some art of [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] formerly in the collection of the Prado.

The [[Museo Naval de Madrid|Naval Museum]], managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|Ministry of Defence]], is also nearby.

==Management==

===Funding===
Until the early 2000s, the Prado's annual income was approximately $18 million, $15 million of which came from the government and the remainder from private contributions, publications, and admissions.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite news| author=[[Michael Kimmelman]]| date=21 November 1993| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/arts/art-view-new-brooms-sweep-madrid-s-museums.html| title=New Brooms Sweep Madrid's Museums| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the conservative government of [[José María Aznar]] decided to change the museum's financing platform, ushering in a public-private partnership. Under its new bylaws, which the [[Cortes Generales]] approved in 2003, the Prado must gradually reduce its level of state support to 50 percent from 80 percent. In exchange, the museum gained control of the budget — now roughly €35 million — and the power to raise money from corporate donations and merchandising. However, its recent €150 million expansion was paid for by the Spanish state.&lt;ref name="fuchs"&gt;{{cite news| author=Dale Fuchs| date=24 December 2004| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-wbspot24_ed3_.html| title=The art of financing the Prado| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Manuel Villaescusa]] bequeathed his fortune of nearly $40 million in Madrid real estate to the Prado, to be used solely for the acquisition of paintings. The museum subsequently sold Villaescusa's buildings to realize income from them. The bequest suddenly made the Prado one of the most formidable bidders for paintings in the world.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt;

===Directors===
The first four directors were drawn from nobility. From 1838 to 1960, the directors were mostly artists. Since then, most of them have been [[art historian]]s.

The '''National Gallery of Art''', and its attached '''Sculpture Garden''', is a national [[art museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], located on the [[National Mall]], between 3rd and 9th Streets, at [[Constitution Avenue]] NW. Open to the public and free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 for the American people by a joint resolution of the [[United States Congress]]. [[Andrew W. Mellon]] donated a substantial art collection and funds for construction. The core collection includes major works of art donated by [[Paul Mellon]], [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]], [[Samuel Henry Kress]], [[Samuel Henry Kress#Biography|Rush Harrison Kress]], [[Peter Arrell Browne Widener]], [[Joseph E. Widener]], and [[Chester Dale]]. The Gallery's collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western Art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Americas and the largest mobile created by [[Alexander Calder]].

The Gallery's campus includes the original neoclassical West Building designed by [[John Russell Pope]], which is linked underground to the modern East Building, designed by [[I. M. Pei]], and the {{convert|6.1|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden|Sculpture Garden]]. The Gallery often presents temporary special exhibitions spanning the world and the history of art. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest museums]] in North America.

==History==

[[File:Gallery15Urlan.ogv|thumb|left|National Gallery of Art]]
[[Pittsburgh]] banker (and [[United States Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] from 1921 until 1932) [[Andrew W. Mellon]] began gathering a private collection of [[old master]] paintings and sculptures during World War I. During the late 1920s, Mellon decided to direct his collecting efforts towards the establishment of a new national gallery for the United States.

In 1930, partly for tax reasons, Mellon formed the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, which was to be the legal owner of works intended for the gallery. In 1930–1931, the Trust made its first major acquisition, [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|21 paintings]] from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St. Petersburg as part of the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], including such masterpieces as [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Alba Madonna]],'' [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'', and [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''.

In 1929 Mellon had initiated contact with the recently appointed Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Charles Greeley Abbot]]. Mellon was appointed in 1931 as a Commissioner of the Institution's National Gallery of Art. When the director of the Gallery retired, Mellon asked Abbot not to appoint a successor, as he proposed to endow a new building with funds for expansion of the collections.

However, Mellon's trial for tax evasion, centering on the Trust and the Hermitage paintings, caused the plan to be modified. In 1935, Mellon announced in ''[[The Washington Star]]'', his intention to establish a new gallery for old masters, separate from the Smithsonian. When asked by Abbot, he explained that the project was in the hands of the Trust and that its decisions were partly dependent on "the attitude of the Government towards the gift".

In January 1937, Mellon formally offered to create the new Gallery.  On his birthday, 24 March 1937, an Act of Congress accepted the collection and building funds (provided through the Trust), and approved the construction of a museum on the National Mall.

The new gallery was to be effectively self-governing, not controlled by the Smithsonian, but took the old name "National Gallery of Art" while the Smithsonian's gallery would be renamed the "National Collection of Fine Arts" (now the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fink, Lois Marie "A History of the Smithsonian American Art Museum", [[University of Massachusetts Press]] (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-55849-616-3}}, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm National Gallery of Art website: general introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208014849/http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm |date=December 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/ngachron.shtm National Gallery of Art website: chronology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407175119/http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/ngachron.shtm |date=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by architect [[John Russell Pope]], the new structure was completed and accepted by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on behalf of the American people on March 17, 1941. Neither Mellon nor Pope lived to see the museum completed; both died in late August 1937, only two months after excavation had begun. At the time of its inception it was the largest marble structure in the world. The museum stands on the former site of the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] station, where in 1881 a disgruntled office seeker, [[Charles Guiteau]], shot President [[James Garfield]] (see [[James A. Garfield assassination]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.american-architecture.info/USA/USA-Washington/DC-010.htm| title=National Gallery of Art, West Building| publisher=American Architecture| accessdate=2 October 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006024153/http://www.american-architecture.info/USA/USA-Washington/DC-010.htm| archivedate=6 October 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As anticipated by Mellon, the creation of the National Gallery encouraged the donation of other substantial art collections by a number of private donors. Founding benefactors included such individuals as [[Paul Mellon]], [[Samuel H. Kress]], [[Samuel Henry Kress#Biography|Rush H. Kress]], [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], [[Chester Dale]], [[Joseph Widener]], [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]] and [[Edgar Garbisch|Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch]].

The Gallery's East Building was constructed in the 1970s on much of the remaining land left over from the original congressional action. Andrew Mellon's children, [[Paul Mellon]] and [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce]], funded the building. Designed by architect I. M. Pei, the contemporary structure was completed in 1978 and was opened on June 1 of that year by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The new building was built to house the Museum's collection of modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints, as well as study and research centers and offices. The design received a National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1981.

The final addition to the complex is the [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden]]. Completed and opened to the public on May 23, 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting a number of pieces from the Museum's contemporary sculpture collection.

[[File:National Gallery of Art Logo.gif|right|framed|thumb|left|National Gallery of Art logo.]]
The National Gallery of Art is supported through a private-public partnership. The United States federal government provides funds, through annual appropriations, to support the museum's operations and maintenance. All artwork, as well as special programs, are provided through private donations and funds. The museum is not part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Noted directors of the National Gallery have included [[David E. Finley, Jr.]] (1938-1956), [[John Walker (curator)|John Walker]] (1956–1968), and [[J. Carter Brown]] (1968–1993). [[Earl A. Powell III|Earl A. "Rusty" Powell III]] (since 1993) is the current director.

Entry to both buildings of the National Gallery of Art is free of charge. From Monday through Saturday, the museum is open from 10 a.m. &amp;ndash; 5 p.m.; it is open from 11 &amp;ndash; 6 p.m. on Sundays. It is closed on December 25 and January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/visit/maps-and-information.html|title = National Gallery of Art|date = 2016-01-12|access-date = |website = Maps and Hours|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160103005918/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/visit/maps-and-information.html|archivedate = 2016-01-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum comprises two buildings: the West Building (1941) and the East Building (1978) linked by an underground passage. The West Building, composed of [[Tennessee marble|pink Tennessee marble]], was designed in 1937 by architect [[John Russell Pope]] in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style (as is Pope's other notable Washington, D.C. building, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]). Designed in the form of an elongated H, the building is centered on a domed rotunda modeled on the interior of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. Extending east and west from the rotunda, a pair of skylit sculpture halls provide its main circulation spine. Bright garden courts provide a counterpoint to the long main axis of the building.
[[File:Dome of East building.jpg|thumb|271x271px|Dome of West Building, an entrance to permanent Renaissance Art collections]]
The West Building has an extensive collection of paintings and sculptures by European masters from the [[Medieval art|medieval period]] through the late 19th century, as well as pre-20th century works by American artists. Highlights of the collection include many paintings by [[Jan Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In contrast, the design of the East Building by architect [[I. M. Pei]] is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one isosceles and the other a smaller right triangle. The space defined by the isosceles triangle came to house the museum's public functions. The portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center. The triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.

The building's central feature is a high atrium designed as an open interior court that is enclosed by a sculptural space spanning {{convert|16000|sqft|m2}}. The atrium is centered on the same axis that forms the circulation spine for the West Building and is constructed in the same Tennessee marble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/onlinetours/archtours.shtm#east NGA.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003215403/http://www.nga.gov/onlinetours/archtours.shtm#east |date=October 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2005 the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk that panels might fall onto visitors below.  In 2008, NGA officials decided that it had become necessary to remove and reinstall all of the panels.  The renovation was completed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=December 8, 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311002118/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | archivedate=March 11, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Building focuses on [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], with a collection including works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Alexander Calder]], a 1977 mural by [[Robert Motherwell]] and works by many other artists. The East Building also contains the main offices of the NGA and a large research facility, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA). Among the highlights of the East Building in 2012 was an exhibition of [[Barnett Newman]]'s ''The Stations of the Cross'' series of 14 black and white paintings (1958–66).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In The Tower: Barnett Newman|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2012/newman.html|website=www.nga.gov|accessdate=22 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201023351/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2012/newman.html|archivedate=1 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman painted them after he had recovered from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; they are usually regarded as the peak of his achievement.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://forward.com/articles/159912/his-cross-to-bear/?p=all| title= His Cross To Bear.

The two buildings are connected by a walkway beneath 4th street, called "the Concourse" on the museum's map. In 2008, the National Gallery of Art commissioned American artist [[Leo Villareal]] to transform the Concourse into an artistic installation. Today, ''Multiverse'' is the largest and most complex light sculpture by Villareal featuring approximately 41,000 computer-programmed LED nodes that run through channels along the entire {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}}-long space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.142055.html|title=Leo Villareal: Multiverse|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nga.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concourse also includes the food court and a gift shop.

The final element of the National Gallery of Art complex, the Sculpture Garden was completed in 1999 after more than 30 years of planning. To the west of the West Building, on the opposite side of [[7th Street (Washington, D.C.)|Seventh Street]], the {{convert|6.1|acres|1|abbr=on}} Sculpture Garden was designed by landscape architect [[Laurie Olin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Gallery|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/about.html|website=www.nga.gov|accessdate=22 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922015956/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/about.html|archivedate=22 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an outdoor gallery for monumental modern sculpture.

The Sculpture Garden contains plantings of Native American species of canopy and flowering trees, shrubs, ground covers, and perennials. A circular reflecting pool and fountain form the center of its design, which arching pathways of granite and crushed stone complement. (The pool becomes an ice-skating rink during the winter.) The sculptures exhibited in the surrounding landscaped area include pieces by [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Mark Di Suvero]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Roxy Paine]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Hector Guimard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit: Sculpture Garden|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/visit/maps-and-information/sculpture-garden.html|website=www.nga.gov|accessdate=22 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926002206/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/visit/maps-and-information/sculpture-garden.html|archivedate=26 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovations===
The NGA's West Building was renovated from 2007 to 2009. Although some galleries closed for periods of time, others remained open.&lt;ref name="BoyleParker"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/national-gallery-of-art-announces-30-million-renovation-to-east-building/2013/03/12/2e3c7e46-8b5c-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html Boyle, Katherine and Parker, Lonnae O'Neal. "National Gallery of Art Announces $30 Million Renovation to East Building." ''Washington Post.'' March 12, 2013.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421200709/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/national-gallery-of-art-announces-30-million-renovation-to-east-building/2013/03/12/2e3c7e46-8b5c-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html |date=April 21, 2016 }} Accessed 2013-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After congressional testimony that the East Building suffered from "systematic structural failures", NGA adopted a Master Renovations Plan in 1999. This plan established the timeline for closing the building, and planned for the renovation of the electronic security systems, elevators, and [[HVAC]].&lt;ref name="BoyleLongClosing" /&gt; Space between the ceilings of existing galleries and the building's skylights (which was never completed when the building was constructed in 1978)&lt;ref name="BoyleLongClosing" /&gt; would be renovated into two, {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=on}} high, hexagonal Tower Galleries. The galleries would have a combined {{convert|12260|sqft|m2}} of space and will be lit by [[Daylighting|skylights]]. A rooftop sculpture garden would also be added. NGA officials said that the Tower Galleries would probably house modern art, and the creation of a distinct "[[Mark Rothko|Rothko]] Room" was possible.

Beginning in 2011, NGA undertook an $85 million restoration of the East Building's façade.&lt;ref name="KellyShed"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/why-national-gallerys-east-building-shed-its-pink-marble-skin/2012/02/21/gIQA5fU5RR_story.html Kelly, John. "Why National Gallery's East Building Shed Its Pink Marble Skin." ''Washington Post.'' February 21, 2012.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106040052/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/why-national-gallerys-east-building-shed-its-pink-marble-skin/2012/02/21/gIQA5fU5RR_story.html |date=January 6, 2018 }} Accessed 2013-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The East Building is clad in {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} thick pink marble panels. The panels are held about {{convert|2|in|cm}} away from the wall by [[stainless steel]] anchors. Gravity holds the panel in the bottom anchors (which are placed at each corner), while "button head" anchors (stainless steel posts with large, flat heads) at the top corners keep the panel upright. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was used on the gravity anchors to level the stones. Joints of flexible colored [[neoprene]] were placed between the panels. This system was designed to allow each panel to hang independent of its neighbors, and NGA officials say they are not aware of any other panel system like it.

However, many panels were accidentally mortared together. Seasonal heating and cooling of the façade, infiltration of moisture, and shrinkage of the building's structural concrete by {{convert|2|in|cm}} over time caused extensive damage to the façade. In 2005, regular maintenance showed that some panels were cracked or significantly damaged, while others leaned by more than {{convert|1|in|cm}} out from the building (threatening to fall).

The NGA hired the [[structural engineering]] firm Robert Silman Associates to determine the cause of the problem.&lt;ref name="DietschFacelift"&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2012/02/03/national-gallery-of-arts-famed-east.html?page=all Dietsch, Deborah K.

[[Anodizing|Anodized]] aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved to the center of the top edge of each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored [[silicone]] gaskets installed, and leveling screws rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011,&lt;ref name="DietschFacelift" /&gt; and originally was scheduled to end in 2014.&lt;ref name="KellyShed" /&gt; By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the façade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014.&lt;ref name="DietschFacelift" /&gt; The East Building remained open throughout the project.&lt;ref name="BoyleParker" /&gt;

In March 2013, the National Gallery of Art announced a $68.4 million renovation to the East Building. This included $38.4 million to refurbish the interior mechanical plant of the structure,&lt;ref name="BoyleLongClosing"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/national-gallery-sees-long-term-benefit-in-long-closing-of-east-building/2013/03/13/1bef612e-8c1d-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html Boyle, Katherine.

The structure remained closed for three years. The architectural firm of Hartman-Cox oversaw both aspects of the renovation.&lt;ref name="BoyleLongClosing" /&gt;

A group of benefactors — which included Victoria and Roger Sant, [[Mitchell Rales|Mitchell and Emily Rales]], and [[David Rubenstein]] — privately financed the renovation.  The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reported that the donation was one of the largest the NGA had received in a decade.&lt;ref name="BoyleParker" /&gt; NGA staff said that they would use the closure to conserve artwork, plan purchases, and develop exhibitions. Plans for renovating conservation, construction, exhibition prep, groundskeeping, office, storage, and other internal facilities were also ready, but would not be implemented for many years.&lt;ref name="BoyleLongClosing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traditional-building.com/clem_labine/?p=953|title=The CIVITAS Chronicles|work=traditional-building.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323132013/http://traditional-building.com/clem_labine/?p=953|archivedate=2015-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Concert A22894.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Gerard van Honthorst]]'s monumental masterwork, ''The Concert'', was acquired by the NGA in 2013 and went on display for the first time in 218 years.]]
The NGA's collection galleries and Sculpture Garden display European and American paintings, sculpture, works on paper, photographs, and decorative arts. The permanent collection of paintings extends from the [[Middle Ages]] to the present day. The [[Italian Renaissance]] collection includes two panels from [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maesta]]'', the [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' by [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Filippo Lippi]], a [[Botticelli]] work on the same subject, [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Allendale Nativity]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''[[The Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|The Feast of the Gods]]'', ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' (the only painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Americas) and groups of works by [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]].

Other European collections include examples of the work of many of the masters of western painting, including a version of ''[[Saint Martin and the Beggar (El Greco)|Saint Martin and the Beggar]],'' by [[El Greco]], and works by [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Cranach the Elder]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and [[Eugène Delacroix]], among others. The collection of sculpture and decorative arts includes such works as the ''Chalice'' of [[Abbot Suger]] of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]] and a collection of work by [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas]]. Other highlights of the permanent collection include the second of the two original sets of [[Thomas Cole]]'s series of paintings titled ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'', (the first set is at the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in [[Utica, New York]]) and the original version of ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley]] (two other versions are in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]).

The National Gallery's print collection comprises 75,000 prints, in addition to rare illustrated books. It includes collections of works by [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], [[William Blake]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Jasper Johns]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. The collection began with 400 prints donated by five collectors in 1941. In 1942, [[Joseph E. Widener]] donated his entire collection of nearly 2,000 works. In 1943, [[Lessing Rosenwald]] donated his collection of 8,000 old master and modern prints; between 1943 and 1979, he donated almost 14,000 more works. In 2008, Dave and [[Reba White Williams]] donated their collection of more than 5,200 American prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/prints.html|title=Prints|last=|first=|date=2013-06-19|website=|publisher=Nga.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221210959/http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/prints.html|archivedate=2013-12-21|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nyabinghi''' is the oldest of the [[Mansions of Rastafari]]. These Rastafari are the strictest out of the six or so major groups. They pledge "love to all human beings", and do not believe in violence, because they believe that only [[Jah]] has the right to destroy. They make this pledge because of the power of words, believing that only when all of Jah's children make the pledge together, the oppressors will be destroyed. In addition, they are often [[non-violent]] or follow the [[just war theory]].

== Name ==
Nyabinghi was a legendary Ugandan/Rwandan tribe queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/warriors.html|title = Jamaica|date = |accessdate = 8 January 2016|website = Suppressed Histories|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was said to have possessed a Ugandan woman named [[Muhumusa]] in the 19th century. Muhumusa inspired a movement, rebelling against African colonial authorities.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Although she was captured in 1913, alleged possessions by Nyabinghi continued (mostly afflicting women).
Bloodline of the true Nyabinghi warriors rightfully settled in the heart of Dzimba dze Mabwe now known as [[Zimbabwe]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

== Music ==
The Nyabinghi resistance inspired a number of Jamaican [[Rastafari movement|Rastas]], who incorporated what are known as [[Nyabinghi chants]] (''binghi'') into their celebrations ([[grounation]]s).{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The [[Nyabinghi rhythm|rhythm]]s of these chants were an influence on popular [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] music. Three kinds of [[Nyabinghi drums|drums]] are used in Nyabinghi music: [[bass drum|bass]], ''[[funde]]'' and ''keteh''. The ''keteh'' plays an [[improvisation|improvised]] [[syncopation]] rooted in [[Asante people|Ashanti]] dance and drumming,&lt;ref&gt;Asante Ivory Trumpet Music in Ghana: Culture Tradition and Sound Barrage By Joseph S. Kaminski&lt;/ref&gt; the ''funde'' plays a regular one-two beat and the bass drum strikes loudly on the first beat, and softly on the third (of fourth) beat. [[Count Ossie]] was the first to record nyabinghi and helped to establish and maintain Rasta culture.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

A '''penal bond''' is a written instrument executed between an obligor and an obligee designed to secure the performance of a legal obligation through the ''[[in terrorem]]'' effect of the threat of a penalty for nonperformance.

== Types of Bonds ==

At its simplest, a [[bond (finance)|bond]] need only state who is to be paid, what sum, when, and where (for example: "'Know all men etc. that I, ''AB'', am firmly bound to ''CD'' in [$]''n'' to be paid at Michaelmas next following'").&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History, 323 (4th ed. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; At [[common law]], these bonds were nearly impossible to contest from the perspective of the obligor (the debtor).&lt;ref&gt;Edith G. Henderson, "Relief from Bonds in the English Chancery: Mid-Sixteenth Century," 18 Am. J. Legal Hist. 298, 300 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; A simple bond can properly be considered a penal bond if it calls for the payment of a sum that is punitive in relation to the damages that would be caused by nonperformance.

Historically, the most significant type of penal bond was the penal bond with conditional defeasance. A penal bond with conditional defeasance combined in one document the bond (the promise to pay a specified amount of money) with the contractual obligation. It did this in what the historian [[A.W.B. Simpson|Brian Simpson]] called a ‘topsy-turvy’ fashion by printing the bond on the front of the document and the condition, whose performance by the obligor would render the bond void (referred to as the indenture of defeasance), on the back.&lt;ref&gt;Biancalana, Joseph, “The Development of the Penal Bond with Conditional Defeasance,” 26 J. Legal His. 103 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

At early common law, the penal obligations of bonds were enforced through an action of debt which was concerned with that penal obligation rather than the underlying agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, at 324&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the enforcement of bonds in the period preceding the modern simplification of pleading was not concerned with contracts principles at all; rather, the enforcement of bonds was a question of "the law of deeds and conditions." &lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

The penal bond with conditional defeasance (hereinafter referred to as a '''conditional bond''', conditional penal bond, or penal bond) first arose in [[England]] during the 1340s/1350’s.&lt;ref&gt;Biancalana, supra note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The conditional bond has been characterized as the dominant method for “framing substantial contracts in the later medieval and early modern periods.” &lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, during the [[Tudor Period]], actions of debt were the most numerous single class of actions in the Common Pleas rolls (and would continue to be so for the next 300 years).&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History, 324 (4th ed. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an innovation in its structure, the conditional penal bond was not the first English attempt to impose “fixed monetary penalties” for failure to perform on an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Biancalana, supra note 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penalties in English law|Penalty clauses]] inserted into written contracts, a mainstay in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as well as penal bonds with separate indentures of defeasance were commonly used to secure the performance of a contract until well into the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting the acquittance on the reverse of the bond itself, however, had a number of advantages over its competitors:

# It “prevented plaintiff [creditor] from pleading that the conditional acquittance or indenture of defeasance [the language which spelled out the condition upon which the obligation to pay the stated sum on the front of the bond was voided] produced by the defendant was not plaintiff’s deed.”&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Including the condition which made the bond void as part of the same document as the bond prevented the debtor from alleging outlandish conditions in defeasance of the bond.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Compurgation|Compurgators]] were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;
# “Debtors could plead payment without a written acquittance.”&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;
# “[C]reditors could not take advantage of the conditions of defeasance to avoid being repaid purposely to double the debt.”&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Courts were willing “to enforce the penalty to the fullest,” but were sensitive to offsets from payments that had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Penal bonds “could be made anywhere and without prior approval of royal officials.”&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Biancalana has argued that there was no real advantage inherent in a conditional penal bond as against its competitors, and that therefore its later dominance was attributable to custom and trade practice.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Palmer, on the other hand, has argued that “[t]he morality that allowed the extension of penal bonds after the Black Death . . . was part of the governmental concern to preserve traditional society by harshly coercing the upper classes to abide by their obligations.” &lt;ref&gt;Robert Palmer, English Law in the Age of the Black Death, 1348-1381 (1993) at 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of its merits, the conditional bond did overtake other forms of imposing a penalty for nonperformance of an obligation by the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Biancalana, Joseph, “The Development of the Penal Bond with Conditional Defeasance,” 26 J. Legal His. 103 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

At common law, the simple bond “was almost irresistible,” the only defenses available to the debtor being forgery or the production of a sealed acquittance in court.&lt;ref&gt;Edith G. Henderson, “Relief from Bonds in the English Chancery: Mid-Sixteenth Century,” 18 Am. J. Legal Hist. 298, 299-300 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Debtors were not permitted to argue any other defenses including, “payment without taking of a sealed acquittance, payment at another time or place then specified in the bond, failure of consideration, impossibility of performance, or fraud in the underlying transaction.” &lt;ref&gt;Id. at 299&lt;/ref&gt; The debtor who was wrongly made to pay twice, however, could win damages in a writ of trespass for the taking.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Donne v. Cornwall'', Y.B. Pas. 1 Hen VII, fo. 14v, pl. 2 (C.P.), reprinted in Baker and Milsom, Sources of English Legal History, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditional bonds were somewhat easier to contest from the perspective of the obligor. Courts considered performance of the condition a valid defense to the bond.&lt;ref&gt;Edith G. Henderson, “Relief from Bonds in the English Chancery: Mid-Sixteenth Century,” 18 Am. J. Legal Hist. 298, 299-300 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century, the common law began to recognize a range of limited circumstances “in which non-performance of the condition was excused or a variant performance was held a sufficient defense against the bond.”;&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; see, for example, ''Abbot of Cerle’s Case''. Before the mid-sixteenth century, however, substantial performance (unless accepted as sufficient by the obligee), partial payment, and late payment were not accepted defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition Between the Common Law and Chancery Courts ==

The [[common law]] was eventually made to compete with the [[Court of Chancery]], which began to pass upon the enforceability of penal bonds. ''Barrantyne v. Jeckett'' (1553/54) has been cited as the earliest example of the Court of Chancery giving relief from a penal bond,&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the middle of the sixteenth century, “Chancery was already intervening against penal bonds quite frequently” (34 cases being reported for study in the years 1544-1568, with probably as many passed over as routine, and some falling through the cracks as not recognizable as penal bonds in the records).&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 299&lt;/ref&gt; “By 1582 Chancery’s intervention was even more frequent,” including some 16 bond cases under consideration in the [[Michaelmas]] term alone.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chancery was more favorable to the debtor, it still maintained a relatively strict line in these cases: [[injunctions]] were not routinely granted “simply on the ground that the penal sum was outrageously disproportionate to the underlying debt.”&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1557 case of ''Chamberlayn v. Iseham'',&lt;ref&gt;C 33/18 fo. 229, 29 June, 4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. (1557)&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates this point. In that case, the debtor (now plaintiff in equity) had given a bond to pay a sum of £400, “defeasible if 20 marks (£13 s. 8d.) was paid by a certain date.” &lt;ref&gt;Henderson, at 300&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than grant an injunction barring the enforcement of the bond on the ground that the sum was grossly disproportionate to the underlying debt, Chancery “felt it necessary to mention special circumstances in the debtor’s favor,” namely that “he was in the service of the king and queen on the day appointed for payment, and had since paid the twenty marks into Chancery to be held for the obligee.” &lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-sixteenth century, Chancery sometimes viewed [[substantial performance]] of the condition as sufficient reason to justify intervention. This was the outcome in the cases of ''Rowse v. Wade'', ''Fabyan v. Fuliambe'', ''Atkinson v. Harman'', ''Longe v. Awbery'', and ''Walaston v. Mower''.&lt;ref&gt;C 33/12 fo. 377, 7 May, 1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. (1555); C 33/21 fo. 295, 8 Nov., 2 Eliz. (1560); C 33/15 fo. 96a, 137a, 211, 253, 6 Nov – 31 May, 3 &amp; 4 Phil &amp; Mar. (1556-57); C 33/18 fo. 28, 28 Oct., 4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. (1557); C 78/33, case 17, 31 Jan., 4 Eliz. (1561/62).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond these cases, “by about 1562 Chancery was beginning to feel that the law of harsh penalties for small defaults was wrong in principle,” having held on a number of occasions that the defendant obligee could not recover more than his damages, notwithstanding the fact that he could have recovered at common law the entire penal sum irrespective of the amount he had been harmed (“damnified” in the verbiage of the time).&lt;ref&gt;Henderson at 304.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift led Chancery to grant relief “routinely in a whole class of cases,” rather than just in exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably as a result of this routinizing of chancering penal bonds, Chancery’s willingness to intervene regularly in penal bonds (starting sometime in the 1580s/90’s) shifted from giving injunctions without regard to whether the common law court had passed on the matter (which was the prior practice) to granting injunctions only during a set period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsurprisingly, this caused friction between the common law courts and the Court of Chancery, which came to a head in 1614 over whether the Chancery Court could properly issues injunctions in cases upon which the common law courts had already passed judgment.&lt;ref&gt;For the entire story, see Samuel Rawson Gardiner’s History of England from the Accession of James I to the Disgrace of Chief-Justice Coke, 1603-1616, pages 271-283 (1863).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''Courtney v. Glanville and Allen'', which grew out of a particularly egregious example of fraud underlying a debt, [[Edward Coke|Chief Justice Coke]], judge and leading advocate of the common law, sought to challenge the authority of the Chancery Court to review decisions already made by the common law courts. As the common law courts had already given judgment for Glanville and Allen, Coke argued that the Chancery Court could not properly rule on the case so as to give an injunction which ran contrary to the action of the common law court. Eventually, this particular dispute became wrapped up in a wider rift between common law and Chancery in the [[Earl of Oxford's case|''Earl of Oxford’s case'']], culminating in a stinging rebuke of the common law courts delivered by King [[James I]], re-affirming the Chancery Court’s right and duty to the people to review those decisions of the common law courts which may have been manifestly unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later History and Decline ==

Chancery’s dim view of penalties in excess of damages eventually won out. In 1696, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] passed a law, the [[Administration of Justice Act 1696|Administration of Justice Act]], which said that “a plaintiff suing upon a bond was allowed to execute on property only up to the value of the damages suffered as a result of the breach.”&lt;ref&gt;Nathan B. Oman, Consent to Retaliation: A Civil Recourse Theory of Contractual Liability, 96 Iowa L. Rev. 529, 540 (2011) (referencing the Administration of Justice Act, 1696, 8 &amp; 9 Will. 3, c. 11 § VIII (Eng.))&lt;/ref&gt; In 1705, the [[Administration of Justice Act 1705|law]] was amended to say that “payment of damages” was to be considered “a full substitute for the stipulated penalty under the bond.” &lt;ref&gt;Id. (referencing the Administration of Justice Act, 1705, 4 &amp; 5 Ann., c. 3, § XIII (Eng.)).&lt;/ref&gt; The penal bond, nonetheless, remained popular in the ensuing century "mainly because of procedural advantages – such as a longer statute of limitations – for actions on specialty contracts like bonds, vis-à-vis simple contracts.” &lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; For bonds, in fact, there was no limitation period before 1833, although payment was presumed after a period of 20 years (reduced to 12 years in 1939).&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Baker, ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' at 325 (4th ed. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; As penal bonds were under seal, preference was also given to them over simple debts in the event of debtor insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 325-326&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these minor advantages, the core fact remained that after “the limitation of the early eighteenth century, regardless of the penalty specified in the bond, the value of the underlying promise represented a ceiling on the plaintiff’s recourse against the defendant.” &lt;ref&gt;Oman, at 540-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis Nyquist reports that “[b]y the eighteenth century, chancering bonds was a regular practice on both sides of the Atlantic, even in common law courts.”&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Nyquist, A Contract Tale from the Crypt, 30 Hous. L. Rev. 1205, 1233 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Massachusetts]], the practice was to give “judgment for only one-half the amount of the bond.” &lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend, unsurprisingly, “undermined” the “in terrorem quality of penal bonds,” and therefore penal bonds were “used less frequently and no longer played a major role in business practice by [1819].” &lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this fact, "until the beginning of the nineteenth century," "virtually all large business transactions" in the United States were conducted via the mutual exchange of two independent penal bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Morton J. Horwitz, The Historical Foundations of Modern Contract Law, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 917, 928 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time in the [[United States]], not only were penal bonds regarded as invalid insofar as they imposed liability in excess of damages, all contractual mechanisms that purported to impose a penalty in excess of damages (rather than valid liquidated damages) were regarded as invalid.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Tayloe v. Sandiford'', 20 U.S. 13, 17 (1822)(where Chief Justice Marshall held that “[i]n general, a sum of money in gross to be paid for the non-performance of an agreement, is considered a penalty, the legal operation of which is, to cover the damages which the party, in whose favour the stipulation is made, may have sustained from the breach of contract by the opposite party. It will not of course be considered as liquidated damages; and it will be incumbent on the party who claims them as such, to show that they were so considered by the contracting parties. Much stronger is the inference in favour of its being a penalty, when it is expressly reserved as one. The parties themselves denominate a penalty; and it would require very strong evidence to authorize the-Court to say that their own words do not express their own intention.”)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1895, the rule limiting relief to actual damages, and disfavoring penal bonds insofar as they purported to grant more than actual damages, was regarded a positive “[amelioration] of the severity of the common law,” and is aptly described in the case of ''Kelley v. Seay'', spinning a story of progress in the law to the point where it was then regarded as a “settled rule that no other sum can be recovered under a penalty than that which shall compensate the plaintiff for his actual loss.” &lt;ref&gt;''Kelley v. Seay'', 41 P. 615, 617 (Sup. Ct. Terr. Okla.) (1895). Accord ''M'Intosh v. Johnson'', 31 P. 450, 452—453 (Sup. Ct. Terr. Utah) (1892) (disallowing penalties when the amount of damages is reasonably ascertainable).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Although penal bonds have not been used for hundreds of years, their influence on English jurisprudence continued through the development of the common law rules in relation to penalty clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Professor [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''The  penal  bond  with  conditional defeasance'' (1966) 82 [[Law Quarterly Review|LQR]] 392, 418-419&lt;/ref&gt;  During their review of this area of the law in ''[[Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi]]''&lt;ref name=Makdessi&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi|court=UKHL |division= |year=2015 |num=67 |date=4 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] reviewed the relevant history and its effect on subsequent jurisprudence (noting that "[t]he  penalty  rule  in  England  is  an  ancient,  haphazardly  constructed  edifice which has not weathered well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0280-judgment.pdf ''Makdessi''] [2015] UKSC 67, at para 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics developed in case law and [[Administration of Justice Act 1696]] and later the [[Administration of Justice Act 1705]] to protect parties became increasingly applied to [[liquidated damages clause]]s, which evolved into the [[Penalties in English law|common law doctrine of penalties]].

'''Pornopedia''' is a [[wiki]] website about pornography, [[erotica]], sexuality, and everything related to it including actors, directors, movies, books, and toys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pool.pornopedia.com/w/images/e/eb/Das_groesste_Porno-Lexikon.jpg Das größte Porno-Lexikon], Coupé magazine, August 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornopedia is run by [[Till Kraemer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.till-kraemer.com/presse/pressespiegel/jolie/images/004.jpg Mein Freund ist ein Pornostar], [[Jolie (magazine)|Jolie]] , January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a German [[actor]], TV host and former [[pornographic film actor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1593484/ Till Kraemer], [[IMDb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Pornopedia has a variety of sexual and pornographic topics and nudity, but does not feature any actual hardcore content. Pornopedia has no notability guidelines, so basically every actor or movie can be included in the encyclopedia.

In order to write for Pornopedia, authors have to register themselves. Every new account will be reviewed by an administrator, before the user is able to post anything. The intention is to keep spam and vandalism at a minimum rate.

{{As of|December 2017}}, the [[German language]] wiki is the most extensive with about 22,900 articles followed by the [[English language]] with about 4,300 articles, the [[Swedish language]] with almost 3600 articles, the [[French language]] with 228, [[Serbian language]] with 128, and [[Spanish language]] with 118. The [[Dutch language]] has three articles, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Italian language]] with two, and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] with one each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pornopedia.com/|title=Pornopedia - The Sexy Encyclopedia|publisher=Pornopedia|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Pornopedia runs on a dedicated [[OpenBSD]] server located in [[San Diego]]. It uses the [[Nginx]] [[web server]] and the [[MySQL]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] [[MariaDB]]. The [[wiki software]] is [[MediaWiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.pornopedia.com/wiki/Spezial:Version|title=Version – Pornopedia|publisher=Pornopedia|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
In February 2010, Pornopedia became known to a wider audience when it appeared in a featured story on the main page of [[Bild]], Europe's best-selling tabloid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/erotik/erotik/sexstar-till-kraemer-gruendet-geile-enzyklopaedie-11519474.bild.html Pornopedia: Sexstar Till Kraemer (32) gründet geile Enzyklopädie], [[Bild]], February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

2009 to 2012, Pornopedia had a series called ''Das Porno-ABC'' in the German men's magazine ''Coupé'': Every month Pornopedia presented an article usually describing a sex position or fetish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pool.pornopedia.com/w/images/a/a1/Das_Porno-ABC_-_Axilismus.jpg Das Porno-ABC] Coupé magazine, November 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''resolv.conf''' is the name of a [[computer file]] used in various operating systems to configure the system's [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) [[resolver (DNS)|resolver]]. The file is a [[plain-text]] file usually created by the network administrator or by applications that manage the configuration tasks of the system. The [[resolvconf]] program is one such program on [[FreeBSD]] or other [[Unix]] machines which manages the resolv.conf file.

==Purpose==
In most [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s and others that implement the [[BIND]] [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) [[resolver (DNS)|resolver]] library, the ''resolv.conf'' [[configuration file]] contains information that determines the operational parameters of the DNS resolver.
The DNS resolver allows applications running in the operating system to translate human-friendly [[domain name]]s into the numeric [[IP address]]es that are required for access to resources on the [[local area network]] or the [[Internet]]. The process of determining IP addresses from domain names is called ''resolving''.

==Contents and location==
The file ''resolv.conf'' typically contains directives that specify the default [[Search domain|search domains]]; used for completing a given query name to a [[fully qualified domain name]] when no domain suffix is supplied. It also contains a list of IP addresses of [[nameserver]]s available for resolution. An example file is:

 search example.com local.lan
 nameserver 1.1.1.1
 nameserver 8.8.8.8
 nameserver 9.9.9.9

''resolv.conf'' is usually located in the &lt;code&gt;''[[/etc]]''&lt;/code&gt; directory of the [[file system]]. The file is either maintained manually, or when [[DHCP]] is used, it is usually updated with the utility [[resolvconf]].

'''Richard Henry Dana Jr.''' (August 1, 1815 – January 6, 1882) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts, a descendant of an eminent colonial family, who gained renown as the author of the American classic, the memoir ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]''. Both as a writer and as a lawyer, he was a champion of the downtrodden, from seamen to fugitive slaves and freedmen.

==Early life and education==
Dana was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], on August 1, 1815{{sfn|Nelson|1981|p=45}} into a family that had settled in colonial America in 1640, counting [[Anne Bradstreet]] among its ancestors.&lt;ref name="sullivan98"&gt;Sullivan, 1972, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the poet and critic [[Richard Henry Dana Sr.]] As a boy, Dana studied in [[Cambridgeport, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] under a strict schoolmaster named Samuel Barrett, alongside fellow Cambridge native and future writer [[James Russell Lowell]].{{sfn|Duberman|1966|p=15}} Barrett was infamous as a disciplinarian who punished his students for any infraction by flogging. He also often pulled students by their ears and, on one such occasion, nearly pulled Dana's ear off, causing the boy's father to protest enough that the practice was abolished.{{sfn|Sullivan|1972|p=100}}

==Career==
In 1825, Dana enrolled in a private school overseen by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], whom Dana later mildly praised as "a very pleasant instructor", though he lacked a "system or discipline enough to ensure regular and vigorous study."{{sfn|Sullivan|1972|p=100}} In July 1831, Dana enrolled at [[Harvard College]], where in his freshman year his support of a student protest cost him a six-month suspension.{{sfn|Sullivan|1972|p=101}} In his junior year, he contracted [[measles]], which in his case led to [[ophthalmia]].

Fatefully, the worsening vision inspired him to take a sea voyage.  But rather than going on a fashionable [[Grand Tour]] of Europe he decided, despite his high-class birth, to enlist as a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]]. On August 14, 1834 he departed Boston aboard the [[brig]] ''[[Pilgrim (brig)|Pilgrim]]'', captained by Frank Thompson, bound for [[Alta California]], at that time still a part of [[Mexico]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1972|p=102}} This voyage would bring Dana to a number of settlements in California (including [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], San Buenaventura, [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[San Juan Capistrano]], San Diego, [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] and San Francisco). After witnessing Thompson's sadistic practices, including a flogging on board the ship, he vowed that he would try to help improve the lot of the common seaman. The ''Pilgrim'' collected hides for shipment to Boston, and Dana spent much of his time in California at San Diego's Point Loma curing hides and loading them onto the ship.

To return home sooner, he was reassigned by the ship's owners to a different ship: the ''Alert''. Of the return trip around [[Cape Horn]] in the middle of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] winter, Dana gives the classic account. He describes terrifying storms and incredible beauty, giving vivid descriptions of [[iceberg]]s, which he calls incomparable.  The most incredible part perhaps is the weeks and weeks it took to negotiate passage against winds and storms—all the while having to race up and down the ice-covered rigging to furl and unfurl sails.  At one point he has an infected tooth, and his face swells up so that he is unable to work for several days, despite the need for all hands.  After the Horn has been rounded he describes the [[scurvy]] that afflicts members of the crew.  In ''[[White-Jacket]]'', [[Herman Melville]] wrote, "But if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana's unmatchable ''Two Years Before the Mast''. But you can read, and so you must have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=44863&amp;pageno=75 |title=Online Reader – Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 1836, Dana arrived back in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Sullivan|1972|pp=104–05}}

He thereupon enrolled at what is now [[Harvard Law School]], then called the Dane Law School. Graduated in 1837, he was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1840&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150683/Richard-Henry-Dana|title=Richard Henry Dana – American author|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to specialize in [[maritime law]]. In the October 1839 issue of a magazine, he took a local judge, one of his own instructors in law school, to task for letting off a ship's captain and mate with a slap on the wrist for murdering the ship's cook, beating him to death for not "laying hold" of a piece of equipment. The judge had sentenced the captain to ninety days in jail and the mate to thirty days.{{sfn|Glenn|1984|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Levine||p=282}}

In 1841, Dana published ''The Seaman's Friend,'' which became a standard reference on the legal rights and responsibilities of sailors. He defended many common seamen in court.
[[File:Richard H Dana Jr 1842.jpg|thumb|Dana in 1842]]
During his voyages he had kept a diary, and in 1840 (coinciding with his admission to the bar) he published a memoir, ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]''. The term, "before the mast" refers to sailors' quarters, which were located in the [[forecastle]] (the ship's [[Bow (ship)|bow]]), officers' quarters being near the stern. His writing evidences his later sympathy for the oppressed.  With the [[California Gold Rush]] later in the decade, ''Two Years Before the Mast'' would become highly sought after as one of the few sources of information on California.

Dana became a prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], helping to found the anti-[[slavery]] [[Free Soil Party]] in 1848 and represented the fugitive slave [[Anthony Burns]] in [[Boston]] in 1854. He was a member of the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]], an organization that assisted fugitive slaves.{{sfn|Bearse|1880|p=3}}

In 1853 Dana represented [[William T. G. Morton]] in Morton's attempt to establish that he discovered the "anaesthetic properties of ether".{{sfn|Morton|1853|pp=222–32}}

In 1859, while the [[U.S. Senate]] was considering whether the United States should try to annex the Spanish possession of [[Cuba]], Dana traveled there and visited [[Havana]], a sugar plantation, a bullfight, and various churches, hospitals, schools, and prisons, a trip documented in his book ''To Cuba and Back''.

During the [[American Civil War]], Dana served as a [[United States Attorney]], and successfully argued before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] that the United States Government could rightfully blockade [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] ports. After the close of the war he resigned his office, as he did not approve of President Andrew Johnson's policy of Reconstruction, which was denounced by "Radical Republicans" as being too moderate in terms of African American civil rights and punishment of former Confederates, and entered private practice. During 1867–1868 Dana was a member of the Massachusetts legislature and also served as a U.S. counsel in the trial of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]].

In 1876, his nomination as ambassador to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] was defeated in the Senate by political enemies, partly because of a lawsuit for plagiarism brought against him for a legal textbook he had edited, [[Henry Wheaton]]'s ''[[Elements of International Law]]'' (8th ed., 1866). Immediately after the book's publication, Dana had been charged by the editor of two earlier editions, William Beach Lawrence, with infringing his copyright, and was involved in litigation which continued for thirteen years. In such minor matters as arrangement of notes and verification of citations the court found against Dana, but in the main Dana's notes were vastly different from Lawrence's.&lt;ref&gt;1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' article on Francis Dana&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Dana was one of the counsel for the Government of the United States, appearing before the [[Halifax Fisheries Commission]], appointed under the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)]] to resolve outstanding issues, including fishing rights. The Commission gave an award directing the United States to pay $5,500,000 to the British Government. Towards the end of his life he went to Europe to devote himself to the preparation of a treatise on international law; but the actual composition of this work was little more than begun when he died in Rome, January 6, 1882.

His son, [[Richard Henry Dana III]], married Edith Longfellow, daughter of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].{{sfn|Nelson|1981|p=63}}

There is additional biographical information and insights into the life of Richard Henry Dana Jr. in the "Introductory Note" to the Harvard Classics edition of ''Two Years Before the Mast'', edited by Charles W. Eliot, L.L.D. and published by P. F. Collier &amp; Son in 1909.  Here is an excerpt:

Richard Henry Dana, the second of that name, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, August 1, 1815.  He came of a stock that had resided there since the days of the early settlements; his grandfather, Francis Dana, had been the first American minister to Russia and later became chief justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts; his father was distinguished as a man of letters.  He entered Harvard College in 1831; but near the beginning of his third year an attack of measles left his eyesight so weak that study was impossible.  Tired of the tedium of a slow convalescence, he decided on a sea voyage; and choosing to go as a sailor rather than a passenger, he shipped from Boston on August 14, 1834, on the brig ''Pilgrim'', bound for the coast of California.  His experiences for the next two years form the subject of the present volume.

In the December following his return to Boston in 1836, Dana re-entered Harvard, the hero of his fellow students, graduating in the following June.  He next took up the study of law, at the same time teaching elocution in the College, and in 1840 he opened an office in Boston.  While in the law school he had written out the narrative of his voyage, which he now published; and in the following year, 1841, issued ''The Seaman's Friend''.  Both books were republished in England and brought him an immediate reputation.

After several years of the practice of law, during which he dealt largely with cases involving the rights of seamen, he began to take part in politics as an active member of the Free-Soil Party.  [Note: the Free-Soil Party was founded in 1847–48 in opposition to the extension of slavery into the western U.S. territories newly acquired from Mexico.]  During the operation of the Fugitive-Slave Law he acted as counsel in behalf of the fugitives Shadrach, Sims and Burns, and on one occasion suffered a serious assault as a consequence of his zeal.  His prominence in these cases, along with his fame as a writer, brought him much social recognition on his visit to England in 1856.  Three years later, his health gave way from overwork, and he set out on a voyage round the world, revisiting California, where he made the observations which appear in the postscript to this book.  [Note: The postscript is entitled: "Twenty-Four Years After," and is included in Dana's list of works, below.]

On his return, Dana was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as United States District Attorney for Massachusetts; and in his arguments before the Supreme Court in Washington in connection with the "Prize cases," dealing with the capture of private property at sea in time of war, he greatly increased an already brilliant legal reputation. He spoke out in favor of African American voting, education, property and firearms ownership, stating:

{{Quotation|We have got to choose between two results. With these four millions of Negroes, either you must have four millions of disfranchised, disarmed, untaught, landless, thriftless, non-producing, non-consuming, degraded men, or else you must have four millions of land-holding, industrious, arms-bearing, and voting population. Choose between the two! Which will you have?|Richard Henry Dana Jr.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ixsgquUHhn4C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22arms-bearing,+and+voting+population.+Choose+between+these+two%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XZPvguF1nM&amp;sig=8KE59oGl8Q0-Aye9aNlcrSZTkAM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIzsGdwZ-QxwIVQxw-Ch3yzQZs#v=onepage&amp;q=%22arms-bearing%2C%20and%20voting%20population.%20Choose%20between%20these%20two%22&amp;f=false ''Religion, Race, and Reconstruction: The Public School in the Politics of the 1870s''] (1998), by Ward M. McCafee, Albany, New York: State University of New York, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His sentiments were echoed by future U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] in his speeches, who wholeheartedly agreed with Dana's message.

==Legacy==
The record of Dana's life agrees with the picture of his temperament which he unconsciously painted in his first and greatest book.  The ready sympathy for the suffering and the oppressed, the courage, unselfishness, and fair-mindedness which he exhibited on the merchant vessel when a boy of twenty, continued to characterize him throughout his long and distinguished career as lawyer and citizen.

{{Nihongo|'''Mitsuhiro Momota'''|百田 光浩|lead=yes}} (born '''Kim Sin-rak'''; {{korean|hangul=김신락}}; November 14, 1924&lt;ref&gt;North Korean claim&lt;/ref&gt; – December 15, 1963), better known as '''Rikidōzan''' ({{lang|ja|力道山}}), was a [[Koreans in Japan|Korean Japanese]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] known as '''The Father of [[Puroresu]]''' and one of the most influential men in professional wrestling history. Initially, he had moved from his native country Korea to Japan to become a [[sumo wrestler]]. He was credited with bringing the sport of professional wrestling to [[Japan]] at a time when the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] needed a local hero to emulate and was lauded as a national hero. He was murdered by a member of the [[Yakuza]] in 1963.

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Rikidozan as sekiwake 1949.jpg|thumb|left|Rikidōzan in 1949, in traditional sumo ''[[keshō-mawashi]]'']]
Rikidōzan was born '''Kim Sin-rak''' in [[South Hamgyong]], in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], on November 14, 1924.

He was the youngest son of Kim Soktee, the owner of a Korean farm with a Confucian tradition and his wife Chon Gi. When his father fell ill, Sin-rak tended to his father, while his mother and older brothers tended to the farm. His father died in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://taugus.web.fc2.com/MARTIAL_ARTS/RIKIDOZAN/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taugus.web.fc2.com/MARTIAL_ARTS/RIKIDOZAN/childe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interq.or.jp/cancer/kuramasa/rikidouzan01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the adopted son of the farmer "Momota family" of [[Nagasaki Prefecture]] when he was young and trained to be a [[sumo]] wrestler. He joined [[Nishonoseki stable]], and made his debut in May 1940. Due to the discrimination against Koreans by the Japanese, Sin-rak claimed that his name was Mitsuhiro Momota (Momota being the surname of the family which adopted, but later disowned, him) and listed his birthplace as [[Omura, Nagasaki|Omura]], [[Nagasaki Prefecture|Nagasaki]]. He was given the ''[[shikona]]'' of Rikidōzan. He reached the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in 1946 and was runner-up to ''[[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' [[Haguroyama Masaji|Haguroyama]] in the [[honbasho|tournament]] of June 1947, losing a playoff for the [[yusho|championship]]. He fought in 23 tournaments in total, with a win-loss record of 135–82. His highest rank was ''[[sekiwake]]''.&lt;ref name="sumodb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sumodb.sumogames.de/Rikishi.aspx?r=3874|title=Rikidozan Mitsuhiro Rikishi Information|publisher=Sumo Reference|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional wrestling===
[[File:Riki Apt.JPG|thumb|right|Rikidōzan's expensive apartment in Japan, called "the Riki Mansion", as it existed in 2007.]]
Rikidōzan gave up sumo in 1950. Although he claimed it was for financial reasons, discrimination against Koreans may have been a contributory factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weiner, Michael|title=Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-20854-8|year=2004|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional wrestling debut in 1951 with a ten-minute draw against Bobby Bruns. He established himself as Japan's biggest wrestling star by defeating one [[United States|American]] wrestler after another. This was shortly after [[World War II]], and the Japanese needed someone who could stand up to the Americans. Rikidōzan thus became immensely popular in Japan. His American opponents assisted him by portraying themselves as [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] who cheated in their matches. Rikidōzan himself was [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booked]] as a villain when he wrestled in America early on but went on to become one of the first Japanese wrestlers to be cheered as a baby face in post World War II America. 

Rikidōzan gained worldwide renown when he defeated [[Lou Thesz]] for the [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship]] on August 27, 1958 in Japan. In another match, Thesz willingly agreed to [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|put over]] Rikidōzan at the expense of his own reputation. This built up mutual respect between the two wrestlers, and Rikidōzan never forgot what Thesz did. He would go on to capture several [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] titles in matches both in Japan and overseas. Rikidōzan also trained professional wrestling students, including soon-to-be wrestling legends [[Antonio Inoki|Kanji "Antonio" Inoki]], [[Kintaro Ohki|Ooki Kintaro]], and [[Shohei Baba|Shohei "Giant" Baba]].

His signature move was the [[Knifehand strike|karate chop]], which was actually based on sumo's ''harite'', rather than actual [[karate]]. It is rumoured that he had been coached by fellow Korean [[Masutatsu Oyama]], but he is more likely to have been coached by another Korean [[Karateka (martial arts)|karateka]], Nakamura Hideo.

With his success in pro wrestling, Rikidōzan began acquiring properties such as [[nightclub]]s, [[hotel]]s, [[condominium]]s and [[boxing]] promotions. He established the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]] (JWA), Japan's first professional wrestling promotion, in 1953. His first major feud was against [[Masahiko Kimura]], the famous [[judo]]ka who had been invited by Rikidōzan to compete as a professional wrestler.  Other famous feuds included those against Thesz in 1957–58, against [[Freddie Blassie]] in 1962, and against [[Dick Beyer|The Destroyer]] in 1963.  In wrestling journalist John M. Molinaro's 2002 book ''Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', it is noted that two of Rikidōzan's matches are rated in the top ten television programs of all time in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Mollinaro, J.F: ''The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', p. 19, Winding Stair Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  His October 6, 1957 sixty-minute draw with Lou Thesz for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] drew an 87.0 rating, and his May 24, 1963 sixty-minute [[Two out of three falls match|two out of three falls]] draw with The Destroyer drew a 67.0 rating, but a larger viewing audience (the largest in Japanese history) than the previous match, since more people had television sets by 1963.

==Death==
[[File:Sannoh hospital.jpg|thumb|Rikidōzan entered Sannoh Hospital after being stabbed]]
On December 8, 1963, while partying in a [[Tokyo]] nightclub, Rikidōzan was stabbed with a urine-soaked blade by a man named Katsuji Murata who belonged to the [[Yakuza|ninkyō dantai]] (Yakuza) [[Sumiyoshi-ikka]]. Reportedly, Rikidōzan threw Murata out of the club and continued to party, refusing to seek medical help.&lt;ref&gt;Mollinaro, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Another report states that Rikidōzan did indeed see his physician shortly after the incident, and was told the wound was not serious. He died a week later of [[peritonitis]] on December 15. It was rumored by [[Masahiko Kimura]] that his murder was in retaliation for when Rikidōzan attacked Kimura during a wrestling match, after Kimura delivered an errant kick to Rikidōzan's groin, ignoring a pre-match arrangement and attacking Kimura [[Kayfabe#Breaking kayfabe|for real]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judoinfo.com/kimura4.htm My Judo by Masahiko Kimura]&lt;/ref&gt;

Murata served seven years in prison for [[manslaughter]]. Murata claimed that on December 15 of every year he would call up Rikidōzan’s sons, Mitsuo and Yoshi Momota, apologize and then visit Rikidōzan’s grave.

==Family==
One of his sons, [[Mitsuo Momota]], followed his father into the ring in 1970 and still works as a [[freelancer]], but was never able to earn the recognition that once made his father famous, despite winning the [[World Junior Heavyweight Championship (AJPW)|World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] in 1989. Mitsuo's son, Chikara Momota, made his in-ring debut on December 16, 2013, the day after the fiftieth anniversary of the death of his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://battle-news.com/battle/2013/12/002060.php | script-title=ja:力道山50回目の命日に孫の力がプロレスデビュー！父であり力道山の息子である百田光雄はダブルヘッダー | date=2013-12-16 | work=Battle News | accessdate = 2013-12-16 | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rikidōzan's other son, [[Yoshihiro Momota]], was also a pro wrestler.

Rikidōzan's son-in-law, Bak Myeong-cheol (박명철), has been a member of the [[National Defence Commission of North Korea]] since around early 2009, while Bak Myeong-cheol's younger sister is the vice secretary of the Light Industry Division of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Mainichi {{cite news | first=省二 (Shoni) | last=西岡 (Nishioka) | script-title=ja:北朝鮮：力道山ファミリー重用 総書記義弟の復権が影響？ | date=2009-11-20 | url=http://mainichi.jp/select/world/northkorea/archive/news/2009/11/20091120k0000e030068000c.html | work=Shimbum | accessdate=2010-03-08 | language=Japanese | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711153216/http://mainichi.jp/select/world/northkorea/archive/news/2009/11/20091120k0000e030068000c.html | archivedate=2012-07-11 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ko:역도산 패밀리 북한서 중용 | date=2009-11-20 | publisher= | url =http://news.kukinews.com/article/view.asp?page=1&amp;gCode=kmi&amp;arcid=0001628538&amp;code=30803000 | work =Kuki News via [[Yonhap]] | accessdate = 2010-03-08 | language = Korean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1324">'''Salname''' (also called ''nevsal'') was the name of the official annuals of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 19th century. The word is a composite word. Both components are in [[Persian language|Persian]],  ''sal'' meaning "year" and ''name'' meaning "letter".

==History==
First salname was published in 1847. It was prepared by [[Ahmed Vefik Pasha]], [[Ahmet Cevdet Pasha]] and Hayrullah. It was sponsored by the grand vizier [[Mustafa Reşit Pasha]], a well known reformer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-tarih.org/sozluk.php?sd=sozlukdetay&amp;id=335 Historical dictionary {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of the salname==
The main salname was the salname of the state. Beginning by 1866 the vilayet (province) administrations also published salnames about the province. There were also salnames of other institutions both governmental and non governmental.  According to Agoston and Masters, most important salnames were the second type salnames. Because by these salnames the government could determine the resources and the conditions of the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Gabor Agoston and Bruce Masters:''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', {{ISBN|0-8160 6259-5}} pp.501-502&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery Ltd v Distillers Corporation (SA) Ltd and Another'''''&lt;ref&gt;1962 (1) SA 458 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]]. It was heard in the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] on 18 September 1961, with judgment handed down on 23 November. Hoexter ACJ, Beyers JA, Van Blerk JA, [[Frans Lourens Herman Rumpff|Rumpff JA]] and Wessels AJA presided. It is significant for its articulation of the contrast between a mere pecuniary interest on the one hand and an actual legal right on the other:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that the shareholder is entitled to an ''aliquot'' share in the distribution of the surplus assets when the company is would up proves that he is financially interested in the success or failure of the company but not that he has any right or title to any assets of the company.&lt;ref&gt;472A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court found that, in enacting section 166(v) of the Liquor Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 30 of 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; as amended by section 42 of the Liquor Further Amendment Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 61 of 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; the legislature had not intended to use the phrase "financial interest in a business" in any restricted sense, such as, for example, in reference to a proprietary interest or a controlling interest. A "financial interest," within the meaning of section 166(v), is acquired, in any business conducted by a company, by a person who acquires shares in that company or in any other company which is by shareholding on its part linked with the former company, either directly or through an intermediate shareholding company or companies.

''[[Goldberg v PJ Joubert]]''&lt;ref&gt;1960 (1) SA 521 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; was thus overruled and the decision in the Cape Provincial Division, in ''[[Distillers Corporation v Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1961 (2) SA 829 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; thus confirmed.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
In Jump City, the [[Teen Titans]] arrive to stop the Balloon Man. When he cannot figure out who they are, the Teen Titans jump into a rap song to introduce themselves and become distracted, forcing the [[Justice League]] to intervene. They criticize the Titans for being childish, not taking anything seriously, and bring up the fact that they do not have a [[Film adaptation|movie]] of their own to prove their legitimacy.

While at the premiere of ''Batman Again'' after [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] sent the [[Challengers of the Unknown]] to another dimension, [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] humiliates himself, after assuming that there will be a movie about him, and is laughed out by the audience. At the rest of the team's suggestion, Robin resolves that in order to get a movie made about him and the Titans, they need an arch-nemesis.

Nearby, [[Deathstroke|Slade]] breaks into [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to steal a crystal. The Titans arrive and attempt to stop him, but he swiftly defeats and insults them. The next day, [[Beast Boy]], [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Raven (DC comics)|Raven]] create a movie to cheer up Robin, but he turns it off prematurely declaring that they will go to [[Hollywood]] to have a movie made about them. Upon arriving, they encounter [[Film director|director]] Jade Wilson, who is responsible for all the [[Superhero film|superhero movies]] being made. She turns down the Titans' request to be in a movie, but explains that the only way she would make one about them is if they were the only superheroes in the world. The Titans take her words literally by going back in time to prevent the origins of the other superheroes, but only end up ruining the present, forcing them to go and undo their blunder.

Slade next arrives at [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne Tech]] to infuse the crystal's power and the Titans arrive to stop him, this time putting up an actual fight. They secure the crystal, but Slade escapes, resolving to split Robin from his teammates. The next day, Jade invites the Titans back to Hollywood and announces that she will make a movie about them due to their recent fight with Slade. While Robin is given a tour of the premises, Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire and Cyborg venture out and cause mischief. They find a Doomsday Machine that is heavily guarded by the heroes and try to destroy it, but Jade arrives and reveals that D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y., is just a terrible acronym for a new streaming service for the new movie she is making. She resolves to drop the rest of the Titans from the film and make it solely about Robin, which he happily accepts, much to the consternation of his team, who wish him luck.

Robin finishes making the movie, but during a scene where he interacts with a prop version of the Titan Tower door panel, a light falls and knocks him out. He awakens and finishes the scene where Jade reveals that they are now in the tower for real, and that she is actually Slade himself in disguise. He gets the crystal back, restrains Robin, and tells Robin that his making so many superhero movies was a plan to keep the heroes busy while he invaded their cities to build his D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y. Device to take over the world. Robin escapes from the shackles with his baby hands, and runs out of the exploding tower. The next morning in the wreckage, Robin calls his friends back, who join him with open arms.

At the premiere of ''Robin: The Movie'', the Titans arrive and unmask Slade, but Slade unleashes the crystal's power to control the other heroes and sends them after the Titans. Robin goes after Slade while the rest of the team leads off the heroes. However, Slade uses his new power to control Robin, and tells him to attack his friends, who show him the rest of the movie they made for him. Robin comes to his senses. Using one of their songs, the team takes out Slade together, defeating him and his giant robot, which also destroys the crystal, snapping the heroes out of their trance.

The heroes all congratulate the Titans for their heroic efforts with Robin admitting that he has learned to be himself. When he tries to go on, everyone demands that they cut to the credits immediately with Robin attempting to stall so that "kids can ask their parents questions." Starfire breaks the fourth wall to say to go right to the credits, but Robin stops just before the film ends telling kids to "ask [their] parents where babies come from."

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the Teen Titans from the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|2003-2006 series]] show up on a distorted screen telling the viewers that they "found a way back."

In a post-credits scene, the [[Challengers of the Unknown]] are still trapped with their leader postulating that they missed the movie.

To the Movies'' distills the enduring appeal of its colorful characters into a charmingly light-hearted adventure whose wacky humor fuels its infectious fun -- and belies a surprising level of intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen Titans Go!

Laura Prudom of [[IGN]] gave the film a score of 8.0/10, calling it a "gleefully unhinged deconstruction of superhero tropes that isn't afraid to take aim at the rest of DC's cinematic roster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prudom |first1=Laura |title=Teen Titans Go!

To the Movies'' should come as a welcome relief to fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheck |first=Frank|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 22, 2018|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/teen-titans-go-movies-review-1128838|title='Teen Titans Go!

David Betancourt of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined, "''Teen Titans Go! To the Movies'' is a laugh-a-minute ride that hits you with the jokes from the very first frame. From the cute shots at Marvel Studios to the self-deprecating tone on the state of DC movies, you’ll leave the theater with a new set of superhero abs from laughing so hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/07/25/teen-titans-go-to-the-movies-is-so-funny-it-hurts/ |title=‘Teen Titans Go!

Brandon Katz of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' said that the film is "a fun parody of sorts that gently skewers our superhero obsessed culture, and while there may be one too many gags thrown in there which can get a bit tiresome after awhile, it's an enjoyable movie for both kids and adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Katz |first1=Brandon |title=''Teen Titans Go!

It's built with the primary goal of making you laugh and forget your problems for just under 90 minutes, and it does exactly that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tallerico |first1=Brian |title=Teen Titans Go!

[[GameSpot]]'s Chris Hayner, while finding fault with what he deemed excessive [[Toilet humour|toilet humor]] and some dragging in the film, said that "In a superhero movie landscape where the world is constantly being destroyed by massive CGI abominations, this is a refreshing change... it doesn't forget how funny and exciting these types of movies can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hayner |first1=Chris E.|title=''Teen Titans Go!

'''Thomas Nadauld Brushfield''' (1828–1910) was an English alienist and antiquarian.

==Life==
Born in London on 10 December 1828, he was son of Thomas Brushfield, J.P. and D.L. of the [[Tower of London]], by his wife Susannah Shepley; his grandfather George Brushfield married Ann Nadauld, great granddaughter of Henri Nadauld, a [[Huguenot]] sculptor. He was educated at a private boarding school at [[Buckhurst Hill]] in [[Essex]], and matriculated with honours at [[University College London|London University]] in 1848.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Brushfield, Thomas Nadauld|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brushfield studied medicine and surgery at [[London Hospital]], which he entered in 1845, and won three gold medals besides other honours. He became member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1850 and graduated M.D. at [[St Andrews University]] in 1862. After serving as house surgeon at the London Hospital he joined Dr. John Millar at [[Bethnal House Asylum]], London.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1852 Brushfield was appointed house surgeon to [[Chester County Lunatic Asylum]], and was first resident medical superintendent from 1854 until 1865. In 1865 he was appointed medical superintendent of the then planned [[Brookwood Hospital|Surrey County Asylum at Brookwood]]. The buildings there were planned in accordance with his suggestions, and later on he helped to design the Cottage Hospital there. Brushfield was a pioneer of the [[non-restraint treatment]] of lunatics, and he sought to lighten the patients' life in asylums by making the wards cheerful and by organising entertainments. He retired on a pension in 1882.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

On his retirement Brushfield settled at [[Budleigh Salterton]], living in a Georgian house known as The Cliff, Cliff Road in Budleigh Salterton on the east Devon coast, near [[Hayes Barton]], the birthplace of [[Sir Walter Ralegh]]. Brushfield made the career of Ralegh his main study for the rest of his life. He became a member of the Devonshire Association in 1882, was elected to the council in 1883, and was president in 1893–4.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Brushfield was a freemason, was elected fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1899 and was a founder of the Devon and Cornwall Record Society. He was a popular lecturer in the West Country. He died at Budleigh Salterton on 28 November 1910, and was buried there.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Brushfield's lantern slides went to the Exeter Public Library, with some of the major Ralegh items from his library. The rest of his library of about 10,000 volumes and manuscripts was dispersed after his death. As reader for the ''New English Dictionary'', he contributed over 72,000 slips.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Brushfield's contribution to the literature of lunacy included ''Medical Certificates of Insanity'' (''[[The Lancet]]'', 1880) and ''Practical Hints on the Symptoms, Treatment and Medico-Legal Aspects of Insanity'', read before the Chester Medical Society in 1890. A paper, 'Notes on the Ralegh Family,' which he read before the 1883 meeting of the Devonshire Association, began a series of papers ''Raleghana'', research into Walter Ralegh's life and literary work, which were published in the Association's ''Transactions'' between 1896 and 1907. ''Ralegh Miscellanea'' (pts. i. and ii.) followed in 1909-10. He contributed other papers on similar themes to other journals. A bibliography of Ralegh, which was published in book form in 1886 (2nd edition 1908), first appeared serially in the ''Western Antiquary'', vol. 5, 1885–6.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
Brushfield married, on 5 August 1852, Hannah, daughter of John Davis of London, who survived him with three sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; One of his sons was [[Thomas Brushfield]] (1858&amp;ndash;1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Nadauld Brushfield | journal= British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=2609 |page=2054 |date= 31 December 1910 |pmc=2336482 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2609.2054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO Matthew Moneypenny has said that the goal of Trunk Archive is to 'make the world a prettier place', with the Archive's catalogue featuring imagery from artists and designers such as [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], [[Arthur Elgort]], and [[Patrick Demarchelier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/fashion/matthew-moneypenny-trunk-agency.html|title=The Man Who Would Make the World a Prettier Place|last=Schneier|first=Matthew|date=2015-12-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has received criticism for its use of automated image tracking software PicScout to identify copyright infringement of images in its catalogue. In 2015, they claimed infringement against the magazine ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' for their use of a transparent [[ink]] splatter image on the cover of their Spring 2012 issue. Trunk Archive identified its own image that featured the ink spatter as the source, it was subsequently revealed by ''2600'' that the original ink spatter was created by a Finnish artist on [[DeviantArt]] who had released it into the [[public domain]], where it was subsequently used by the ''2600'' cover, as well as the image in Trunk Archive's library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2982914/security/hacker-magazine-2600-extorted-for-714-over-ink-spot-pic-copyright-troll-doesnt-own.html|title=Hacker magazine 2600 extorted for $714 over ink spot pic copyright troll doesn't own|last=Storm|first=Darlene|website=Computerworld|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2600 Accused of using Unauthorized Ink Splotches|url=http://2600.com/content/2600-accused-using-unauthorized-ink-splotches|publisher=''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]''|accessdate=8 September 2015|location=2600.com|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infringement case was subsequently dropped by the company, and COO Melissa Kelly sent a letter to the magazine apologizing for the mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2600.com/content/apology-trunk-archive|title=AN APOLOGY FROM TRUNK ARCHIVE {{!}} 2600|website=www.2600.com|access-date=2016-05-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523220325/http://2600.com/content/apology-trunk-archive|archivedate=2016-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''United States Pharmacopeia''''' (''USP'') is a [[pharmacopeia]] (compendium of [[drug]] information) for the [[United States]] published annually by the '''United States Pharmacopeial Convention''' (usually also called the USP), a nonprofit organization that owns the [[trademark]] and [[copyright]]. The ''USP'' is published in a combined volume with the ''National Formulary'' (a [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]]) as the '''USP-NF'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Formulary|url = http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25605|website = MedicineNet|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a drug ingredient or drug product has an applicable ''USP'' quality standard (in the form of a ''USP-NF'' monograph), it must conform in order to use the designation "USP" or "NF". Drugs subject to ''USP'' standards include both human drugs ([[Prescription drug|prescription]], [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]], or otherwise) and animal drugs. ''USP-NF'' standards also have a role in U.S. federal law; a drug or drug ingredient with a name recognized in ''USP-NF'' is considered adulterated if it does not satisfy compendial standards for strength, quality or purity. USP also sets standards for [[dietary supplement]]s and food ingredients (as part of the ''[[Food Chemicals Codex]]''). USP has no role in enforcing its standards; enforcement is the responsibility of [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and other government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere.

== Product quality–standards and verification ==

''USP'' establishes written (documentary) and physical ([[Reference standard|reference]]) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products, and ingredients. These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency.

Prescription and over-the-counter medicines available in the United States must, by [[United States Code|federal law]], meet ''USP-NF'' public standards, where such standards exist. Many other countries use the ''USP-NF'' instead of issuing their own pharmacopeia, or to supplement their government pharmacopeia.

USP's standards for food ingredients can be found in its ''[[Food Chemicals Codex]]'' (''FCC''). The ''FCC'' is a compendium of standards used internationally for the quality and purity of food ingredients like preservatives, flavorings, colorings and nutrients. While the ''FCC'' is recognized in law in countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], it currently does not have statutory recognition in the United States, although ''FCC'' standards are incorporated by reference in over 200 FDA food regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal Register {{!}} Food Additive Regulations; Incorporation by Reference of the Food Chemicals Codex, 7th Edition|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/29/2013-28439/food-additive-regulations-incorporation-by-reference-of-the-food-chemicals-codex-7th-edition|website = www.federalregister.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; USP obtained the ''FCC'' from the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 2006. The IOM had published the first five editions of the ''FCC''.

USP also conducts verification programs for dietary supplement products and ingredients. These are testing and audit programs. Products that meet the requirements of the program can display the USP Verified Dietary Supplement Mark on their labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are Dietary Supplements Dangerous? - Consumer Reports|url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/05/dangerous-supplements/index.htm|website = www.consumerreports.org|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is different from seeing the letters "USP" alone on a dietary supplement label, which means that the manufacturer is claiming to adhere to USP standards. ''USP'' does not test such products as it does with USP Verified products.

== Healthcare information ==

In the past, Congress authorized the Secretary of HHS to request USP to develop a drug classification system that Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit plans may use to develop their [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formularies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = United States Pharmacopeia (USP). Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Model Guidelines Source Information|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/USPMG/|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to revise such classification from time to time to reflect changes in therapeutic uses covered by Part D drugs and the addition of new covered Part D drugs. USP has developed six versions of the Model Guidelines, the last issued early in 2014 for the 2015–2017 benefit years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Part D Model Guidelines Updated Far Too Infrequently|url = http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/1103/1103.modelformulary.html|website = Managed Care Magazine Online|accessdate = 2015-12-11|last = webadmin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promoting the Quality of Medicines program ==

Since 1992, USP has worked cooperatively with the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) to help developing countries address critical issues related to poor quality medicines. This partnership operated as the Drug Quality and Information (DQI) program until 2009, when, to better meet growing global needs,  USAID awarded USP a five-year, $35 million cooperative agreement to establish a new, expanded program: Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to curb ‘fake’ food, drug products in Nigeria by PQM|url = http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/08/how-to-curb-fake-food-drug-products-in-nigeria-by-pqm/|website = www.ngrguardiannews.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 USAID extended the PQM program for five years (through September 2019), increased its funding to $110 million, and expanded the geographical reach of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USAID extends USP's Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM) programme - Express Pharma Online|url = http://archivepharma.financialexpress.com/latest-updates/3149-usaid-extends-usp-s-promoting-the-quality-of-medicines-pqm-programme|website = archivepharma.financialexpress.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PQM serves as a primary mechanism to help USAID-supported countries strengthen their quality assurance and quality control systems to better ensure the quality of medicines that reach patients. PQM has four key objectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM)|url = http://www.usp.org/global-health-programs/promoting-quality-medicines-pqmusaid|website = www.usp.org|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strengthen quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems
*  Increase the supply of quality assured medicines
*  Combat the availability of substandard and counterfeit medicines
* Provide technical leadership and global advocacy

USP-USAID collaborative efforts have helped communities improve drug quality in more than 35 countries. PQM currently works in [http://www.usp.org/global-health-impact-programs/promoting-quality-medicines-pqmusaid/global-impact/africa Africa], [http://www.usp.org/global-health-impact-programs/promoting-quality-medicines-pqmusaid/global-impact/asia Asia], [http://www.usp.org/global-health-impact-programs/promoting-quality-medicines-pqmusaid/global-impact/europeeurasia Europe/Eurasia], and the [http://www.usp.org/global-health-impact-programs/promoting-quality-medicines-pqmusaid/global-impact/latin-americacaribbean Caribbean/Latin America].

== International agreements and offices ==

USP works internationally, largely through agreements with other pharmacopeias, as well as regulatory bodies, manufacturer associations and others. In recent years, USP signed a series of [[Memorandum of understanding|Memoranda of Understanding (MOU)]] with groups including the [[Pharmacopeia of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission]], nine countries belonging to the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)]], and the Federal Service on Surveillance in Healthcare and Social Development of the Russian Federation (Roszdravnadzor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roszdravnadzor.ru/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; USP also operates an international office in Switzerland, and offices and laboratories in Brazil, India and China. In November 2014, a delegation from Global LifeSci Development Corporation, as part of Montgomery County's business visit to India visited US Pharmacopeial Convention at IKP Knowledge Park at Hyderabad in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = KENQOM Communications - Services Marketing, PR, Communications &amp; Content Marketing Agency: Chat with Jonathan Genn, EVP, Global LifeSci Development Corp.

'''White Aryan Resistance''' ('''WAR''') is a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organization in the United States founded and led by former [[Ku Klux Klan]] [[Grand Dragon]] [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]]. It is based in [[Warsaw, Indiana]], and is incorporated as a business.

It holds views that are self-described as racist, as seen in its website sections "Racist Jokes" and "Racist Videos," and in the tagline for its newspaper ''The Insurgent'': "the most racist newspaper on earth." WAR uses the slogan ''White Revolution is the Only Solution''.

== History ==
Metzger's first group was known as the '''White Brotherhood''', which he led in the mid-1970s until joining [[David Duke]]'s [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] in 1975. By 1979 he had risen to Grand Dragon of the California realm. During these years the California realm conducted unauthorized border patrols at the Mexican border and kept a blackshirted security detail that would engage in skirmishes with anti-Klan demonstrators and police. One incident in [[Oceanside, California]], in the spring of 1980, involved 30 members of this squad and left seven people injured. In the summer of 1980 Metzger left the national organization and founded his own '''California Knights of the Ku Klux Klan'''. The group continued to harass [[Hispanics]] and [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. ''The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia'' Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing inc. 1991 pp.92, 387&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-Defamation League]] ''Danger: Extremism; the major voices and vehicles on America far right fringe'' New York; Anti-Defamation League 1996 pp.77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to late 1982, Metzger headed the California Knights, while also pursuing various electoral offices. In 1982 he left the Klan to found a new group, the '''White American Political Association''', a group dedicated to promoting "prowhite" candidates for office. After losing the [[United States Senate election in California, 1982|1982 California Senate Democratic primary]], Metzger abandoned the electoral route and reorganized WAPA as '''White American Resistance''' in 1983 and then to White Aryan Resistance, to reflect a more "revolutionary" stance.&lt;ref&gt;Newton &amp; Newton p.92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Danger: Extremism'' p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, Tom Metzger began ''Race and Reason'', a [[public-access television|public-access]] cable television show, airing WAR propaganda and interviewing other neo-Nazis.&lt;ref name="CableAccess"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5071EFC38550C748CDDA90994DE484D81 | title=Extremist Finds Cable TV is Forum for Right-wing Views | work=The New York Times |date=October 7, 1986 | first= Wallace | last= Turner| accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show caused much controversy, and its guests included anti-abortion speakers, [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] and [[Racial segregation|pro-segregation]] lawyers.&lt;ref name="CableAccess" /&gt; WAR members gained attention through appearances on talk shows throughout the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB071FFB3B5C0C778CDDA80994D0484D81 | title=Geraldo Rivera's Nose Broken In Scuffle on His Talk Show  | work=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1988| accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trash TV|work=Newsweek|date=November 14, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Metzger, recorded this message on his "WAR HOTLINE",

&lt;blockquote&gt;You have reached WAR Hotline. White Aryan Resistance. You ask: What is WAR? We are an openly white-racist movement—Skinheads, we welcome you into our ranks___The federal government is the number one enemy of our race. When was the last time you heard a politician speaking out in favor of white people? ... You say the government is too big; we can't organize. Well, by God, the SS did it in Germany, and if they did it in Germany in the thirties, we can do it right here in the streets of America_We need to cleanse this nation of all nonwhite mud-races for the survival of our own people and the generations of our children.&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Steven E.|title=Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism In Modern American History|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-350-7|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7ad8GzRf0QC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22Tom+Metzger%22+%22white+supremacist%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic-Ki57sTLAhWGNxQKHVs_AlYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tom%20Metzger%22%20%22white%20supremacist%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 13, 1988, three white Aryan supremacists who were members of East Side White Pride, which allegedly had ties to WAR, beat to death [[Mulugeta Seraw]], an [[Ethiopia]]n man who had moved to the United States to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/56028630.html?dids=56028630:56028630&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+24%2C+1990&amp;author=&amp;pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=02.A&amp;desc=Lawyer+makes+racists+pay | title=Lawyer makes racists pay | work=USA Today |date=October 24, 1990 | first=  | last= | accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1990, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] won a [[Civil law (common law)|civil case]] on behalf of the deceased's family against Tom and John Metzger, for a total of US$12.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30613FD34540C758EDDA90994D8494D81 | title=Sending a $12.5 Million Message to a Hate Group | work=The New York Times |date=October 26, 1990 | first=Robb | last=London | accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC did not charge for their work, and the Seraw family did not share any money won with the SPLC.

The '''White Racial Identity Model''' was developed by psychologist [[Janet E. Helms|Janet Helms]] in 1990. It is a racial and [[Ethnic identity development|ethnic identity model]] created specifically for people who identify as [[White people|White]]. This theory, heavily influenced by [[William E. Cross Jr.|William Cross]], has become a widely referenced and studied theory on white [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]] development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Patton, L. D., Renn, K. A., Guido, F. M., Quaye, S. J., Evans, N. J., &amp; Forney, D. S. (2016). ''Student development in college: Theory, research, and practice''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.
&lt;/ref&gt; This model was created “to raise the awareness of White people about their role in creating and maintaining a racist society, and the need for them to act responsibly by dismantling [[systemic racism]] through a framework of power and [[White Privilege|privilege]],”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Helms, J. E. (1995). An update of Helms's white and people of color racial identity models. In J.G. Ponterotto, J.M. Casas, L.A. Suzuki, &amp; C.M. Alexander (Eds.), ''Handbook of multicultural counseling'' (pp. 181-198). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Helms presented the idea that all people have a racial identity in some way that is influenced by power and privilege.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Two sequential phases ==
The White Racial Identity Model is broken into five stages, split into two groups: Abandonment of [[Racism]] and the Evolution of a non-racist identity. White individuals transition from understanding themselves as racial beings and the privilege associated with being White, to taking ownership of and abandoning racial privilege, and finally learning about other racial groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In phase one, the abandonment of racism, White identifying individuals have no consciousness of their race and privilege until they are met with a disruption related to race. This disruption then challenges the individual’s ideas of whiteness and how they play a role in a racist society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following this encounter, the individual then begins to understand the salience of race and its relevance to power. In this stage, a person moves through three other sub-stages: Contact, Disintegration, and Reintegration.

Once an individual has experienced phase one, they move to phase two, the evolution of a non-racist identity, where they begin to reflect more seriously on their identity and how they interact with their surroundings. They begin to make more efforts to interact and learn from different racial groups. Helms wrote that people in this phase are working to “be White without also being bad, evil, or racist”. The stages a person moves through in this phase includes Pseudo-independence, Immersion/Emersion, and Autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, J.E. (1992). ''A race is a nice thing to have: A guide to being a white person or ''understanding the white persons in your life''. Topeka, KS: Content Communications. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and measurement ==
The White Racial Identity Model has been measured using the White Racial Identity Attitudes Scale (WRIAS) developed originally in 1990 by Helms and Carter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Leach, M. M., Behrens, J. T., &amp; LaFleur, N. K. (2002). White Racial Identity and White Racial Consciousness: Similarities, Differences, and Recommendations. ''Journal Of Multicultural Counseling &amp; Development'', ''30''(2), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Helms has said that this scale can be used to quantify the “multidimensional aspect” of the identity statues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although this scale has been critiqued{{by whom|date=March 2018}}, it has been replicated in several studies and the scales in this measure are highly correlated in measuring this construct.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Helms and Cook, however, recommend using qualitative analysis in conjunction with the WRIAS to develop a racial profile for these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, J.E. &amp; Cook, D.A. (1999). ''Using race and culture in counseling and psychotherapy: Theory and process.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Critiques ==
One of the main critiques of this model is that it is outdated and not as applicable as it once was.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The theory was created in 1990 and revised in 1995. Although it has been updated, there are many other white identity development and consciousness models that have been adapted from this that some researchers and practitioners see as more relevant.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Wayne|last2=Bennett|first2=Sandra K.|last3=Atkinson|first3=Donald R.|title=White Racial Identity Models|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011000094221009|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=129–146|doi=10.1177/0011000094221009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Row, Bennett, and Atkinson created their own theory in response to concerns they had with Helm’s model. These critiques included the singular focus on blacks and the white-black relationship, the developmental stage focus of the model, and the similarities to [[Ethnic identity development|ethnic identity models]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They created the White Racial Consciousness Theory to address these concerns.

'''''Wright v Doe d. Tatham''''' (1838) is a famous [[Exchequer Court]] decision on the use of [[hearsay]] within a trial. The case was further one of the main inspirations for Dickens' [[Bleak House]]. The decision was later upheld by the House of Lords in ''[[R v Kearly]]'' (1992).

==Facts==
Tatham was the claimant and heir to the fortune of the deceased. The will, however, had devised a portion of the property to Wright, a former servant. The main issue was whether the deceased had the required testamentary capacity when he wrote his will. Three letters written to the testator were submitted as circumstantial evidence that the author believed the testator was of sound mind and the issue was whether these letters could be admitted as evidence to prove competence or whether they constituted hearsay. Wright had argued that the letters were admissible because they showed that the testator was seen and treated as a competent in the eyes of those who knew him. Tatham argued that they were inadmissible and so would have to sworn under oath before they could be admissible.

==Judgment of the Court==
The House of Lords held that the letters were inadmissible as hearsay because the letters implied the statement "Marsden was of sound mind."

==Subsequent use==
The case appears in numerous treatises and evidence text books because of the difficult hearsay issue it raised.  Baron Parke held that conduct consistent with a belief in a fact is hearsay when offered to prove the existence of that fact.  The approach taken by [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] 801(a) does not yield the same result, as it requires that there be an intention to assert, which was absent from the "statement" in '''''Wright v. Doe d. Tatham.'''''
