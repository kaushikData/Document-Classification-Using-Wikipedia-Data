'''''Air Bud''''' is a 1997 American [[comedy film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/air-bud-v156970|work=Allmovie|title=Air Bud|author=Deming, Mark|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sparked the franchise centered on the real-life dog [[Air Buddy (dog)|Air Buddy]], a cross-bred [[Golden Retriever]], who shoots basketball hoops and appears as Old Blue/Buddy. The film was financially successful, grossing $4 million in its opening weekend and totaling $27.8 million in its run against an estimated $3 million budget.&lt;ref name="boxoffice" /&gt;

==Plot==
Norm Snively, an alcoholic and bumbling clown, and his [[Golden Retriever]] Old Blue are doing a show at a child's birthday party. After Blue causes havoc at the party, Snively angrily takes him in a kennel to a dog pound (though it was the latter's own fault for throwing a ball that was too big for the former's mouth), until the kennel falls out of his truck, rendering Blue homeless. Meanwhile, 12-year-old Josh Framm has relocated with his mother Jackie and two-year-old sister Andrea from Virginia to Fernfield, Washington. Due to heartbreak over the death of his father, a pilot who died in a plane crash during a test flight due to fuel shortage, he is too shy to try out for his middle school's basketball team or to make any friends. He instead becomes the basketball team's manager, an awkward offer by Coach Joe Barker which he accepts. He practices basketball by himself in a makeshift court that he sets up in an abandoned allotment, where he meets Blue and renames him Buddy. Josh soon discovers that Buddy has the uncanny ability to play basketball, and decides to let Buddy come home with him.

Jackie agrees to let him keep Buddy until Christmas and she plans to send him to the pound if his rightful owner is not located; however, she sees how loyal Buddy is and how much Josh loves him. On Christmas, Jackie lets Josh keep Buddy as a present.

Following Christmas, Josh finds a tryout invitation in his locker and further realizes Buddy's talent when he discovers that he can actually shoot a hoop. These facts together prompt Josh to try out, and he gets a place on the team. At his first game, he befriends teammate Tom Stewart, but earns the disdain of star player and team bully Larry Willingham. Meanwhile, Buddy leaves the backyard, goes to the school and shows up while the game is underway. He runs into the court, disrupts the game, and causes mayhem, but the audience loves him after he scores a basket.

Buddy is later caught by Josh after the game. Soon after, the dog witnesses Coach Barker abusing Tom by violently pelting him with basketballs in an attempt to make him catch better. He leads Josh, Jackie, and the school principal Ms. Pepper to the scene. As a result, Barker is fired and replaced by the school's kind-hearted engineer, former NBA player Arthur Chaney, at Josh's suggestion. As the new basketball coach, Chaney starts implementing changes in the team, including benching Larry during a game for constant ball-hogging. Angry by Chaney's decision, Buck Willingham, Larry's overbearing father, forces Larry to leave the team. Buddy becomes the mascot of the school's basketball team and begins appearing in their halftime shows. After the Timberwolves lose one game, the team has subsequent success and qualifies for the State Final.

Just before the championship game, Snively appears after seeing Buddy on television. Hoping to profit out of Buddy's newfound fame, he forces Jackie to hand over Buddy, using papers proving that he is Buddy's legal owner. Knowing they do not have a choice, Jackie forces Josh to give Buddy back to Snively. After noticing that he's feeling withdrawn and depressed, Jackie regrets making Josh give up Buddy. Josh decides to rescue Buddy, suspecting he's being abused by Snively. He sneaks into Snively's backyard and finds Buddy chained up and abused again. Snively catches Josh escaping with Buddy, and pursues them in his dilapidated clown truck before crashing into a lake. Josh then decides to set Buddy free in the forest to find a new home. Initially, his team is losing at the next championship to the opposing team, which Larry turns out to have joined. Then Buddy returns for a joyful reunion for Josh and the team. When it is discovered that there is no rule that a dog can't play basketball, Buddy joins the roster and leads the team to a come from behind championship victory, with Josh scoring the game-winning buzzer beater.

Snively arrives and attempts to sue the Framm family for custody of Buddy, despite that his ownership papers were ruined when he crashed into the lake. Upon seeing Buddy, Judge Cranfield is disgusted and initially reluctant to judge a case over a dog, but agrees only under a strict condition that the case be executed seriously. During the trial, Josh protests against letting Snively have Buddy, mentioning the abuse that Buddy has suffered under him, including chaining Buddy to his fence. Jackie also protests, mentioning that Buddy was much happier with their family, and that she too has seen how abusive Snively is. After hearing a number of people protest against Snively, Cranfield doesn't believe that neither one has any real evidence in claiming ownership to Buddy. Soon, Chaney arrives and suggests that Buddy chooses his owner. As a fan of Chaney, Cranfield accepts his proposal and moves the court outside to the front lawn for Buddy to choose. After Buddy rips up the rolled-up newspaper that Snively had always abused him with, Buddy chooses Josh. When Snively angrily attempts to get Buddy back by force, police officers quickly take him away and arrest him, while Josh and the rest of the citizens rejoice and gather around Buddy to welcome him to his new home.

Much of the on-set dog motivation (not training) were performed by Justin Sherbert (formally Justin Sherman) of Free Willy fame. The animals were pet and treated with respect by Sherbert who noted, "motivating these dogs is significantly easier than teaching a whale to flip." Sherbert remains the canine motivator at large for the Air Bud franchise.

'''Andy Kerr Stadium''' is a 10,221-seat [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Hamilton (village), New York|Hamilton, New York]], United States. It was dedicated in honor of former Colgate football coach [[Andrew Kerr|Andy Kerr]] in September 1966.  There have been several upgrades to the facility in recent years.  In 1991, the stadium added the permanent Fred Dunlap Stands on the east side of the stadium. Dunlap is a former Colgate football head coach and athletic director. In 2003, a new three story press box was constructed behind the west stands of the stadium.  In 2006, the stadium added a new scoreboard with video capability. In 2007, Colgate replaced the natural grass surface with the synthetic playing surface [[FieldTurf]].

It is home to the [[Colgate University]] Raiders football and men's lacrosse teams.

On 29 February 2012, the [[Bahrain national football team|Bahraini]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] national [[association football]] teams faced each other in a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying match]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. The match was played at the [[Bahrain National Stadium]] in [[Riffa]], [[Bahrain]]. This match is known for the investigation called for by [[FIFA]] afterwards.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}

Before this match Bahrain needed to score nine goals in order to pass [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] and to move on to the next round in qualifying. They also needed Qatar to lose their next match against [[Iran national football team|Iran]] but due to an 83rd-minute equalizer the game finished 2–2 and thus Qatar progressed instead of Bahrain.&lt;ref name=telegraph9117977&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/9117977/Fifa-security-launches-investigation-into-Bahrains-unusual-10-0-victory-over-Indonesia.html|title=Fifa security launches investigation into Bahrain's 'unusual' 10–0 victory over Indonesia|work=The Telegraph|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the game, [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] required a winning margin of nine goals to stand any chance of progressing to the next stage.&lt;ref name=mail2108614&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2108614/FIFA-launch-investigation-Bahrain-10-0-win-Indonesia.html|title=FIFA launch investigation as Taylor's Bahrain win crucial World Cup qualifier 10–0|work=The Daily Mail|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the game, [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] had lost all five matches to date in their qualification group, allowing 16 goals in the process.&lt;ref name=telegraph9117977/&gt; Internal conflict in the [[Football Association of Indonesia]] lead them to prevent all [[Indonesia Super League]] players from playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/wire-news/indonesia-fa-confidentavoiding-fifa-ban_682641.html|title=Indonesia FA confident of avoiding FIFA ban|work=Reuters|date=19 March 2012|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They only sent players who play in the [[Indonesian Premier League]], although Indonesia's regular, better, and more experienced national players play in the [[Indonesia Super League]].

Prior to this match, Indonesia's record loss was 9–0, recorded in 1974 at the hands of [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref name=jg501839&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satwiko |first1=Wimbo |last2=Rahman |first2=Anita |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/football-blame-game-starts-after-indonesias-10-0-loss/501839 |title=Football: Blame Game Starts After Indonesia's 10–0 Loss |work=Jakarta Globe |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404163909/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/football-blame-game-starts-after-indonesias-10-0-loss/501839 |archivedate=4 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the six previous meetings between the two teams, each team had won twice, with two matches having been drawn.&lt;ref name=jg501839/&gt;

==Match summary==
Indonesia started the game with an inexperienced side, with no player holding more than 12 international [[Cap (sport)|caps]].&lt;ref name=dtaus&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/soccer/bahrain-coach-says-his-team-did-nothing-wrong-in-10-0-world-cup-qualifying-drubbing-of-weakened-indonesia/story-e6frey4r-1226322523205|title=Bahrain coach says his team did 'nothing wrong' in 10–0 World Cup qualifying drubbing of weakened Indonesia|work=The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the international debut for eight players in the Indonesia starting line up (except [[Syamsidar]], [[Irfan Bachdim]], and [[Ferdinand Sinaga]]).

[[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] suffered an early setback when their [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] Syamsidar was shown the [[Misconduct (association football)|red card]] in the first three minutes.&lt;ref name=mail2108614/&gt; After Bahrain scored the resultant penalty, they went on to be awarded a total of four penalties in the match, including three in the first half, although substitute Indonesia goalkeeper [[Andi Muhammad Guntur]] managed to save two of the four kicks.&lt;ref name=jg501839/&gt;

Baseball Park underwent further expansion in 2007 in preparation for a new [[Australian Baseball League]], which was originally intended to start in late 2007.  The upgrades provided increased corporate facilities and public seating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=271 Perth Heat going from strength to strength] www.austadiums.com. Retrieved 15 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the facility underwent further upgrades between the end of the [[2010 Claxton Shield|2009-2010 Claxton Shield]] season and the start of the ABL, which began in November 2010. The upgrades included a new, permanent, terraced bar, a batter's eye in centre field and an electronic scoreboard, while the outfield fences were also brought in to help fix the shortage of home runs at the venue in previous [[Claxton Shield]] seasons. Furthermore, an enclosed members area, numbered seats, an improved playing surface, upgraded corporate boxes, fences around the terraces and a new gameday office building were part of the improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wa.baseball.com.au/?Page=68757 Barbagallo Ball Park Upgrades] http://www.wa.baseball.com.au.

The '''Brisbane Entertainment Centre''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Boondall]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].  The centre is managed by [[AEG Ogden]].

The arena has an array of [[seating plan]]s which facilitate the comfort of its users, subject to performance. Specific seating plans are usually allocated, depending on the performance and the size of its audience. The general seating arrangements are end stage mode, "in the round" and intimate mode, which only uses half of the arena. The centre also houses a sporting complex and small function rooms which are available to hire for [[wedding reception]] and business functions.

The centre has 11,000 tiered seats and a maximum concert capacity of 14,500 making it the largest indoor live entertainment arena in Brisbane and the second largest permanent indoor arena in Australia behind only the 21,000 capacity [[Sydney Super Dome]] (it is smaller than the 14,820 seat [[Rod Laver Arena]] and the 14,856 seat [[Perth Arena]], though both of those venues have a [[retractable roof]]).&lt;ref name="eciw"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/entertainment-centre-in-worlds-top-20-20121017-27r82.html |title=Entertainment Centre in world's top 20 |author=Marissa Calligeros |accessdate=10 December 2012 |date=17 October 2012 |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019192659/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/entertainment-centre-in-worlds-top-20-20121017-27r82.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It cost $71 million to construct.&lt;ref name="lorsal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Power and Politics in the City: Brisbane in transition |editor1-first=Janice |editor1-last=Caulfield |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Wanner |chapter=Local Resource Allocation in the City: Structural-Institutional Power |last=Wanna |first=John |author2=Robyn Davies |year=1995 |publisher=Macmillan Education AU |isbn=0732929997 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjhLdOf9lgwC |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre's large audience capacity is mostly used for the staging of [[concerts]] and [[musical theatre]] shows, including [[Whitney Houston]]’s [[Nothing But Love World Tour]], [[One Direction]]'s [[Take Me Home Tour (One Direction)|Take Me Home Tour]], [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[Fearless Tour|Fearless]] and [[Speak Now World Tour|Speak Now]] Tours, [[Shawn Mendes]]' [[Illuminate World Tour]], [[Grease (musical)|Grease]], [[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]], and [[The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular]]. It has also staged [[ice-skating]] shows, including ''[[Disney On Ice]]''. The Entertainment Centre was also the filming venue for the original Australian series of [[Gladiators (Australian TV series)|Gladiators]] from 1995 to 1997.

==Location==
Located in Boondall, just off the Gateway Motorway, patrons can catch a [[Queensland Rail City network]] service to Boondall railway station, on the [[Shorncliffe railway line]], or travel by taxi. There are 4,000 car parking spaces. Buses do not run to the centre even on event nights.

==Brisbane Bullets==
From 1986–1997 the BEC was home to former [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] team the [[Brisbane Bullets]].

The Bullets won the 1987 NBL championship against the [[Perth Wildcats]], and secured their second NBL championship at this venue as they completed a two-game sweep of the Wildcats 2-0 after winning the first game which was played at the [[Challenge Stadium|Perth Superdome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbl.com.au/nbl-hq/history/year-by-year-history/80s/1987/ National Basketball League: 1987] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426192312/http://www.nbl.com.au/nbl-hq/history/year-by-year-history/80s/1987/ |date=26 April 2011 }}. Retrieved on 22 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the Brisbane Bullets won their second NBL championship and their first at the Entertainment Centre with a 2-0 series win over the [[Perth Wildcats]] (the Bullets previous championship win in 1985 was at the [[Chandler Arena|Sleeman Sports Centre]]).

In 1990 the Brisbane Bullets hosted games 2 and 3 of the National Basketball League Grand Final series against the Perth Wildcats, setting a new NBL attendance record for the time in Australia of 13,221 for game 2.

In 2007, the Brisbane Bullets won their third and last NBL championship when they defeated the [[Melbourne Tigers]] 3-1 in their best of five game series. The Entertainment Centre was used due to a date clash with the Bullets then home, the [[Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre]].{{cn|date=May 2013}}

The Brisbane Bullets returned to the NBL in [[2016–17 NBL season|2016–17]] and will again play some games at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CD5A0e2vbY Brisbane Bullets vs Adelaide 36ers highlights - 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">The '''British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame''' was founded in 1948 and is the third oldest [[ice hockey]] [[Hall of Fame]] in the world, behind the [[Russian and Soviet Hockey Hall of Fame]] (also founded in 1948) and the [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]] (founded in 1943). The Hall honours individuals who have made important contributions to the sport of hockey in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The Hall houses displays and exhibitions of memorabilia depicting significant contributions of players, coaches, referees and other individuals.

The Hall of Fame was founded by the weekly ''Ice Hockey World'' newspaper in 1948.  When the newspaper stopped being published in 1958, the Hall of Fame ceased to exist.  In 1986, the Hall was re-established by the British Ice Hockey Writers' Association (now called [[Ice Hockey Journalists UK]] (IHJUK)).

A sub-committee of IHJUK meets each year to decide on a list of potential inductees.  To be inducted, individuals must have contributed "outstanding service to British ice hockey".

'''Campo Mário Santiago''' is a football stadium in [[Angola]] owned by football club [[Progresso Associação do Sambizanga]]. Located in the club's home neighborhood of [[Sambizanga]], the 8,000-seat stadium whose rehabilitation began in 1996 with private funding and stopped afterwards for lack of funding, resumed in 2016 under a sponsorship deal with the [[Fundação Eduardo dos Santos]] (FESA). The stadium's capacity is expected to be increased to 18,000 seats following the 18-month-long rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/desporto/2016/5/25/Angola-Progresso-chairperson-points-out-gains-Mario-Santiago-Stadium,3750a826-fb47-418a-91fe-2a573a3c4c8a.html |title=Progresso chairperson points out gains of Mário Santiago Stadium |publisher=ANGOP.com |date=24 Jun 2016 |accessdate=24 Jun 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area were the court is located was the home ground of two football clubs that closed down in the post-independence period: Académica do Ambrizete and Benfica do Quinzau.

During the pro-communist rule that followed the country's independence in 1975, the area where the court is located was called '''Campo da Revolução''' (''Revolution Camp'') and was the venue of several firing-squad executions ordered by the [[MPLA]] regime in 1975, the most famous of which was the shooting of MPLA commander [[Virgílio Sotto Mayor]] under the charge of treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3384:biografia-oficial-do-nacionalista-virgilio-sotto-mayor&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=88&amp;lang=pt |title=Biografia oficial do nacionalista Virgílio Sotto Mayor ''(Official Biography of Virgílio Sotto Mayor)'' |publisher=club-k.net |date=31 Aug 2009 |accessdate=24 Jun 2016 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following that ill-famed period, the  field was renamed in honour of Angolan nationalist Mário Afonso Santiago (9 Sep 1942–13 Nov 1971), a local resident, ownership given to Progresso do Sambizanga and the construction work for the football stadium beginning afterwards.

==History==
Castelão was constructed from 1969 to 1973 and was inaugurated on November 11 of that year.

In May 2000, the Ceará state government started to reform the stadium. The reformations were divided in three stages, and started on May 16, 2001. The first stage consisted in the recovery of the ditches, and of the bleachers junctions, as well as the recovery of the low walls. The second stage of the reformation started on July 20, 2001, and consisted in the recovery and strengthening of the stadium's physical structure. The third stage consisted in the recovery of the electrical, hydraulic, sanitary, and electronic installations.&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"/&gt;

The inaugural match was played on November 11, 1973, when Ceará and Fortaleza drew 0-0. The stadium's first goal was scored on November 18, 1973 by Ceará's Erandy, when Ceará beat [[Esporte Clube Vitória|Vitória]] 1-0.&lt;ref name="templosdofutebol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Castelão |url=http://mavalem.sites.uol.com.br/ce/Fortaleza1.htm |accessdate=2008-09-13 |publisher=Templos do Futebol |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623200430/http://mavalem.sites.uol.com.br/ce/Fortaleza1.htm |archivedate=June 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-inaugural match was played on March 23, 2002, when the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] beat the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]] 1-0.&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"/&gt; The stadium's first goal after the re-inauguration was scored by Brazil's [[Luiz Carlos Bombonato Goulart|Luizão]].&lt;ref name="enciclopedialance"/&gt;
The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 118,496, set on August 27. 1980, when the Brazil national team beat the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]] 1-0.&lt;ref name="templosdofutebol"/&gt;

==2014 FIFA World Cup==
Castelão was one of the venues of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], which took place in Brazil. The stadium was redeveloped for the tournament; the reconstruction project, by Uruguayan architect [[Héctor Vigliecca]], involved the addition of a larger roof, the construction of an underground car park with 4,200 spaces, and a new lower tier.  After the redevelopment, the stadium now has an [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] capacity of 60,342.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The stadium closed on March 31, 2011 for the reconstruction project, which was officially completed in December 2012.&lt;ref name = "redevelopment"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20753289 |title=Brazil opens first World Cup 2014 stadium |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castelão was the first of 12 stadiums being built or redeveloped for the 2014 World Cup to be completed.&lt;ref name = "redevelopment"/&gt;

==Other events==
On July 9, 1980, it was opened in Fortaleza the 10th National Eucharistic Congress. [[Pope John Paul II]] participated in the celebrations of the Congress and the Estádio Castelão received the largest public of its history: 120,000 followers. On this occasion, during Virgílio Távora's government, the stadium was reformed, and the bleachers of the inferior section were concluded.

Another religious celebration happened on August 13, 1995. On this occasion the archbishop of Fortaleza Dom Aloísio Lorscheider farewell gathered 50 thousand followers.

Several artistic shows were made at the stadium. One of the most outstanding happened on December 10, 1996 when [[Xuxa]] commanded the animation to thousands of children.

|[[White and Black in chess|Black]]'s king is in check by the [[Rook (chess)|rook]].
}}

A '''check''' is a condition in [[chess]], [[shogi]], and [[xiangqi]] that occurs when a player's [[King (chess)|king]] (or general in xiangqi) is under threat of {{chessgloss|capture}} on their opponent's next turn. A king so threatened is said to be ''in check''. A player must get out of check, if possible, by [[Interposing (chess)|interposing]] a [[Piece (chess)|piece]] between the threatening piece and the king, capturing the threatening piece, or moving the king to a square where it is no longer in check. If the player cannot move out of check, the game ends in [[checkmate]] and the player loses. Players cannot make any move that puts their own king in check.
{{AN chess|pos=tocleft}}

==Introduction==
A check is the result of a move that places the opposing king under an immediate threat of capture by at least one of the player's pieces. Making a move that checks is sometimes called "giving check". If the king is in check and the checked player has no legal move to get out of check, the king is [[checkmate]]d and the player loses.

Under the [[rules of chess|standard rules of chess]], a player may not make any move that places or leaves their king in check. A player may move the king, capture the threatening piece, or [[Block (chess)|block]] the check with another piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|p=27}}, {{harvcol|Polgar|Truong|2005|pp=32,103}}, {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; A king cannot itself directly check the opposing king, since this would place the first king in check as well. A move of the king could expose the opposing king to a [[discovered check]] by another piece, however.

In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[chess variations|variations of chess]], such as [[Losing chess]], a player can move into check. In [[fast chess]], a player is permitted to leave their king in check, which results in them losing the game.

There may be up to three possible ways to get a king out of a single check on the following move:
#''Capturing the checking piece, with either the king or another piece.'' If the checking piece is on a square next to the king, the king can capture the piece if the king does not move into a new check (i.e. if the piece is not protected by another enemy piece). Likewise, a piece that is [[Pin (chess)|pinned]] to the king cannot capture the checking piece if such a move would place the king in check from the pinning piece.
#''Moving the king to an adjacent square where it is not in check.'' The king is not allowed to [[castling|castle]] when it is in check. The king may capture an enemy piece in a move to get out of check, as long as the piece is not protected.
#''Blocking the check.'' This only works if the checking piece is a [[Queen (chess)|queen]], [[Rook (chess)|rook]], or [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] and there is at least one empty square in the line between the checking piece and the checked king. Blocking a check is done by moving a piece to one such empty square. (The blocking piece is then [[Pin (chess)|pinned]] to the king by the attacking piece.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Polgar|Truong|2005|pp=32,103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the position in the first diagram, White can get out of check by any of three methods:
# Capturing the attacking piece by the move Nxa2.
# Moving the king to any unattacked square (marked with "x"); namely, Kd6, Ke5, or Ke7.
# Blocking the check by the move Rc4 or Nd5.

If a king is placed in [[double check]], the king must get out of both checks on the following move. Since it is impossible to capture both checking pieces or block both lines of attack in a single move, a double check can be escaped only by moving the king out of check.

If none of these possibilities can get the king out of check, then it is checkmated and the game is lost by the checkmated player.

==Types of checks==
A simple and very common type of check is when a piece moves to directly attack the opposing king only by itself. Sometimes such a check is part of a [[chess tactic]] such as a [[Fork (chess)|fork]], a [[Skewer (chess)|skewer]], or a [[discovered attack]] on another piece. In some cases, a check can be used to defend against such tactics.

There are also a few more special types of check:
*''[[Discovered check]]''. A discovered check is similar to any other type of discovered attack except that it is a discovered attack on the opposing king. In a discovered check, a piece moves out of the line of attack by another piece so that this other piece (which can be a queen, rook, or bishop) is then checking the opponent's king. The piece that actually moved in the discovered check move could possibly be any type of piece belonging to the same player as the checking piece except queen or the same type of piece administering the check. A discovered check could be a tactic in itself because the piece that moved could attack or otherwise create a threat to another piece on the checked king's side. The opponent has to get out of the discovered check on the following move and may not get a chance to thwart the attack by the other piece that moved.
*''[[Double check]]''. A double check is a check from two pieces to the opponent's king in a single move. This happens when a moved piece attacks the king, resulting in a second piece giving check by discovered check. It can also happen, though very rarely, when an ''[[en passant]]'' capture opens two lines of attack simultaneously. In algebraic chess notation, a double check move is sometimes noted with a "++" after the written move in place of the usual "+", although "++" has been used to indicate checkmate (along with "#").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=125&amp;view=article FIDE Laws of chess]&lt;/ref&gt; A double check cannot be blocked, nor can it be met by capturing one of the checking pieces (unless the king itself makes the capture), because there is check from two directions.
*''[[Cross-check]]''. When a check is answered by a check, particularly when this second check is delivered by a piece blocking the first, it is called a ''cross-check''. In fact, a "cross-checkmate" is also possible in that way (that is, to answer a check with a checkmate) but since no such term exists, it would be called cross-check as well. Cross-checks are rather rare in actual gameplay but are a popular theme in [[chess problems]].

==Announcing check and notation==
In friendly games, the checking player customarily says "check" when making a checking move.  Announcing "check" is not required under the [[rules of chess]] and it is usually not done in formal games. Until the early 20th century a player was expected to announce "check", and some sources of rules even required it {{Harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=74}}.

In [[algebraic chess notation]], a checking move is recorded like any other move, except that a "+" is normally written after the move.

In the [[FIDE]] rules for rapid chess, if a player leaves their king in check or commits any other illegal move their opponent can claim a win.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=171&amp;view=article (accessed 22 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Less commonly (and obsolete), the warning ''garde'' can be said when a player directly attacks the opponent's [[Queen (chess)|queen]] in a similar way. This was mostly abandoned in the 19th century {{Harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=74}}. The same move can be both ''check'' and ''garde'' simultaneously.  Before the queen acquired its current move (about 1495) the rook was the most powerful piece. At that time the term ''check-rook'' was used for a move that checked the king and attacked a rook at the same time {{Harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=75}}.

==Checking in tactics and strategy==
Sometimes checking an opponent provides no benefit to the checking player. This is called a "useless check" and it may even provide the checked opponent with a [[tempo (chess)|tempo]] (move opportunity) to move the king into a safer position {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=437}}. For example, 1.e4 e6 2.d4 Bb4+? does nothing for Black and in fact causes him to lose a tempo after 3.c3! A check given with the sole intention of delaying an inevitable defeat by one move is referred to as a "spite check", and may be considered somewhat unsporting {{harvcol|Eade|2005|p=65}}.

There are many instances, however, when checking the opponent's king may be a useful tactic or part of a tactic, either in attacking or in defense. Checking is often used in [[combination (chess)|combinations]] with many other tactics or simply to force an opponent into a position where the opposing king can be checkmated, otherwise taken advantage of, or is otherwise worse for the opponent. Some attacks involve numerous checks to force an opponent into a losing position, especially when the king is exposed. An unexpected check in a forced combination or an overlooked cross-check in a planned series of checks may serve as sort of a [[zwischenzug]], foiling the plan.

Some uses of checking:
* Repetitive checking to prevent losing a game going poorly (i.e. to [[draw (chess)|draw]] the game by [[perpetual check]]).
* Royal [[fork (chess)|fork]] ([[Knight (chess)|knight]] fork of king and queen) or other forks involving the king.
* Checks to force an [[Exchange (chess)|exchange]].
* A double check could be especially bad for the opponent since there are likely to be fewer options to get out of check. A double check is often more likely to lead to checkmate or loss of material.
* A check might force a king to move so that it cannot [[castling|castle]] later.
* Moving a piece to give check can sometimes open a line of attack on another piece. The opponent must escape the check, and therefore cannot (in general) prevent the other piece from being captured ([[discovered attack]]).
* Similarly, the piece moved to create a discovered check may attack another enemy piece, leading to the same scenario.
* The king may also, by being forced to move out of check, enable the checking piece to capture another piece (an absolute [[skewer (chess)|skewer]]).
* A check might force some piece to block it and therefore pose an absolute [[Pin (chess)|pin]] on that piece.
* A check might deflect the king from protecting some other piece (particularly in an [[chess endgame|endgame]], to capture opponent's pawns).
* A check could sometimes be used to foil an opponent's trap which would otherwise lead to loss of material.  For example, if an opponent forks two of a player's pieces, the attacked player may be able to move one of the forked pieces to check the opponent's king requiring the opponent to save it on his/her next move, thus allowing the player to then move the other forked piece to also save it from attack.

==History==
In early Sanskrit chess (c. 500–700) the king could be {{chessgloss|captured}} and this ended the game.  The Persians (c. 700–800) introduced the idea of warning that the king was under attack (announcing ''check'' in modern terminology).  This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game.  Later the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check.  As a result, the king could not be captured {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=22}}.

In this usage, the words "check" and "chess" come via Arabic from Persian ''shāh'', meaning "king"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goddesschess.com/chessays/shahmatjan.html "The King Is not Dead After All! The Real Meaning of Shah Mat or the Lesson of the Commode"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513054140/http://www.goddesschess.com/chessays/shahmatjan.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}, Jan Newton, GoddessChess.com, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; or "monarch" {{harvcol|Murray|2012|p=159}}.

'''Circle rules football''', commonly referred to as '''circle rules''', is a [[team sport|sport]] played between two teams of six with a large spherical ball similar to a [[exercise ball|stability ball]]. Invented in [[New York City]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/05/circle-rules-football/ Circle Rules Football: Experimental Theater Meets Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; the sport is currently played in cities across the [[United States]], as well as in several international locations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/fashion/17games.html?pagewanted=1 With Games They Invent, Artists Unleash the Athlete Within]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycmg/nyctvod/html/home/lnyc103.html Lunch NYC: From the Playground to the Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is played on a circular [[playing field|field]] with a central [[goal (sport)|goal]]. The goal has no [[net (device)|net]], as the two teams score through the goal from opposing directions. Around the goal is a circular area called the “key,” which only the teams’ [[goalkeeper|goalies]] may enter. Players outside the key may touch the ball with any part of their bodies, allowing them to [[dribbling|dribble]], [[kick (football)|kick]], roll, carry, and throw the ball; however, they may not hold the ball in any way that restricts its movement. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins.

==Gameplay==
Each team consists of six players (excluding substitutes), one of whom is the goalkeeper. Teams may be coed, though they are not required to be. Two [[referee]]s are on the field at all times; one watches over the key to call key violations and ensure the safety of the goalies, while the other moves freely around the field.

An official game consists of four fifteen-minute periods. Prior to the start of the game, a representative from each team participates in a "down-up." The two players stand opposite each other; on the referee's signal, they race to touch both [[scapula|shoulder blades]] to the ground and return to a stationary standing position. As in a [[coin flipping|coin toss]], the winner of the down-up gets to choose which direction his team will score and whether his team will [[kick-off (association football)|kick off]] or receive the ball at the start of the match.

The team that is kicking off gathers inside the key, while the other team takes up their positions outside. After the kick off, the kicking team must wait inside the key until a member of the other team has touched the ball; at this point the kicking team is released from the key, and no players except the goalies may reenter it until a goal has been scored. After each goal, the scoring team gathers inside the key and repeats this procedure.

Goals are scored by putting the ball through the goalposts in a team's designated direction. Each goal is worth one [[score (sport)|point]]. Outside the key, players may touch the ball with any part of their body; however, they cannot hold the ball with two hands or hold it against their body in a way that restricts the ball's movement. Players are free to dribble, kick, roll, carry, throw, and strike the ball, and they may move it in any direction around the field.

Physical contact between players on the field is limited. Incidental contact, as well as contact that is the result of a movement that causes contact with the ball before contact with another player, is generally not [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalized]]. The referees' discretion plays a large role in determining the type and intensity of contact that is allowed on the field.

Inside the key, the goalies attempt to defend their own side of the goal, while allowing their team to score through from the opposite direction. Goalies have [[contact sport|full contact]] with each other, allowing them to [[grappling|grapple]]; however, dangerous moves such as [[strike (attack)|striking]] and contact above the neck are forbidden. Goalies may leave the key to pursue the ball, but they may not have contact with each other outside the key. Goalies may not score for their own teams.

The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins. In the event of a [[tie (draw)|tie]], two five-minute halves of [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] are played.

===Field and equipment===
The game is generally played on a circular field of [[grass]] or [[artificial turf]], though it can also be played on other surfaces, including [[road surface|pavement]] and [[sand]]. The field is 50 meters in diameter. The goal (four meters wide and three meters high) sits in the center of the field, surrounded by a circular area called the key (8 meters in diameter).

The goalposts are typically constructed of 3/4 inch [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC piping]], a common material found in most hardware stores.

The spherical ball (55&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter), made of a soft [[Elastomer|elastic]], closely resembles a stability ball.

===Penalties===
The most common penalties are known as "key violations." Any non-goalkeeper who sets foot inside the key (at any time other than kickoff) receives a 30-second suspension from the game without a replacement. If a non-goalkeeper touches the ball while inside the key, the suspension is extended to 60 seconds. Any player who receives three key violations in one game will be suspended from the game for five minutes without a replacement.

Contact violations on the field are similar to soccer or basketball. Inadvertent violations result in a direct kick for the opposing team. Flagrant contact violations result in a 60-second ejection of the offending player and a direct kick. Malicious contact violations result in ejection from the game without replacement. Three violations within a game result in the player being ejected for the remainder of the game, however, they may be replaced after any ejection penalties if the final violation was not malicious.

A penalty may also be called on a player for holding the ball. The penalty for holding is an [[indirect free kick]] for the opposing team from the spot of the violation.

==History==
Circle rules football was created by Gregory Manley in 2006 as a senior [[thesis]] project for the Experimental Theater Wing, a division of [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/article-19224-forget-pills-take-pilates.html Forget Pills, Take Pilates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.good.is/shows/the-wild-frontier-of-sports The Wild Frontier of Sports: Circle Rules Football] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415084806/http://www.good.is/shows/the-wild-frontier-of-sports |date=2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aimed to highlight the similarities between [[drama]] and [[athletics (U.S.)|athletics]], demonstrating that “everything inherent in theater is inherent in sports.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/fashion/17games.html?pagewanted=1 With Games They Invent, Artists Unleash the Athlete Within]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has been played regularly in [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] since its inception. In the spring of 2009, [http://circlerulesfederation.com/ Circle Rules Federation] began running an official competitive [[sports league|league]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellesleynewsonline.com/sports/new-version-of-football-sweeps-college-campus-1.2110693 New version of football sweeps college campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229232054/http://www.wellesleynewsonline.com/sports/new-version-of-football-sweeps-college-campus-1.2110693 |date=2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first championship title was won by The Flying Mordecais.

Also in 2009, circle rules football was featured in the [http://www.comeoutandplay.org/ Come Out &amp; Play Festival], where it won the "Most Original Sport" and "Best in Festival" awards;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theduquesneduke.com/obscure-to-the-extreme-1.2571203 Obscure to the Extreme]&lt;/ref&gt; it was also featured at [https://archive.is/20130112223523/http://igfest.org/ igfest] 2009, where it was named "Best in Festival" and "Most Likely to be Played Again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eugene-michael-santiago/circle-rules-football_b_324456.html Circle Rules Football — The Road Ahead]&lt;/ref&gt;

Official league play resumed in Brooklyn in 2010, and The Flying Mordecais successfully defended their title. In both the 2011 and 2012 seasons, upstart team The Rebel Rousers went undefeated and claimed the championship.

==Variations==
In casual matches, a slightly pared down version of the game, known as "small rules," is often played. Small rules is played without goalies, and the width of the goal and the key are reduced to two and six meters, respectively. In this version of the game, players may enter the key, but they still may not touch the ball inside the area—unless their last point of contact with the ground was outside the key (as in the case of a jump or dive). Small rules is typically played with four members per team on the field at a time.

Since fall 2007, an event called the Harvest Tournament has been held annually. For this [[tournament]], a unique 3-on-3 version of small rules is played. The sixth Harvest Tournament took place in Prospect Park on Saturday, October 20, 2012.

In March 2010, an indoor variation of circle rules football was introduced in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23879961-circle-rules-football---a-whole-new-ball-game.do Circle Rules Football - a whole new ball game]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color Line Stadion''' is an [[association football]] [[stadium]] in [[Ålesund]], [[Norway]], and the home of [[Norwegian Premier League]] side [[Aalesunds FK]]. It was inaugurated in April 2005 and cost [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 160 million to build. It is referred to as '''Aalesund Stadion''' by [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2013/clubs/club=82819/matches/index.html |title=UEFA Europa League 2012/13 – Aalesunds FK |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first top-level stadium in Norway to feature [[artificial turf]], which was at the time a highly debated issue. When Aalesund opened the stadium, businessman Olav Nils Sunde donated a statue to the club, which was erected in front of the stadium. Whilst Sunde denied it, the statue bore a very strong resemblance to former Aalesund player [[John Arne Riise]]. In 2007, when Riise played in the Champions League Final, a Norwegian commentator demanded the statue officially carry his name. Riise himself has said, "[The name change] is not for me to decide. Everyone sees who it is, and I know that it was made for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/11/the-knowledge-footballers-degrees|title=Which footballers have degrees?|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 it has also hosted the home games of the [[Toppserien|Norwegian Women's Premier League]] side [[Fortuna Ålesund]]. The venue has hosted one [[Norway national under-21 football team]] match, playing 1–3 against [[Cyprus national under-21 football team|Cyprus]] on 3 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotball.no/System-pages/TabellTermin/?tournamentId=39901 |title=Norge Menn U21 |publisher=[[Football Association of Norway]] |language=Norwegian |archivedate=26 November 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63UG3Ayfy?url=http://www.fotball.no/System-pages/TabellTermin/?tournamentId=39901 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 survey carried out by the [[Norwegian Players' Association]] among away-team captains, Color Line Stadion was ranked eleventh amongst league stadiums, with a score of 2.87 on a scale from one to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |title=Lerkendal nest beste fotballbane |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYl4tTGG?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1723">'''Colpbol''' is a [[team sport]] invented in 2000 by [[Valencia]]n physical education teacher Juanjo Bendicho. Colpbol is characterized by its great dynamism, integration and egalitarianism, with all team members having equal importance, and with mixed gender teams the rule rather than the exception. The people who play this sport use “lechita de la chota” 

Colpbol is similar to [[Valencian pilota]] and [[handball]] (in that players strike the ball by hand) as well as [[futsal]] (in terms of size of the playing field, teams and goals).

Since its invention, the popularity of colpbol has spread from Valencia to the rest of Spain and to some countries in [[South America]]. There is a youth colpbol league in Spain with more than 3000 participants.

The '''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe''' was an international aeronautical speed competition instituted on 25 August 1909 by the French oil magnate [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]]. The race was reinstated three times through the years at the initiative of the [[Aéro-Club de France]], and later by  Deutsch de la Meurthe's widow Suzanne.

==First Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
Announced in 1906, the first Deutsch de la Meurthe competition was a speed trial intended for all powered aircraft over a distance of 200 kilometres, to be flown as an outward leg of 100 km followed by a return to the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551284g/f7.image.r=Deutsch%20de%20la%20Meurthe Bulletin Officiel de l'Aėro-Club de France] [[l'Aėrophile]], March 1906, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The flight had to be made between  1 March and  31 October, and the performance was recognized only if the previous best performance was surpassed by at least 10%. A bonus of 20,000 [[French franc|francs]] was awarded each year for the best performance that had remained unsurpassed for eight months. The Coupe (cup), an objet d'art valued at 10,000 francs, was to be given to the first aircraft builder who won three consecutive competitions.&lt;ref name=flight1919&gt;{{cite |journal=Flight |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201366.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de l a Meurthe |volume=XI |number=564|date=16 October 1919 |page= 1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===1912 competition===
Despite the substantial prize being offered, it took six years to attract participants. On 12 April 1912, [[Maurice Tabuteau]] piloting a 50&amp;nbsp;hp [[Gnome et Rhône|Gnome]]-powered [[Morane-Saulnier]] monoplane flew the circuit in 1 h 47 min 48 s, despite persistent navigation problems caused by fog. On 1 May 1912 Parisian Emmanuel Hélen completed the course at {{convert|119.532|kph|mph|abbr=on}} flying a 70&amp;nbsp;hp Gnome-powered [[Nieuport]] monoplane. Since no other pilot bettered this performance by more than 10% before 31 October 1912, Hélen became the first holder of the Coupe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200317.html Flight, 5 May 1921, p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1913 competition===
On 27 October 1913 [[Eugène Gilbert]] gained first place in the second competition for the Coupe, covering the course at an average speed of {{convert|154.38|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in a 160 h.p. Gnome-powered [[Deperdussin Monocoque]].

===1919/1920 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage 29V racer.jpg|thumb|Nieuport-Delage NiD.29V racer]]
The competition was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]], but on 13 October 1919 it resumed using the same course, but the competition was now open for the entire year, and the trophy would be definitely kept by the first participant whose time remained unbeaten for eight consecutive months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201390.html Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'' 23 October 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Four aeroplanes participated in this trial: a 180&amp;nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]]-powered [[Gourdou-Leseurre]] monoplane piloted by Rost, a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|SPAD]]-Herbemont piloted by [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]], a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Nieuport biplane piloted by [[Bernard Barny de Romanet]], and a 180&amp;nbsp;hp Le Rhöne-powered Nieuport monoplane designed by engineer Mary, and flown by the Danish pilot [[Leth Jensen]]. Taking off on 13 October 1919, Jensen flew the circuit at an average speed of 200.001&amp;nbsp;km/h (57 minutes). The next day, Rost reached an average speed of 210&amp;nbsp;km/h while de Romanet had an aircraft failure. On 15 October, Sadi-Lecointe flew a first circuit at 223&amp;nbsp;km/h, and then a second lap at 246.9&amp;nbsp;km/h and thus became the title holder. On 21 October 1919, de Romanet reached an average speed of 268.631&amp;nbsp;km/h which was insufficient to be homologated, because this performance was less than 110% of Sadi-Lecointe's performance. He followed it the next day with an average speed of 285.600 km/h which did count. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201420.html "The Coupe Deutsch"] ''Flight'' 30 October 1919 p1422&lt;/ref&gt; Bad weather then stopped the competition, which was resumed just three months later. On 3 January 1920, Sadi-Lecointe, who had in the meanwhile had left [[Blériot-SPAD]] for Nieuport, reached {{convert|266.314|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;"The Deutsch Cup Contest" ''Flight'' 8 January 1920 p56&lt;/ref&gt;  with a Hispano-engined [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29]]V. On 3 August 1920, he became the holder of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, his performance having remained unbeaten.

==Second Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1920, following the ending of the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Trophy]] competition due to a third consecutive French victory, the Aéro-Club de France decided to organize a new competition to replace it. This was named ''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe'' to honour [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]], who had died on 24 November 1919; the competition was funded by his family.

It remained a speed competition, but was now to be held on a given date. The competition was to be held as 3 laps of a 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) circuit, with its start at [[Étampes]] and a turn made at la Marmogne farm at [[Gidy]]. The competition was open for three years and was international, with each country allowed three entrants. A sum of 60,000 francs was to be awarded each year for the best performance, and a cup valued at 20,000 francs given to the winner. In the case of the cup being won outright before the end of the competition, the winner would also received the remaining prize money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200327.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal=Flight |date=12 May 1921 |page=327 |format=pdf |number=645 |volume=XIII)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan.jpg|thumb|Nieuport NiD.41 Sesquiplan]]
There were seven participants in this race, which was held on 1 October. No eliminating heats were needed to select from the five French pilot entrants, since Count [[Bernard Barny de Romanet|Bernard de Romanet]] died when the wing fabric of his Lumière-De Monge monoplane&lt;ref group=note&gt;The aircraft could be configured as either a biplane or a monoplane.&lt;/ref&gt; detached at high speed during the elimination trials on 23 September, and at the last moment [[Hanriot (aircraft company)|Hanriot]] withdrew their entrant, the Hanriot HD.22. This was a metal monoplane with retractable landing gear expressly built for the race, and which had been intended to be piloted by Rost. Nieuport entered two [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29|Nieuport NiD.29V]]s  piloted by Sadi-Lecointe and Ferdinand Lasne, and a [[Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan|NiD.41 Sesquiplan]] was entrusted to Georges Kirsch. A 700&amp;nbsp;hp Fiat-powered [[Fiat Aviazione|Fiat]] biplane piloted by [[Francesco Brack Papa]] represented Italy, and British pilot Herbert James flew a 450&amp;nbsp;hp [[Napier Lion]]-powered [[Nieuport Nighthawk|Gloster Mars I]] (G-EAXZ).&lt;ref name=flight1921&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200650.html The Coupe de Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'', 29 September 1921, pp. 650-651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;
A broken propeller forced Sadi-Lecointe to make a forced landing in a beet field at Cernonville, injuring an eye and both legs in the process. The wing fabric of James' aeroplane was torn away, and he had to make a forced landing. Brach Papa established a new Italian speed record, but the engine exploded before the finish. Thus, only two Nieuport pilots were left to finish the race, Georges Kirsch winning with a speed of 282.75&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new world speed record for a distance of 300&amp;nbsp;km); Fernand Lasne's speed was 259.03&amp;nbsp;km/h.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

===1922 competition===
The 1921 circuit remained unchanged for the 1922 competition, which was held on 30 September. Nieuport-Astra&lt;ref group=note&gt;Nieuport having taken over the [[Société Astra]] by this point&lt;/ref&gt; entered a Nieuport NiD.29V piloted by Lasne and the sesquiplane piloted by Sadi-Lecointe, [[Jean Casale]] was piloting a Blériot-SPAD S.58, a design based on the [[Blériot-SPAD S.41|S.41 fighter]]. Fiat and Gloster were presenting the same machines and pilots as the preceding year. Assigned to their factory pilot Berthelin, who was new to this competition, the NiD.41 was retired at the last moment. The [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] Simplex aircraft which was supposed to be piloted by [[Georges Madon]] had an accident during its tests, and [[Charles Nungesser]] was absent.&lt;ref name=flight1922&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200573.html |title=The race for the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal= Flight |date=5 October 1922 |pages=573-576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Nieuport sesquiplane named ''Eugène Gilbert'' (race number 5), Sadi-Lecointe covered the first 100&amp;nbsp;km at an average speed of 325&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new closed circuit speed record), but a spark plug popped out of its cylinder and passed through the engine cowling as he was turning around the airport pylon. The pilot was therefore forced to land, and the airplane hit a gutter which turned the aircraft on its back without injuring the pilot. James lost his maps during his flight and unable to find the turning point returned to the start. Jean Casale's SPAD S.58 ''Louis Blériot'' (race no.3) was victim of a radiator leak, and made a forced landing at Étampes and was unable to finish the race, as was also the case for Brack-Papa's [[Fiat B.R.|Fiat R.700]] which had a fuel pump failure.{{cn|date=September 2015}} The first lap made by the Italian pilot at 288&amp;nbsp;km/h (179&amp;nbsp;mph) was not homologated since the aircraft had flown behind the time-keepers at the starting point, but he was offered a second attempt. Brack-Papa started a second time but retired when he realized he would not be able to beat Lasne, ) who won the competition with an average speed of 289.90&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=flight1922/&gt;

==Third Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1931 Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe initiated a new competition for the Coupe, which was contested for the first time on 29 May 1933. The trial was to be run in two 1,000&amp;nbsp;km stages separated by a 90 minutes refuelling stop, and was limited to aircraft with an engine capacity of less than eight litres. The starting point of the race was still at Étampes. Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe was offering one million Francs, and the Ministère de l'Air (Air Ministry) offered another three million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200422.html Flight, 6 May 1932, p. 390]&lt;/ref&gt;
===1933 competition===
[[File:Potez 53 Musee du Bourget P1010709.JPG|thumb|A Potez 53]]
On 24 May 1933 Captain [[Ludovic Arrachart]] was killed when his [[Caudron C.362|Caudron C.360]] (race no.11) crashed due to engine failure at Maisons near [[Chartres]] while he was training for the competition.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65535525/f6.image.r=caudron|date=June 1933|page=166|title=La Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was won by Georges Détré flying a [[Potez 53]] powered by a Potez 9B radial engine developing barely 310&amp;nbsp;hp at full power at a speed of {{convert|322.81|kph|mph}},  beating Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 (race no.6) with a speed of {{convert|291.12|kph|mph}}, and also beating the only foreign competitor, [[Nick Comper]] flying [[Comper Swift]] ''G-ABWW'' {{convert|239.58|kph|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; A third French competitor, test pilot Lemoine also flying a Potez 53, was forced to abandon the race.&lt;ref name=flight1934-510&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200510.html Flight, 24 May 1934, pp. 510-511]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 competition===
[[File:Caudron 460 Le Bourget 2009.jpg|thumb|A Caudron C.460 replica]]
[[File:GMars.jpg|thumb|Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ)]]
On 27 May 1934, the race was a duel between the Caudron pilots, the [[Caudron]] firm presenting two racing aircraft designed by [[Marcel Riffard]]. [[Maurice Arnoux]] won with a C.450 at a speed of 388.97&amp;nbsp;km/h overtaking Louis Massotte's [[Régnier Motor Company|Regnier]]-engined (and sponsored) C.366 (360.72&amp;nbsp;km/h) and Albert Monville's Renault-engined [[Caudron C.460]] (341.04&amp;nbsp;km/h). Nick Comper flew the [[Comper Streak]] (G-ACNC), but retired on the 6th lap of the afternoon session as problem with the undercarriage limited his speed. Georges Detre flying a [[Potez 53]]-2 retired after problems with his engine oil supply. The [[Potez 53]]-3 had problems with its variable pitch propeller and was unable to start for the second section,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flight1934-510/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1933/1933%20-%200976.html Flight, 9 Nov 1933, p. 976]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200480.html Flight, 17 May 1934, pp. 476, 480-481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200531.html Flight, 31 May 1934, pp. 531-532]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 competition===
The 1935 race was arguably the most exciting{{cn|date=September 2015}} competition of them all, and was the consecration of the Caudron-Renault racers. Eight pilots were registered for this event, but the [[Nennig C-3]] (race no.4) of [[Guy Bart]] was not ready, and the Régnier Martinet, a modified Caudron C.366, (race no.2) was damaged during its tests. Two Caudron C.560s were supposed to participate (race no.1 and 3), but were not ready. They were thus replaced by a [[Caudron C.430]] and a C.450 with the same race numbers.&lt;ref name=flight1935&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1935/1935%20-%201324.html "A Family Affair"] ''Flight'', 30 May 1935, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;

The course was over 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;miles), from [[Etampes]] aerodrome to [[Chartres]] [[Boncé|Bonce]] and back. The race itself was in two stages, each of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (625&amp;nbsp;miles).

Charles Franco was the first to take off in Caudron C.430 (race no.1), but abandoned the race on the fourth lap as he was clearly out-classed by the other aircraft. It was followed by the Caudron C.460s of [[Yves Lacombe]] (race no.5), [[Raymond Delmotte]] (Caudron's chief pilot) (race no.8 ), and [[Maurice Arnoux]] (race no.6) respectively, this last entrant having to quit the race after seven laps, having run out of oil after a high-speed lap at {{convert|469|km/h|abbr=on}}. [[Albert Monville]]'s Caudron C.450 (race no.3) was the last to take off. Only three aircraft qualified for the second part of the race, which was held during rain showers. Raymond Delmotte won, ahead of Yves Lacombe and Maurice Arnoux, flying the aircraft previously flown by Albert Monville .&lt;ref name=flight1935/&gt;

==Fourth Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
On 13 September 1936, a last competition was organized, in which two [[Caudron C.461]]s, one Caudron C.450 and two [[Caudron C.560]]s took part. Yves Lacombe won this race with a speed of only {{convert|389.462|km/h|abbr=on}}, overtaking Maurice Arnoux timed at {{convert|369.59|km/h|abbr=on}}, a performance barely superior to what had been established in 1934, probably because of bad engine tuning in a competition presenting no real challenge for the engine and aircraft manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202782.html ''Flight'', 15 October 1936, p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source does not mention anything save Lacombe won|date=September 2015}}

The '''Death Lineup''' is a group of smaller [[basketball]] players on the [[Golden State Warriors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Developed under head coach [[Steve Kerr]], it began during their 2014–15 run that led to an [[NBA championship]]. Unlike typical [[small ball (basketball)|small-ball]] units, this Warriors lineup is versatile enough to defend larger opponents, while also aiming to create mismatches on offense with their shooting and playmaking skills.&lt;ref name=tjarks_09062016&gt;{{cite news|last=Tjarks|first=Jonathan|title=The NBA’s New Lineups of Death|date=September 6, 2016|work=The Ringer|url=https://theringer.com/the-nbas-new-lineups-of-death-7e52303954a1|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheringer.com%2Fthe-nbas-new-lineups-of-death-7e52303954a1&amp;date=2017-06-10|archivedate=June 10, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slater_05152016&gt;{{cite news|last=Slater|first=Anthony|title=A clash of styles: The Thunder's big lineup against the Warriors' small-ball unit|date=May 15, 2016|newspaper=The Oklahoman|url=http://newsok.com/article/5498376|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewsok.com%2Farticle%2F5498376&amp;date=2017-06-10|archivedate=June 10, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dubin_03072018&gt;{{cite news|last=Dubin|first=Jared|title=Golden State's Death Lineup Has Been DOA on Defense|date=March 7, 2018|work=Vice Sports|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/437ead/golden-states-death-lineup-has-been-doa-on-defense|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313130130/https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/437ead/golden-states-death-lineup-has-been-doa-on-defense|archivedate=March 13, 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lineup features the [[Splash Brothers]], a [[Three-point field goal|three-point shooting]] backcourt consisting of two-time [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP]] [[Stephen Curry]], and perennial two-way All-Star [[Klay Thompson]]. It also features versatile defender [[Andre Iguodala]] on the [[Swingman|wing]] alongside scorer [[Kevin Durant]], and 2016–17 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] [[Draymond Green]] at [[Center (basketball)|center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/warriors-death-lineup-game-5-finals-2017-6|title=The Warriors waited until the right moment to unleash their greatest weapon, and the Cavs had no answer|work=Business Insider|access-date=August 6, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green's defensive versatility has been described as the "key" that allows the lineup to be so effective; although his natural position is [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], he is able to play as an undersized center in lieu of a traditional center who might be slower or lack the playmaking and shooting abilities of Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warriorsworld.net/2016/02/03/draymond-green-drives-the-golden-state-machine/|title=How Draymond Green Drives the Golden State Machine – Warriors World|last=Tsan|first=Pin|access-date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/golden-state-warriors/post/_/id/1313/draymond-green-as-the-top-center-its-no-joke|title=Warriors' Draymond Green as NBA's top center?

== History ==
In [[2014–15 Golden State Warriors season|2014–15]], Golden State won 67 games in the regular season, led by [[NBA MVP]] [[Stephen Curry]]. The Warriors' starting lineup with the {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} [[Andrew Bogut]] at [[center (basketball)|center]] played 813 minutes together and outscored opponents by 19.6 points per 100 possessions. After falling behind 2–1 in the [[2015 NBA Finals]], Warriors coach [[Steve Kerr]] inserted [[Andre Iguodala]] into the starting unit for Bogut, who had been named to [[NBA All-Defensive Team]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="golliver_06122016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Golliver|first=Ben|title=Warriors start small, then stay small, to blow out Cavs and even NBA Finals|date=June 12, 2015|work=SI.com|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/12/steve-kerr-nba-finals-andre-iguodala-lebron-james-game-4-warriors-cavaliers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521141920/https://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/12/steve-kerr-nba-finals-andre-iguodala-lebron-james-game-4-warriors-cavaliers|archivedate=May 21, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg-Melches-Stadion''' was a [[stadium]] in [[Essen]], [[Germany]]. It was built in 1923, renovated to the former state in 1939, 1948 and 1954&lt;ref name="verganegloriemm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martijnmureau.nl/vergane-glorie-georg-melches-stadion/ |title=History of the Georg Melches Stadion |publisher=martijnmureau.nl |date= |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a capacity of 30,000. Due to safety reasons this was reduced to 15,000 from 1994 onwards.  It was used, mostly, for [[Association football|football]] matches of [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] and concerts. The stadium was demolished by August 2012.

In 1920, the predecessor of Rot-Weiss Essen bought a piece of land at the PHönixstrasse (which was later renamed to Hafenstrasse). After the purchase it appeared that the land was too short to build a stadium. In the years after, the club purchased the remaining lands and construction of the stadium began. In 1923 the club built three stands, which could hold 10,00 spectators.&lt;ref name="verganegloriemm"/&gt; In 1939 the club built a new stadium on the same location, allowing the capacity to grow to roughly 27,000. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the stadium was heavily damaged. In 1948 the renovation and reconstruction of it was finished and in the early 1950s Rot-Weiss Essen planned on building a new multifunctional main stand.

The ideas behind this new main stand would be a revolution on the European mainland.&lt;ref name="anderhafenstrasse"&gt;{{cite book | first = Uwe| last = Wick | title = An der Hafenstraße, RWE! | publisher = Verlag die Werkstatt | location = Götingen | year = 2011 | page = 205| isbn = 978-3-89533-820-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Melches had a vision a multifunctional stand, in which a sporthall, a sauna, offices, residential units, commercial units and a press room were present. The construction would be made out of concrete and in 1954 the building was officially inaugurated. German and European papers were positive on these developments and even called the stadium the German Highbury, as an example to Arsenal’s former stadium. In 1952 Rot-Weiss Essen won the German Cup and in 1954 it won the German national championship. In 1956 Georg Melches and Rot-Weiss Essen installed the first floodlight installation of [[BRD (Germany)|West Germany]]. The stadium was an example for other stadiums.&lt;ref name="anderhafenstrasse"/&gt; Due to medical conditions, Georg Melches stepped down and died in 1963. In 1964 Rot-Weiss Essen renamed the stadium to the Georg Melches Stadion.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

After Melches’ death, Rot-Weiss Essen couldn’t have the same successes as in the 1950s. It also appeared that all the club’s money was invested in the stadium and the club had troubles in investing the little money left in new players. When West Germany was chosen as hosts for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], the club hoped investors and the municipality of Essen would invest into the stadium to make it a host for the World Cup. This didn’t happen and rivals [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]] built a new stadium to host matches for the World Cup. With the little money left, Rot-Weiss Essen invested in renovating the stadium in 1975. Relegation from the 1. Bundesliga in 1977 and financial problems forced the club to sell the Georg Melches Stadium to Essen in 1979.

The municipality of Essen invested almost nothing in the renovation of the stadium and due to safety reasons parts of the stadium were closed down and demolished in 1994. The capacity was reduced to 15,000. In 2010 it was announced that Rot-Weiss Essen would build a new stadium 100 meters from the Georg Melches Stadion. One of the stands was cut into half, leaving the stadium with only 2.5 stands. On May 19, 2012, Rot-Weiss Essen played their last match in the stadium against [[Fortuna Köln]]. Two days later the Georg Melches Stadion was demolished and in August 2012 the [[Stadion Essen]] was opened.

'''Holiday Park''' was a [[association football|football]] ground and [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] stadium in [[Durham, England|Durham]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Durham City A.F.C.|Durham City]] between 1923 and 1939.

==History==
Holiday Park opened in 1923 when Durham City left their [[Kepier Haughs]] ground. The club brought the wooden seated stand from the previous ground, which remained the only spectator facility at Holiday Park during the club's spell in [[the Football League]]. The first League match at the ground was played on 1 September 1923, with 4,000 spectators watching a 0–0 draw with [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] The ground's record attendance of 7,182 was set soon afterwards for an FA Cup qualifying match against [[West Stanley F.C.|West Stanley]] on 17 September 1923.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p66, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durham were voted out of the Football League in 1928, and the last Football League match was played at Holiday Park on 5 May 1928, when 5,000 spectators saw Durham beat [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] 5–1. In 1937 a new 2,000 capacity stand was built as the ground was adapted for greyhound racing. This involved reducing the size of the pitch, and ultimately caused Durham City to fold in 1938.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durhamcityafc.com/pages.php?page_id=131 History] Durham City A.F.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was subsequently expanded as it continued to be used for greyhound racing. It was later demolished, with the site used by the electricity board.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

===Greyhound racing===
Independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place at Holiday Park from 23 October 1937 with the ground undergoing improvements including a new 2,000 capacity stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/427284/542930/12/101200|title=OS County Series Durham 1939|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racing ended in 1954.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]] again plays his [[working class]] [[underdog (competition)|underdog]], gormless, gullible, indefatigable and triumphant hero. A weakling, Formby's character overcomes obstacles to beat a corrupt rival in the [[boxing]] ring. He plays a scrawny barber's assistant who, in response to the keep fit fad sweeping through Britain at the time, dreams of a better physique, and sings of it in the catchy "Biceps, Muscle and Brawn". He falls in love with a beautiful manicurist, and competes for her affections with a muscle bound thug. The manicurist is more attracted to the brute until the barber can prove that he is a crook, and defeat him in the boxing ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/keep-fit-v97582 |title=Keep Fit (1937) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nield |first=Anthony |url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/72385/keep-fit.html#ixzz2t9B1QvG1 |title=''Keep Fit'' DVD Video Review|publisher=Film, the digital fix|date=8 April 2010|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish players and game theoreticians have long been involved in the game of chess and have significantly contributed to the development of chess, which has been described as the "Jewish National game".

Although making up less than 0.2% of the world's population, of the first 13 undisputed [[Chess world champion|world champions]], over 50% were Jewish, including the first two. The Modern school of chess espoused by [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Siegbert Tarrasch]]; the [[Hypermodernism (chess)|Hypermodernism]] influenced by [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] and [[Richard Réti]]; and the [[Soviet Chess School]] promoted by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] were all strongly influenced by Jewish players. Other influential Jewish chess theoreticians, writers and players include [[Johannes Zukertort|Zukertort]], [[Savielly Tartakower|Tartakower]], [[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker]], [[Akiba Rubinstein|Rubinstein]], [[Gyula Breyer|Breyer]], [[Rudolf Spielmann|Spielmann]], [[Samuel Reshevsky|Reshevsky]], [[Reuben Fine|Fine]], [[David Bronstein|Bronstein]], [[Miguel Najdorf|Najdorf]], [[Mikhail Tal|Tal]], [[Bobby Fischer|Fischer]], and [[Judit Polgár|Polgár]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Edward|title=Chess and Jews|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/jews.html|publisher=chesshistory.com|accessdate=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest Chess Players|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1004505|publisher=Chessgame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovich|first=Felix|title=Jewish Chess Masters on Stamps|year=2000|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Arpad Elo]], the inventor of the scientific rating system employed by the [[FIDE]] analysed some 476 major tournament players from the nineteenth century onward and of the fifty-one highest ranked players, approximately one-half were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elo|first=Arpad|title=The Rating of Chess Players, Past and Present|year=1978|publisher=ARCO|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the strongest ever players was the half Jewish [[Garry Kasparov]], who was world No. 1 from 1985 until his retirement in 2005; however Kasparov has described himself as a "self-appointed Christian"&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Kasparov]]&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to follow his mother's faith. The strongest female chess player in history by far is the Jewish [[Judit Polgár]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Top Chess players|url=http://ratings.fide.com/toplist.phtml?list=men|publisher=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently a strong Jewish presence among the world's best players. Currently, the world number two, [[Levon Aronian]] from Armenia, is half-Jewish. [[Beersheba]] in Israel is the city with the most chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]] per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabinowitz|first=Gavin|title=Beersheba Masters Kings, Knights, Pawns|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/30/news/adfg-ichess30|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has also won one silver and one bronze medal at [[Chess Olympiad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olimpbase.org/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.olimpbase.org%2Folympiads%2Fmen_results.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of Jewish participation in chess is discussed extensively in academic and popular literature. One such book devoted to the topic is ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qhz9AAAACAAJ The Great Jewish Chess Champions]'' by Harold U. Ribalow and Meir Z. Ribalow, [[Hippocrene Books]], 1987, {{ISBN|0-87052-305-8}}. Others include ''[http://www.getcited.org/pub/100093138 Chess, Jews, and history]'', by [[Victor Keats]], 1994, Oxford Academia Publishers, {{ISBN|1-899237-00-3}}, [http://www.getcited.org/pub/100093139 ''Chess Among the Jews: A Translation and Explanation of the Work of Moritz Steinschneider''], by Victor Keats, 1995, {{ISBN|1-899237-02-X}}, ''[http://www.getcited.org/pub/100307178 Chess in Jewish history and Hebrew literature]'', by Victor Keats, 1995, Magnes Press, {{ISBN|965-223-915-1}}, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=gGoqKT91lMsC&amp;dq=jews+chess&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Can I Play Chess on Shabbas''], by Joe Bobker, 2008, {{ISBN|965-229-422-5}}.

[[File:GSU Auditorium Atlanta.JPG|thumb|GSU Dahlberg Hall, 2012]]
[[File:Atlanta Auditorium 1910s.jpg|thumb|Atlanta Municipal Auditorium with original brick facade]]
'''Atlanta Municipal Auditorium''', originally known as the ''Auditorium and Armory'', was an [[auditorium]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], USA. It was constructed with funds raised by a committee of Atlanta citizens and then sold to the city of Atlanta.

The structure was dedicated in a pre-inaugural visit from President [[William Howard Taft]] in 1909 during which he was served a [[Virginia opossum|possum]] dinner, and the dining hall in which this event took place was named in his honor. The public dedication of the Auditorium took place with the hosting of the inaugural Atlanta Music Festival in May 1909. The Auditorium and Armory also housed the 179th Field Artillery, who stored munitions there as well as using the space for drills.

Over the years various concerts, theater productions, [[opera]]s, balls, and [[professional wrestling]] matches were hosted at the auditorium, as were the 1922 to 1932 [[Southern Conference]] men's [[basketball]] tournaments. One additional event of note was the ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Ball, held in conjunction with the 1939 [[premiere]] of the film. 

The building originally had a red [[brick]] [[facade]]. After a 1940 fire the original architect, [[John Robert Dillon]], redesigned the exterior and it was rebuilt with a [[marble]] facade.

Until [[Woodruff Arts Center]] opened, the Municipal Auditorium was the home of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]].

The building was sold in 1979 to [[Georgia State University]] which now uses the structure as their Alumni Hall. On September 17, 2010, Georgia State University renamed their Alumni Hall Dahlberg Hall, after alumnus A. W. "Bill" Dahlberg.

Atlanta Municipal Auditorium is located at Gilmer and Courtland Streets in [[downtown Atlanta]].

'''Haji Rahimni bin Haji Pundut''' (born 5 January 1987) is a [[Brunei]]an [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Setia Perdana FC]] in the [[Brunei Super League]] as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faisal one of Setia Perdana’s key players|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/faisal-one-of-setia-perdanas-key-players/|date=17 March 2016|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a typing error, his patronym is mistakenly referred to as '''Pundat'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleague.com/Web/main.aspx?ID=e186a16b-ced4-4bad-a458-90e301728dc0|title=SLeague Portal: DPMM|publisher=[[S.League]]|date=|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822045646/http://www.sleague.com/Web/main.aspx?ID=e186a16b-ced4-4bad-a458-90e301728dc0|archivedate=22 August 2009|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Rahimni previously played for professional club [[Brunei DPMM FC]] in the [[2009 S.League]] season, DPMM's first and eventful season in [[Singapore]] after withdrawing from the [[Malaysia Super League]]. He only saw one minute of playing time, against [[Sengkang Punggol FC|Sengkang Punggol]] on 6 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Match Statistics for Match 0102 - Sengkang Punggol FC vs Brunei DPMM FC|url=http://www.sleague.com/match-details/?id=SL/09-0102|date=|publisher=S.League|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the bench for the final of the [[2009 Singapore League Cup#Final|2009 Singapore League Cup]], picking up a winner's medal as DPMM won the game 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.redsports.sg/2009/06/20/league-cup-final-saffc-brunei-dpmm/|title=League Cup eludes SAFFC as Brunei DPMM FC win on penalties|publisher=Red Sports Singapore|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahimni moved to [[Setia Perdana]] in 2011 for the Brunei National Football League, a competition ran by the newly established [[National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] to determine the teams for a new league that was to become the [[2012–13 Brunei Super League]]. His club finished third in the one-off league, placing them in the [[2014 Brunei Premier League|2014]] [[Brunei Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei 2011/12|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/brunei2012.html|date=13 December 2012|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2015, Rahimni scored a three-minute hattrick in a 4-2 victory against [[Kasuka FC]], a feat possibly yet to be equalled in Bruneian football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/06/01/hj-rahimni-stars-setia-perdana%E2%80%99s-victory|title=Hj Rahimni stars in Setia Perdana’s victory|publisher=The Brunei Times|date=1 June 2015|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702234632/http://bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/06/01/hj-rahimni-stars-setia-perdana%E2%80%99s-victory|archivedate=2 July 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahimni finished the 2015 season as top scorer for the Brunei Premier League with 16 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DST PREMIER LEAGUE 2015 top scorers|url=http://nfabd.org/schedules/dst-premierleague-2015-scorer.htm|date=13 August 2015|publisher=[[National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahimni scored a total of seven goals to lift Setia Perdana to first place in the [[2017 Brunei Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IKLS promoted to DST Premier League with win over DSP United|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/ikls-promoted-to-dst-premier-league-with-win-over-dsp-united/|date=30 September 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought promotion for Setia to the [[2018–19 Brunei Super League]].

'''''Red Dirt Rising''''' is a 2011 film starring Brad Yoder, Burgess Jenkins and Brett Rice based on the book ''Red Dirt Tracks: The Forgotten Heroes of Early Stockcar Racing'' by Gail Cauble Gurley telling the true story of race car driver [[Jimmie Lewallen]]. The film dramatizes the birth of [[NASCAR]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Plot ==
The film tells the true story of stock car racing legend  [[Jimmie Lewallen]] and his friends [[Bill Blair (NASCAR driver)|Bill Blair, Sr.]] and Fred Harb.  Early in his life, Jimmie Lewallen struggles to dig himself out of a life of poverty. Choosing to attempt a living by bootlegging, he and his lifelong friend Bill Blair risk everything but through attempts to build a faster get-a-way vehicle for bootlegging, they inadvertently become a part of the birth of stock-car racing. As time passes, Jimmie marries his wife Carrie James and starts a family but the pressures of family responsibilities starts to tear Jimmie away from his love of stock-car racing. In one critically historic moment, Jimmie turns down an offer from future NASCAR founder, [[Bill France Sr.]] at an opportunity to "buy into NASCAR" for $500.00. Jimmie refused, saying "it would never amount to anything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legends of NASCAR - Jimmie Lewallen|url=http://www.legendsofnascar.com/Jimmie_Lewallen.htm|publisher=Legends of NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Set during the 1930s and 1940s, the film portrays the life and times of those involved with stock car racing before NASCAR was a household name.

In 1997, Lassiter won the 1500 meters at the [[USATF]] Outdoor National Championships.  While still a collegian, he was ranked as the number 2 1500 meter runner in the US by ''[[Track and Field News]]'' magazine after both the 1997 and 1999 seasons.

===Post-collegiate===
Lassiter continued running for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] following the completion of his college eligibility.

In 2001, Lassiter won the mile at the [[USA Indoor Track and Field Championships]] and followed that by finishing sixth at the [[2001 IAAF World Indoor Championships]] in [[Lisbon, Portugal]].  He then finished second in the 1500 meters at the USATF Outdoor Championships in the same year.  He was again ranked #2 in the US by ''Track and Field News'' at the completion of the season.

Lassiter had another strong season in 2002, again winning the 1500 meters at the USATF Outdoor National Championships and again ranking #2 in the US.

In 2002, Lassiter admitted to serving as a pacemaker in the 1500-meters for then-[[Kenya]]n [[Bernard Lagat]] at the [[2002 IAAF World Cup|World Cup]] competition.  Lassiter and Lagat were training partners at the time and Lassiter’s actions took him out of the running in the race and eliminated a chance for the US team to score more points in the team competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20020922/ai_n12666475 Athletics ; Pacemaker who missed the point | Independent on Sunday, The | Find Articles at BNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E5DF1639F932A1575AC0A9649C8B63 PLUS: TRACK AND FIELD; Lassiter's Strategy Upsets U.S. Officials - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trackprofile.com/2002/09-20-RRW-wcup-day1.html WITH LASSITER PACING, LAGAT WINS WORLD CUP 1500M TITLE - 2002 IAAF World Cup Day 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010185819/http://www.trackprofile.com/2002/09-20-RRW-wcup-day1.html |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lassiter later issued an apology to the team and was sanctioned by the USATF for his actions, requiring him to complete 20 hours of community service and receiving a letter of reprimand. Lassiter then began coaching at Springdale High School in Springdale Arkansas

'''Sinobo Stadium''' (formerly known as '''Eden Aréna''' and '''Synot Tip Arena''') is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]], in [[Prague]]-[[Vršovice]], [[Czech Republic]].

The stadium has a capacity of 21,000 people and it is the most modern football stadium in the [[Czech Republic]]. It is the home venue of [[SK Slavia Prague]] and occasionally the [[Czech Republic national football team]]. In the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons, it was also the venue of [[Bohemians 1905]] home matches. During the 2011–12 season the stadium hosted home matches for [[FC Viktoria Plzeň]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage.

The stadium was the venue for the [[2013 UEFA Super Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Wembley, Amsterdam ArenA, Prague get 2013 finals |url= http://fotbal.idnes.cz/predkola-evropskych-poharu-televize-prime-prenosy-fxy-/fot_pohary.aspx?c=A170725_132512_fot_pohary_min |work= iDNES.cz |publisher= MF DNES |date= 25 July 2017 |accessdate= 25 July 2017 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170731191355/http://fotbal.idnes.cz/predkola-evropskych-poharu-televize-prime-prenosy-fxy-/fot_pohary.aspx?c=A170725_132512_fot_pohary_min |archivedate= 31 July 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1950s, Slavia was forced to leave its stadium at [[Letná]] and a [[Stadion Eden (1953)|new stadium]] was built at Eden in the [[Vršovice]] district. Its capacity was about 50,000 (mostly for standing). The wooden western (main) stand was taken from the old stadium at Letná, the rest of the stands were made of concrete. The stadium also featured an athletics track. The first match at this stadium took place on 27 September 1953, Slavia drew 1-1 against the team of [[Křídla vlasti Olomouc]]. [[Josef Bican]] scored the home team's goal.

===Move===
In the 1970s, it became apparent that Eden did not provide sufficient comfort for the visitors and started planning to build a new one in the same place. However, under the communist regime, the planning went quite slowly. Several projects were made, and the construction was finally to start in 1990. In 1989, Slavia moved temporarily to the nearby [[Ďolíček]] stadium (home of FC Bohemians Prague, now known as [[Bohemians 1905]]) and the eastern stand was torn down. However, the [[Velvet Revolution|overthrowing of the communist regime in 1989]] delayed the construction. In the meantime, Slavia moved to [[Stadion Evžena Rošického]], a stadium on the [[Strahov (district of Prague)|Strahov hill]], which is large but uncomfortable and poorly accessible.

In the early 1990s, the whole construction was cancelled and Slavia moved back to Eden. A temporary stand was built in the place of former eastern stand, but it was clear that Eden was outdated and Slavia needed a new home ground. Several more projects were made, but Slavia was unable to raise sufficient funds and there were some legal problems, as the premises were owned by the government and it took a lot of effort to transfer them to Slavia. In 2000, the stadium became ineligible to host [[Czech First League]] matches, so Slavia moved to the unpopular Strahov again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=588369.html|title=Return to Eden nears for Slavia|work=UEFA.com|date=18 September 2007|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New stadium===
[[File:StadiumEden.jpg|thumbnail|Front side]]
Slavia finally presented a project of the new stadium, but no construction started. In December 2003, the old Eden stadium was torn down and Slavia announced that the new stadium would be opened on 19 October 2005, however, by October 2005 the construction had not even started. It took another year to start. The project had to be scaled down to lower the construction cost from 1.8 billion Czech koruna to less than 1 billion. The construction eventually started in October 2006.

Despite the stadium not being fully finished, it was opened on 7 May 2008 with an exhibition match against [[Oxford University A.F.C.]] Many former Slavia stars (such as [[Pavel Kuka]], [[Patrik Berger]], [[Jan Suchopárek]] and [[Ivo Knoflíček]]) took part in this match, which Slavia won 5–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Czech champions Slavia too strong for Blues| url=http://www.ouafc.com/news/262| date=12 May 2008| accessdate=13 November 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206161411/http://www.ouafc.com/news/262| archivedate=6 December 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first competitive match at the new stadium was played on 17 May 2008 against [[FK Jablonec 97|Jablonec]], the match ended 2–2, Slavia secured the [[Czech First League]] title in this final match of the [[2007–08 Czech First League|2007/08 season]].

In 2016, [[CEFC China Energy]], who had previously purchased a majority stake in SK Slavia Prague, sought to buy a 70% stake in the stadium and announced plans to invest around €50 million (including the purchase price) to improve the stadium capacity and turn it into the main national stadium for the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cefc-ziska-stadion-v-edenu-pocita-s-jeho-rekonstrukci-p0b-/fotbal.aspx?c=A160330_162423_fotbal_pes|title=Čínský majitel Slavie získá stadion v Edenu, počítá s rekonstrukcí|trans-title=Chinese owner of Slavia acquires the Eden stadium, plans renovations|work=iDNES.cz|language=Czech|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, it was announced that the details of the transaction have since changed and CEFC China Energy had purchased the stadium in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/eden-majitel-zmena-cefc-slavia-dki-/fotbal.aspx?c=A170413_150953_fotbal_ten|title=Čínská CEFC k fotbalové Slavii přikoupila i stadion v Edenu|date=2017-04-13|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsorship ==
In July 2008, it was announced that betting company Synot Tip had made an agreement with E Side Property Limited, the owners of the stadium, regarding a sponsorship deal regarding one of the stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-26012810-synot-je-partnerem-stadionu-v-edenu|work=ihned.cz|publisher=Hospodářské noviny|title=Synot je partnerem stadionu v Edenu|language=Czech|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the stadium's name was officially changed to Synot Tip Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/kdyz-slavia-porazi-boleslav-bude-mit-pred-spartou-desetibodovy-naskok-1mj-/fotbal.aspx?c=A090426_155957_fotbal_pes|title=Když Slavia porazí Boleslav, bude mít před Spartou desetibodový náskok|language=Czech|work=idnes.cz|publisher=Mladá fronta DNES|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Natland Group were announced as the new majority owners of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denik.cz/fotbal/stadion-v-edenu-ve-vetsine-patri-natlandu20111011.html|title=Stadion v Edenu ve většině patří Natlandu|language=Czech|work=denik.cz|publisher=Vltava-Labe-Press|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 it was announced that Synot would not be extending their sponsorship of the stadium past the end of the [[2011–12 Gambrinus liga|2011–12 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jan|last1=Malý|first2=Josef|last2=Káninský|url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-54727310-slavia-prijde-o-miliony-od-synotu|title=Slavia přijde o miliony od Synotu|language=Czech|work=ihned.cz|publisher=Hospodářské noviny|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Profile TA gold.jpg|thumb|The Athletic app logo]]
''The Athletic'' was founded by Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, former coworkers at subscription-based fitness company [[Strava]], with the mission of producing "smarter coverage for die-hard fans." The company was built as an alternative to the struggling ad-supported models.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2017"/&gt; ''The Athletic'' relies on subscription revenue, not advertising revenue, to support the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/the-athletic-sports-news.php |title=Fast-growing startup aims to ‘replace the sports page’ |first=Tony |last=Biasotti |date=October 11, 2017 |work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]'s Summer 2016 batch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.ycombinator.com/the-athletic/ |title=The Athletic gives diehard sports fans high-quality content without the ads |date=July 11, 2016 |publisher=Y Combinator}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site originally launched in Chicago in January 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theathletic.com/480/2016/01/22/welcome-to-the-athletic/|title=Welcome Chicago, to The Athletic|date=January 22, 2016|work=The Athletic|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Jon Greenberg serving as the founding editor, along with Sahadev Sharma ([[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]) and Scott Powers ([[Chicago Blackhawks|Blackhawks]]). Greenberg and Powers previously worked at ESPN Chicago, while Sharma left ''Baseball Prospectus''' Cubs vertical to join the website.  

In October 2016, ''The Athletic'' expanded to a second city, Toronto, to focus on Maple Leafs, Raptors, and Blue Jays coverage. ''The Athletic'' hired James Mirtle as editor-in-chief for Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite twitter |user=mirtle |number=801452582602424321 |title=Excited to announce that I've been hired as editor-in-chief with @TheAthleticTO, a great new startup site in Toronto. |date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirtle spent over a decade as a sportswriter at ''The Globe and Mail'' before joining ''The Athletic''.  A third city, Cleveland, launched in March 2017, with Jason Lloyd as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20170217/BLOGS06/170219821/the-athletic-soon-will-launch-a-cleveland-site-featuring-jason-lloyd |title=The Athletic soon will launch a Cleveland site featuring Jason Lloyd |date=February 17, 2017 |first=Kevin |last=Kleps |work=Crain's Cleveland Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Athletic'' continued city expansion to Detroit in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20170924/news/640081/the-athletic-paywall-sports-journalism-plants-its-flag-in-detroit |title=The Athletic: Paywall sports journalism plants its flag in Detroit |first=Bill |last=Shea |date=September 24, 2017 |work=Crain's Detroit Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August, the site hired [[Ken Rosenthal]] as a senior baseball writer, shortly after Fox Sports eliminated its entire writing staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theathletic.com/86701/2017/08/23/ken-rosenthal-why-im-joining-the-athletic/ |title=Ken Rosenthal: Why I’m joining The Athletic |first=Ken |last=Rosenthal |date=August 23, 2017 |work=The Athletic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/fox/fox-sports-eliminates-digital-writing-staff-in-favor-of-promoting-their-debate-shows.html |title=Fox Sports eliminates digital writing staff in favor of promoting their debate shows |date=June 26, 2017 |work=Awful Announcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, the company announced a $20 million third round of funding led by Evolution Media. Mather reported that this money would be invested into expanding coverage to new cities and increasing the number of writers from the then staff of 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-athletic-raises-20-million-to-fund-expansion-1520269215|title=The Athletic Raises $20 Million to Fund Expansion|last=Mullin|first=Benjamin|date=2018-03-05|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same month, the site announced full coverage in Denver and Boston starting in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/athletic/athletic-launches-coverage-denver-seattle-tampa-making-clear-wants-absolutely-every-market.html |title=The Athletic launches coverage in Denver, Seattle, and Tampa, making clear it wants to be everywhere |first=Alex |last=Putterman |date=2018-03-28 |work=Awful Announcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Denver, ''The Athletic'' hired several reporters from ''[[The Denver Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/news/denver-post-broncos-writers-leave-amid-layoffs-to-join-the-athletic-10129365 |title=Post Broncos Writer Joins Site She Saw as Trying to Destroy Newspapers |first=Michael |last=Roberts |date=2018-03-27 |work=Westword}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the initial staff consisted of beat writers previously employed at the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'''s web portal [[MassLive]].&lt;ref name=Finn20180329&gt;Finn, Chad.

Formerly known as the Justus Aquatic Center it opened January 1985 as a business venture combining a hotel with a sporting venue.  It was the first aquatic, fitness and hotel complex, of its kind.  Financial problems plagued the center from the beginning. In  1988, there was a brief closure of the facility as it was taken in [[receivership]] by the [[Great Western Bank (1919–97)|Great Western Bank]].&lt;ref name="os-1988nov10"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-11-10/business/0080200100_1_fussell-justus-radisson-inn |title=Hotel, Aquatic Complex Goes On The Block |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=November 10, 1988 |first=Vicki |last=Vaughan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was renamed the Orlando International Aquatic and Fitness Center.  Citing an operating loss of $600,000 a year and the impossibility of running an aquatics facility of that size in the black, the bank closed the center in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Sentinel Jan 1992&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=October 2008}} The center was to be destroyed in order to make a larger parking lot.

A local [[hotel|hotelier]], [[Harris Rosen]], fought the closure, by forming an organization called Friends of the Aquatic Center with several aquatics [[activist]]s such as Dr. [[Lucky Meisenheimer]], Scott Henderson, Julie Sundstrom and others.  A six-month community battle ensued in the attempt to reopen the center. Rallies and protest marches were held and congressional representatives [[Jim Bacchus]] and [[Bill McCollum]] became involved.&lt;ref&gt;Williamsburg News June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=October 2008}}

Ultimately a deal between the county commission and the bank was arranged, in exchange for [[zoning]] changes that increased hotel room density at the site, the bank separated the Aquatic Center from the hotel and donated the facility to the county. Not wanting to manage the facility, the county offered the center to the [[Central Florida YMCA]].  Jerry Haralson the CEO of the Central Florida YMCAs agreed to add the Aquatic Center to the Central Florida YMCA community. &lt;ref&gt; "[http://www.ymcaaquaticcenter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=1 A Brief History of the YMCA Aquatic Center]". YMCA Aquatic Center.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 1992, the facility reopened as the YMCA Aquatic Center.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Sentinel June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=October 2008}}

[[Charlie Stuart]] became the first chairman of the YMCA Aquatic Center’s [[Board of Directors]] and Richard Robinson was named the first executive Director. 

In 1994 Jim Ferber the CEO of the Central Florida YMCA arranged a partnership with [[Florida Hospital Orlando]] that resulted in the addition of a [[physical therapy]] and rehabilitation center to the YMCA Aquatic Center. The remodeling project was completed under the guidance of Jim Purdy the then executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center. 

In the mid 1990s, John Vasbinder took over as the executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center and for the first time the center began to run in the black.  A $250,000 grant from [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] resulted in further improvements to the center. 

In 2007 the YMCA Aquatic Center added a new $150,000 video [[scoreboard]] under the guidance of Steve Corrie, executive Director of the YMCA Aquatic Center from 2007-2012. In 2010 Corrie led a successful $1.3million capital campaign that provided a comprehensive facelift for the facility. These upgrades allowed the Aquatic Center to move back into the national swim meet scene. During his tenure, Corrie rebranded the facility in the swimming world as 'The Big House'. The name has stuck since then. 

The YMCA Aquatic Center currently houses a number of competitive athletic teams in swimming, water polo, and diving.  One of those programs is YCF Diving who, in 2012, had 2 Olympic Trials qualifiers ([[Justin Dumais]] &amp; Wallace Layland) and 1 Olympian ([[Brittany Viola]]).&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Sentinel August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=August 2012}}. The YCF Water Polo program was named the 2012 Southeast Club of the year. Special Olympic/Dr P Phillips High School Coach and YMCA volunteer, Apryle Nickson was named the 2012 North America Special Olympic Coach of the Year.
