'''{{mp|2018 CY|2}}''' is an [[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], with an estimated diameter of {{convert|59–190|m|ft|sigfig=2}}. It was first observed on 9 February 2018, by astronomers of the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]], Arizona, during its close approach to Earth.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPEC" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2018 CY|2}} is an [[Apollo asteroid]]. Apollo's [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|cross the orbit of Earth]] and are the largest group of [[near-Earth objects]] with nearly 10 thousand known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.92–1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 14 months (438 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.13&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.18 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 27[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It is, however, not a [[Mars-crossing asteroid]], as its [[aphelion]] of 1.34&amp;nbsp;AU is less than the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins its first observation at Mount Lemmon in February 2018.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The object has a [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.0451 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, which corresponds to 17.6 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD).&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; On 14 February 2018, 14:44 UTC, it came within 18.66&amp;nbsp;LD of the Earth ''(see diagrams)''.&lt;ref name="MPC-Tweet" /&gt; Its next close approach will be on 14 February 2024, at a similar distance.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

The [[Minor Planet Center]] estimates a diameter of 59–190 meters.&lt;ref name="MPC-Tweet" /&gt; Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, {{mp|2018 CY|2}} measures between 100 and 190 meters in diameter, for an [[absolute magnitude]] of 22.33, and an assumed [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.057 and 0.20, which represent typical values for [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] and [[S-type asteroid|stony]] asteroids, respectively.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2018 CY|2}} has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor named.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Achiroë''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪr|oʊ|iː}} or '''Anchirrhoë''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀχιρ(ρ)όη}}), or according to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' Anchinoë (Ἀγχινόη),&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-|Pseudo]]-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]]. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.1.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 2.1.4]'' with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921&lt;/ref&gt; which is perhaps a mistake for Anchiroë, was in [[Greek mythology]] a [[naiad]], a daughter of the river-god [[Nilus (mythology)|Nilus]].  She was also the wife of [[Belus (Egyptian)|Belus]], by whom she became the mother of [[Aegyptus]] and [[Danaus]], and, according to some accounts, [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]], and [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. Otherwise, the possible mother of this children and spouse of Belus was called [[Side (mythology)|Side]], eponym of [[Sidon]] in [[Phoenicia]]. 

According to others, Ares begot by her a son, [[Sithon (mythology)|Sithon]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia|Scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]]. ''Alexandra, 583 &amp; 1161''&lt;/ref&gt;, and according to [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]]&lt;ref&gt;ap. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s.v. Pallene Παλλήνη''&lt;/ref&gt; also two daughters, Pallenaea and Rhoetea, from whom two towns derived their names. 

==Mythology==
Anchinoe was a minor figure in Greek accounts and only mentioned by [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] in his ''Bibliotheca'':&lt;blockquote&gt;But Belus remained in Egypt, reigned over the country, and married Anchinoe, daughter of Nile, by whom he had twin sons, Egyptus and Danaus, but according to Euripides, he had also Cepheus and Phineus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''American Expeditionary Force, North Russia''' ('''AEF in North Russia''') (also known as the '''Polar Bear Expedition''') was a contingent of about 5,000 [[United States Army]] troops&lt;ref name="Willett1"&gt;Robert L. Willett, "Russian Sideshow" (Washington, D.C., Brassey's Inc., 2003), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; that landed in [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Russia]] as part of the  [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] and fought the [[Red Army]] in the surrounding region during the period of September 1918 through to July 1919.

{{North Russia Campaign}}

==History==
[[Image:Polar Bear Monument Historical Marker.JPG|thumb|200px|State historical Marker at [[White Chapel Memorial Cemetery|White Chapel Cemetery]] in [[Troy, Michigan]]]]

===Background===
The U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent the Polar Bear Expedition to Russia in response to requests from the governments of [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] to join the Allied Intervention in North Russia (also known as the [[North Russia Campaign]]). The British and French had two objectives for this intervention:&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Joel R. Moore, Harry H. Mead and Lewis E. Jahns, "The History of The American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki" (Nashville, TN, The Battery Press, 2003), pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt;

# preventing Allied war material stockpiles in Archangelsk (originally intended for the recently collapsed [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]) from falling into German or [[Bolshevik]] hands
# mounting an offensive to rescue the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], which was stranded along the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]]

On July 14, 1918, the U.S. Army's [[85th Infantry Division (United States)|85th Division]] left their training camp at [[Camp Custer]], [[Michigan]] for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France.  Three days later, President Wilson agreed to a limited participation by American troops in the Allied Intervention with the stipulation that they would only be used for guarding the stockpiled war material. When U.S. Army General [[John J. Pershing]] received the directive from President Wilson, he changed the orders for the [[339th Infantry Regiment]], along with the First Battalion of the 310th Engineers plus a few other ancillary units from the 85th Division.  Instead of heading for France, these units were trained and re-outfitted in England with Russian guns and then sent to North Russia. They arrived in Arkhangelsk on September 4, 1918, coming under British command. (Allied expeditionary forces had occupied Arkhangelsk on August 2, 1918.)

See [[American Expeditionary Force, Siberia]] for information on the 7,950 American soldiers and officers sent to [[Vladivostok]], Russia at the same time.&lt;ref name="Willett2"&gt;Robert L. Willett, "Russian Sideshow" (Washington, D.C., Brassey's Inc., 2003), pp. 166, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expedition===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Polarbearexpedition.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] soldier shot by an American guard 8 January 1919.]]
When the British commanders of the Allied Intervention arrived in [[Arkhangelsk]] on August 2, 1918, they discovered that the Allied war material had already been moved up the [[Northern Dvina|Dvina River]] by the retreating Bolshevik forces. Therefore, when the American troops arrived one month later, they were immediately used in offensive operations to aid in the rescue of the Czech Legion. The British commanders sent the First Battalion of the 339th Infantry up the Dvina River and the Third Battalion of the 339th up the [[Vologda]] Railroad where they engaged and pushed back the Bolshevik forces for the next six weeks.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

However, these two fronts each became hundreds of miles (kilometers) long and were extremely narrow and difficult to supply, maintain, and protect. By the end of October 1918, they were no longer able to maintain the offensive and acknowledging their fragile situation and the rapid onset of winter, the Allies began to adopt a defensive posture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The Allied commanders soon also soon realized they would be unable to raise an effective local force of anti-Bolshevik soldiers. Thus they gave up the goal of linking up with the Czech Legion and settled in to hold their gains over the coming winter.  During that winter, the Bolshevik army went on the offensive, especially along the [[Vaga River]] portion of the Dvina River Front, where they inflicted numerous casualties and caused the Allies to retreat a considerable distance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

During their time in North Russia, the American forces suffered more than 210 casualties, including at least 110 deaths from battle, about 30 missing in action, and 70 deaths from disease, 90% of which were caused by the [[Spanish Flu]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} A October 1919 report gives the casualties as 553: 109 killed in battle; 35 died of wounds; 81 from disease; 19 from accidents/other causes; 305 wounded and 4 POWS (released).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&amp;dat=19191021&amp;id=CQccAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w1QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4809,3158851|title=Ludington Daily News Michigan |date=October 21, 1919| via= Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal===
Following the Allied [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] on November 11, 1918, family members and friends of the AEF in North Russia soldiers began writing letters to newspapers and circulating petitions to their representatives in the [[U.S. Congress]] asking for the immediate return of the force from North Russia.  In turn, the newspapers editorialized for their withdrawal and their Congressmen raised the issue in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Meanwhile, aware of not only the change in their mission, but also of the Armistice on the Western Front and the fact that the port of Arkhangelsk was now frozen and closed to shipping, the morale of the American soldiers plummeted.  They asked their officers why they were fighting Bolshevik soldiers in Russia and did not receive a clear answer, other than that they had to fight to survive and avoid the Bolshevik army pushing them into the [[Arctic Ocean]].

[[File:Polarbearexpedition2.jpg|thumb|200px|A Bolshevik soldier killed in an attempted [[Battle of Bolshie Ozerki|flank attack]] on [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied troops]] at Bolshie Ozerki, [[Russia]] 8 April 1919.]]
Early in 1919, instances of rumored and actual mutinies in the Allied ranks became frequent. President Wilson directed his War Department on February 16, 1919 to begin planning the AEF in North Russia's withdrawal from North Russia. In March 1919, four American soldiers in Company B of the 339th Infantry drew up a petition protesting their continued presence in Russia and were threatened with court-martial proceedings.  U.S. Army Brigadier General [[Wilds P. Richardson]] arrived in Arkhangelsk aboard the icebreaker ''Canada'' on April 17, 1919, with orders from General Pershing to organize a coordinated withdrawal of the American troops "...at the earliest possible moment."  On May 26, 1919, the first half of 8,000 volunteer members of the British North Russian Relief Force arrived in Arkhangelsk to relieve the American troops.  In early June, the bulk of the AEF in North Russia sailed for [[Brest, France|Brest]], France and then for [[New York City]] and home—which for two-thirds of them was in the state of Michigan. During the withdrawal, the men of the AEF in North Russia decided to call themselves "Polar Bears" and were authorized to wear the Polar Bear insignia on their left sleeve. The AEF in North Russia officially disbanded on August 5, 1919.

Several years after the American troops were withdrawn from Russia, President [[Warren G. Harding]] called the expedition a mistake and blamed the previous administration.&lt;ref name="mask"&gt;American soldiers faced Red Army on Russian soil, ''Army Times'', September 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
A year after all of the expedition members had returned home, in 1920 Polar Bear veterans began lobbying their state and Federal governments to obtain funds and the necessary approvals to retrieve the bodies of at least 125 of their fellow American soldiers which were then believed to have been buried in Russia and left behind.  By that time, 112 sets of remains had already been transferred to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19290925&amp;id=In1YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oEMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1887,5863710|title=Lawrence Journal-World September 25, 1929|via= Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, additional research found that 226 fallen "polar bears" had originally been buried in North Russia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19290910&amp;id=2NA-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gkwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6271,4254486&amp;hl=en The Tuscaloosa News September 10, 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;
with a total of approximately 130 sets of U.S. soldier remains then estimated to still be buried in North Russia. Hampered by the lack of diplomatic recognition between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], it took many years before they finally received permission.  An expedition under the auspices of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] (VFW) was successful in organizing and conducting a recovery mission in the autumn of 1929 that found, identified and brought out the remains of 86 U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19300319&amp;id=f6lMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3339,3424925|title=Prescott Evening Courier March 19, 1930|via= Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen remains of AEF in North Russia soldiers were shipped by the Soviet Union to the U.S. in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19340817&amp;id=qSQbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gEsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2795,4188522&amp;hl=en The Pittsburgh Press August 17, 1934]&lt;/ref&gt; which reduced the number of U.S soldiers still buried in North Russia to about 30.

The remains of 56 AEF in North Russia soldiers were eventually re-buried in plots surrounding the Polar Bear Memorial by sculptor [[Leon Hermant]] in [[White Chapel Memorial Cemetery]], [[Troy, Michigan]] in a ceremony on May 30, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pbma.grobbel.org/burials.htm |title=Burials at the Polar Bear Monument, White Chapel Cemetery, Troy, Michigan |date=30 May 1930 |accessdate=18 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1kmdny7KqEQC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=memorial+White+Chapel+Polar+Bears+expeditionary+force |page=69 |title=A Motor City year |first=John |last=Sobczak |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2009|isbn=9780814334102 |accessdate=18 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Gunnes]], who was born in 1899, died on March 11, 2003.  Gunnes was believed to have been the last living American to have fought in the Allied Intervention near the port of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea.&lt;ref name="dies"&gt;WWI vets: last living links to a bygone era: with less than 400 of them left, these century-old warriors still have stories to tell, about the Great War.

'''Analytical light scattering''' (ALS), also loosely referred to as [[Size-exclusion chromatography|SEC]]-[[multi-angle light scattering|MALS]], is the implementation of [[static light scattering]] (SLS) and [[dynamic light scattering]] (DLS) techniques in an online or flow mode. A typical ALS instrument consists of an [[HPLC]]/[[Fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]] [[chromatography]] system coupled in-line with appropriate light scattering and refractive index detectors. The advantage of ALS over conventional steady-state light scattering methods is that it allows separation of [[molecule]]s/[[macromolecule]]s on a [[chromatography column]] prior to analysis with light scattering detectors. Accordingly, ALS enables one to determine [[hydrodynamic]] properties of a single [[monodisperse]] species as opposed to bulk or average measurements on a sample afforded by conventional light scattering.

'''Behemoth''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɪ|ˈ|h|iː|m|ə|θ|,_|ˈ|b|iː|ə|-}}; {{lang-he|בהמות}}, ''behemot'') is a beast mentioned in {{bibleref2|Job|40:15–24}}. Suggested identities range from a mythological creature to an [[elephant]], [[hippopotamus]], [[rhinoceros]], or [[African buffalo|buffalo]].&lt;ref name="Metzger2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce Manning|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael D|title=The Oxford Guide To People And Places Of The Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amlXOOaSuLMC|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517610-0|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metaphor]]ically, the name has come to be used for any extremely large or powerful entity.

==Description==
[[File:Behemoth3.jpg|thumb|upright|''Behemoth and Leviathan'', watercolour by [[William Blake]] from his ''[[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|Illustrations of the Book of Job]]''.]]
[[Book of Job|Job]] 40:15–24 describes Behemoth, and then the sea-monster [[Leviathan]], to demonstrate to [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] the futility of questioning God, who alone has created these beings and who alone can capture them.&lt;ref name="ToornBecking1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Der Toorn|first1=Karel |last2=Becking|first2=Bob|last3=Van Der Horst|first3=Pieter W|title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible: Second Extensively Revised Edition|year=1999|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-11119-6|pages=165–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. L. Patton lists several interpretations of the nature of these beasts, including the idea that they are [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] monsters destroyed by the deity at the time of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iwanski|first=Darius|title=The Dynamics of Job's Intercession|year=2006|publisher=Biblical Institute Press|isbn=978-88-7653-161-3|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ylRdqCYToJQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=chaos+deity+++behemoth+leviathan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zZdBTcfoB86IhQeup_XeAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=chaos%20deity%20%20%20behemoth%20leviathan&amp;f=false|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leviathan is identified figuratively with both the primeval sea ({{bibleref2|Job|3:8}}, {{bibleref2|Psalms|74:13}}) and in [[apocalyptic literature]] – describing the end-time – as that adversary, the [[Devil]], from before creation who will finally be defeated. In the divine speeches in Job, Behemoth and Leviathan may both be seen as composite and mythical creatures with enormous strength, which humans like Job could not hope to control. But both are reduced to the status of divine pets, with rings through their noses and Leviathan on a leash.&lt;ref name="Metzger2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan (2008). ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament''. Oxford University Press. p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
Job 40:15-24
King James Version
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
}}

==Later Jewish writings==
In Jewish [[apocrypha]] and [[pseudepigrapha]] such as the 2nd century BCE [[Book of Enoch]], Behemoth is the primal unconquerable monster of the land, as Leviathan is the primal monster of the waters of the sea and [[Ziz]] the primordial monster of the sky. According to this text Leviathan lives in "[[Abyss (religion)|the Abyss]]", while Behemoth the land-monster lives in an invisible desert east of the [[Garden of Eden]] (1 Enoch 60:7–8). 

A Jewish rabbinic legend describes a great battle which will take place between them at the end of time: "...they will interlock with one another and engage in combat, with his horns the Behemoth will gore with strength, the fish [Leviathan] will leap to meet him with his fins, with power. Their Creator will approach them with his mighty sword [and slay them both]." Then, "from the beautiful skin of the Leviathan, God will construct canopies to shelter the righteous, who will eat the meat of the Behemoth and the Leviathan amid great joy and merriment." (''Artscroll'' [[siddur]], p. 719).

In the [[Haggadah]], Behemoth's strength reaches its peak on the [[summer solstice]] of every solar year (around 21 June). At this time of year, Behemoth lets out a loud roar that makes all animals tremble with fear, and thus renders them less ferocious for a whole year. As a result, weak animals live in safety away from the reach of wild animals. This mythical phenomenon is shown as an example of divine mercy and goodness. Without Behemoth's roar, traditions narrate, animals would grow more wild and ferocious, and hence go around butchering each other and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from ''Legends of the Jews'', [[Louis Ginzberg]] - volume I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
[[File:Dictionnaire Infernal - Behemoth.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Behemoth as depicted in the ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
Since the 17th century CE there have been many attempts to identify Behemoth. Some scholars have seen him as a real creature, usually the [[hippopotamus]], occasionally the [[elephant]], [[rhinoceros]], or [[water buffalo]].&lt;ref name="ToornBecking1999"/&gt; The reference to Behemoth's "tail" that "moves like a cedar" presents a problem for most of these readings, since it cannot easily be identified with the tail of any animal. Biologist Michael Bright suggests that the reference to the cedar tree actually refers to the brush-like shape of its branches, which resemble the tails of modern elephants and hippopotamuses.&lt;ref name="BOTF"&gt;{{cite book|author= Bright, Michael|title=Beasts of the Field: The Revealing Natural History of Animals in the Bible|year=2006|pages= 26–27|isbn=1-86105-831-4|publisher=Robson|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some have identified the cedar as an elephant [[Elephant#Trunk|trunk]], but it might instead refer to Behemoth's [[penis]], since the Hebrew word for "move" can also mean "extend", and the second part of the verse speaks of the sinew around his "stones". The [[Vulgate]] seems to endorse such a reading by using the word "''[[Testicle|testiculorum]]''".&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1987"&gt;Mitchell (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian language|Russian-language]] speakers have used the [[cognate]] word бегемот (''begemot'') to refer to the hippopotamus from third quarter of the 18th century – Russian-speakers also use the name гиппопотам (''gippopotam'').

[[Young Earth Creationist]]s have argued that the behemoth may have been a [[sauropod]]-like dinosaur due to it being a large, plant-eating [[land animal]] with a long tail resembling a cedar.&lt;ref&gt;Keil, C.F. and Delitzsch, F., ''Commentary on the Old Testament'', Vol. IV, Job, Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, p. 357, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Young earth creationists assert that the creature's massive size and its tree-like tail eliminate the possibilities of it being an extant [[land animal]], where they see it more akin to a large herbivorous [[dinosaur]] (such as a sauropod).&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, A. and Hanson, M., The Book of Job, SCM Press, London, p. 112, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driver, S.R. and Gray, G.B., A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of Job, T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh, Part II, p. 326, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another opinion sees Behemoth as a product of the imagination of the author of Job, a symbol of God's power: in verse 24 he is described as having a ring ("snare") through his nose, a sign that he has been tamed by [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref name="Metzger2004"/&gt;

==Literary references==
The 17th-century political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] named the [[Long Parliament]] 'Behemoth' in his book ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]''. It accompanies his book of political theory that draws on the lessons of [[English Civil War]], the rather more famous ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. It is also the name of a [[Behemoth (Master and Margarita)|character]] in [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel, ''[[The Master and Margarita]]''.

The Behemoth also appears in [[John Milton]]’s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (Book VII 470–472):
"''[… ]Scarce from his mould / Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved / His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,[ …]''"

The Behemoth is mentioned in ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' by [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]: 
"''[…] behold ! in plaited mail / Behemoth rears his head.''" […] (''Summer''). The German émigré [[Franz Leopold Neumann]] entitled his 1941 book about National Socialism, '' [[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism]]''.

The Behemoth is also mentioned in the opera, [[Nixon in China (opera)|''Nixon in China'']], composed by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], and written by [[Alice Goodman]]. At the beginning of the first act, the chorus sings "The people are the heroes now, Behemoth pulls the peasants' plow" several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera-arias.com/adams/nixon-in-china/libretto/ |title=Nixon in China Libretto &amp;#124; Adams |publisher=Opera-Arias.com |date=1972-02-21 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to his sister Mariana, [[Khalil Gibran]] told her that his health was "as good as a [[Bahamut]]," which is thought to derive from the biblical "Behemoth." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orangos.wordpress.com/2017/12/10/رسالتان-من-جبران-لماريانا |title=Gibran's letter to Mariana, c(1927-1930)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beijing Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program''' ('''SCAP''') was a [[astronomical survey]] to search for [[near-Earth objects]]. It was conducted during the 1990s, at the [[Xinglong Station]] in the [[Yanshan mountains]] of China's [[Hebei]] province and resulted in the discovery of more than a thousand numbered [[minor planet]]s.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;

Funded by the [[Chinese Academy of Science]], the survey is sometimes also called '''BAO Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program''' and '''NAOC Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program''', referring to the [[Beijing Astronomical Observatory]] (BAO) and [[National Astronomical Observatory of China]] (NAOC), respectively.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The instrument that SCAP used to detect near-Earth objects was a 60/90&amp;nbsp;cm [[Schmidt telescope]]. Equipped with a 2048×2048 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera, this telescope was installed at the BAO Xinglong station in Hebei province, China.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In a conversation with Space.com contributor Michael Paine, SCAP head Jin Zhu said that the program's allotted time to use the Schmidt telescope was significantly reduced to make room for the observatory's other projects.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

{{See also|Category:Discoveries by SCAP}}

From 1995 to 1999, SCAP detected one new comet and 2460 new asteroids and observed 43860 other asteroids, making it the fifth largest asteroid observation project at that time. Five of the asteroids it discovered were NEAs, two of which were considered [[potentially hazardous asteroid]]s (PHAs). In 2002, an NEA was discovered near Earth's [[moon]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[File:Straw-hay-briquettes.jpg|thumb|[[Biomass briquettes]] are an example fuel for production of dendrothermal energy]]
'''Biomass''' is waste material from plants or animals that is not used for food or feed; it can be waste from farming (like wheat stalks) or horticulture (yard waste), food processing (like corn cobs), animal farming (manure rich in nitrogen and phosphorus), or human waste from sewage plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biomass - Energy Explained, Your Guide To Understanding Energy |url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=biomass_home |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used in various industrial processes, like energy production or as raw materials for manufacturing chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ur-Rehman |first1=S |last2=Mushtaq |first2=Z |last3=Zahoor |first3=T |last4=Jamil |first4=A |last5=Murtaza |first5=MA |title=Xylitol: a review on bioproduction, application, health benefits, and related safety issues. |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |date=2015 |volume=55 |issue=11 |pages=1514–28 |doi=10.1080/10408398.2012.702288 |pmid=24915309}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burning biomass releases carbon emissions, but has been classed as a renewable energy source in the [[EU]] and [[UN]] legal frameworks, because plant stocks can be replaced with new growth.&lt;ref&gt;See M Le Page, ‘The Great Carbon Scam’ (21 September 2016) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130922-600-revealed-the-renewable-energy-scam-making-global-warming-worse/ 231 New Scientist 20–21]&lt;/ref&gt; It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to an energy source; biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: ''thermal'', ''chemical'', and ''biochemical''. Some chemical constituents of plant biomass include [[lignin]]s, [[cellulose]], and [[hemicellulose]].

In terms of how biomass is used as fuel, percentages were gathered in the United States of 2016. 5% is considered primary energy in the U.S. Making up that 5% of primary energy, about 48% comes from biofuels (mostly ethanol), 41% from wood based biomass, and around 11% from municipal waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=biomass_home|title=Biomass - Energy Explained, Your Guide To Understanding Energy - Energy Information Administration|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842] Retrieved on 2012-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 2018, biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries. Biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams (104.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; g – about 105 billion metric tons) of carbon per year, about half in the ocean and half on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Field | first1 = C.

Wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass (second-generation biofuels) as fuel. Harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into [[pellet fuel]] or other forms of fuels.

Biomass also includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], including [[biofuel]]s.

Based on the source of biomass, biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories. [[Biofuel#First-generation biofuels|First-generation biofuels]] are derived from sources such as sugarcane and [[corn]] starch. Sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce [[bioethanol]], an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a [[fuel cell]] to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline. However, utilizing food-based resources for fuel production only aggravates the food shortage problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Marshall A.|title=First generation biofuels compete|journal=New Biotechnology|date=1 November 2010|volume=27|issue=5|pages=596–608|doi=10.1016/j.nbt.2010.06.010|pmid=20601265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second-generation biofuels]], on the other hand, utilize non-food-based biomass sources such as agriculture and municipal waste. These biofuels mostly consist of [[lignocellulosic biomass]], which is not edible and is a low-value waste for many industries. Despite being the favored alternative, economical production of second-generation biofuel is not yet achieved due to technological issues. These issues arise mainly due to chemical inertness and structural rigidity of [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naik|first=S.N.|author2=Goud, Vaibhav V. |author3=Rout, Prasant K. |author4= Dalai, Ajay K. |title=Production of first and second generation biofuels: A comprehensive review|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|year=2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=578–597|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/ieas-report-on-1st-to-2nd-generation-biofuel-technologies Renewable Energy World] Retrieved on 2012-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biofuelstp.eu/fuelproduction.html biofuelstp.eu European Biofuels] Retrieved on 2012-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per [[hectare]] with low input energy. Some examples of these plants are wheat, which typically yields 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare, and straw, which typically yields 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the UK.&lt;ref name="Energy crops"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy crops|url=http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,17301&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|work=crops are grown specifically for use as fuel|publisher=BIOMASS Energy Centre|accessdate=6 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310063405/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,17301&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archive-date=2013-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from [[cellulose]] to [[glucose]] through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.

The main contributors of [[waste energy]] are [[municipal solid waste]], [[manufacturing waste]], and [[landfill gas]]. Energy derived from biomass is projected to be the largest non-hydroelectric renewable resource of electricity in the US between 2000 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass for Electricity Generation|url=http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/biomass/|work=capacity of about 6.7 gigawatts in 2000 to about 10.4 gigawatts by 2020|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104063803/http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/biomass/|archivedate=4 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like [[ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]]. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas, also called [[landfill gas]] or [[biogas]]. Crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol.

There is research involving algae or algae-derived biomass, as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as [[ethanol]], [[butanol]], and [[methane]], as well as [[biodiesel]] and [[hydrogen]]. Efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production. Genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Randor Radakovits|author2=Robert E.

===Thermal conversions===
[[File:Top 5 Biomass-Electricity Countries.png|thumb|Trends in the top five countries generating electricity from biomass]]
Thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form. Also known as thermal oil heating, it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmathermal.com/biomass-energy-systems/|title=Biomass Energy Systems: Design &amp; Service|newspaper=Sigma Thermal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic alternatives of [[combustion]] ([[torrefaction]], [[pyrolysis]], and [[gasification]]) are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed (mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature). These processes reduce carbon emissions during processing of biomass while providing useful byproducts which can later be used in several applications.&lt;ref&gt; Akhtar, A., Krepl, V., &amp; Ivanova, T. (2018). A Combined Overview of Combustion, Pyrolysis, and Gasification of Biomass. Energy &amp; Fuels, 32(7), 7294–7318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy created by burning biomass is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly, such as in [[tropical]] countries. There are other less common, more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits, such as [[hydrothermal]] upgrading.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass, including aqueous slurries, and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms. Some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power and [[co-firing]]. In a typical dedicated biomass power plant, efficiencies range from 20–27% ([[Heat of combustion#Higher heating value|higher heating value]] basis).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/owning-and-operating-costs-of-waste-and-biomass-power-plants.html Owning and Operating Costs of Waste and Biomass Power Plants]. Claverton-energy.com (2010-09-17). Retrieved on 2012-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass cofiring with coal, by contrast, typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30–40%, higher heating value basis).&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. (2005). "Biomass-coal co-combustion: Opportunity for affordable renewable energy." Fuel 84(10): 1295–1302.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical conversion===
A range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms, such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used, transported or stored, or to exploit some property of the process itself. Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes, such as [[Fischer-Tropsch synthesis]], methanol production, olefins (ethylene and propylene), and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks. In most cases, the first step involves gasification, which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, G., E. D. Larson, R. H. Williams, T. G. Kreutz and X. Guo (2011). "Making fischer-tropsch fuels and electricity from coal and biomass: Performance and cost analysis." Energy &amp; Fuels 25: 415–437.&lt;/ref&gt;
Biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid. Therefore, biomass [[gasification]] is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and traces of [[methane]]. This gas mixture, called a [[producer gas#USA|producer gas]], can provide fuel for various vital processes, such as [[internal combustion engines]], as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications.&lt;ref name="Rajvanshi, A. K. 1986"&gt;Rajvanshi, A. K. "Biomass Gasification." Alternative Energy in Agriculture, Vol. II, Ed. D. Yogi Goswami, CRC Press, 1986, pp. 83–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Because any biomass material can undergo gasification, this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production, where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel. In addition, biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste (such as wastes available on a farm) into producer gas, which is a very usable fuel.&lt;ref name="Rajvanshi, A. K. 1986"/&gt;

Conversion of biomass to [[biofuel]] can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kunkes|first=E. L.|author2=Simonetti, D.

Biomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals. [[Halomethanes]] have successfully been by produced using a combination of A. fermentans and engineered S. cerevisiae.&lt;ref name="Alaimo, Peter 2010"&gt;Alaimo, Peter &amp; Amanda-Lynn Marshall (2010) "Useful Products from Complex Starting Materials: Common Chemicals from Biomass Feedstocks" Chemistry – A European Journal 15 4970–4980.&lt;/ref&gt; This method converts NaX salts and unprocessed biomass such as [[switchgrass]], sugarcane, corn stover, or [[Populus|poplar]] into halomethanes. S-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in S. cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred. Production levels of 150&amp;nbsp;mg L-1H-1 iodomethane were achieved. At these levels roughly 173000&amp;nbsp;L of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the United States’ need for iodomethane.&lt;ref name="Alaimo, Peter 2010"/&gt; However, an advantage of this method is that it uses NaI rather than I2; NaI is significantly less hazardous than I2. This method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future.

Other chemical processes such as converting straight and waste vegetable oils into biodiesel is [[transesterification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,15179&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Conversion technologies].

===Biochemical conversion===
As biomass is a natural material, many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed, and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed.

Biochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels, such a biogas or bioethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bioenergyconsult.com/biochemical-conversion-technologies/|title=Biochemical Conversion of Biomass|date=2014-05-29|newspaper=BioEnergy Consult|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process: [[anaerobic digestion]], [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], and [[composting]].

[[Glycoside hydrolases]] are the enzymes involved in the degradation of the major fraction of biomass, such as polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thermostable variants are gaining increasing roles as catalysts in biorefining applications in the future bioeconomy, since recalcitrant biomass often needs thermal treatment for more efficient degradation. Some examples in today´s processing include the production of monosaccharides for food applications as well as use as a carbon source for microbial conversion into metabolites such as bioethanol and chemical intermediates, oligocaccharide production for [[prebiotic (nutrition)]] applications and production of surfactants alkyl glycoside type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=|year=2014|author1=Linares-Pastén|first1=J.

Biomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the (bulky) fuel play a key factor in the plant's economics. Rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly, which has led to a global biomass market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2009.05.017|url=http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/chem/2008-0506-201447/NWS-E-2007-49.pdf|title=Production and trading of biomass for energy – an overview of the global status|year=2009|last1=Heinimö|first1=J.|last2=Junginger|first2=M.|journal=Biomass and Bioenergy|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1310|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531075439/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/chem/2008-0506-201447/NWS-E-2007-49.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-31|df=|hdl=1874/27304}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make small plants of 1 MW&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as ORC technology, a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic working medium.

On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]].

Industry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plant's ability to comply with emissions standards. Some of these challenges, unique to biomass plants, include inconsistent fuel supplies and age. The type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors; the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste (such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings). Furthermore, many of the biomass plants are old, use outdated technology and were not built to comply with today’s stringent standards. In fact, many are based on technologies developed during the term of U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], who created the [[United States Department of Energy]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] projected that by 2017, biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas, slightly more expensive than nuclear power, and much less expensive than solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=U.S. Energy Information Administration|docket=National Energy Information Center|title=''Annual Energy Outlook 2010''|type=report no.

The adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process. Between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14%.&lt;ref name="Scheck"&gt;{{cite news|first=Justin|last=Scheck|title=Wood-Fired Plants Generate Violations|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 23, 2012|url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=22202|accessdate=September 27, 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13% of power; of this fraction, biomass contributes approximately 11% of the alternative production.&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning About Renewable Energy|url=http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_biomass.html|work=NREL's vision is to develop technology|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=4 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112432/http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_biomass.html|archive-date=2013-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted in early 2012, of the 107 operating biomass plants in the United States, 85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years. This data also includes minor infractions.&lt;ref name="Scheck"/&gt;

Despite harvesting, biomass crops may [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]] carbon. For example, soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil, especially at depths below {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/Publications.htm?seq_no_115=164741, Soil Carbon under Switchgrass Stands and Cultivated Cropland (Interpretive Summary and Technical Abstract)]. USDA Agricultural Research Service, April 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass. Typically, perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass, both living and dead, built up over years, and much less soil disruption in cultivation.

The proposal that biomass is [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree's carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Current studies indicate that "even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage" and "the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobsandenergy.com Jobs and Energy].

Forest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations, including [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate. Greenpeace recently released a report entitled "Fuelling a BioMess"&lt;ref name="BioMess"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/Global/canada/report/2011/10/ForestBiomess_Eng.pdf|title=Fuelling a BioMess|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]|date=October 2011|accessdate=2015-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924041131/http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/Global/canada/report/2011/10/ForestBiomess_Eng.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass. Because any part of the tree can be burned, the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages [[Logging#Whole tree logging|whole-tree harvesting]], which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting, and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest. In some jurisdictions, forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems, including standing trees, naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest. Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees, and even longer in low productivity areas; furthermore, logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]], a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production.&lt;ref name= "BioMess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/slyutse/today_nrdc_and_our_partners.html NRDC fact sheet lays out biomass basics, campaign calls for action to tell EPA our forests aren't fuel | Sasha Lyutse's Blog | Switchboard, from NRDC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213704/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/slyutse/today_nrdc_and_our_partners.html |date=2013-10-04 }}.

==Supply chain issues==
With the seasonality of biomass supply and a great variability in sources, supply chains play a key role in cost-effective delivery of bioenergy. There are several potential challenges unique to bioenergy supply chains:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.071| title = Modeling of biomass-to-energy supply chain operations: Applications, challenges and research directions| journal = Energy Policy| volume = 67| pages = 116–126| year = 2014| last1 = Mafakheri | first1 = F. | last2 = Nasiri | first2 = F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical issues
* Inefficiencies of the conversion processes
* Storage methods for seasonal availability
* Complex multi-component constituents incompatible with maximizing the efficiency of single-purpose use
* High water content of many biomass feedstock
* Conflicting decisions (technologies, locations, and routes)
* Complex location analysis (source points, inventory facilities, and production plants)

Logistic issues
* Seasonal availability leading to storage challenges and/or seasonally idle facilities
* Low bulk-density and/or high water content making transportation of biomass less economical
* Finite productivity per area and/or time incompatible with the conventional approach to the economy of scale focusing on maximizing facility size

Financial issues
* The limits for the traditional approach to economy of scale which focuses on maximizing single facility size
* Unavailability and complexity of life cycle costing data
* Lack of required transport infrastructure
* Limited flexibility or inflexibility to energy demand
* Risks associated with new technologies (insurability, performance, rate of return)
* Extended market volatilities (conflicts with alternative markets for biomass)
* Difficult or impossible to use financial hedging methods to control cost

Social issues
* Lack of participatory decision making
* Lack of public/community awareness
* Local supply chain impacts vs. global benefits
* Health and safety risks
* Extra pressure on the transport sector
* Decreasing the esthetics of rural areas

Policy and regulatory issues
* Impact of fossil fuel tax on biomass transport
* Lack of incentives to create competition among bioenergy producers
* Focus on technology options and less attention to the selection of biomass materials
* Lack of support for sustainable supply chain solutions

Institutional and organizational issues
* Varied ownership arrangements and priorities among supply chain parties
* Lack of supply chain standards
* Impact of organizational norms and rules on decision making and supply chain coordination
* Immaturity of change management practices in biomass supply chains

The '''Chihuahuan Desert''' ({{lang-es|Desierto Chihuahuense}}) is a [[desert]] and [[ecoregion]] designation covering parts of [[northern Mexico]] and the [[southwestern United States]]. It occupies much of [[West Texas]], parts of the middle and lower Rio Grande Valley and the lower Pecos Valley in [[New Mexico]], and a portion of southeastern [[Arizona]], as well as the central and northern portions of the [[Mexican Plateau]]. It is bordered on the west by the extensive [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] range, along with northwestern lowlands of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] range. On the Mexican side, it covers a large portion of the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], along with portions of [[Coahuila]], north-eastern [[Durango]], the extreme northern part of [[Zacatecas]], and small western portions of [[Nuevo León]]. With an area of about {{convert|362000|km2|0|abbr=on}}, it is the third largest desert of the Western Hemisphere and the [[List of North American deserts|second largest in North America]], after the [[Great Basin Desert]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=John W. |editor-last=Wright | year=2006 | title=The New York Times Almanac | edition=2007 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=New York, New York | isbn=0-14-303820-6 | pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Chihuahuan Desert from South Rim BIBE.jpg|left|thumbnail|The terrain mainly consists of [[Drainage basin|basin]]s broken by numerous small [[mountain range]]s.]]

Several larger mountain ranges include the [[Sierra Madre Oriental|Sierra Madre]], the [[Sierra del Carmen]], the [[Organ Mountains]], the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], the [[Sacramento Mountains]], the [[Chisos Mountains]], the [[Guadalupe Mountains]], and the [[Davis Mountains]]. These create "[[sky island]]s" of cooler, wetter, [[climate]]s adjacent to, or within the desert, and such elevated areas have both coniferous and broadleaf woodlands, including forests along drainages and favored exposures. The [[Sandia-Manzano Mountains]], the Magdalena-San Mateo Mountains, and the [[Gila Wilderness|Gila]] Region border the Chihuahuan Desert at their lower elevations.

There are a few urban areas within the desert: the largest is [[Ciudad Juárez]] with almost two million inhabitants; [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Saltillo, Coahuila|Saltillo]], and [[Torreón, Coahuila|Torreón]]; and the US cities of [[Albuquerque]] and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] and [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]] are among the other significant cities in this ecoregion.  [[Monterrey, Nuevo León|Monterrey]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] are located near the Chihuahuan desert.

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] the Chihuahuan Desert may be the most biologically diverse desert in the world as measured by species richness or endemism. The region has been badly degraded, mainly due to grazing.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=na1303 |name=Chihuahuan desert|accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many native grasses and other species have become dominated by woody native plants, including creosote bush and mesquite, due to overgrazing and other urbanization. The [[Mexican wolf]], once abundant, was nearly extinct and remains on the endangered species list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mexicanwolves.org/|website=Mexican Wolves|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The desert is mainly a [[rain shadow]] desert because the two main mountain ranges covering the desert, the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] to the west and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] to the east block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico respectively.&lt;ref name=NMSU&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddl.nmsu.edu/chihuahua.html | title = The Chihuahuan Desert | publisher = New Mexico State University | accessdate = February 16, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121227092714/http://ddl.nmsu.edu/chihuahua.html | archivedate = December 27, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Climatically, the desert has a dry climate with only one rainy season in the summer and smaller amounts of precipitation in early winter.&lt;ref name= NMSU /&gt;  Most of the summer rains falls between late June and early October, during the [[North American Monsoon]] when moist air from the Gulf of Mexico penetrates into the region.&lt;ref name= NMSU /&gt;&lt;ref name= NPS1 &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/cave/naturescience/deserts.htm | title = Chihuahuan Desert| publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its inland position and higher elevation than the [[Sonoran Desert]] to the west, mostly varying from {{convert|600| to |1675|m|0|abbr=on}} in altitude,&lt;ref name= EOE &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Chihuahuan_desert | title = Chihuahuan Desert | publisher = Encyclopedia of Earth | accessdate = February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the desert has a slightly milder climate in the summer (though usually daytime June temperatures are in the range of {{convert|35|to|40|C|F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and cool or cold winters with occasional frosts.&lt;ref name= NPS1 /&gt; The average annual temperature in the desert is {{convert|24|C|F}}, which varies with altitude. The hottest temperatures in the desert occur in lower elevation areas and in valleys.&lt;ref name= EOE /&gt; Northern areas have more severe winters than the southern portion and can receive snowstorms.&lt;ref name= NPS1 /&gt; The mean annual precipitation for the Chihuahuan Desert is {{convert|235|mm|in|abbr=on}} with a range of approximately {{convert|150|–|400|mm|0|abbr=on}}, although it receives more precipitation than other warm desert ecoregions.&lt;ref name= NMSU /&gt;  Nearly two-thirds of the arid zone stations have annual totals between {{convert|225|and|275|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.utep.edu/chih/pdf/chihuahuanclimate.pdf Chihuahuan Climate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906101600/http://museum.utep.edu/chih/pdf/chihuahuanclimate.pdf |date=September 6, 2006 }}, Chihuahuan Desert Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is scant except at the higher elevation edges.

==Flora/Fauna==

[[File:Antelope, Otero Mesa NM.jpg|left|thumbnail|Pronghorn and lechuguilla are native species of the Chihuahuan Desert.]]
Creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]]'') is the dominant plant species on gravelly and occasional sandy soils in valley areas within the Chihuahuan Desert. The other species it is found with depends on factors such as the soil, altitude, and degree of slope. Viscid acacia (''[[Acacia neovernicosa]]''), and tarbush (''[[Flourensia]] [[Flourensia cernua|cernua]]'') dominate northern portions, as does broom dalea  (''[[Psorothamnus]] [[Psorothamnus scoparius|scoparius]]'') on sandy soils in western portions. ''[[Yucca]]'' and ''[[Opuntia]]'' species are abundant in foothill edges and the central third, while Arizona rainbow cactus (''[[Echinocereus polyacanthus]]'') and Mexican fire-barrel cactus (''[[Ferocactus pilosus]]'') inhabit portions near the US–Mexico border.

[[Herbaceous plant]]s, such as bush muhly (''[[Muhlenbergia porteri]]''), blue grama (''[[Bouteloua gracilis]]''), gypsum grama (''[[Bouteloua breviseta|B. breviseta]]''),  and hairy grama (''[[Bouteloua hirsuta|B. hirsuta]]''), are dominant in desert grasslands and near the mountain edges including the Sierra Madre Occidental. Lechuguilla (''[[Agave lechuguilla]]''), honey mesquite (''[[Prosopis glandulosa]]''), ''[[Opuntia macrocentra]]'' and ''[[Echinocereus pectinatus]]'' are the dominant species in western [[Coahuila]]. Ocotillo (''[[Fouquieria splendens]]''), lechuguilla, and ''[[Yucca filifera]]'' are the most common species in the southeastern part of the desert. Candelilla (''[[Euphorbia antisyphilitica]]''), ''[[Mimosa zygophylla]]'', ''[[Acacia glandulifera]]'' and lechuguilla are found in areas with well-draining, shallow soils. The shrubs found near the Sierra Madre Oriental are exclusively lechuguilla, guapilla (''[[Hechtia glomerata]]''), Queen Victoria's agave (''[[Agave victoriae-reginae]]''), sotol (''[[Dasylirion]]'' spp.), and barreta (''[[Helietta]] [[Helietta parvifolia|parvifolia]]''), while the well-developed [[herbaceous layer]] includes grasses, [[Fabaceae|legumes]] and cacti.

Grasslands comprise 20% of this desert and are often mosaics of shrubs and grasses. They include purple three-awn (''[[Aristida purpurea]]''), black grama (''[[Bouteloua eriopoda]]''), and sideoats grama (''[[Bouteloua curtipendula]]''). Early Spanish explorers reported encountering grasses that were "belly high to a horse;" most likely these were big alkali sacaton (''[[Sporobolus wrightii]]'') and tobosa (''[[Pleuraphis]] [[Pleuraphis mutica|mutica]]'') bottomlands.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 024.png|thumb|right|200px|The Vision of the Lord Directing Abram to Count the Stars (woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]] from the 1860 ''Bible in Pictures'')]]
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], '''the covenant of the pieces''' or '''covenant between the parts''' (Hebrew: ברית בין הבתרים ''berith bayin hebatrim'') was an event in which [[God]] revealed himself to [[Abraham]] and made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with him, in which God announced to Abraham that his descendants would eventually inherit the [[Land of Israel]]. This was the first of a series of covenants made between God and the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]].

== Biblical narrative ==
The biblical story in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:1-15|HE}} recounts the covenant of the pieces. The day started with a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] in which Abram expressed his concerns about being childless. God tells Abram that he would have a son born to him, asks him to count the stars, if possible, and promises "So shall thy seed be." God commands Abram to prepare an [[animal sacrifice]]. Abram performed the sacrifice, cutting the animals (except the birds) into two pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|15:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep. God prophesied to Abram that his seed would be strangers in a land that is not theirs (a strange land) and serve the rulers of the land for four hundred years but afterward they would come out with "great substance" and in the fourth generation they would return to [[Canaan]].

[[Yahweh]] declared all of the regions of land that Abram's offspring would claim: 
{{quote|
"In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.' |{{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:18–21|HE}}}}

[[File:Greater Israel map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The boundaries of the region which was promised to Abraham's descendants in the covenant of the pieces as defined in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:18-21|HE}}]]
The covenant found in {{bibleref2|Genesis|12-17|NIV}} is known in Hebrew as the ''Brit bein HaBetarim'', the "Covenant Between the Parts", and is the basis for [[brit milah]] (covenant of circumcision) in [[Judaism]]. The covenant was for Abraham and his seed, or offspring,&lt;ref name = "BLB" &gt;{{Cite web | title = Blue Letter Bible: Dictionary and Word Search for zera` (Strong's 2233) | year = 2011 | url = http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2233&amp;t=KJV | accessdate = 2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of natural birth and adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|17:11–13|KJV}} And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Genesis 12–17 three covenants (or developments of the covenant) can be distinguished. According to the [[documentary hypothesis]] these covenants are based on the differing [[Jahwist]], [[Elohist]] and [[Priestly source|Priestly]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 62–68&lt;/ref&gt; In Genesis 12 and 15, God grants Abram land and descendants but does not place any stipulations (unconditional). By contrast, Gen. 17 contains the [[brit milah|covenant of circumcision]] (conditional).

* To make of Abraham a great nation and to bless those who bless him and curse those who curse him and all peoples on earth would be blessed through Abraham.{{Bibleref2c|Gen|12:1–3|NIV}}
* To give Abraham's descendants all the land from the river (or [[wadi]]) of Egypt to the [[Euphrates]].{{Bibleref2c|Gen|15:18–21|NIV}} Later, this land came to be referred to as the [[Promised Land]] or the [[Land of Israel]].
* To make Abraham the father of many nations and of many descendants and give "the whole land of [[Canaan]]" to his descendants.{{bibleref2c|Gen|17:2–9|NIV}}
* [[Religious male circumcision|Circumcision]] is to be the permanent sign of this everlasting covenant with Abraham and his male descendants and is known as the brit milah.{{bibleref2c|Gen|17:9–14|NIV}}

'''''Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History''''' is a book by [[Xiaoming Wang (paleontologist)|Xiaoming Wang]] and [[Richard H. Tedford]]. It was published in 2008 by [[Columbia University Press]]. The book offers a "holistic picture of canid evolution" and an overview of existing and extinct taxa, also detailing the evidence for the domestication and evolution of domestic dogs from their wolf ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lewis | first1=M | title=Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume=84 | issue=3 | pages=315–316 | date=Sep 2009 | doi=10.1086/644718 | url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/644718?journalCode=qrb&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received particular praise for its in-depth coverage of Chinese canids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yule | first1=JV | title=Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History by X.

The '''Eight Pillars''' also known as '''Eight Pillars of the Sky''' are a concept from [[Chinese mythology]]. Located in the eight cardinal directions, they are a group of eight mountains or pillars which have been thought to hold up the sky. They are symbolically important as types of ''[[axis mundi]]'' and [[cosmology]]. Their functions in mythology ranged from pillars which functioned to hold apart the Earth and the Sky (or Heaven), as ladders allowing travel between the two, and as the location of various paradises or wonderland with associated magical people, plants, and animals. The Eight Pillars are a central aspect to Chinese mythology, and also have been used extensively in poetic allusion. Some variations exist, such as only having four pillars.

==Places==
Various mythological geography is associated with the Eight Pillars, including the eight mountain pillars themselves along with surrounding or intervening terrain, such as the [[Moving Sands]]. The eight mountain pillars include [[Kunlun (mythology)|Kunlun]], [[Jade Mountain (mythology)|Jade Mountain]], [[Mount Buzhou]], and five more (Yang Lihui 2005: ''passim''). Kunlun functions as a sort of ladder which could be used to travel between earth and Heaven. Accordingly, any person who succeeded in climbing up to the top of Kunlun would magically become an immortal spirit (Yang 2005: 160-162).

===Buzhou Mountain===
{{Main|Mount Buzhou}}
Buzhou was the defective mountain pillar. Having been damaged by [[Gonggong]], it no longer separated the Earth and the Heaven for the proper distance. Bu-zhou was the northwest one (Hawkes, 1985 (2011): 94-95, 135-136, 323).

===Kunlun===
{{Main|Kunlun}}
Kunlun Mountain has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes Kunlun appears as a pillar of the sky (or earth), sometimes appearing as being composed of multiple tiers (Yang 2005: 160), with the commonality of "mystery, grandeur, or magnificence" being emphasized in the mythological descriptions. The base of the Kunlun Mountain is said to penetrate as far into the earth, as its above-ground part proceeds towards the sky (Christie1968: 74). As the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an ''[[axis mundi]]'' from the [[cosmology]] of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) [[Sumeru|Mount Sumeru]]. Another historical development in the mythology of Kunlun, (again with Indian influence) was that rather than just being the source of the [[Yellow River]], Kunlun began to be considered to be the source of four major rivers flowing to the four quarters of the compass (Christie 1968:74).

===Jade Mountain===
{{Main|Jade Mountain (mythology)}}
Another of the Eight Pillars was Jade Mountain.

===Associated geography===
Various other mythological geography is associated with the Eight Pillars. This includes the four rivers flowing from Kunlun Mountain and the Moving Sands.

==Activities==
Various activities took place at the eight pillars. For one, they were often thought of as reaching from Earth to Heaven; thus, climbing one of the pillars would allow one to reach Heaven from Earth.

==Inhabitants==
The eight mountain pillars were favorite places for all sorts of characters to visit or dwell. This includes various deities, immortals, and shamans.

===Deities===
Various deities inhabited or visited one or more of the eight mountain pillars. These include [[Xiwangmu]] and others on Kunlun.

====Queen Mother of the West (Xiwangmu)====
Although not originally located on Kunlun, but rather on a [[Jade Mountain (mythology)|Jade Mountain]] neighboring to the north (and west of the [[Moving Sands]]), Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals ([[xian (Taoism)|xian]]) feasted on bear paws, monkey lips, and the livers of dragons, served at the edge of the Lake of Gems. Every 6000 years the peaches which conferred immortality upon those who ate them would be served (except the time when they were purloined by [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]). Originally a plague deity with tiger teeth and leopard tail, she became a beautiful and well-mannered goddess responsible for guarding the herb of immortality (Christie 1968: 78-79).

===''Xian (Immortals)''===
{{Further|Xian (Taoism)}}
The immortals, or ''xian'', were Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form). The ''xian'' were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a [[crane in Chinese mythology|magical crane]] or dragon.

====Wu shamans====
{{Further|Wu (shaman)|List of wu shamans}}
The Wu or shamans were people that practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing, generally through the use of spirit flight. They generally seem to have become immortals.

==Poetry==
The Eight Pillars are a subject of poetic allusion from the ancient poems "[[Li Sao]]" and "[[Heavenly Questions]]"  by [[Qu Yuan]]; and, on through later times, in [[Classical Chinese poetry]]. The immortals, or ''[[Xian]]'', were Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form), which was presided over by Xiwangmu. The ''xian'' were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a [[crane in Chinese mythology|magical crane]] or dragon.

An '''environmental gradient''' is a gradual change in [[Abiotic component|abiotic factors]] through space (or time). Environmental gradients can be related to factors such as [[altitude]], [[temperature]], depth, ocean proximity and soil humidity.

Species [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]]s usually change along environmental gradients in a more or less predictive way. However, the species abundance along an environmental gradient is not only determined by the abiotic factor but, also by the change in the [[biotic interaction]]s, like [[competition (biology)|competition]], along the environmental gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinckley |first=Tom |title=Gradients |url=http://www.sefs.washington.edu/classes.esc.401/Gradients.htm |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=18 September 2013 |author2=Combs, Julie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415130557/http://www.sefs.washington.edu/classes.esc.401/Gradients.htm |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an [[ecotone]], species [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]]s change relatively quickly compared to the environmental gradient.

The [[species distribution]] along environmental gradients has been studied intensively due to large databases of species presence data (e.g. [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility|GBIF]])

Environmental Gradients are linked to Connectivity and natural disturbance when considering river systems. A river restoration scheme must consider all of these factors before undertaking a program as these three factors are what leads to a larger biodiversity.

Each species are not found in every type of habitat or in every part of the world. Within the environment there are multiple factors which affects organisms. The organisms in the polar region can not survive the climate at the equator.

[[Huisman–Olff–Fresco models]] describe unimodal species responses over an environmental gradient.

'''Gilbert White''' [[Royal Society|FRS]] (18 July 1720 – 26 June 1793) was a "[[parson-naturalist]]", a pioneering [[England|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He remained unmarried and a curate all his life. He is best known for his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''.

==Life==

[[File:Gilbert White's house, back view.JPG|left|thumb|Gilbert White's house, ''The Wakes'', now a museum, viewed from the back gardens in 2010]] White was born in his grandfather's vicarage at [[Selborne]] in [[Hampshire]]. He was educated at the [[Queen Mary's School for Boys, Basingstoke|Holy Ghost School]] {{sfn|Baigent|Millard|1889|p=161}} and by a private tutor in [[Basingstoke]] before going to [[Oriel College, Oxford]]. He obtained his [[deacon]]'s orders in 1746, being fully ordained in 1749, and subsequently held several curacies in Hampshire and [[Wiltshire]], including Selborne's neighbouring parishes of [[Newton Valence]] and [[Farringdon, Hampshire|Farringdon]], as well as Selborne itself on four separate occasions. In 1752/53 White held the office of Junior [[Proctor]] at Oxford and was [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Oriel. In 1757 he became non-resident [[perpetual curate]] of [[Moreton Pinkney]] in [[Northamptonshire]]. After the death of his father in 1758, White moved back into the family home at ''The Wakes'' in Selborne, which he eventually inherited in 1763. In 1784 he became curate of Selborne for the fourth time, remaining so until his death.  Having studied at the more prestigious Oriel, at the behest of his uncle, he was ineligible to be considered for the permanent living of Selborne, which was in the gift of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

White is regarded by many as [[England]]'s first [[ecologist]], and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D. L., Heinsohn, R. G. and Lindenmayer, D.

Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the [[earthworm]]:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z_YVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Letter LXVII] (1777)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White and [[William Markwick]] collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species, White recording in Hampshire and Markwick in [[Sussex]] between 1768 and 1793. These data, summarised in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern [[phenology]]. 

American nature writer, [[Donald C. Peattie]], writes in ''The Road of a Naturalist'' about White's contribution to the public interest in birds: "The bird census, now so widely promulgated by the Audubon Society, was the invention of Gilbert White; he was the original exponent, as far as I know, of the close seasonal observation of Nature, a branch of science known to the pedantic as phenology. He was the first to perceive the value in the study of migration (then a disputed fact) and of banding or ringing birds, though it was Audubon who first performed the experiment. No professional ornithologist ever did so much to widen interest in birds; from White's pages they cock a friendly eye at us, and hop out of his leaves right over our thresholds."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Culross Peattie. The Road of a Naturalist. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1941. P278-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1783–84 diary corroborates the dramatic climatic impacts of the volcanic '[[Laki|Laki haze]]' that spread from Iceland with lethal consequences across Europe.

Gilbert White's sister Anne was married to [[Thomas Barker (meteorologist)|Thomas Barker]] (1722–1809),&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Evans, ''Highways and Byways in Northampton &amp; Rutland'', Pocket edition ([[Macmillan &amp; Co]], London 1924), 161-62.&lt;/ref&gt; called 'The father of meteorology', and Gilbert maintained a correspondence with his nephew [[Samuel Barker (Hebraist)|Samuel Barker]], who also kept a naturalist's journal.&lt;ref&gt;See 'Literary and Scientific Intelligence', ''Gentleman's Magazine'' Vol 5, 1835, 289-90 [https://books.google.com/books?id=u1NIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA289 read here]&lt;/ref&gt;

White is best known for his ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' (1789). This is presented as a compilation of his letters to [[Thomas Pennant]], the leading British [[zoologist]] of the day, and the Hon. [[Daines Barrington]], an [[England|English]] [[barrister]] and another [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]], though a number of the 'letters' such as the first nine were never posted, and were written especially for the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The English Parson-Naturalist | publisher=Gracewing | author=Armstrong, Patrick | year=2000 | pages=83 |quote="An obvious example is the first, nominally to Thomas Pennant, but which is clearly contrived, as it introduces the parish..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been continuously in print since its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=1408 Project Gutenberg edition of The Natural History of Selborne]&lt;/ref&gt; It was long held, "probably apocryphally", to be the fourth-most published book in the English language after the [[Bible]], the [[Complete Works of Shakespeare|works of Shakespeare]], and [[John Bunyan]]’s ''[[The Pilgrim’s Progress]]''.&lt;ref name=Mabey6&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

White's biographer, [[Richard Mabey]], praises White's expressiveness:&lt;ref name=Mabey173&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|What is striking is the way Gilbert [White] often arranges his sentence structure to echo the physical style of a bird's flight. So 'The [[Whitethroat|white-throat]] uses odd jerks and gesticulations over the tops of hedges and bushes'; and '[[Woodpeckers]] fly ''volatu undosu'' [in an undulating flight], opening and closing their wings at every stroke, and so are always rising and falling in curves.'&lt;ref name=Mabey173/&gt;}}

The White family house in Selborne, ''The Wakes'', now contains the Gilbert White Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gilbertwhiteshouse.org.uk/ | title=Gilbert White's House and Garden and the Oates Collection | accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Selborne Society]] was founded in 1895 to perpetuate the memory of Gilbert White.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} It purchased land by the [[Grand Union Canal]] at [[Perivale]] in West London to create the first Bird Sanctuary in Britain, known as [[Perivale Wood]]. In the 1970s, Perivale Wood became a [[Local Nature Reserve]]. This initiative was led by a group of young naturalists, notably Edward Dawson and Peter Edwards, Kevin Roberts and Andrew Duff. It was designated by [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing Borough Council]] under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://perivalewood.k-hosting.co.uk | title=Perivale Wood Local Nature Reserve owned and managed by the Selborne Society Ltd as the Gilbert White Memorial | publisher=The Selborne Society | accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flora Thompson]], the countryside novelist, said of White: "It is easy to imagine him, this very first of English nature writers, the most sober and modest, yet happiest of men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Thompson, Flora; Shuckburgh, Julian (editor) | title=The Peverel Papers - A yearbook of the countryside | publisher=Century Hutchinson | year=1986 | isbn=0-712-61296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White is quoted by [[Merlyn]] in ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' by [[T.H. White]] and in ''The Boy in Grey'' by [[Henry Kingsley]], in which [[Scaly thrush|White's thrush]] appears as a character.

The Reserve is owned and managed by the Selborne Society, named to commemorate White's ''Natural History''. White's frequent accounts of a [[tortoise]] inherited from his aunt in ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' form the basis for [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]]'s book, ''Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile'' (2006), and for [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]]'s ''The Portrait of a Tortoise'' (1946).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

{{Global surveillance}}

'''Global surveillance''' refers to the [[mass surveillance]] of entire populations across national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Maureen|title=Illusions of Security: Global Surveillance and Democracy in the Post-9/11 World|year=2007|publisher=[[City Lights Books]]|location=San Francisco|isbn=0872864766|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots can be traced back to the middle of the 20th century when the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, which later expanded to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to create the present [[Five Eyes]] alliance. The alliance developed cooperation arrangements with several "third-party" nations. Eventually, this resulted in the establishment of a global surveillance network, code-named "[[ECHELON]]" (1971).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nabbali 2004 84–97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its existence, however, was not widely acknowledged by governments and the mainstream media until the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] by [[Edward Snowden]] triggered a debate about the [[right to privacy]] in the [[Digital Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zevenbergen|first=Bendert|title=Adventures in digital surveillance|journal=European View|date=3 December 2013|volume=12|issue=2|pages=223–233|doi=10.1007/s12290-013-0287-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12290-013-0287-x|accessdate=17 December 2013|quote=Snowden used the press to inform the world that a global surveillance state may be being built.

== Historical background ==

{{Main|Origins of global surveillance}}

The [[origins of global surveillance]] can be traced back to the late 1940s after the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was collaboratively enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, which eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network code-named "'''[[ECHELON]]'''" in 1971.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nabbali 2004 84–97"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal|1970s Watergate affair]] and a subsequent [[congressional inquiry]] led by Sen. [[Frank Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html|title=Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms - Spying On The Home Front - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |title=No Holiday |url= |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the [[European Parliament]] highlighted the NSA's role in [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]] in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peggy Becker |date=October 1999 |title=DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND RISK OF ABUSE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION |url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/development-of-surveillance-technology-and-risk-of-abuse-of-economic-information-pbQASTOA132/downloads/QA-ST-OA-132-EN-N/QASTOA132ENN_002.pdf;pgid=y8dIS7GUWMdSR0EAlMEUUsWb00002lUIfz2M;sid=w3lJEyGE1rNJH3CegDfXtEOhYbo1Q2zn3Qs=?FileName=QASTOA132ENN_002.pdf&amp;SKU=QASTOA132ENN_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=QA-ST-OA-132-EN-N |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page= |docket= |accessdate=31 January 2014 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, [[Edward Snowden]]. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]] were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/07/15/snowden-has-thousands-of-damaging-nsa-documents-says-greenwald/|title=Snowden has 'thousands' of damaging NSA documents, says Greenwald|work=MSNBC|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries around the world, including [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] and member states of [[NATO]], have been targeted by the "[[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]]" strategic alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA—five English-speaking [[Western world|Western countries]] aiming to achieve [[Total Information Awareness]] by [[mastering the Internet]] with analytical tools such as the [[Boundless Informant]].&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Ewen MacAskill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining |title=Boundless Informant: the NSA's secret tool to track global surveillance data |work=The Guardian |accessdate=12 June 2013 |location=London |date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As confirmed by the NSA's director [[Keith B. Alexander]] on 26 September 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators: Limit NSA snooping into US phone records |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029003314/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2013 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=15 October 2013 |quote="Is it the goal of the NSA to collect the phone records of all Americans?" Udall asked at Thursday's hearing.  "Yes, I believe it is in the nation's best interest to put all the phone records into a lockbox that we could search when the nation needs to do it.

On 6 June 2013, Britain's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper began publishing a series of revelations by an as yet unknown American whistleblower, revealed several days later to be ex-CIA and ex-NSA-contracted systems analyst Edward Snowden. Snowden gave a cache of documents to two journalists: [[Glenn Greenwald]] and [[Laura Poitras]], Greenwald later estimated that the cache contains 15,000 – 20,000 documents, some very large and very detailed, and some very small.&lt;ref name=cepr1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/the-americas-blog/greenwald-testifies-to-brazilian-senate-about-nsa-espionage-targeting-brazil-and-latin-america|title=Greenwald Testifies to Brazilian Senate about NSA Espionage Targeting Brazil and Latin America |author =Duran-Sanchez, Mabel|date=10 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Senado1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.br/noticias/TV/default.asp?IND_ACESSO=S&amp;cod_midia=269827&amp;cod_video=267526|title=Glenn Greenwald afirma que documentos dizem respeito à interesses comerciais do governo americano|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In over two subsequent months of publications, it became clear that the NSA had operated a complex web of spying programs which allowed it to intercept Internet and telephone conversations from over a billion users from dozens of countries around the world. Specific revelations were made about China, the European Union, Latin America, Iran and Pakistan, and Australia and New Zealand, however, the published documentation reveals that many of the programs indiscriminately collected bulk information directly from central servers and Internet backbones, which almost invariably carry and reroute information from distant countries.

Due to this central server and backbone monitoring, many of the programs overlapped and interrelated among one another. These programs were often carried out with the assistance of US entities such as the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[FBI]],&lt;ref name="microsoft"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data How Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 July 2013. Retrieved 13 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was sanctioned by US laws such as the [[FISA Amendments Act]], and the necessary court orders for them were signed by the secret [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]. Some of the NSA's programs were directly aided by national and foreign intelligence agencies, Britain's [[GCHQ]] and Australia's [[Defence Signals Directorate|DSD]], as well as by large private telecommunications and Internet corporations, such as [[Verizon]], [[Telstra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bridie Jabour in Sydney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/12/telstra-deal-america-government-spying |title=Telstra signed deal that would have allowed US spying |work=The Guardian |date=12 July 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google]] and Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;The first three days of revelations were: the FISC court order that Verizon provide bulk metadata to its customers to the NSA; presentation slides explaining the cooperation of nine US internet giants through the PRISM program; and the bulk collection of Chinese users' text messages, which coincided with [[Xi Jinping]]'s visit to California to meet [[Barack Obama]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden's disclosures of the NSA's surveillance activities are a continuation of [[news leak]]s which have been ongoing since the early 2000s. One year after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], former U.S. intelligence official [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], was publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shorrock |first= Tim |authorlink= Tim Shorrock |title= The Untold Story: Obama's Crackdown on Whistleblowers: The NSA Four reveal how a toxic mix of cronyism and fraud blinded the agency before 9/11 |journal= The Nation |date= 15 April 2013 |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/173521/obamas-crackdown-whistleblowers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further disclosures followed. On 16 December 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report under the headline "[[George W.

The newspaper released a report on 11 May 2006, regarding the NSA's "massive database" of phone records collected from "tens of millions" of U.S. citizens. According to ''USA Today'', these phone records were provided by several telecom companies such as [[AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] and [[BellSouth]].&lt;ref name="USATODAY1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls|last=Leslie Cauley|first=|work=|access-date=|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=11 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the security analyst [[Babak Pasdar]] revealed the existence of the so-called "Quantico circuit" that he and his team discovered in 2003 when brought on to update the carrier's security system. The circuit provided the U.S. federal government with a backdoor into the network of an unnamed wireless provider, which was later independently identified as [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=Whistle-Blower: Feds Have a Backdoor Into Wireless Carrier — Congress Reacts|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/whistleblower-f/|work=Wired|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Global surveillance by category}}

Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 include court orders, memos, and policy documents related to a wide range of surveillance activities.

== Purposes ==

According to the April 2013 summary of documents leaked by Snowden, other than to combat terrorism, these surveillance programs were employed to assess the foreign policy and economic stability of other countries,&lt;ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark |title=Ally and Target: US Intelligence Watches Germany Closely|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-is-a-both-a-partner-to-and-a-target-of-nsa-surveillance-a-916029.html|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to gather "commercial secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colombia asks Kerry to explain NSA spying|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kerry-to-face-questions-on-nsa-spying-during-south-america-trip/2013/08/12/afdab47e-0382-11e3-88d6-d5795fab4637_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 13, 2013|first=Karen|last=DeYoung|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement addressed to the [[National Congress of Brazil]] in early August 2013, journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] maintained that the U.S. government had used [[counter-terrorism]] as a pretext for clandestine surveillance in order to compete with other countries in the "business, industrial and economic fields".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenwald diz que espionagem dá vantagens comerciais e industriais aos Estados Unidos|url=http://www12.senado.gov.br/noticias/materias/2013/08/06/greenwald-diz-que-espionagem-da-vantagens-comerciais-e-industriais-aos-estados-unidos|publisher=Federal Senate of Brazil|accessdate=August 13, 2013|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenwald diz que EUA espionam para obter vantagens comerciais|url=http://www.dw.de/greenwald-diz-que-eua-espionam-para-obter-vantagens-comerciais/a-17002867|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=August 13, 2013|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA's activity in Latin America is 'collection of data on oil and military purchases from Venezuela, energy and narcotics from Mexico' – Greenwald|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_08_07/NSA-s-activity-in-Latin-America-is-collection-of-data-on-oil-and-military-purchases-from-Venezuela-energy-and-narcotics-from-Mexico-Greenwald-1337/|publisher=Voice of Russia|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2013 letter to the [[Brazilian government]], Snowden wrote that "These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation.

In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published on 12 August 2013, former NSA Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] admitted that "We (the NSA) steal secrets. We're number one in it". Hayden also added: "We steal stuff to make you safe, not to make you rich".&lt;ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/&gt;

According to documents seen by the news agency [[Reuters]], these "secrets" were subsequently funnelled to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.&lt;ref name="reuters3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805|agency=Reuters|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal agents are then instructed to "recreate" the investigative trail in order to "cover up" where the information originated.&lt;ref name="reuters3" /&gt;

According to the congressional testimony of [[Keith B. Alexander]], [[Director of the National Security Agency]], one of the purposes of its data collection is to store all the phone records inside a place that can be searched and assessed at all times. When asked by Senator [[Mark Udall]] if the goal of the NSA is to collect the phone records of all Americans, Alexander replied, "Yes, I believe it is in the nation's best interest to put all the phone records into a lockbox that we could search when the nation needs to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators: Limit NSA snooping into US phone records |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029003314/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2013 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=15 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The ''Times'', the NSA can "augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including [[bank code]]s, [[insurance]] information, [[Facebook]] profiles, [[Manifest (transportation)|passenger manifests]], [[Voter database|voter registration rolls]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location information, as well as [[property]] records and unspecified [[tax]] data".&lt;ref name="nsasocial"/&gt; Such types of data were collected from U.S. citizens as well as foreign nationals.&lt;ref name="nsasocial"/&gt;]]

The NSA uses the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs of American citizens to create sophisticated graphs of their social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their travelling companions and other personal information.&lt;ref name="nsasocial"&gt;{{cite news|title=N.S.A.

According to [[top secret]] NSA documents leaked by Snowden, during a single day in 2012, the NSA collected [[e-mail]] [[address book]]s from:

* 22,881 [[Gmail]] accounts&lt;ref name="wapo1"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |title=NSA collects millions of e-mail address books globally|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=20 December 2013|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 105,068 [[Outlook.com|Hotmail]] accounts&lt;ref name="wapo1"/&gt;
* 444,743 [[Yahoo!]] accounts&lt;ref name="wapo1"/&gt;

Each day, the NSA collects contacts from an estimated 500,000 [[Contact list|buddy lists]] on live-chat services as well as from the inbox displays of Web-based e-mail accounts.&lt;ref name="wapo1"/&gt; Taken together, the data enables the NSA to draw detailed maps of a person's life based on their personal, professional, religious and political connections.&lt;ref name="wapo1"/&gt;

=== Data transfer ===

Federal agencies in the United States:  Data gathered by these surveillance programs is routinely shared with the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref name=microsoftencrypt&gt;{{cite web|author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Ewen MacAskill |author3=Laura Poitras |author4=Spencer Ackerman |author5=Dominic Rushe |title=Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the NSA supplies domestic intercepts to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and other law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="reuters3" /&gt;

Foreign countries: As a result of the NSA's [[secret treaty|secret treaties]] with foreign countries, data gathered by its surveillance programs are routinely shared with countries who are signatories to the [[UKUSA Agreement]]. These foreign countries also help to operate several NSA programs such as '''[[XKeyscore|XKEYSCORE]]'''. (See [[Global surveillance#International cooperation|International cooperation]].)

=== Financial payments monitoring ===

A special branch of the NSA called "'''Follow the Money'''" (FTM) monitors international payments, banking and credit card transactions and later stores the collected data in the NSA's financial databank, "'''Tracfin'''".&lt;ref name="nsafin"&gt;{{cite web|title='Follow the Money': NSA Spies on International Payments|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-exclusive-nsa-spies-on-international-bank-transactions-a-922276.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile phone location tracking ===

[[Mobile phone tracking]] refers to the act of attaining the position and coordinates of a mobile phone. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than 5 billion records of phone locations on a daily basis. This enables NSA analysts to map cellphone owners' relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.&lt;ref name=wapo52013&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |title=NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the NSA is tracking people right now|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/how-the-nsa-is-tracking-people-right-now/634/|accessdate=6 December 2013|date=4 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FASCIA: The NSA's huge trove of location records|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/what-is-fascia/637/|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013|author1=Ashkan Soltani |author2=Matt DeLong }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and 'develop' targets|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/how-the-nsa-uses-cellphone-tracking-to-find-and-develop-targets/2013/12/04/d9114d52-5d1f-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_video.html|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reporter explains NSA collection of cellphone data|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/politics/reporter-explains-nsa-collection-of-cellphone-data/2013/12/04/67b85252-5d26-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_video.html|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=The NSA says it 'obviously' can track locations without a warrant.

=== Infiltration of smartphones ===

As worldwide sales of [[smartphone]]s grew rapidly, the NSA decided to take advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone contains a variety of data sets that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behaviour, interests, location, photos and [[credit card]] numbers and passwords.&lt;ref name="spiegel201399"/&gt;

According to the documents leaked by Snowden, the NSA has set up [[task force]]s assigned to several smartphone manufacturers and [[operating systems]], including [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPhone]] and [[iOS]] operating system, as well as [[Google]]'s [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system.&lt;ref name="spiegel201399"/&gt; Similarly, Britain's [[GCHQ]] assigned a team to study and crack the [[BlackBerry]].&lt;ref name="spiegel201399"/&gt; In addition, there are smaller NSA programs, known as "scripts", that can perform surveillance on 38 different features of the [[iOS 3]] and [[iOS 4]] operating systems. These include the [[map]]ping feature, [[voicemail]] and photos, as well as [[Google Earth]], [[Facebook]] and [[Yahoo! Messenger]].&lt;ref name="spiegel201399"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark |title=iSpy: How the NSA Accesses Smartphone Data|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-spies-on-smartphones-including-the-blackberry-a-921161.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infiltration of commercial data centers ===

In contrast to the '''[[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]]''' surveillance program, which is a front-door method of access that is nominally approved by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA court]], the '''[[Muscular (surveillance program)|MUSCULAR]]''' surveillance program is noted to be "unusually aggressive" in its usage of unorthodox hacking methods to infiltrate Yahoo! and Google [[data centre]]s around the world. As the program is operated overseas ([[United Kingdom]]), the NSA presumes that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner, and is, therefore, able to collect content and metadata on a previously unknown scale from U.S. citizens and residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|title=NSA infiltrates links to Yahoo, Google data centers worldwide, Snowden documents say|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Ashkan|last2=Soltani|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documents leaked by Snowden, the MUSCULAR surveillance program is jointly operated by the NSA and Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] agency.&lt;ref name="How we know"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/|title=How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Ashkan|last2=Soltani|first3=Andrea|last3=Peterson|work=The Washington Post|date=4 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Global surveillance#International cooperation|International cooperation]].)

=== Infiltration of anonymous networks ===

The [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] have made repeated attempts to spy on Internet users communicating in secret via the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Several of their clandestine operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of anonymous Tor users who visit infected websites. In some cases, the NSA and GCHQ have succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. In other cases, the NSA and the GCHQ were able to uncover the identity of these anonymous users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6-2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Craig Timberg |author3=Steven Rich }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA slideshow on 'The TOR problem'|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-slideshow-on-the-tor-problem/499/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Steven Rich |author2=Matt DeLong }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Everything you need to know about the NSA and Tor in one FAQ|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nsa-and-tor-in-one-faq/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA report on the Tor encrypted network|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-research-report-on-the-tor-encryption-program/501/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ report on 'MULLENIZE' program to 'stain' anonymous electronic traffic|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/gchq-report-on-mullenize-program-to-stain-anonymous-electronic-traffic/502/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013|author1=James Ball |author2=Bruce Schneier |author3=Glenn Greenwald }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|title=Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Tor Stinks' presentation – read the full document|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monitoring of hotel reservation systems ===

Under the '''[[Royal Concierge]]''' surveillance program, Britain's GCHQ agency uses an automated monitoring system to infiltrate the [[hotel reservation system|reservation system]]s of at least 350 luxury [[hotel]]s in many different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Holger Stark |title='Royal Concierge': GCHQ Monitors Hotel Reservations to Track Diplomats|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/gchq-monitors-hotel-reservations-to-track-diplomats-a-933914.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=17 November 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related surveillance programs involve the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels, as well as the monitoring of computers, hooked up to the hotel network.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"/&gt;

=== [[Virtual reality]] surveillance ===

The U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) have been conducting surveillance on the networks of many online games, including [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) such as [[World of Warcraft]], as well as [[virtual world]]s such as [[Second Life]], and the [[Xbox]] gaming console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=MARK MAZZETTI |author2=JUSTIN ELLIOTT |title=Spies Infiltrate a Fantasy Realm of Online Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/world/spies-dragnet-reaches-a-playing-field-of-elves-and-trolls.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=12 December 2013|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political espionage ==

According to the April 2013 summary of disclosures, the NSA defined its "intelligence priorities" on a scale of "1" (highest interest) to "5" (lowest interest).&lt;ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/&gt; It classified about 30 countries as "3rd parties", with whom it cooperates but also spies on:

* '''Main targets''': China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan were ranked highly on the NSA's list of spying priorities, followed by France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil. The [[European Union]]'s "international trade" and "economic stability" are also of interest.&lt;ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/&gt; Other high priority targets include Cuba, Israel, and North Korea.&lt;ref name="WaPo20130829"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-budget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html|title=U.S. spy network's successes, failures and objectives detailed in 'black budget' summary|authors=Barton Gellman and Greg Miller|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Irrelevant''': From a US intelligence perspective, countries such as Cambodia, Laos and Nepal were largely irrelevant, as were governments of smaller European Union countries such as Finland, Denmark, Croatia and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/&gt;

Other prominent targets included members and adherents of the Internet group known as "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]",&lt;ref name="spiegellaurapoitras"/&gt; as well as potential whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maass|first=Peter|title=How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Snowden, the NSA targeted reporters who wrote critically about the government after 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Easley|first=Jonathan|title=Snowden: NSA targeted journalists critical of government after 9/11 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316751-snowden-nsa-targeted-journalists-critical-of-government-after-911|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a joint operation with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), the NSA deployed secret eavesdropping posts in eighty U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide.&lt;ref name="spiegel1000"/&gt; The headquarters of [[NATO]] were also used by NSA experts to spy on the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras |author2=Marcel Rosenbach |author3=Fidelius Schmid |author4=Holger Stark |title=Attacks from America: NSA Spied on European Union Offices|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/nsa-spied-on-european-union-offices-a-908590.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, documents provided by Edward Snowden revealed that the following [[intergovernmental organization]]s, diplomatic missions, and government ministries have been subjected to surveillance by the "[[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]]":

[[File:UKUSA Map.svg|thumb|The "[[Five Eyes]]" of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States]]
During [[World War II]], the [[1943 BRUSA Agreement|BRUSA Agreement]] was signed by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom for the purpose of intelligence sharing.&lt;ref name="BRUSA papers"&gt;U.S. National Security Agency. [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ukusa/early_papers_1940-1944.pdf Early Papers Concerning US-UK Agreement – 1940–1944] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015422/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ukusa/early_papers_1940-1944.pdf |date=18 September 2013 }}. Agreement between British Government Code and Cipher School and U.S. War Department dated 17 May 1943. Retrieved: 5 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This was later formalized in the [[UKUSA Agreement]] of 1946 as a [[secret treaty]]. The full text of the agreement was released to the public on 25 June 2010.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the treaty was later revised to include other countries such as Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Turkey, and the Philippines,&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"/&gt; most of the information sharing has been performed by the so-called "'''[[Five Eyes]]'''",&lt;ref name="fiveeyesap"&gt;{{cite news|title=5-nation spy alliance too vital for leaks to harm|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/experts-say-us-spy-alliance-will-survive-snowden|work=Associated Press|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term referring to the following English-speaking [[Western world|western democracies]] and their respective intelligence agencies:

* {{flagicon|AUS}} – The [[Defence Signals Directorate]] of Australia&lt;ref name="fiveeyesap"/&gt;

* {{flagicon|UK}} – The [[Government Communications Headquarters]] of the United Kingdom, which is widely considered to be a leader in traditional spying due to its influence on countries that were once part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="fiveeyesap"/&gt;
* {{flagicon|USA}} – The [[National Security Agency]] of the United States, which has the biggest budget and the most advanced technical abilities among the "''five eyes''".&lt;ref name="fiveeyesap"/&gt;

[[File:Asia-europe cable Route.png|centre|thumb|800px|[[Top secret]] documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the "Five Eyes" have gained access to the majority of Internet and telephone communications flowing throughout Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.]]
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Left''': [[SEA-ME-WE 3]], which runs across the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n [[supercontinent]] from Japan to [[Northern Germany]], is one of the most important [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] accessed by the "Five Eyes". Singapore, a former British colony in the Asia-Pacific region (blue dot), plays a vital role in intercepting Internet and telecommunications traffic heading from Australia/Japan to Europe, and vice versa. An intelligence-sharing agreement between Singapore and Australia allows the rest of the "Five Eyes" to gain access to [[SEA-ME-WE 3]].&lt;ref name="smhaug28"/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Right''': [[TAT-14]], a telecommunications cable linking Europe with the United States, was identified as one of few assets of "Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources" of the USA on foreign territory. In 2013, it was revealed that British officials "pressured a handful of telecommunications and Internet companies" to allow the British government to gain access to [[TAT-14]].&lt;ref name="SZAug28"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/59603415442/british-officials-have-far-reaching-access-to-internet|title=British Officials Have Far-Reaching Access To Internet And Telephone Communications|author1=John Goetz |author2=Hans Leyendecker |author3=Frederik Obermaier |date=28 August 2013|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the leaked documents, aside from the Five Eyes, most other Western countries have also participated in the NSA surveillance system and are sharing information with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Snowden Interview: The NSA and Its Willing Helpers|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|quote=Snowden: Yes, of course.

Glenn Greenwald said that the "NSA often maintains these partnerships by paying its partner to develop certain technologies and engage in surveillance, and can thus direct how the spying is carried out." These partner countries are divided into two groups, "Second Parties" and "Third Parties".

The [[Australian Signals Directorate]] ('''ASD'''), formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate ('''DSD'''), shares information on Australian citizens with the other members of the [[UKUSA Agreement]]. According to a 2008 [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] document leaked by Snowden, data of Australian citizens shared with foreign countries include "bulk, unselected, unminimised metadata" as well as "medical, legal or religious information".&lt;ref name=guardian031213&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=James Ball |author3=Katharine Murphy |title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In close cooperation with other members of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] community, the ASD runs secret surveillance facilities in many parts of [[Southeast Asia]] without the knowledge of Australian diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip Dorling|title=Exposed: Australia's Asia spy network|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/exposed-australias-asia-spy-network-20131030-2whia.html|accessdate=22 December 2013|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ASD cooperates with the [[Security and Intelligence Division]] (SID) of the [[Republic of Singapore]] in an international operation to intercept underwater telecommunications cables across the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=philipsg/&gt;

In March 2017 it was reported that, on advice from the [[Five Eyes| Five Eyes intelligence alliance]], more than 500 Iraqi and Syrian refugees, have been refused entry to Australia, in the last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/security-red-flag-for-500-refugees-on-international-watchlist/news-story/129957e81c26c099045685818b56ceea  |title=Security red flag for 500 refugees |author=Benson, Simon|date=23 March 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

The [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] ('''CSEC''') offers the NSA resources for advanced collection, processing, and analysis. It has set up [[Covert operation|covert]] sites at the request of NSA.&lt;ref name="cbccanusa"&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA's Intelligence Relationship with Canada's Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC)|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/pdf/nsa-canada-april32013.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US-Canada [[Signals intelligence|SIGNT]] relationship dates back to a secret alliance formed during [[World War II]], and was formalized in 1949 under the [[CANUSA Agreement]].&lt;ref name="cbccanusa"/&gt;

On behalf of the NSA, the CSEC opened secret surveillance facilities in 20 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Greg Weston |author2=Glenn Greenwald |author3=Ryan Gallagher |title=Snowden document shows Canada set up spy posts for NSA|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/snowden-document-shows-canada-set-up-spy-posts-for-nsa-1.2456886|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] has been revealed, following the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] to be engaging in surveillance on Wifi Hotspots of major Canadian Airports, collecting meta-data to use for engaging in surveillance on travelers, even days after their departure from said airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881|title=CSEC used airport Wi-Fi to track Canadian travellers: Edward Snowden documents|date=31 January 2014|work=cbc.ca|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===

The [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste]] ('''PET''') of Denmark, a domestic intelligence agency, exchanges data with the NSA on a regular basis, as part of a secret agreement with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden leak confirms Denmark spying deal with US|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/snowden-leak-confirms-denmark-spying-deal-with-us.8185.html|publisher=''[[The Copenhagen Post]]''|author=Justin Cremer|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being one of the "[[UKUSA Agreement#9 Eyes.2C 14 Eyes.2C and other .22third parties.22|9-Eyes]]" of the [[UKUSA Agreement]], Denmark's relationship with the NSA is closer than the NSA's relationship with Germany, Sweden, Spain, Belgium or Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark is one of the NSA's '9-Eyes'|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark-is-one-of-the-nsas-9-eyes.7611.html|publisher=''[[The Copenhagen Post]]''|author=Justin Cremer|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

The [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] ('''BND''') of Germany systematically transfers metadata from German intelligence sources to the NSA. In December 2012 alone, the BND provided the NSA with 500 million metadata records.&lt;ref name="SpiegelMetadata"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/bnd-leitet-laut-spiegel-massenhaft-metadaten-an-die-nsa-weiter-a-914682.html|title =Überwachung: BND leitet massenhaft Metadaten an die NSA weiter|date=3 August 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA granted the Bundesnachrichtendienst access to '''[[X-Keyscore]]''',&lt;ref name="xKeyscoreGermany"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agencies-used-nsa-spying-program-a-912173.html 'Prolific Partner': German Intelligence Used NSA Spy Program], ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.

In early 2013, [[Hans-Georg Maaßen]], President of the German domestic security agency [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz]] ('''BfV'''), made several visits to the headquarters of the NSA. According to [[top secret|classified]] documents of the German government, Maaßen agreed to transfer all data records of persons monitored in Germany by the BfV via '''XKeyscore''' to the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verfassungsschutz beliefert NSA|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/spionage-in-deutschland-verfassungsschutz-beliefert-nsa-1.1770672|publisher=''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''|accessdate=14 September 2013|language=German|quote=Seit Juli 2013 testet der Verfassungsschutz die Späh- und Analysesoftware XKeyscore.

In 2012, the BfV handed over 864 [[data set]]s of personal information to the CIA, NSA and seven other [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]]. In exchange, the BND received data from U.S. intelligence agencies on 1,830 occasions. The newly acquired data was handed over to the BfV and stored in a domestically accessible system known as '''[[Nachrichtendienstliches Informationssystem|NADIS WN]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthias Gebauer |author2=Hubert Gude |author3=Veit Medick |author4=Jörg Schindler |author5=Fidelius Schmid |title=CIA Worked With BND and BfV In Neuss on Secret Project|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cia-worked-with-bnd-and-bfv-in-neuss-on-secret-project-a-921254-2.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===

[[File:Israel Memorandum of Understanding SIGINT.pdf|thumb|On 11 September 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' released a secret NSA document leaked by Snowden, which reveals how Israel's [[Unit 8200]] ('''ISNU''') was given raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens, as part of a secret agreement with the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name="israelnsa1"&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA shares raw intelligence including Americans' data with Israel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents|accessdate=September 14, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 11, 2013|author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Laura Poitras |author3=Ewen MacAskill }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Unit 8200|Israeli SIGINT National Unit]] ('''ISNU''') routinely receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens from the NSA. However, a secret NSA document leaked by Snowden revealed that U.S. government officials are explicitly exempted from such forms of data sharing with the ISNU.&lt;ref name="israelnsa1"/&gt; As stated in a memorandum detailing the rules of data sharing on U.S. citizens, the ISNU is obligated to:

{{quote|Destroy upon recognition any communication contained in raw [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] provided by NSA that is either to or from an official of the U.S. government. "U.S. government officials" include officials of the Executive Branch (including [[White House]], Cabinet Departments, and independent agencies); the [[United States Congress|U.S. House of Representatives and Senate]] (members and staff); and the U.S. Federal Court system (including, but not limited to, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]). |[[:File:Israel Memorandum of Understanding SIGINT.pdf|Memorandum of understanding between the NSA and Israel]] (circa 2009)}}

According to the undated memorandum, the ground rules for intelligence sharing between the NSA and the ISNU were laid out in March 2009.&lt;ref name="israelnsa1"/&gt; Under the data sharing agreement, the ISNU is allowed to retain the identities of U.S. citizens (excluding U.S. government officials) for up to a year.&lt;ref name="israelnsa1"/&gt;

In 2011, the NSA asked the Japanese government to intercept underwater fibre-optic cables carrying phone and Internet data in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. However, the Japanese government refused to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA asked Japan to tap regionwide fiber-optic cables in 2011|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/10/27/world/nsa-asked-japan-to-tap-regionwide-fiber-optic-cables-in-2011/#.Um4Lf1NVO28|publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]''|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libya ===

Under the reign of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], the Libyan regime forged a partnership with Britain's secret service [[MI6]] and the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to obtain information about Libyan dissidents living in the United States and Canada.

[[File:-FsA14 - Freiheit statt Angst 009 (15082098181).jpg|thumb|"[[Stop Watching Us]]" rally in Berlin, Germany, August 2014]]
The global surveillance disclosure has caused tension in the [[bilateral relations]] of the United States with several of its allies and economic partners as well as in its relationship with the [[European Union]]. On 12 August 2013, President Obama announced the creation of an "independent" panel of "outside experts" to review the NSA's surveillance programs. The panel is due to be established by the Director of National Intelligence, [[James R. Clapper]], who will consult and provide assistance to them.&lt;ref name="obamafalloutsp"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Luke|title=James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence Who Misled Congress, To Establish Surveillance Review Group|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/13/james-clapper_n_3748431.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey undertaken by the human rights group [[PEN International]], these disclosures have had a [[chilling effect]] on American writers. Fearing the risk of being targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have [[self-censorship|self-censored]] themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings.&lt;ref name="penc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Matt Sledge|title=NSA 'Chilling' Effect Feared By Writers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/13/nsa-writers_n_4267716.html|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=14 November 2013|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''invariant mass''', '''rest mass''', '''intrinsic mass''', '''proper mass,''' or in the case of bound systems simply '''mass,''' is the portion of the total mass of an [[physical body|object]] or [[physical system|system]] of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system.  More precisely, it is a characteristic of the system's total [[energy]] and [[momentum]] that is the same in all [[frames of reference]] related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="LawrenceS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA1073 Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Volume 2, page 1073] - Lawrence S. Lerner - Science - 1997&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[center of momentum frame]] exists for the system&lt;!-- note there are massless particles --&gt;, then the invariant mass of a system is equal to its total mass in that "rest frame". In other reference frames, where the system's momentum is nonzero, the total mass (a.k.a. [[relativistic mass]]) of the system is greater than the invariant mass, but the invariant mass remains unchanged.

Due to [[mass-energy equivalence]], the '''rest energy''' of the system is simply the invariant mass times the [[speed of light]] squared.  Similarly, the total energy of the system is its total (relativistic) mass times the speed of light squared.

Systems whose [[four-momentum]] is a [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null vector]] (for example a single photon or many photons moving in exactly the same direction) have [[zero]] invariant mass, and are referred to as [[massless particle|''massless'']]. A physical object or particle moving faster than the speed of light would have space-like four-momenta (such as the hypothesized [[tachyon]]), and these do not appear to exist. Any time-like four-momentum possesses a reference frame where the momentum (3-dimensional) is zero, which is a center of momentum frame. In this case, invariant mass is positive and is referred to as the rest mass.

If objects within a system are in relative motion, then the invariant mass of the whole system will differ from the sum of the objects' rest masses. This is also equal to the total energy of the system divided by [[speed of light|''c'']]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. See [[mass–energy equivalence]] for a discussion of definitions of mass. Since the mass of systems must be measured with a weight or mass scale in a center of momentum frame in which the entire system has zero momentum, such a scale always measures the system's invariant mass. For example, a scale would measure the kinetic energy of the molecules in a bottle of gas to be part of invariant mass of the bottle, and thus also its rest mass. The same is true for massless particles in such system, which add invariant mass and also rest mass to systems, according to their energy.

For an isolated ''massive'' system, the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal [[velocity]] (with a velocity depending on the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] used to view it). Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the [[center of momentum frame]], the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being "at rest" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which exists under these assumptions, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This total energy in the center of momentum frame, is the '''minimum''' energy which the system may be observed to have, when seen by various observers from various inertial frames.

Note that for reasons above, such a rest frame does not exist for single [[photon]]s, or rays of [[light]] moving in one direction. When two or more photons move in different directions, however, a center of mass frame (or "rest frame" if the system is bound) exists. Thus, the mass of a system of several photons moving in different directions is positive, which means that an invariant mass exists for this system even though it does not exist for each photon.

[[Image:Rest mass 0 and 1.svg|thumb|right|160px|Possible 4-momenta of particles. &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''One'''&lt;/span&gt; has zero invariant mass, &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;'''the other'''&lt;/span&gt; is massive]]

== Sum of rest masses ==
Because the invariant mass includes the mass of any kinetic and potential energies which remain in the center of momentum frame, the invariant mass of a system can be greater than sum of rest masses of its separate constituents.{{clarify|date=January 2013|It an electric field in a hydrogen atom a "separate constituent"? And which is its mass: positive or negative?}} For example, rest mass and invariant mass are zero for individual photons even though they may add mass to the invariant mass of systems. For this reason, invariant mass is in general not an additive quantity (although there are a few rare situations where it may be, as is the case when massive particles in a system without potential or kinetic energy can be added to a total mass).

Consider the simple case of two-body system, where object A is moving towards another object B which is initially at rest (in any particular frame of reference). The magnitude of invariant mass of this two-body system (see definition below) is different from the sum of rest mass (i.e. their respective mass when stationary). Even if we consider the same system from center-of-momentum frame, where net momentum is zero, the magnitude of the system's invariant mass is '''not equal''' to the sum of the rest masses of the particles within it.

The kinetic energy of such particles and the potential energy of the force fields increase the total energy above the sum of the particle rest masses, and both terms contribute to the invariant mass of the system. The sum of the particle kinetic energies as calculated by an observer is smallest in the center of momentum frame (again, called the "rest frame" if the system is bound).

They will often also interact through one or more of the [[fundamental forces]], giving them a potential energy of interaction, possibly [[negative number|negative]].

For an isolated ''massive'' system, the center of mass moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal [[velocity]]. Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the [[center of momentum frame]], the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being "at rest" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which always exists, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

== As defined in particle physics ==
In [[particle physics]], the '''invariant mass''' {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to the [[mass]] in the rest frame of the particle, and can be calculated by the particle's [[energy]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|E}} and its [[momentum]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''p'''}} as measured in ''any'' frame, by the [[energy–momentum relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; m_0^2 c^2 = \left( \frac{E}{c} \right) ^2 - \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;

or in [[natural units]] where {{math|1=''c'' = 1}},

:&lt;math&gt; m_0^2 = E^2 - \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| ^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

This invariant mass is the same in all [[frame of reference|frames of reference]] (see also [[special relativity]]). This equation says that the invariant mass is the pseudo-Euclidean length of the [[four-vector]] {{math|(''E'', '''p''')}}, calculated using the [[pseudo-Euclidean space|relativistic version of the Pythagorean theorem]] which has a different sign for the space and time dimensions. This length is preserved under any Lorentz boost or rotation in four dimensions, just like the ordinary length of a vector is preserved under rotations. In quantum theory the invariant mass is a parameter in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]] for an elementary particle. The Dirac quantum operator corresponds to the particle four-momentum vector.

Since the invariant mass is determined from quantities which are conserved during a decay, the invariant mass calculated using the energy and momentum of the decay products of a single particle is equal to the mass of the particle that decayed.
The mass of a system of particles can be calculated from the general formula:

: &lt;math&gt; \left( W c^2 \right) ^2= \left( \sum E \right) ^2 - \left\| \sum \mathbf{p} c \right\| ^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the invariant mass of the system of particles, equal to the mass of the decay particle.
: &lt;math&gt;\sum E&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the energies of the particles
: &lt;math&gt;\sum \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector sum of the [[momentum]] of the particles (includes both magnitude and direction of the momenta)

The term invariant mass is also used in inelastic scattering experiments. Given an inelastic reaction with total incoming energy larger than the total detected energy (i.e. not all outgoing particles are detected in the experiment), the invariant mass (also known as the "missing mass") {{mvar|W}} of the reaction is defined as follows (in natural units):

: &lt;math&gt; W^2 = \left( \sum E_\text{in} - \sum E_\text{out} \right) ^2 - \left\| \sum \mathbf{p}_\text{in} - \sum \mathbf{p}_\text{out} \right\| ^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

If there is one dominant particle which was not detected during an experiment, a plot of the invariant mass will show a sharp peak at the mass of the missing particle.

In those cases when the momentum along one direction cannot be measured (i.e. in the case of a neutrino, whose presence is only inferred from the [[missing energy]]) the [[Transverse mass]] is used.

==Example: two-particle collision==

In a two-particle collision (or a two-particle decay) the square of the invariant mass (in [[natural units]]) is
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;M^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = ( E_1 + E_2 ) ^2 - \left\| \textbf{p}_1 + \textbf{p}_2 \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 \left( E_1 E_2 - \textbf{p}_1 \cdot \textbf{p}_2 \right) .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Massless particles ===
The invariant mass of a system made of two massless particles whose momenta form an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;
has a convenient expression:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt; M^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = (E_1 + E_2) ^2 - \left\| \textbf{p}_1 + \textbf{p}_2 \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = [ ( p_1 , 0 , 0 , p_1 ) + ( p_2 , 0 , p_2 \sin \theta, p_2 \cos \theta ) ] ^2 = ( p_1 + p_2) ^2 - p_2 ^2 \sin^2 \theta - ( p_1 + p_2 \cos \theta ) ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = 2 p_1 p_2 ( 1 - \cos\theta ) .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Collider experiments ===
In particle collider experiments, one often defines the angular position of a particle in terms of an azimuthal angle&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; and [[pseudorapidity]] &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt;. Additionally the transverse momentum, &lt;math&gt; p_{T} &lt;/math&gt;, is usually measured. In this case if the particles are massless, or highly relativistic ( &lt;math&gt; E &gt;&gt; m&lt;/math&gt;,) then the invariant mass becomes:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;M^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 p_{T 1} p_{T 2} ( \cosh(\eta_1 - \eta_2) - \cos (\phi_1 - \phi_2) ) .\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Rest energy ==
The '''rest energy''' &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ E_0=m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light|speed of light in vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/066063.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In general, only differences in [[energy]] have physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modell|first=Michael|author2=Robert C. Reid|title=Thermodynamics and Its Applications |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1974 |isbn=0-13-914861-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of rest energy follows from the [[special theory of relativity]] that leads to Einstein's famous conclusion about equivalence of energy and mass. See [[Mass–energy equivalence#Background|background for mass–energy equivalence]].

On the other hand, the concept of the equivalent Dirac invariant rest mass may be defined in terms of the self energy corresponding to the product of a geometric matter current and a generalized potential &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=González-Martín |first= Gustavo R.|date=1994 |title=A geometric definition of mass. |journal=Gen. Rel. Grav. |volume=26 |pages=1177 |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7436p075454jtg5/ |bibcode = 1994GReGr..26.1177G |doi = 10.1007/BF02106710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a [[mass#single definition of mass|single definition of mass]] in a geometric unified theory.

[[Image:View across Cleeve Common - geograph.org.uk - 38060.jpg|Cleeve Common is designated a biological and geological site|thumb|250px]]

This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Gloucestershire]]'''. [[Natural England]], the designating body for SSSIs in [[England]], uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974-1996 county system]], and this list follows the same approach. Some sites you may expect to find here could therefore be in the [[List of SSSIs in Avon|Avon]] list.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Midger]] and [[Lower Woods]] are included in the [[List of SSSIs in Avon|Avon list]]&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be that a site may on the borders of more than one county.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001017 Natural England citation] for 'The Malvern Hills' (retrieved 2012-08-21)&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be on the country borders.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003580 Natural England citation] for 'Upper Wye Gorge' (retrieved 2012-08-21)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural England]] chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=Natural England |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there are 121 sites designated in this [[Area of Search]], of which 69 have been designated due to their biological interest, 32 due to their geological interest, and 20 for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SSSIs in Gloucestershire | work=Natural England | url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1016| accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloucestershire has 3 [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] being the [[Cotswolds]], [[Malvern Hills]], and the [[Wye Valley]] (the latter is also partly in Wales).  These areas may include several SSSIs, or be named an SSSI as is the case for the Malvern Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural England information and map of AONBs | work=Natural England | url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designations/aonb/default.aspx | accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloucestershire has 2 designated [[Ramsar site]]s being the [[Severn Estuary]] and [[Walmore Common]] both SSSIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee Listing of Ramsars | work=DEFRA | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-1389 | accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two sites are also designated as [[Special Protection Area]]s (SPA) under the EC Directive on the conservation of Wild Birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee Listing of Special Protection Areas | work=DEFRA | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-1400 | accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloucestershire has 7 recognised [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]] (SAC), several of which bring together more than one SSSI.  These are: [[Cotswold Commons And Beechwoods|Cotswold Beechwoods]]; [[Dixton Wood]]; [[River Wye|River Wye/ Afon Gwy]]; [[Rodborough Common]]; [[Severn Estuary]]; Wye Valley and Forest of Dean Bat Sites/ Safleoedd Ystlumod Dyffryn Gwy a Fforest y Ddena; Wye Valley Woodlands/ Coetiroedd Dyffryn Gwy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee Listing of Special Areas of Conservation | work=DEFRA | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/SAC_list.asp | accessdate=2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Highbury Wood]] SSSI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Natural England NNR citation and map for Highbury Wood NNR| work=Natural England | url= http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006076.aspx| accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cotswold Commons and Beechwoods]] SSSI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural England NNR citation and map for the Cotswolds Commons and Beechwoods | work=Natural England | url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designations/nnr/1006044.aspx | accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s (NNR). [[Lady Park Wood]] (part of the wood is in Gloucestershire and part in Monmouthshire) is a national nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural England NNR citation and map for Lady Park Wood (Gloucestershire) | work=Natural England | url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006088.aspx | accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of the SSSIs are recognised by the relevant local authorities as '''Key Wildlife Sites''' and '''[[Regionally Important Geological Sites|Regionally Important Geological/Geomorphological Sites]]'''. There are c. 800 recognised Key Wildlife Sites in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Wildlife Sites information | work=Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust| url=http://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/what-we-do/local-nature-conservation/conservation-areas/key-wildlife-sites | accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}

This is a '''list of the highest mountains in Germany'''.  All of these [[mountain]]s are located in the federal state of  [[Bavaria]]. They lie within the [[Alps]] in the region known as the [[Eastern Alps]] and are part of the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]. The majority belong to the [[mountain range]]s of the [[Wetterstein]], [[Berchtesgaden Alps]] and [[Allgäu Alps]].

Because the definition of a mountain is not universally agreed, a distinction is made between main summits and other peaks. Subsidiary summits or subpeaks are not counted. In the Alps a summit is classed as independent, according to the [[UIAA]] definition, if it has a [[prominence]] of 30 metres or more. In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, however, it must have a prominence of at least 300 metres.&lt;ref&gt;Or a prominence of 100m according to other authorities.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this definition only the main summits of entire mountain massifs are counted. All elevations with a prominence below 30 metres are considered as subpeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[UIAA]] |url=http://www.hikr.org/files/40196.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Viertausender of the Alpen –&amp;nbsp;Offizielles UIAA-Verzeichnis |date=Nr. 145, März 1994 |access-date=7 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

By these definitions, the highest mountains in Germany are the [[Zugspitze]] (2,962&amp;nbsp;m), [[Hochwanner]] (2,746&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Watzmann]] (Middle Peak, 2,713&amp;nbsp;m). If all independent summits are counted, the Zugspitze is followed by the [[Schneefernerkopf]] (2,875&amp;nbsp;m) and the [[Wetterspitzen|Middle Wetterspitze]] (2,747&amp;nbsp;m) in places two and three. Both are however, part of the Zugspitze massif and lie relatively close to the summit of the Zugspitze itself.

The highest mountain which lies entirely on German soil is the Watzmann with a height of 2,713&amp;nbsp;metres, followed by the [[Hochkalter]] (2,607&amp;nbsp;m), the [[Großer Daumen]] (2,280&amp;nbsp;m) and the [[Höfats]] (2,259&amp;nbsp;m). Likewise fully on German territory, but considerably less independent, are the [[Höllentalspitze|Middle Höllentalspitze]] (2,742&amp;nbsp;m) and the [[Hochblassen]] (2,703&amp;nbsp;m).

A majority of the summits were verifiably climbed in the 19th century; the Watzmann and [[Hoher Göll]] for example as early as 1800. The Zugspitze was officially climbed for the first time in 1820. However, there are many peaks of which it is suspected had been climbed in earlier times by unknown climbers.

Because the borders of Germany have often changed during the course of the centuries, there were different "highest mountains" in the past. For example, during the time of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] up to 1806, the [[Ortler]] in present-day [[South Tyrol]], at 3,905&amp;nbsp;m, was the highest German mountain. During the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] to 1918 [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in the colony of [[German East Africa]], at 5,895&amp;nbsp;m, was officially the highest mountain of the [[German Reich]]. During the [[Nazi era]] from 1938 to 1945 this title went to the [[Großglockner]] which, at 3,797&amp;nbsp;m, is today the highest mountain in Austria.

== Key ==
*'''Ranking''': The ranking of the peak within Germany in terms of height.
*'''Photograph''': Photograph of the mountain.
*'''Peak''': Name of the peak.
*'''Height''': Height of the mountain in metres.
*'''Mountain range''': Mountain range in which the mountain lies.
*'''Massif''': (table 1) Gives the name of the massif to which the mountain belongs. If the massif is named after a linked main peak, the link is omitted here.
*'''Location''': (table 2) DE = mountain lies entirely on German territory; DE/AT = mountain lies in the area of the border between [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], but the peak at least is on German state territory.
*'''Isolation''': The [[Topographic isolation|isolation]] describes the radius of the area which the mountain dominates. Given in kilometres including the reference point.
*'''Prominence''': The [[prominence]] is the height difference between height of the summit and the highest point to which one must descend in order to climb a higher peak. Given in metres including the reference point.
*'''First climb''': Name of the first climber and date. Empty field indicates that the first climber or the date is not known.

There may be differences in data from other sources. The tables use the tables of the German height reference system, based on height above [[Normalnull]] (~sea level) in Amsterdam, and data from the Bavarian Survey Office (''Bayerischen Vermessungsverwaltung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung |publisher=Bayerische Staatsregierung |url=http://www.geodaten.bayern.de/BayernViewer/index.cgi |title=Bayernviewer |access-date=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The highest summits ==
Table 1 below shows the 30 highest independent summits in Germany. A summit or peak requires a [[prominence]] of over 30 metres in order to count as independent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29949">The class Mammalia ([[mammal]]s) is divided into two subclasses based on reproductive techniques: egg-laying mammals ([[Yinotheria|yinotherians]] or [[monotreme|monotremes]] - see also [[Australosphenida]]), and mammals which give live birth ([[Theria|therians]]).  The latter subclass is divided into two infraclasses: pouched mammals ([[Metatheria|metatherians]] or [[marsupial|marsupials]]), and placental mammals ([[eutheria|eutherians]], for which see [[List of placental mammals]]). Classification updated from Wilson and Reeder's "Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference" using the "Planet Mammifères" website.&lt;ref name="Planet Mammifères"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boudet Ch.|title=Planet' Mammiferes|url=http://www.planet-mammiferes.org/drupal/en/node/20|website=Planet' Mammiferes|accessdate=2016-04-17 |version=4.1 of 2013/12/23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list contains all known [[black hole]]s relatively near the [[Solar System]] (within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy). To make it easier to compare distances, our nearest star aside from the [[Sun]] – [[Proxima Centauri]] – is about '''4.24''' light years away and our [[Milky Way]] galaxy is '''100,000''' [[light year]]s in diameter.

The '''Mie solution''' to [[Maxwell's equations]] (also known as the '''Lorenz–Mie solution''', the '''Lorenz–Mie–Debye solution''' or '''Mie scattering''') describes the [[scattering]] of an electromagnetic plane wave by a homogeneous [[sphere]]. The solution takes the form of an [[infinite series]] of [[Vector spherical harmonics|spherical multipole partial waves]]. It is named after [[Gustav Mie]].

The term ''Mie solution'' is also used for solutions of Maxwell's equations for scattering by stratified spheres or by infinite cylinders, or other geometries where one can write [[separation of variables|separate equations]] for the radial and angular dependence of solutions. The term ''Mie theory'' is sometimes used for this collection of solutions and methods; it does not refer to an independent physical theory or law. More broadly, "Mie scattering" suggests situations where the size of the scattering particles is comparable to the wavelength of the light, rather than much smaller or much larger.

Mie scattering (sometimes referred to as a non-molecular or aerosol particle scattering) takes place in the lower 4.5&amp;nbsp;km of the atmosphere, where there may be many essentially spherical particles present with diameters approximately equal to the size of the wavelength of the incident energy. Mie scattering theory has no upper size limitation, and converges to the limit of geometric optics for large particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plaza.ufl.edu/dwhahn/Rayleigh%20and%20Mie%20Light%20Scattering.pdf|title=Light Scattering Theory|last=Hahn|first=David W.|date=July 2009|website=University of Florida|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

A modern formulation of the Mie solution to the scattering problem on a sphere can be found in many books, e.g., [[Julius Adams Stratton|J. A. Stratton]]'s ''Electromagnetic Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=J. A. |last=Stratton|title=Electromagnetic Theory|location= New York|publisher= McGraw-Hill|year= 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this formulation, the incident plane wave, as well as the scattering field, is expanded into radiating spherical [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] wave functions. The internal field is expanded into regular spherical vector wave functions. By enforcing the [[boundary condition]] on the spherical surface, the expansion coefficients of the scattered field can be computed.

For particles much larger or much smaller than the wavelength of the scattered light there are simple and excellent approximations that suffice to describe the behaviour of the system. But for objects whose size is similar to the wavelength, e.g., water droplets in the atmosphere, latex particles in paint, droplets in emulsions, including milk, and biological cells and cellular components, a more exact approach is necessary.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite book|first1=C.

Danish physicist [[Ludvig Lorenz]] and others independently developed the theory of electromagnetic plane wave scattering by a [[dielectric]] sphere.

The formalism allows the calculation of the electric and magnetic fields inside and outside a spherical object and is generally used to calculate either how much light is scattered, the total [[optical cross section]], or where it goes, the form factor. The notable features of these results are the Mie resonances, sizes that scatter particularly strongly or weakly.&lt;ref name=vdh&gt;{{Cite book|first=H. C.|last= van de Hulst|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ivW_TgIdjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Light scattering by small particles|location= New York|publisher= John Wiley and Sons|year= 1957|isbn=9780486139753}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[Rayleigh scattering]] for small particles and [[Rayleigh–Gans–Debye scattering]] (after [[Lord Rayleigh]], [[Richard Gans]] and [[Peter Debye]]) for large particles. The existence of resonances and other features of Mie scattering make it a particularly useful formalism when using scattered light to measure particle size.

==Computational codes==
Mie solutions are implemented in a number of programs written in different computer languages such as [[Fortran]], [[MATLAB]], and [[Mathematica]]. These solutions are in terms of infinite series and include calculation of scattering phase function, extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies, and other parameters such as asymmetry parameter or radiation torque. Current usage of a "Mie solution" indicates a series approximation to a solution of Maxwell's equations. There are several known objects that allow such a solution: spheres, concentric spheres, infinite cylinders, cluster of spheres and cluster of cylinders. There are also known series solutions for scattering on ellipsoidal particles. For a list of these specialized codes, examine these articles:
* [[Codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres]] &amp;ndash; solutions for a single sphere, coated spheres, multilayer sphere, and cluster of spheres;
* [[Codes for electromagnetic scattering by cylinders]] &amp;ndash; solutions for a single cylinder, multilayer cylinders, and cluster of cylinders.

A generalization that allows a treatment of more generally shaped particles is the [[T-matrix method]], which also relies on the series approximation to solutions of Maxwell's equations.

==Approximations==

===Rayleigh approximation (scattering)===
{{main|Rayleigh scattering}}
[[File:Knysnasunset.jpg|thumb|The change of sky colour at sunset (red nearest the sun, blue furthest away) is caused by Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric gas particles, which are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. The grey/white colour of the clouds is caused by Mie scattering by water droplets, which are of a comparable size to the wavelengths of visible light.]]

Rayleigh scattering describes the elastic scattering of light by spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. The intensity ''I'' of the scattered radiation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; I = I_0 \left( \frac{1 + \cos^2 \theta}{2 R^2} \right) \left( \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \right)^4 \left(\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^6,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, ''R'' is the distance between the particle and the observer, ''θ'' is the scattering angle, ''n'' is the [[refractive index]] of the particle, and ''d'' is the diameter of the particle.

It can be seen from the above equation that Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent upon the size of the particle and the wavelengths. The intensity of the Rayleigh scattered radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.

The Rayleigh scattering model breaks down when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie's scattering model can be used to find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this range of particle sizes differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.

The blue colour of the sky results from Rayleigh scattering, as the size of the gas particles in the atmosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Rayleigh scattering is much greater for blue light than for other colours due to its shorter wavelength. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, its blue component is Rayleigh scattered strongly by atmospheric gases but the longer wavelength (e.g. red/yellow) components are not. The sunlight arriving directly from the Sun therefore appears to be slightly yellow, while the light scattered through rest of the sky appears blue.  During sunrises and sunsets, the effect of Rayleigh scattering on the spectrum of the transmitted light is much greater due to the greater distance the light rays have to travel through the high-density air near the Earth's surface.

In contrast, the water droplets that make up clouds are of a comparable size to the wavelengths in visible light, and the scattering is described by Mie's model rather than that of Rayleigh. Here, all wavelengths of visible light are scattered approximately identically, and the clouds therefore appear to be white or grey.

===Rayleigh–Gans approximation===
The [[Rayleigh–Gans approximation]] is an approximate solution to light scattering when the relative refractive index of the particle is close to unity, and its size is much smaller in comparison to the wavelength of light divided by |''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1|, where ''n'' is the [[refractive index]].

===Anomalous diffraction approximation of van de Hulst===
The [[Anomalous diffraction theory|anomalous diffraction approximation]] is valid for large (compared to wavelength) and optically soft spheres.
(soft in the context of optics implies that the refractive index of the particle (m) differs only slightly
from the refractive index of the environment, in comparison with scattering of acoustic waves, and the particle subjects
the wave to only a small phase shift.) The extinction efficiency in this approximation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2 - \frac{4}{p} \sin p + \frac{4}{p^2} (1 - \cos p),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Q'' is the efficiency factor of scattering, which is defined as the ratio of the scattering cross-section and geometrical cross-section π''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The term ''p'' = 4πa(''n'' − 1)/λ has as its physical meaning the phase delay of the wave passing through the centre of the sphere, where ''a'' is the sphere radius, ''n'' is the ratio of refractive indices inside and outside of the sphere, and ''λ'' the wavelength of the light.

This set of equations was first described by van de Hulst in (1957).&lt;ref name=vdh/&gt;

==Applications==
Mie theory is very important in [[meteorology|meteorological]] [[optics]], where diameter-to-wavelength ratios of the order of unity and larger are characteristic for many problems regarding haze and [[cloud]] scattering. A further application is in the characterization of [[aerosol|particles]] by optical scattering measurements. The Mie solution is also important for understanding the appearance of common materials like [[milk]], [[biological tissue]] and [[latex]] paint.

===Atmospheric science===
Mie scattering occurs when the diameters of atmospheric [[particulates]] are similar to the wavelengths of the scattered light. [[Dust]], [[pollen]], [[smoke]] and microscopic [[water droplets]] that form [[cloud]]s are common causes of Mie scattering. Mie scattering occurs mostly in the lower portions of the atmosphere, where larger particles are more abundant, and dominates in cloudy conditions.

===Cancer detection and screening===
Mie theory has been used to determine whether scattered light from tissue corresponds to healthy or cancerous cell nuclei using [[angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry]].

===Magnetic particles===
A number of unusual electromagnetic scattering effects occur for magnetic spheres. When the [[relative permittivity]] equals the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], the back-scatter gain is zero. Also, the scattered radiation is polarized in the same sense as the incident radiation. In the small-particle (or long-wavelength) limit, conditions can occur for zero forward scatter, for complete polarization of scattered radiation in other directions, and for asymmetry of forward scatter to backscatter. The special case in the small-particle limit provides interesting special instances of complete polarization and forward-scatter-to-backscatter asymmetry.&lt;ref name="KerkerWang1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerker|first1=M.|last2=Wang|first2=D.-S.|last3=Giles|first3=C. L.|title=Electromagnetic scattering by magnetic spheres|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|volume=73|issue=6|year=1983|pages=765|url=http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/papers/JOSA-scattering-1983.pdf |format=PDF |issn=0030-3941|doi=10.1364/JOSA.73.000765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metamaterial===
Mie theory has been used to design [[metamaterial]]s. They usually consist of three-dimensional composites of metal or non-metallic inclusions periodically or randomly embedded in a low-permittivity matrix. In such a scheme, the negative constitutive parameters are designed to appear around the Mie resonances of the inclusions: the negative effective [[permittivity]] is designed around the resonance of the Mie electric dipole scattering coefficient, whereas negative effective [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] is designed around the resonance of the Mie magnetic dipole scattering coefficient, and doubly negative material (DNG) is designed around the overlap of resonances of Mie electric and magnetic dipole scattering coefficients. The particle usually have the following combinations:
# one set of magnetodielectric particles with values of relative permittivity and permeability much greater than one and close to each other;
# two different dielectric particles with equal permittivity but different size;
# two different dielectric particles with equal size but different permittivity.

In theory, the particles analyzed by Mie theory are commonly spherical but, in practice, particles are usually fabricated as cubes or cylinders for ease of fabrication. To meet the criteria of homogenization, which may be stated in the form that the lattice constant is much smaller than the operating wavelength, the relative permittivity of the dielectric particles should be much greater than 1, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\text{r} &gt; 78(38)&lt;/math&gt; to achieve negative effective permittivity (permeability).&lt;ref name=Holloway2003&gt;

R.|author2=et al.|title=Investigating the extrinsic size effect of palladium and gold spherical nanoparticles|journal=Optical Materials|date=2017|volume=64|pages=413–420|doi=10.1016/j.optmat.2017.01.014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925346717300149|bibcode=2017OptMa..64..413R}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early computers in the 1970s were only able to compute diffraction data with the more simple Fraunhofer approximation, Mie is widely used since the 1990s and officially recommended for particles below 50 micrometers in guideline ISO 13321:2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISO 13320:2009 - Particle size analysis -- Laser diffraction methods|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44929|website = www.iso.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mie theory has been used in the detection of oil concentration in polluted water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=L|title=Rapid in situ determination of total oil concentration in water using ultraviolet fluorescence and light scattering coupled with artificial neural networks|journal=Analytica Chimica Acta|volume=478|page=245|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(02)01471-X|last2=Kear-Padilla|first2=L.

== Extensions ==
In 1986 P. A. Bobbert and J. Vlieger extended the Mie model to calculate scattering by a sphere in a homogeneous medium placed on flat surface.

Mud volcanoes are not true [[Igneous rock|igneous]] [[Volcano|volcanoes]] as they do not produce [[lava]] and are not necessarily driven by [[magma]]tic activity. The Earth continuously exudes a mud-like substance, which may sometimes be referred to as a "mud volcano". Mud volcanoes may range in size from merely 1 or 2 meters high and 1 or 2 meters wide, to 700 meters high and 10 kilometers wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kioka|first1=Arata|last2=Ashi|first2=Juichiro|title=Episodic massive mud eruptions from submarine mud volcanoes examined through topographical signatures|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=28 October 2015|volume=42|issue=20|pages=8406–8414|doi=10.1002/2015GL065713|bibcode=2015GeoRL..42.8406K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller mud exudations are sometimes referred to as mud-pots. 

The mud produced by mud volcanoes is mostly formed as hot water, which has been heated deep below the Earth's surface, begins to mix and blend with subterranean mineral deposits, thus creating the mud slurry exudate. This material is then forced upwards through a geological fault or fissure due to local subterranean pressure imbalances. Mud volcanoes are associated with [[subduction zone]]s and about 1100 have been identified on or near land. The temperature of any given active mud volcano generally remains fairly steady and is much lower than the typical temperatures found in igneous volcanoes. Mud volcano temperatures can range from near {{convert|100|C}} to occasionally {{convert|2|C}}, some being used as popular "mud baths."

About 86% of the gas released from these structures is [[methane]], with much less [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]] emitted. Ejected materials are most often a slurry of fine solids suspended in water that may contain a mixture of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[acid]]s and various [[hydrocarbon]]s.

Possible mud volcanoes have been identified on [[Mars]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | title=Mars domes may be 'mud volcanoes' | work=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7966437.stm | accessdate=2009-03-27 | date=March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
A mud volcano may be the result of a [[piercement structure]] created by a pressurized [[mud]] [[diapir]] that breaches the Earth's surface or ocean bottom. Their temperatures may be as low as the freezing point of the ejected materials, particularly when venting is associated with the creation of [[hydrocarbon]] [[clathrate hydrate]] deposits. Mud volcanoes are often associated with [[petroleum]] deposits and tectonic [[subduction]] zones and [[orogeny|orogenic belts]]; hydrocarbon gases are often erupted. They are also often associated with [[volcano|lava volcanoes]]; in the case of such close proximity, mud volcanoes emit incombustible gases including [[helium]], whereas lone mud volcanoes are more likely to emit methane.

Approximately 1,100 mud volcanoes have been identified on land and in shallow water. It has been estimated that well over 10,000 may exist on [[continental shelf|continental slopes]] and [[abyssal plain]]s.

===Features===
* '''Gryphon''': steep-sided cone shorter than 3&amp;nbsp;meters that extrudes mud
* '''Mud cone''': high cone shorter than 10&amp;nbsp;meters that extrudes mud and rock fragments
* '''Scoria cone''': cone formed by heating of mud deposits during fires
* '''Salse''': water-dominated pools with gas seeps
* '''Spring''': water-dominated outlets smaller than 0.5&amp;nbsp;metres
* '''Mud shield'''

===Emissions===
Most liquid and solid material is released during eruptions, but seeps occur during dormant periods.

The mud is rich in [[halite]] (rock salt).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

First-order estimates of mud volcano emissions have been made (1&amp;nbsp;Tg = 1&amp;nbsp;million metric tonnes).
* 2002: L. I. Dimitrov estimated that 10.2–12.6&amp;nbsp;[[Teragram#SI multiples|Tg]]/yr of methane is released from onshore and shallow offshore mud volcanoes.
* 2002: Etiope and Klusman estimated at least 1–2 and as much as 10–20&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr of methane may be emitted from onshore mud volcanoes.
* 2003: Etiope, in an estimate based on 120 mud volcanoes: "The emission results to be conservatively between 5 and 9&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr, that is 3–6% of the natural methane sources officially considered in the atmospheric methane budget. The total geologic source, including MVs (this work), seepage from seafloor (Kvenvolden et al., 2001), microseepage in hydrocarbon-prone areas and geothermal sources (Etiope and Klusman, 2002), would amount to 35–45&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr."&lt;ref name="etiope2003gsa"&gt;{{cite conference | author=Etiope, Giuseppe | title=A NEW ESTIMATE OF GLOBAL METHANE FLUX TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM ONSHORE AND SHALLOW SUBMARINE MUD VOLCANOES | booktitle=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs | year=2003 | pages=115}} {{cite web | title=A NEW ESTIMATE OF GLOBAL METHANE FLUX TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM ONSHORE AND SHALLOW SUBMARINE MUD VOLCANOES | work=XVI INQUA Congress | url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/inqu/finalprogram/abstract_53365.htm | accessdate=April 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2003: analysis by Milkov et al. suggests that the global gas flux may be as high as 33&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr (15.9&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr during quiescent periods plus 17.1&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr during eruptions). Six teragrams per year of greenhouse gases are from onshore and shallow offshore mud volcanoes. Deep-water sources may emit 27&amp;nbsp;Tg/yr. Total may be 9% of fossil CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; missing in the modern atmospheric CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; budget, and 12% in the preindustrial budget.&lt;ref name="milkov2003a"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Milkov, A.

====Yellowstone's "Mud Volcano"====
[[File:Yellowstone mud volcano 17894.jpg|thumb|Yellowstone's "Mud Volcano"&lt;ref&gt;NPS, Peaco, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The name of [[Yellowstone National Park]]'s "Mud Volcano" feature and the surrounding area is misleading; it consists of [[hot spring]]s, [[mud pot]]s and [[fumarole]]s, rather than a true mud volcano. Depending upon the precise definition of the term ''mud volcano'', the Yellowstone formation could be considered a hydrothermal mud volcano cluster. The feature is much less active than in its first recorded description, although the area is quite dynamic. Yellowstone is an active [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] area with a magma chamber near the surface, and active gases are chiefly steam, carbon dioxide, and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. 

However, there are mud volcanoes and mud geysers elsewhere in Yellowstone. One, the "Vertically Gifted Cyclic Mud Pot" sometimes acts as a geyser, throwing mud up to 30 feet high.&lt;ref name="usgsglossmudv"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mud volcano | work=USGS Photo glossary of volcano terms | url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/MudVolcano.html | accessdate=April 20, 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050404035116/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/MudVolcano.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern part of [[Venezuela]] contains several mud volcanoes (or mud domes), all of them having an origin related to oil deposits. The mud of {{convert|6|km|mi}} from [[Maturín, Venezuela]], contains water, biogenic gas, hydrocarbons and an important quantity of salt. Cattle from the [[savanna]] often gather around to lick the dried mud for its salt content.

This volcano is approximately {{convert|50|ft|m}} high and can accommodate 10 to 15 people in its crater; many tourists and locals visit this volcano due to the alleged medicinal benefits of the mud; it is next to a ''cienaga'', or lake. This volcano is under legal dispute between the Bolívar and Atlántico Departamentos because of its tourist value.

'''''My Side of the Mountain''''' is a children or [[young adult fiction|young adult]] adventure novel written and illustrated by American writer [[Jean Craighead George]] published by [[E. P. Dutton]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendrix|first1=Steve|title=Into the Woods|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/10/08/ST2009100803869.html|accessdate=7 July 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 11, 2009|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a boy who learns about courage, independence, and the need for companionship while attempting to live in a forested area of New York state. In 1960, it was one of three [[Newbery Medal]] Honor Books (runners-up)&lt;ref&gt;Horning, Kathleen T. ''The Newbery &amp; Caldecott Awards: A Guide to the Medal and Honor Books.'' Chicago: American Library Association, 2009, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1969 it was loosely adapted as a [[My Side of the Mountain (film)|film of the same name]]. George continued the story in print, decades later.

==Plot summary==
The place is [[New York City]]. It is the 1950s. The protagonist is 14 year old Sam Gribley. With eight brothers and sisters, the New York apartment is crowded. Sam runs away to his great-grandfather's abandoned farm, to live off the land. 

He studies survival skills from books at the [[New York City Public Library]]. A bus takes him to the small town of [[Delhi, NY]]. Sam's father permits him to go to Delhi, if Sam will let people in town know he is staying at the farm. Sam builds a shelter from [[Tsuga|hemlock]] branches. He catches trout. He cannot make fire. 

Sam fails to locate his grandfather's farm. He meets Bill, who lives in a cabin. Bill teaches him how to make fire. Sam finds the farm. A stone foundation is its only remains.

Self-sufficient, Sam forages and traps plants and animals. He makes a hollow tree his home. As [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] used fire to create [[dugout canoes]], Sam uses fire to enlarge the interior of the hollow tree. 

A [[peregrine falcon]] is hunting for prey. Sam wants a hunting falcon to harvest game. Sam studies [[falconry]] at the town's library. He camps for days to seek out the falcon's [[Bird nest|eyrie]]. He steals an [[eyas]], naming it Frightful. 

Sam is forced to hide. A [[forest ranger]] is investigating one of Sam's fires. The ranger lingers overnight. One of Sam's traps catches a [[weasel]] instead of game. Sam adopts it, and calls the weasel The Baron.

Winter is coming. Sam kills a deer for its [[Buckskin (leather)]]. He smokes [[venison]].

Sam trains Frightful to hunt. Sam hunts frogs, pheasants, rabbits, and sparrows. He preserves wild grains and [[tubers]], smokes fish and meat. He makes storage spaces in trunks of other trees.

Sam makes [[buckskins]] to wear. Sam notices a [[raccoon]] digging for mussels in the creek. Sam names the raccoon Jesse Coon James. [[File:Willow whistle.jpg|thumb|150px|A [[willow whistle]], similar to the one made in the novel ''My Side of the Mountain''.]]

Sam returns to his hollowed out tree home. He finds a man there. The man is a professor of [[English literature]].  Sam nicknames him Bando, while Bando gives Sam the nickname "[[Thoreau]]". He spends 10 days with Sam. They build a raft and catch fish. He teaches Sam to make a whistle from a willow branch. Bando leaves, but will come back for [[Christmas]].

Sam makes a clay [[fireplace]] to keep his home warm. Sam insulates the treehouse too well, however: fire generates [[carbon monoxide]]. Sam makes holes which ventilate the cabin for fresh air. 

On Christmas Eve, Bando is back. On Christmas Day, Sam's father has come to visit. Sam is overjoyed to see his father. The three have Christmas dinner of venison. Sam's father is relieved. Sam is doing just fine.

Spring arrives. Matt Spell, a teenager who aspires to be a reporter for the [[newspaper]], arrives at Sam's treehouse. Matt wants to write about Sam's presence on the Gribley farm. Sam offers Matt a deal: Matt can visit for a week during spring, if Matt keeps everything secret. Matt agrees. 

Sam encounters Aaron, a [[Jewish]] songwriter visiting the forest for inspiration and sings him a song. He tells Sam it is close to [[Passover]]. 

Matt spends the week with Sam. Matt is thrilled to be there, but Sam is sad. It reminds him too much of life in New York City.

Bando returns to check on Sam. Sam asks Bando for some jeans and a shirt. In June, Sam's father, mother, and all his siblings arrive. Father announces the entire family is moving to the farm. Sam is overjoyed the family has come. He is also upset. It is the end of independence, living off the land. 

Sam argues with his father. He is building a proper house for the family on the land. Sam is upset about the traditional home. It means abandoning the treehouse. Mother states he can go off on his own at age 18.

==Critical reception and impact==
[[File:CD3622-0005 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|left|Many people travel to [[Delhi, New York]], to seek out the Gribley farm. The Gribley farm is fictional. Hallaway Dairy Farm, however, is a real farm near Delhi.]]
''My Side of the Mountain'' won critical plaudits upon its release. Numerous reviewers praised the novel for its detailed depiction of the wilderness and animals, its unsentimental treatment of animals and nature, and its characters, their maturation, and development.&lt;ref name="Reviewers"&gt;Cullinan, Bernice E. and Person, Diane Goetz. ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature.'' New York: [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]], 2005, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' in 1959 gave the novel a solid review, calling it "a delightful flight from civilization, written with real feeling for the woods."&lt;ref&gt;"Third Avenue Thoreau." ''New York Times.'' September 13, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Children's author Zena Sutherland, writing in ''Children &amp; Books'' at the time, called Sam's development from immature, impulsive child into a mature young adult "wholly convincing".&lt;ref name="Reviewers" /&gt; [[Ruth Hill Viguers]], reviewing the book in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', concluded in 1959, "I believe it will be read year after year, linking together many generations in a chain of well-remembered joy and refreshment."&lt;ref&gt;Viguers, Ruth Hill.  "Review: ''My Side of the Mountain''." ''The Horn Book Magazine.'' October 1959, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being named to the Newbery Award Honors list, the book was also an [[American Library Association]]'s Notable Book for 1959, was placed on the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] 1959 honors list, was given a [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] citation (in 1965), and won the 1959 George G. Stone Center for Children's Books Award.&lt;ref name="Reviewers" /&gt;

The book continued to be praised in the 1990s and 2000s. Book critic [[Eden Ross Lipson]] included it in her 2000 list of the best children's books, and said it "skillfully blends themes of nature, courage, curiosity, and independence".&lt;ref&gt;Lipson, Eden Ross. ''The 'New York Times' Parent's Guide to the Best Books for Children.'' New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Librarians and authors Janice DeLong and Rachel Schwedt listed the book as one of a "core collection for small libraries" of the contemporary fiction section.&lt;ref&gt;DeLong, Janice A. and Schwedt, Rachel E. ''Core Collection for Small Libraries: An Annotated Bibliography of Books for Children and Young Adults.'' Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 1997, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Charles Wohlforth]], writing in 2004, agreed that it was a classic of contemporary children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wohlforth, Charles P. ''The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern Front of Climate Change''. New York: North Point Press, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, the book had been translated into numerous foreign languages, and visitors to the Cannon Free Library in Delhi, New York, often asked to see the abandoned farm where the novel was set.&lt;ref&gt;Sive, Mary Robinson. ''Lost Villages: Historic Driving Tours in the Catskills''. Delhi, N.Y.: Delaware County Historical Association, 1998, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; (The abandoned farm does not actually exist; the Gribley farm is entirely fictional.)

The book has not always won uncritical praise. In 1999, reviewer Mary Harris Russell noted that "the narrator, Sam, speaks with a tone more measured than that of most teenagers. That tone grates on some readers."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Mary Harris. [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/21/books/children-s-books-welcome-back.html "Welcome Back"]. ''New York Times''. November 21, 1999. Retrieved 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] has cited ''My Side of the Mountain'' with inspiring him to become a [[Falconry|falconer]], which led him into a career in [[environmental law]] and [[environmental activism]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvey, Anita. ''Everything I Need to Know I Learned From a Children's Book: Life Lessons From Notable People From All Walks of Life.'' New York: Roaring Brook Press, 2009, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Television host and pet advice author [[Marc Morrone]] and award-winning natural history author [[Ken Lamberton]] also credit the book with generating their interest in falconry.&lt;ref&gt;Morrone, Marc and Ellis-Bell, Nancy. ''A Man for All Species: The Remarkable Adventures of an Animal Lover and Expert Pet Keeper.'' New York: Harmony Books, 2010, p. 46; Lamberton, Ken. ''Beyond Desert Walls: Essays from Prison.'' Tucson, Ariz.: University of Arizona Press, 2005, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 77 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=SLJChapter2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |title= Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth | publisher= ''A Fuse #8 Production''.

The Nicobar Islands cover a land area of 1,841&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Nicobar-Islands Nicobar Islands]. Encyclopedia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a population of 36,844 during the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]]. They comprise three distinct groups:

'''[[Car Nicobar Subdivision|Northern Group]]''':
* [[Car Nicobar]]
* Battimaly

'''[[Nancowry Subdivision|Central Group]]''':
* [[Chowra]], Chaura or Sanenyo
* [[Teressa (Nicobar Islands)|Teressa]] or Luroo
* [[Bompuka]] or Poahat
* [[Katchal Island|Katchal]]
* [[Camorta Island|Camorta]]
* [[Nancowry Island|Nancowry]] or Nancowrie
* [[Trinket Island|Trinket]]
* [[Man Island (Nicobar)|Laouk]] or "Isle of Man"
* [[Tillangchong]]

'''[[Great Nicobar Subdivision|Southern Group]]''' (Sambelong):
* [[Great Nicobar]] (922&amp;nbsp;km², largest island of the Nicobars)
* [[Little Nicobar]]
* [[Kondul Island]]
* [[Pulo Milo]] or Pillomilo (Milo Island)
* [[Meroe Island|Meroe]], Trak, Treis, Menchal, Kabra, Pigeon and Megapod

Indira Point ({{coord|6.756378|93.827765}}) is the southernmost point of Great Nicobar Island and also of India itself, lying about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].

The Nicobar Islands are part of a great [[island arc]] created by the collision of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] with [[Eurasia]]. The collision lifted the [[Himalayas]] and most of the Indonesian islands, and created a long arc of highlands and islands, which includes the [[Arakan Yoma]] range of [[Burma]], the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and the islands off the west coast of [[Sumatra]], including the [[Banyak Islands]] and [[Mentawai Islands]].

===Ecology===
The climate is warm and tropical, with temperatures ranging from 22 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C. Rainfall is heavy due to annual monsoons and measures around 3000 to 3800&amp;nbsp;mm each year. The vegetation of the Nicobars is typically divided into the coastal [[mangrove]] forests and the interior evergreen and deciduous [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]]. Additionally, several islands contain extensive inland [[grassland]]s, though these are thought to result from human intervention.

The Nicobar Islands are recognised as a distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]], the '''Nicobar Islands rain forests''', with many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species.

As a result of lower sea levels during the [[ice age]]s, the Andaman Islands were linked to the Southeast Asian mainland, but it is not believed that the Nicobar Islands ever had a land bridge to the continent. Lower sea levels did link the islands to one another: Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar were linked to each other, and Nancowry, Chaura, Katchall, Trinka, Camorta, and the nearby smaller islands were linked to one another as well.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
The Nicobar Islands are believed to have been inhabited for thousands of years. Six indigenous [[Nicobarese languages]] are spoken on the islands, which are part of the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer branch]] of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]], which includes [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages of [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Munda languages]] of India. An indigenous tribe living at the southern tip of Great Nicobar, called the [[Shompen people|Shompen]], may be of [[Mesolithic]] Southeast Asian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Origin of the name ===
The earliest extant references to the name "Nicobar" is in the [[Sri Lanka]]n [[Pali]] [[Buddhist]] chronicles, the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' (c. 3rd or 4th century CE) and the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (c. 4th or 5th century), which state that the children of the followers of the legendary founder of the Sri Lankan Kingdom, Vijaya, landed on ''Naggadipa'' (the island of the children, from the Pali '''nagga''' meaning 'naked').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Mahavamsa or The Great Chronicle of Ceylon| author=Wilhelm Geiger (Tr)| year=1912 | accessdate=  8 July 2013| publisher=Pali Text Society | url=http://what-buddha-said.net/library/pdfs/mahavamsa.geiger.pdf| quote= ''P54 "The island where the children landed was called Naggadipa..." N: "l That is,'Island of children', from nagga 'naked'..." ''| isbn= 978-81-206-0218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern name is likely derived from the [[Chola dynasty]] name for the islands, '''''Nakkavaram''''' or ''''Puup Pii'''' (literally, "naked man" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) which is inscribed on the [[Thanjavur]] (Tanjore) inscription of 1050 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Ancient Jaffna| author=C Rasanayagam| year=1926 | accessdate=  | publisher=Asian Educational Society (reprint)| url=| quote= ''P53 "Naggadipa, where the children are alleged to have landed, is certainly Nicobars, the Nakkavaram of the Tamils, ...''| isbn= 978-81-206-0210-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keay2001"&gt;{{Cite book | title=India: A History | author=John Keay | year=2001 | accessdate= | publisher=Grove Press | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibLUu6RlvqwC | quote=''... and 'Nakkavaram' certainly represents the Nicobar islands ...'' | isbn=978-0-8021-3797-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica1998"&gt;{{Cite book | title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica | year=1998 | accessdate = 16 November 2008 | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | url=https://books.google.com/?id=abRYAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...

=== Colonial period ===
The history of organised European [[colonisation]] on the islands began with the [[Danish East India Company]] in 1754/56. During this time they were  administrated from [[Tranquebar]] (in continental [[Danish India]]) administrated under the name of '''Frederiksøerne'''; missionaries from the [[Moravian Church]] Brethren's settlement in [[Tranquebar]] attempted a settlement on [[Nancowry Island|Nancowry]] and died in great numbers from disease; the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of [[malaria]]: 1784–1807/09, 1830–1834 and finally from 1848 gradually for good. Between 1778 and 1783, [[William Bolts]] attempted to establish an Austrian colony on the islands on the mistaken assumption that [[Denmark–Norway]] had abandoned its claims to the islands.&lt;ref name="ColVoy"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italy]] made an attempt at buying the Nicobar Islands from Denmark between 1864 and 1868. The Italian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce [[Luigi Torelli]] started a negotiation that looked promising, but failed due to the unexpected end of his Office and the [[:it:Governo La Marmora I|first La Marmora Cabinet]]. The negotiations were interrupted and never brought up again.&lt;ref&gt;Ministero della Guerra, Ufficio Storico, Storia Militare della Colonia Eritrea, Vol. I, Roma 1935, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]]'s presence in the islands ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,&lt;ref name="ColVoy" /&gt; which in 1869 made them part of [[British India]].

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the islands were [[Invasion and occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II|occupied by Japan between 1942 and 1945]]. India occupied these islands after the [[Surrender of Japan]], as its Territory.

===Indian state===
Together with the Andaman Islands, they became a [[union territory]] of India in 1950.

== Water sports ==
Andaman and Nicobar islands are also known for the various types of water sports available. Water sports include snorkeling, scuba diving, parasailing, under-sea walking and other thrilling sports. Water sports is one main cause of the huge tourist attraction to this place. People can enjoy with their families and prefer to relax or excite themselves.

==26 December 2004 tsunami==
On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Nicobar Islands was devastated by a 10–15 m high [[tsunami]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. At least 6,000 people were killed on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] with reports putting the death toll on [[Katchal Island]] alone at 4,600.

Several islands were heavily damaged with initial reports of islands broken in two or three pieces and coral reefs moved above water. Teressa Island was said to have been split into two pieces and Trinkat Island into three pieces. Some estimates said that the islands were moved as much as 100 feet (30 m) by the earthquake and tilted.

[[Indira Point]] subsided 4.25 m and the lighthouse there was damaged.

==World Biosphere Reserve==
On 31 May 2013 it was reported that Nicobar Islands have been declared as [[World Biosphere Reserve]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title=''Nicobar Islands declared as world biosphere reserve''|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=31 May 2013|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/Nicobar-Islands-declared-as-world-biosphere-reserve/articleshow/20358478.cms|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
*Airport: [[Car Nicobar]] CBD/VECX has an airstrip on [[Car Nicobar Air Force Base]] of 2717 by 43 meters on the South East coast near Malacca but does not offer commercial service.  [[Great Nicobar]] has a small airstrip of approximately 1000 meters at Campbell Bay/Tenlaa on its East coast.
*Seaport: At least one small shipping dock is located in Campbell Bay on the East coast of [[Great Nicobar]].  [[Car Nicobar]] has a small dock at its Northern tip near Keating Point and Mus.

[[File: North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone.jpg|thumb|Significant ocean currents involved in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical and Subpolar gyres]]
The '''North Pacific Gyre''' (NPG) or '''North Pacific Subtropical Gyre''' (NPSG), located in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], is one of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s. This gyre covers most of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is the largest ecosystem on Earth, located between the [[equator]] and [[50th parallel north|50° N latitude]], and comprising 20 million square kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3658829| title=A Sea of Change: Biogeochemical Variability in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre|year=1999 |publisher=Springer|volume=2|pages=181–214|doi=10.1007/s100219900068|journal=Ecosystems | last1 = Karl | first1 = David M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gyre has a clockwise circular pattern and is formed by four prevailing [[ocean current]]s: the [[North Pacific Current]] to the north, the [[California Current]] to the east, the [[North Equatorial Current]] to the south, and the [[Kuroshio Current]] to the west. It is the site of an unusually intense collection of man-made [[marine debris]], known as the [[Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the much smaller [[North Pacific Subpolar Gyre]] make up the two major gyre systems in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Pacific Ocean. This two-gyre circulation in the North Pacific is driven by the [[Trade winds|trade]] and [[Westerlies|westerly winds]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Descriptive Physical Oceanography: An Introduction|last=Talley|first=Lynne D.|last2=Pickard|first2=George L.|last3=Emery|first3=William J.|last4=Swift|first4=James H.|publisher=Academic Press|year=2011|isbn=0750645520|location=London, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the best examples of all of Earth’s oceans where these winds drive a two-gyre circulation. Physical characteristics like weak [[thermohaline circulation]] in the North Pacific and it is mostly blocked by land in the north, also help facilitate this circulation. As depth increases, these gyres in the North Pacific grow smaller and weaker, and the [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] at the center of the Subtropical Gyre will migrate poleward and westward.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Physical oceanography ==

=== Subtropical circulation in the North Pacific ===

Like all subtropical gyre systems, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is an [[anticyclone]] meaning the circulation is in a clockwise direction around its high pressure at the center because of its placement in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. This circulation is also associated with equatorward [[Sverdrup balance|Sverdrup]] transport and [[Ekman transport|Ekman]] downwelling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating [[Geostrophic wind#geostrophic flow|geostrophic flow]]. [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for Sverdrup transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Dynamical Oceanography|last=Pond, S.|first=|last2=Pickard, G. L.|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-08-028728-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuroshio Current]] is the narrow, strong westward boundary current of the subtropical circulation. This current influences the water column all the way to the bottom. The Kuroshio current flows in a northerly direction, then eventually flows further from the westward boundary where it then takes an eastward direction into the North Pacific. This eastward flowing current is then called the Kuroshio Extension. The [[North Pacific Current]] is located just north of the Subtropical Gyre and flows in an easterly direction. Also, known as the West Wind Drift or the Subarctic Current, the North Pacific Current also includes the westward flow of the southern boundary of the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oceans: Their Physics, Chemistry, and General Biology|last=Sverdrup|first=H. U.|last2=Johnson|first2=|last3=Fleming|first3=R. H.|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1942|isbn=|location=New York|pages=M. W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Equatorial Current]] borders the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre on the south and flows in a westerly direction. The westward flow within the elongated tropical [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] circulation is also included in the North Equatorial current. The [[California Current|California Current System]] comprises the eastern boundary of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and flows south along the coast of California. Here [[Upwelling|coastal upwelling]] drives the eastern boundary current and an undercurrent that flows poleward.

In the western region of the North Pacific, the surface of the Subtropical Gyre generally has a "C-shape".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyrki|first=K.|date=1975|title=Fluctuations of the Dynamic Topography of the Pacific Ocean|url=|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=5 | issue = 3 |pages=450–459|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1975)005&lt;0450:fotdti&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasunuma|first=K.|last2=Yoshida|first2=K.|date=1978|title=Splitting of the subtropical gyre in the western North Pacific|url=|journal=Journal of Oceanography|volume=34 | issue = 4 |pages=160–172|doi=10.1007/bf02108654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuroshio current and Kuroshio Extension roughly from the outside of this "C-shape" where it then turns westwards into recirculation, where it then flows south parallel to the Kuroshio Current. From here the "C-shape" then flows eastward comprising the [[Subtropical Countercurrent]] at roughly 20 – 25⁰N, then finally the "C" wraps back towards the west forming the North Equatorial Current just south of 20⁰N. It is common for subtropical gyres to have this "C-shape" surface flow. The Subtropical Countercurrent is a shallow area of this "C"; at only about 250 dbar under the surface, circulation is a simpler closed, anticyclonic gyre.

Narrow east-west frontal zones that cross the Pacific are less than 100&amp;nbsp; km wide. The Subarctic Frontal Zone or Subarctic Boundary, about 42⁰N, is fixed in the North Pacific Current.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Subarctic Frontal Zone, slightly south of the maximum westerly wind speeds, separates the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre from the Subtropical Gyre. In the central and eastern Pacific at roughly 32⁰N is the Subtropical Frontal Zone. Sometimes referred to as the Subtropical Convergence Zone, this frontal zone serves as the boundary between the west flowing North Equatorial Current from the North Pacific Current.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increasing depth in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, it gets smaller in the western region near Japan and it also loses strength. The Subtropical Gyre does not exist below 1500 m below the surface with the exception of the Kuroshio Current and Extension regions.

==== Circulation dependence on depth ====

The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre diminishes spatially with increasing depth.  Similar to all subtropical gyre systems, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shrinks towards its most energetic surface flows, in a northwestern direction between the Kuroshio Current and the Kuroshio Extension. This is drastic shrinkage from the surface to about 200 m below.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=J. L.|date=1997|title=On the Total Geostrophic Circulation of the Pacific Ocean: Flow Patterns, Tracers, and Transports|url=|journal=Progress in Oceanography|volume=39 | issue = 4 |pages=263–352|doi=10.1016/s0079-6611(97)00012-8|bibcode=1997PrOce..39..263R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the surface, the boundary that separates the westward and eastward flows from south of 20⁰N to about 25 – 30⁰N at 200 m. The "C-shape" in the western region of the Subtropical Gyre, including the Subtropical Countercurrent, generally does not exist below 200 m. At about 1000 – 1500 m, the Subtropical Gyre is located entirely in the western region of the North Pacific near the Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Extension.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the subtropical regions, flow is weak where influences from the Subtropical Gyre are minimal. Differences in steric heights over distances of 1000&amp;nbsp; km are on the order of 1&amp;nbsp; cm, rather than the differences of 10&amp;nbsp; cm within the area of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.

The '''origins of [[global surveillance]]''' can be traced back to the late 1940s, when the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, whose close cooperation eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network, code-named "'''[[ECHELON]]'''", in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal|1970s Watergate affair]] and a subsequent [[congressional inquiry]] led by Sen. [[Frank Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |title=No Holiday |url= |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the [[European Parliament]] highlighted the NSA's role in [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]] in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peggy Becker |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 1999 |title=DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND RISK OF ABUSE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/cache/offonce/home/publications/studies?page=12 |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page= |docket= |accessdate=November 3, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic.

By the late 1990s the [[ECHELON]] system was capable of intercepting satellite transmissions, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave. A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in his 1996 book "Secret Power". While the existence of ECHELON was denied by some member governments, a report by a committee of the [[European Parliament]] in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Fiddler, Stephen (July 1, 2013).

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament stated in its report that the term "ECHELON" was used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals intelligence collection system capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally.

On March 15, 2012, the American magazine ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' published an article with the headline "The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)",&lt;ref name="wired11"&gt;{{cite news|title=The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1|work=Wired|accessdate=August 14, 2013|first=James|last=Bamford|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later mentioned by U.S. Rep. [[Hank Johnson]] during a congressional hearing. In response to Johnson's inquiry, NSA director [[Keith B. Alexander]] testified that these allegations made by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine were untrue.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|title=NSA Chief Denies Wired's Domestic Spying Story (Fourteen Times) In Congressional Hearing|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/20/nsa-chief-denies-wireds-domestic-spying-story-fourteen-times-in-congressional-hearing/|work=Forbes|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, [[Edward Snowden]] handed over 200,000 [[top secret]] documents to various media outlets, triggering one of the biggest [[news leak]]s in the modern [[history of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-CIA employee source of leak on PRISM program|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130609-former-cia-employee-source-us-intelligence-leaks-snowden-nsa|publisher=[[France 24]]|accessdate=September 17, 2013|quote=Snowden’s decision to reveal his identity and whereabouts lifts the lid on one of the biggest security leaks in US history and escalates a story that has placed a bright light on Obama’s extensive use of secret surveillance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to ecology:

'''[[Ecology]]''' &amp;ndash; scientific study of the distribution and abundance of [[life|living organisms]] and how the distribution and abundance are affected by [[interaction]]s between the organisms and their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  The environment of an organism includes both physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local [[abiotic]] factors such as [[Sun|solar]] [[insolation]], [[climate]] and [[geology]], as well as the other organisms that share its [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].  Also called '''ecological science'''.

{{nihongo|'''Oyashio'''|親潮||"Parental Tide"}}, also known as '''Oya Siwo''', '''Okhotsk''' or the '''[[Kuril Islands|Kurile]] current''', is a cold [[subarctic]] [[ocean current]] that flows south and circulates counterclockwise in the western North [[Pacific Ocean]].  The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and flow southward via the [[Bering Sea]], passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].  It collides with the [[Kuroshio Current]] off the eastern shore of [[Japan]] to form the [[North Pacific Current]] (or Drift). 
The nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the {{nihongo|parent|親|''oya''}} that provides for and nurtures marine organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter= Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents|date=2001|last=Qiu|first=Bo|title=Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|page=1413–25| publisher=Academic Press | url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/bo/Q01.pdf |quote= The upwelled, nutrient-rich water feeds the Oyashio from the north and leads to its nomenclature, parent (''oya'') stream (''shio'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glattstein|first=Judy|title=Enhance Your Garden with Japanese Plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAhIAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-1-56836-137-6|page=16 |quote=[...] currents whirl around and ascend, and nourish microscopic plankton. Oyashio is thus the parent of fishes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current has an important impact on the climate of the [[Russian Far East]], mainly in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]], where the northern [[tree line|limit of tree growth]] is moved south up to ten degrees compared with the latitude it can reach in inland [[Siberia]]. The waters of the Oyashio Current form probably the richest [[fishery]] in the world owing to the extremely high-nutrient content of the cold water and the very high [[tides]] (up to ten metres) in some areas – which further enhances the availability of nutrients. However, the Oyashio Current also causes [[Vladivostok]] to be the most equatorward [[port]] to seasonally freeze and require [[icebreaker|icebreaking ships]] to remain open in winter. Nonetheless, this has relatively little effect on the fish yield through the Sea of Okhotsk, because the large tides mean freezing does not occur so easily.

During [[glacial period]]s, when lower [[sea level]] exposed the [[Bering land bridge]], the current could not flow in the regions the Oyashio affects today. The level of cooling with the onset of glacial conditions (after an [[interglacial]]) was much less than in other areas of the Earth at similar latitudes. This allowed [[Tōhoku Region|Tōhoku]] and [[Hokkaidō]] – the only areas of [[East Asia]] with enough snowfall to potentially form glaciers – to remain unglaciated except at high elevations during periods when Europe and [[North America]] were largely glaciated. This lack of glaciation explains why, despite its present climate being much colder than most of [[Europe]], East Asia has retained 96 percent of [[Pliocene]] tree genera, whereas Europe has retained only 27%.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The '''Panjal Traps''' or the '''Tethyan Plume''' is a [[large igneous province]] (LIP) that erupted during the Early–Middle [[Permian]] in what is now north-western [[India]].  The Panjal Traps are associated with the opening of the [[Tethys Ocean|Neo-Tethys Ocean]], which resulted in the dispersal of the [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian]] [[continental fragment|continental blocks]] from the north-eastern margin of [[Gondwana]] and possibly the break-up of this old and large continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chauvet|Lapierre|Bosch|Guillot|2008|loc=Introduction, p. 384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Zanskar]]-[[Lahaul and Spiti district|Spliti-Lahaul]] area (in the north-western Himalayas and south-east Ladakh) the {{Convert|30|-|150|m|abbr=on}}-thick basalts of the Panjal Traps are mostly exposed as massive (terrestrial) lava flows, but also as (marine) [[pillow lava]]s and [[hyaloclastite]]s.&lt;ref name="Chauvet-setting"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chauvet|Lapierre|Bosch|Guillot|2008|loc=Geological setting, pp. 384–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panjal Traps were first documented in 1824 and were eventually named by British geologist [[Richard Lydekker]] in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lydekker|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their origin, age, and relationship with surrounding and underlying rocks remained elusive for more than a century.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt-2014"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shellnutt|Bhat|Wang|Brookfield|2014|loc=Introduction, pp. 159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They remained one of the most understudied LIPs before being properly dated to 289&amp;nbsp;Ma in 2011.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt-2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shellnutt|Bhat|Brookfield|Jahn|2011|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological setting==
Late Carboniferous to Early Permian deposits of Tethyan affinity in the Zanskar-Spiti area are mostly [[terrigenous]], [[Detritus|detrital]] sedimentary rocks, although some magmatic activity documented in Pakistan and central Nepal has been associated with this period.  These sedimentary layers are associated with the erosion that followed the [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] of the margins of the newly rifted Indian continent.  
In the eastern and central Himalayas more voluminous volcanic eruptions have been documented from the same period.  The [[Abor Hills|Abor]] volcanics produced {{Convert|1500|m|abbr=on}} of [[basalt]]ic to [[andesite|andesitic]] flows and [[tuff]]s.  In the Late Permian ([[Sakmarian]]-[[Roadian]]) the [[tholeiitic basalt|theoliitic]] [[Nar-Tsum]](?) produced {{Convert|300|m}} of [[spilite]]s and [[Bhote Koshi|Bhote Kosi]] basalts in southern Tibet.&lt;ref name="Chauvet-setting" /&gt;

The slightly younger ([[Artinskian]]-[[Permian#anchor 2|Kazanian]]) Panjal Traps produced the largest magmatic province in north-western India.  Its lava flows now covers 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, from the eastern Zanskar-Spliti-Lahaul area to north-eastern Pakistan and they filled a rifted valley called the Zanskar-Spiti [[syncline|synclinorium]].&lt;ref name="Chauvet-setting" /&gt;
The original extent of the Panjal Traps may have exceeded 0.2x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a distribution similar to those of the [[Emeishan Traps|Emeishan LIP]] in south-western China and the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia River basalts]] in north-western United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stojanovic|Aitchison|Ali|Ahmad|2016|loc=Introduction, p. 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Ladakh and in the [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir Basin]] the flows are {{Convert|2500|m|abbr=on}} thick with a smaller amount of [[pyroclastic]]s overlain by [[Phenocryst|aphyric]] basaltic flows.  In north-eastern Pakistan the Panjal flows are exposed as [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] cross-cutting the [[Basement (geology)|basement]] and Early Paleozoic layers, and as inter-layered magmatic flows on Late Plaeozoic to Early Mesozoic layers with Tethyan affinity.&lt;!--Panjal Traps are widespread and up to 2km thick under [[eclogite]]s and [[amphibolite]]s metamorphic [[facies]](?).--&gt;&lt;ref name="Chauvet-setting" /&gt;

The eruption of the Panjal Traps was followed (Kazanian-[[Wuchiapingian|Djulfian]]) by the emplacement of a succession of sediments, the result of the progressive [[Thermal subsidence|thermo]]-[[tectonic subsidence]] of the Indian passive margin associated with the expanding Neo-Tethys.&lt;ref name="Chauvet-setting" /&gt;

==Tectonic implications==
The Panjal Traps have been associated with either the [[Olson's Extinction|Mid-Capitanian]] (260&amp;nbsp;Ma) or [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]] (251&amp;nbsp;Ma) mass extinction events.  Analyses of zircon crystals have, however, yielded an [[U-Pb dating|&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pb age]] of 289±2&amp;nbsp;Ma&amp;nbsp;— considerably older than these mass extinctions.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt-2011" /&gt;
The Panjal Traps can, nevertheless, be linked to the African [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces|large low-shear-velocity province]] (or superplume) and, as such, is most likely responsible for the widespread flood basalts in the Himalayas, but the [[Siberian Traps]] (251&amp;nbsp;Ma) are probably a better candidate for these younger mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|pp=1023–1024; Fig. 21, p. 1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late Carboniferous-Permian LIPs (such as [[Skagerrak-Centered Large Igneous Province|Jutland]], Panjal, [[Tarim Large Igenous Province|Tarim]], [[Emeishan Traps|Emeishan]] and Siberia) were emplaced before the break-up of Pangaea whereas the post-Permian LIPs were involved in the break-up of the supercontinent.  Mantle plume-derived LIPs share features such as large-volume flood basalts, short duration, uplift and doming of the crust before eruption, and high temperature-melts such as [[komatiite]]s and [[picrite]]s.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt-2014" /&gt;
The chemical and isotopic composition of samples of basalt taken from the eastern Kashmir Valley are similar to within-plate basalts, and probably derived from a [[spinel]] [[peridotite]] source.  Samples taken from the western side of the valley are more primitive, derived from a more depleted source.  This suggests that Panjal made a transition from a newly formed continental setting, where the basalt composition was 'enriched [[Ocean island basalt|OIB]]-like', to an old ocean basin, where the composition was 'depleted [[Mid-ocean ridge|MORB]]-like'.  Chemically, the Panjal basalts are similar to those from post-Permian/post-Pangaean LIPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shellnutt|Bhat|Wang|Yeh|2015|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paleomagnetism|Paleomagnetic]] data from the Kashmir Valley indicate the Panjal eruption occurred at a paleolatitude of c. 33°&amp;nbsp;(±5°)S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stojanovic|Aitchison|Ali|Ahmad|2016|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domenico Fetti 007.jpg|thumb|The vision painted by [[Domenico Fetti]].]]
[[File:Peter's vision of the sheet with animals.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from ''Treasures of the Bible'' by Henry Davenport Northrop, 1894.]]
According to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Acts 10|chapter 10]], [[Saint Peter]] had a vision of a vessel ({{Lang-el|σκεῦος}}, ''skeuos''; "a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners") full of animals being lowered from [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] ({{bibleref|Acts|10:11|KJV}}). A voice from heaven told Peter to kill and eat, but since the vessel (or sheet, ὀθόνη, ''othonē'') contained [[unclean animals]], Peter declined. The command was repeated two more times, along with the voice saying, "What God hath made clean, that call not thou common" (verse 15) and then the vessel was taken back to heaven (verse 16).

At this point in the narrative, messengers sent from [[Cornelius the Centurion]] arrive and urge Peter to go with them. He does so, and mentions the vision as he speaks to Cornelius, saying "God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean" ({{bibleref|Acts|10:28|KJV}}). Peter related the vision again in {{bibleref|Acts|11:4-9|KJV}}.

==Interpretation==
[[Simon J. Kistemaker]] suggests that the lesson God taught Peter in this vision is that "God has removed the barriers he once erected to separate his people from the surrounding nations."&lt;ref name="Kistemaker1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kistemaker|first=Simon J. |authorlink=Simon J. Kistemaker|title=Exposition of the Acts of the Apostles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rascAAAACAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Baker Book House|isbn=978-0-8010-5290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|378}} Kistemaker argues that it means Peter has to accept [[Gentile]] believers as full members of the [[Christian Church]], but also that God has made all animals clean, so that "Peter with his fellow [[Jewish Christian]]s can disregard the [[Kashrut|food laws]] that have been observed since the days of [[Moses]]."&lt;ref name="Kistemaker1990" /&gt;{{rp|380}} [[Albert Mohler]], President of Southern Seminary, writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/21/my-take-the-bible-condemns-a-lot-but-heres-why-we-focus-on-homosexuality/ | title= The Bible condemns a lot, but here's why we focus on homosexuality| work= My Take| publisher= CNN | author=[[Albert Mohler|R. Albert Mohler Jr.]] | date= May 21, 2012 | accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As the Book of Acts makes clear, Christians are not obligated to follow this holiness code. This is made clear in Peter's vision in Acts 10:15. Peter is told, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'  In other words, there is no [[kosher]] code for Christians. Christians are not concerned with eating kosher foods and avoiding all others. That part of the law is no longer binding, and Christians can enjoy shrimp and pork with no injury to conscience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Luke Timothy Johnson]] and [[Daniel J. Harrington]] write that this episode heralds a radical change in Peter's "identity as a member of God's people,"&lt;ref name="JohnsonHarrington1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Luke Timothy |authorlink1=Luke Timothy Johnson|last2=Harrington|first2=Daniel J. |authorlink2=Daniel J. Harrington|title=The Acts of the Apostles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVLF53DjFPsC&amp;pg=PA187|year=1992|publisher=Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5807-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187-}} but also that "the implication is that all things God created are declared clean by him, and are not affected by human discriminations."&lt;ref name="JohnsonHarrington1992" /&gt;{{rp|184}}

On the other hand, the [[United Church of God]] (a group following the teachings of [[Herbert W. Armstrong]]) calls this an "often-misunderstood section of the Bible",&lt;ref name="UCG"&gt;{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Teach About Clean and Unclean Meats?|year=2008|publisher=[[United Church of God]]|url=http://www.ucg.org/files/booklets/what-does-the-bible-teach-about-clean-and-unclean-meats.pdf|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Peter's statement in verse 28 indicates that the divine disclosure reflected only a teaching about people, and not one about food. The UCG argues that Peter realised "the puzzling vision could not be annulling God’s instructions."&lt;ref name="UCG"/&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has a similar view of this passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adventist Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4_kAAAAMAAJ|date=January 2007|publisher=Review and Herald Pub. Association|volume=184 Pt 1|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's triple refusal described in {{bibleref|Acts|10:16|KJV}} echoes the [[denial of Peter]] described in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].&lt;ref name="Witherington1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witherington|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Witherington III|title=The Acts of the Apostles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2P7zSnM9BjMC&amp;pg=PA350|year=2008|publisher=Wm.

==Artistic depictions==
Peter's vision was rarely shown in art, but has been illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings by [[Rembrandt]] and a variant by his pupil [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten|van Hoogstraten]].  Rembrandt was probably reacting to a painting of the subject by [[Domenico Fetti]] which was then in Amsterdam, and is now in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Bevers2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevers|first=Holm |title=Drawings by Rembrandt and His Pupils: Telling the Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQMBCBIJpCAC&amp;pg=PA152|year=2009|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-978-2|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in the "Altar of St. Peter" in [[Seville Cathedral]], attributed to [[Francisco de Zurbarán]].&lt;ref name="Soria2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soria|first1=Martin S.|title=Zurbaráaan's Altar of Saint Peter|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=33|issue=3|year=2015|pages=165–173|issn=0004-3079|doi=10.1080/00043079.1951.11408051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RéveilDuchesne1833"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Réveil|first1=Etienne Achille |last2=Duchesne|first2=Jean |title=Museum of Painting and Sculpture: Or, Collection of the Principal Pictures, Statues and Bas-reliefs in the Public and Private Galleries of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byEUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP364|year=1833|publisher=Bossange|pages=364–|volume=Vol 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piacenzian''' is in the international [[geologic time scale]] the upper [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] or latest [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Pliocene]]. It spans the time between 3.6 ± 0.005 [[annum|Ma]] and 2.588 ± 0.005 Ma (million years ago). The Piacenzian is after the [[Zanclean]] and is followed by the [[Gelasian]] (part of the [[Pleistocene]]).

The Piacenzian is roughly [[coeval]] with the [[European land mammal age]] MN 16, overlaps the late [[Chapadmalalan]] and early [[Uquian]] [[South American land mammal age]] and falls inside the more extensive [[Blancan]] [[North American land mammal age]]. It also correlates with the Astian, Redonian, [[Reuverian]] and Romanian regional stages of Europe. Some authorities describe the British [[Red Crag Formation]] and Waltonian stage as late Piacenzian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=RCG|title=Red Crag Formation|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/correlation/POSTERSTRAT_v2011.pdf.20110222-162627|title=Global Chronostratigraphical Correlation Table for the Last 2.7 Million Years. v.2011|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others regard them as early Pleistocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1004220.pdf |title=The Naze citation|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=     5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Allaby|title=Oxford Dictionary of Geology &amp; Earth Sciences|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=626|year=2013|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-19-96530  6-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Piacenzian was introduced in scientific literature by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stratigrapher Karl Mayer-Eymar in 1858. It is named after the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Piacenza]].

The base of the Piacenzian is at the base of magnetic chronozone C2An (the base of the Gauss chronozone and at the [[extinction]] of the [[plankton]]ic [[foram]]s ''Globorotalia margaritae'' and ''Pulleniatina primalis''. The [[GSSP]] for the Piacenzian stage is at Punta Piccola on [[Sicily]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Castradori ''et al.'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the Piacenzian (the base of the Quaternary system and the Pleistocene series) is defined [[Magnetostratigraphy|magnetostratigraphically]] as the base of the Matuyama (C2r) [[chronozone]] (at the [[Gauss-Matuyama reversal]]), and isotopic stage 103. Above this point there are notable extinctions of the calcareous [[nanofossil]]s: ''[[Discoaster|Discoaster pentaradiatus]]'' and ''Discoaster  surculus''.&lt;ref&gt;Gadstein ''et al.'' (2005), p. 28; Rio ''et al.'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Climate of the Piacenzian would have started as a somewhat wet and warm period in North America occurring just after a brief cooling period of the Zanclean. Deposition of sediments and mollusks of the Piacenzian correspond with the rise in sea level creating the Tamiami Subsea and Jackson Subsea of Florida, Duplin Subsea generally of [[South Carolina]], and Yorktown Subsea of the [[Outer Banks]] and inland [[North Carolina]]. Dates have been established on the basis of the genera and species of mollusks found.&lt;ref&gt;Petuch, Edward J., Ph.D. Florida Atlantic University, Department of Geodsciences. Cenozoic Seas: The View From Eastern North America. CRC Press, Dec. 29, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8493-1632-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the genus ''Homo''==
The late Piacenzian may be when the genus ''[[Homo]]'' developed out of the ancestral genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc.first"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31718336 |title='First human' discovered in Ethiopia |author=Pallab Ghosh|date=4 March 2015 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the oldest known fossils unambiguously identified as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' date to just after the end of the Piacenzian (2.58 Ma), a fossilized jawbone that exhibits traits that are transitional between ''Australopithecus'' and ''Homo habilis'' was discovered in the [[Afar Triangle]] in 2015.
The find was made by Ethiopian student Chalachew Seyoum at a site called [[Ledi-Geraru]] between the [[Mille River|Mille]] and [[Awash River|Awash]] rivers, in  [[Afar Region|Afar Regional State]] (near {{coord|11.36|N|40.86|E|}}).&lt;ref name=newscientist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27079-oldest-known-member-of-human-family-found-in-ethiopia.html#.VPrw7vmsXId |title=Oldest known member of human family found in Ethiopia |publisher=''[[New Scientist]]'' |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31718336 |title= 'First human' discovered in Ethiopia |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on geological evidence from the Afar region, the individual would have lived just after a major [[Abrupt climate change|climate shift]], during which forests and waterways were rapidly replaced by arid [[savanna]]. Regarding the Afar region, and as stated in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']]: "Vertebrate fossils record a faunal turnover indicative of more open and probable arid habitats than those reconstructed earlier in this region, in broad agreement with hypotheses addressing the role of environmental forcing in hominin evolution at this time." This interpretation is consistent with hypotheses  that emphasize the savanna as the [[Savanna principle|ancestral environment]] that shaped the evolution of early ''Homo'' and other hominins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/03/03/science.aaa1415 |title=Late Pliocene fossiliferous sedimentary record and the environmental context of early ''Homo'' from Afar, Ethiopia |author1=Erin N.

'''Public plans for energy efficient refurbishment''' are put in place by states to encourage building owners to renovate their properties in a way that increases their energy performance. As financing represents the most important obstacle to this type of renovation, the plans favour financial incentives in the form of loans or grants. Various institutions can be involved in the process, such as ministries, banks, firms, or [[Energy services company|energy services companies]] (ESCOs).

A number of countries have implemented such plans: the United States, France, Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Estonia, and others.

== United States: PACE ==

{{main|PACE financing}}

The concept of [[PACE financing|PACE]] (Property-Assessed Clean Energy) was inspired by “[[solar bonds]]” program implemented in [[San Francisco]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsr.org/rule/solar-energy/2554-2/ "Solar Energy Initiative - San Francisco, CA," ILSR, January 16 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; It was meant to overcome the major barrier to the installation of solar and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] retrofits in commercial or residential properties: high up-front costs. The principle consisted in “on-tax bill solar and efficiency financing,” whereby repayment of the investment in measures is made through a [[property tax]] assessment.

PACE originated in 2008 with pilot programs in [[California]], [[Colorado]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], that focused primarily on energy efficiency upgrades to single family homes. The first actual PACE program was carried out in [[Berkeley, California]], and the state passed the first PACE-enabling legislation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacenow.org/about-pace/ "About PACE," PACENow. Accessed July 9 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the [[2008 financial crisis]], on July 30, 2008, the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) was created to supervise enterprises and banks (the "regulated entities"), after [[Fannie Mae]] (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and [[Freddie Mac]] (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association)'s bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;"Housing and Economic Recovery Act," PUBLIC LAW 110–289, 110th Congress, July 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, most homes had a market value below the volume of contracted loans, following the burst of the [[housing bubble]]. In July 2010, the FHFA issued the first of many directives that effectively ban Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from buying or holding mortgages with PACE assessments.&lt;ref name="article FHFA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hsu|first1=Tiffany|title=Fannie, Freddie freeze PACE energy-efficiency retrofit financing programs|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/07/fannie-freddie-freeze-pace-energyefficiency-retrofit-financing-programs.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PACE therefore shifted its focus over the next year toward commercial, industrial, multi-family and agricultural buildings and properties.

PACENow, is a national advocate for PACE, defines its mission as “''to promote and assist the development of PACE programs by state and local governments and provide leadership and support for a growing universe of energy efficiency and PACE stakeholders.''”&lt;ref name="PACE annual report" /&gt;

PACE funding is provided (using various sources) or arranged by local governments for 100% of a project's cost, and is repaid with an assessment over a term of up to 20 years.&lt;ref name="PACE annual report"&gt;PACENow, “Annual Report,” June 2013.

== Germany - [[KfW]] Bankengruppe ==

=== Context and creation ===

[[KfW]] (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute) is a German government-owned development bank, based in [[Frankfurt]]. The bank was created in 1948 after the [[Second World War]] as part of the [[Marshall Plan]] for the reconstruction of Europe.

The [[KfW]] Förderbank (KfW promotional bank) is today its largest business unit, committed to housing and environmental protection. KfW introduced the Efficiency House Standard in 2009, to identify levels of energy efficiency in houses and provide loans or grants accordingly. Its activities devoted to bringing down CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions align with a strategy designed by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;BMWI (2010) Energiekonzept für eine umweltschonende, zuverlässige und bezahlbare Energieversorgung, http://www.bmwi.de, vom 05.10.2010.&lt;/ref&gt; following the decision to speed up the pace of nuclear energy phase-out.&lt;ref name="kfw impact"&gt;KfW Bankengruppe. 2011. “Impact on Public Budgets of KfW Promotional Programmes in the Field of Energy-Efficient Building and Rehabilitation,” STE Research Report, Forschungszentrum Jülich. PDF available: [http://www.actu-environnement.com/media/pdf/news-22153-etude-kfw.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy outlined the directions to be privileged in the following years to achieve the desired level of energy efficiency. Among others, it asked to significantly raise the efficiency standards for buildings, to increase funds available for building improvement, and to implement tools to help ensure that new buildings gradually comply with the futureEuropean standards for nearly zero energy buildings. The KfW created promotional programmes targeting private buyers and homeowners, landlords and housing companies, to support refurbishment of older residential buildings with grants or loans.

=== Goals and missions ===

The German government announced in its “Energy Concept” strategy that it aims at reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 80% in 2050 (the base year is 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtai.de/GTAI/Navigation/EN/Invest/Industries/Smarter-business/Smart-energy/germanys-energy-concept,did=383282.html|title=GTAI - Invest|last=GmbH|first=Germany Trade and Invest|website=www.gtai.de|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 2010, annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have fallen at an average annual growth rate of -1.1%. This rate is not large enough to reach the 80% reduction goal; emissions should decrease at a rate of 3.4% per year from now on.&lt;ref name="macro effects" /&gt;

The most important sector contributing to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions is the production and distribution of energy and water (42% of total emissions), and the second-most important one is that of private households (22%). The government has thus decided that efforts must be focused on two pillars: increased energy efficiency in existing buildings, and a larger share of renewable electricity. In order to ensure a reduction of energy consumption in existing buildings, it has decided to promote their rehabilitation, and has committed to carrying out thermal retrofits on 2% of the building stock each year. The realization of these goals is precisely what KfW's promotional programs are targeting.&lt;ref name="macro effects"&gt;Kronenberg, Tobias, Wilhelm Kuckshinrichs, and Patrick Hansen. 2012. “Macroeconomic Effects of the German Government’s Building Rehabilitation Program,” Munich Personal RePEc Archive (MPRA) Paper No. 38815. [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/38815/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intervention methods ===

The bank has set six levels of promotional incentives for energy efficiency refurbishment activities, expressed as Efficiency House Standards 55, 70, 85, 100, 115, and “Monument”. These numbers represent the energy consumption of the housing unit as a percentage of the maximum primary energy requirement specified by the Energy Conservation Ordinance (EnEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energytransition.de/2012/10/energy-conservation-ordinance-enev-and-financial-support-schemes/|title=http://energytransition.de/2012/10/energy-conservation-ordinance-enev-and-financial-support-schemes/|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402233230/http://energytransition.de/2012/10/energy%2Dconservation%2Dordinance%2Denev%2Dand%2Dfinancial%2Dsupport%2Dschemes/|archive-date=2013-04-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower the rating, the greater the energy efficiency. For example, a “KfW Efficiency House 70” consumes 70% of this requirement. As such, the best standard (55) receives the greatest support. To meet the energy standard for an efficient home, heating systems, [[thermal insulation|thermal wall insulation]], roof and floor insulation and windows are required.&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;Power, Anne and Monika Zulauf. 2011. “Cutting Carbon Costs: Learning from Germany’s Energy Saving Program,” WhatWorks Collaborative. PDF available: [http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/cp/CCCfull.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Promotional funds are available either through a loan, or through a grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KfW Effizienzhaus (KfW Efficiency House) - Germany|url=http://www.buildup.eu/links/34974|website=Build Up|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of an energy consultant is mandatory in the application process, and must be contracted by the applicant himself.

==== Supplementary Credit ====

The “KfW Energy Efficient Renovation - Supplementary Credit” programme offers low interest loans specifically for the replacement of the heating and domestic hot water systems that were installed before 2009. The loans can be up to €50,000, and have a 10-year maturity at a fixed interest rate.&lt;ref&gt;"KfW Energieeffizient Sanieren - Ergänzungskredit (Energy Efficient Renovation - Supplementary Credit) - Germany." BuildUp. Retrieved July 25, 2010. [http://www.buildup.eu/links/35264]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== BAFA Energiesparberatung (Energy saving advice) ====

The [[Federal Office of Economics and Export Control]] (BAFA) offers grants in certain situations to cover expenses in on-site energy consultancy in residential buildings (on-site consulting). The maximum grant cannot exceed 50% of the total gross cost of the consultation.&lt;ref&gt;"BAFA Energiesparberatung (Energy saving advice) - Germany." BuildUp. Retrieved July 25, 2014. [http://www.buildup.eu/links/35420]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial arrangements===

KfW obtains its funding on the capital markets, where it benefits from an AAA [[credit rating]] and a 100% guarantee from the German government. It obtains around €80 billion annually on the international capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdinger, Andreas. 2013. “La rénovation thermique des bâtiments en France et en Allemagne : quels enseignements pour le débat sur la transition énergétique ?,” Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI), Working Papers n°07/13, Paris, France. PDF available: http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Idees-pour-le-debat/WP0713_AR_renovation%20energetique%20France-Allemagne.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; KfW thus provides refinancing loans to commercial banks at advantageous rates. KfW does not lend directly to individuals; loans have to go through commercial banks. The interest rate for the promotional loans distributed by the commercial banks is further subsidized by funds provided by the [[:simple:Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs of Germany|Federal Ministry of Building, Transport and Urban Development]]. KfW also receives additional funding from the “Energy and Climate fund”, used to finance the preferential loans and the grants. Grants are distributed directly by KfW to individuals.&lt;ref name="macro effects" /&gt;

=== Business plan and results ===

In 2012, KfW Group had dedicated €29.2 billion to its “Climate change and environment” department, making it its largest activity and its core priority. The latest data on the KfW programs’ achievements shows positive results: between 2006 and 2012, the programs led to an average reduction of 5.9 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents per year.&lt;ref name="report kfw"&gt;"Sustainability Report - Facts and Figures Update 2013." KfW. 2013. PDF available: https://www.kfw.de/PDF/Download-Center/Konzernthemen/Nachhaltigkeit/KfW_FaktenUpdate2013-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically on KfW's refurbishment programmes, the commitment volume in 2012 was €10.1 billion, and financed investments amounted to €27.3 billion. Still in 2012, 240,000 housing units were refurbished to higher energy efficiency levels, and 116,000 new energy efficient housing units were built.&lt;ref name="report kfw" /&gt;

In terms of [[energy conservation]], the energy use in newly retrofitted buildings has decreased from approximately 120 kWh per square meter per annum to 80 kWh/sm/p.a.&lt;ref name="report kfw" /&gt;

==== International opening ====

In 2010, the KfW entered into a partnership with the [[Small Industries Development Bank of India|Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)]], whereby the KfW provided a dedicated credit line of €50 Million to finance energy efficiency projects in micro, small and medium enterprises in India.&lt;ref&gt;IEA (International Energy Agency), 2011, "Joint Public-Private Approaches for Energy Efficiency Finance." PDF available: http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/finance-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to encourage MSMEs (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to undertake energy-saving investments in plant and machinery, and in production processes. KfW has also provided technical assistance to help SIDBI identify key MSME clusters, set up the financing streams, and conduct awareness campaigns.

=== Macroeconomic effects===

A study on the macroeconomic effects of the German government's building rehabilitation programs has been conducted to assess the impact from the investment projects on the public revenue, the housing industry and the climate policy.&lt;ref name="macro effects" /&gt; The analysis focused on short-term effects (the effects taking place in the corresponding year). For the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, the analysis took into account the program cost (the [[opportunity cost]] of providing funds for the KfW promotional programs instead of using them elsewhere), and calculated the revenues from the [[value added tax]] paid by investors, net taxes on products, net taxes on production, [[payroll tax]] and SSC (Social Security Contributions) including solidarity surcharge, [[corporate income tax]], and other income taxes including solidarity surcharge. Because it is not clear whether the additional demand for labour is met through overtime work or through additional jobs, the analysis provides two scenarios; one named “overtime”, where the demand impulse does not create additional jobs, and the second named “jobs”, where the opposite is true. In the latter, the avoided cost of unemployment is added as a revenue.

In any scenario, results clearly show that the public revenue has been positively impacted by the investment projects.

* In 2008, the program cost amounted to €1,293 million. In the scenario “overtime”, the net effect on the public budget (public revenue minus program cost) was €1,478 million. In the scenario “jobs”, the avoided cost of unemployment equals €857 million, and the net effect is thus €2,335 million.
* In 2009, which was the year of the “[[Great Recession]]”, when the KfW programs were used as a means to increase aggregate demand, the program cost amounted to €2,035 million. In the scenario “overtime”, the net effect was €3,326 million, and in the scenario “jobs”, it was €5,937 million. 
* In 2010, the program cost was much lower than in 2009, amounting to €1,366 million. In the scenario “overtime”, the net effect was €3,987 million, and in the scenario “jobs”, it was €5,810 million, quite similar to the year 2009.

The conclusion from this study is three-fold: first, KfW promotional programs result in important energy use and emissions reduction. Not only is this environmentally valuable, it also helps to reduce Germany's import dependence on manufacturing and energy sources. Second, the programs strengthen the demand for labour-intensive activities such as construction services, thereby reducing unemployment. Finally, the net effect of the programs on the public budget is undeniably positive, as a weighing of program costs against induced revenues shows.&lt;ref name="macro effects" /&gt;

== Estonia: KredEx ==

The KredEx scheme was designed based on the German federal bank ([[KfW]]) model, a pioneer in the use of a [[revolving fund]] to finance energy efficient building renovation.

The success of the KredEx scheme relies mainly on the political impetus it was given at the time of its creation. This allowed to raise a considerable amount of funding from the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|EU Structural Funds]], a first in Europe for this type of program.

The political impetus also allowed for the development of a legal framework propitious to the distribution of funds under preferential terms, to widen adoption of the program by end beneficiaries.

Apartment building associations who wish to undertake renovation works must undertake an [[energy audit]] in order to apply for the loan or grant. It is their responsibility to contract construction companies and supervisors for the works (who check that the works respect the terms of the loan).

The proposed loans are advantageous in their longer maturity (up to 20 years), lower interest rates (from 4.3%), and rates fixed for a period of 10 years. Grants are available for those who wish to undertake more comprehensive refurbishment. The combination of grants and loans has proven beneficial: grants motivate project adoption, and long term favourable loans are needed to make the investment accessible. 
Expected energy savings are way above the level that was initially set as a target.

=== Context and creation ===

[[Estonia]] is one of the most attractive country in Eastern Europe in terms of [[Foreign direct investment|FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)]], thanks to a high [[credit rating]] (A), low labour costs, a modern technological infrastructure, and favourable regulatory and tax policies.&lt;ref name="e3g report"&gt;Davies, Susan and Ingrid Holmes. 2011. “European Perspectives on the Challenges of Financing Low Carbon Investment: Estonia,” [[E3G]] Report, September 2011. [http://www.e3g.org/images/uploads/E3G_European_Perspectives_on_the_Challenges_of_Financing_Low_Carbon_Investment_Estonia.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental policy is designed by the Ministry of Environment, whereas energy policy is managed by the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications]].

Under the EU's burden-sharing agreement for reduction of CO2 emissions, Estonia was mandated to reduce [[greenhouse gases]] by 8% over 1990 values between 2008 and 2012. Energy efficiency in buildings is a high priority for the Estonian Government: 60% of housing was built between 1960 and 1990, around 95% is privately owned, and 75% of the population lives in multi-apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Suu, Lauri. 2013. "Financing Housing in Estonia." Presented on November 29, 2013. [http://www.hupfas.hr/Lauri-Suu-financing-housing-in-estonia.pdf]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.kredex.ee/en/ KredEx] was created in 2001 to help Estonian companies develop, raise finance, and expand their exports. Another aim was to support the upgrade and renovation of domestic housing, and its primary focus has gradually shifted to the development of financial products that support retrofit of apartment buildings. It provides various financial products, such as loans and loan guarantees, as well as grants for renovation, efficiency audits and evaluations.&lt;ref name="e3g report"/&gt;

=== Legal status and nature of partnerships ===

KredEx is a state-owned credit and export guarantee fund (not a public bank), created in 2001 by the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications]] as a not-for-profit entity. [[Surety|Sureties]] and guarantees issued by KredEx are fully backed by a state guarantee. It was established as a body governed by private law, operating in the public interest according to State policies.&lt;ref name="e3g report"/&gt;

KredEx works as a [[revolving fund]] that, among other activities, supports financing of energy efficiency projects. It has received loans from the [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] (CEB) to undertake measures aimed at complying with the Council's Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0091|title=EUR-Lex - 32002L0091 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; KredEx also receives funding from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF).

Important other stakeholders in the program include the commercial banks Swedbank and [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken|SEB]], which get favourable funding from KredEx and make loans to apartment building associations. Their main motivation to take part in the program was to get access to more clients, especially at the beginning of the financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy-cities.eu/IMG/pdf/infinite_solutions_estonia.pdf Adler, Mirja. 2013. "The KredEx Revolving Fund." KredEx]&lt;/ref&gt; They have also had very good experiences with financing energy refurbishment of buildings prior to 2009.

KredEx also works in cooperation with some international bodies, in particular other state-owned financial institutions: in 2007, it signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with [[KfW|KfW Bankengruppe]] (Germany), BGK (Poland), and Hipotēku Banka (Latvia), on the structuring and implementation of large financing programmes to promote energy efficiency in housing, for which KfW provided advice.&lt;ref name="e3g report"/&gt;

=== Goals and missions ===

The KredEx scheme aims to motivate apartment building owners to reduce energy consumption and increase the energy efficiency of their homes by providing preferential loans and grants under certain conditions. In 2009, the stated goal was to renovate at least 1,000 buildings within the framework of the following years in order to deem the program successful.&lt;ref name="kredex revolving fund"&gt;[http://www.energy-cities.eu/IMG/pdf/infinite_solutions_estonia.pdf Adler, Mirja. 2013. “The KredEx Revolving Fund,” KredEx]&lt;/ref&gt; The targeted energy savings are of approximately 30% for renovated buildings.&lt;ref name="kredex revolving fund" /&gt;

=== Financial arrangements ===

Since 2003, KredEx has been committed to supporting energy efficiency through loans and grants. Until 2007, KredEx has worked under a simple grant scheme. For energy audits, building designs and technical expertise, up to 50% of the costs are provided in grants; this part of the scheme is still continuing today. For renovation, up to 10% of the costs were provided through grants; through this scheme, KredEx achieved renovation of 3,200 buildings, for an amount of €11 Million.&lt;ref name="e3g report"/&gt; The problems with this approach were insufficient funding, limitation to “single works”, and the fact that grants are only available after payments (building owners had to provide the entirety of up-front costs).

KredEx therefore shifted to a [[revolving fund]] approach, to widen the opportunities for refurbishment of buildings, receive greater financial support from the state, and reduce administration costs.

[[File:The KredEx Revolving Fund.png|thumb|The KredEx Revolving Fund]]

In 2010, Estonia became the first country to channel [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|EU Structural Funds]] into apartment buildings renovation programs:&lt;ref name="e3g report"/&gt;

* The [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] (CEB) provided a loan of €29 Million, at very interesting rates. 
* The [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF) disbursed €17 Million to the fund.

In 2009, the Fund amounted to €49 Million. Progressively, KredEx added up to €10 Million to the Fund from its profits. In 2013, the Estonian State provided a loan of €16 Million to KredEx, and the capital was increased to €72.6 Million.&lt;ref name="kredex revolving fund" /&gt;

The Fund is used to offer preferential loans for building refurbishment, distributed through two commercial banks, [[Swedbank]] and [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken|SEB]] Estonia. The advantages of the loans disbursed through the banks are:&lt;ref name="e3g report"/&gt;

* Longer maturity (20 years instead of an average of 11.8 years)
* Lower interest rates (4.3-4.8% instead of 7-10%)
* Rates fixed for longer periods (10 years instead of 5, or even variable rates)

=== Intervention methods ===

The renovation loan programme was developed by KredEx, together with the [[KfW]] (Germany), and the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renoveerimislaen (Renovation loan for apartment buildings) - Estonia|url=http://www.buildup.eu/links/34842|website=Build Up|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apartment Building Renovation Loans, introduced in 2009, are available for apartment buildings constructed before 1993. Loans cannot be applied for by individual homeowners. Only apartment associations, building associations and communities of apartment owners in buildings with at least 3 apartments are eligible.

The main terms for the loans are as follows:&lt;ref name="adler pres"&gt;Adler, Mirja. 2013. “Estonian experience in financing renovation of apartment buildings,” presented at the Roundtable “Blockhouse renoveerimiskogemus Lithuania and Estonia,” April 3, 2013, Vilnius.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Achievement of energy saving of at least 20% in apartment buildings of 2000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Achievement of energy saving of at least 30% in apartment buildings of over 2000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Loan period of up to 20 years
* Self-financing of at least 15%, can be covered by reconstruction grant
* Minimum loan amount: €6,400 per apartment building, up to 64 EUR/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or the maximum amount according to the apartment building's solvency

Aside from loans, grants are also available to help finance the independent [[energy audit]] (including monitoring after the renovation) and project design documents. It can be used to decrease the share of self-financing, or by apartment buildings constructed after 1993 (which do not belong to the renovation loan target group of KredEx) to be combined with a regular loan. The goal of the grant scheme is to motivate building owners to achieve complete renovation of the buildings, without leaving important energy saving measures aside. The grants are distributed in the amount of 15%, 25% and 35% of the total project cost, depending on the level of energy savings achieved, under the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rekonstrueerimise toetus (Reconstruction grant) - Estonia|url=http://www.buildup.eu/links/35195|website=Build Up|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''15% Grant''

* Fulfill the terms for renovation loan
* Energy saving 20 or 30%, according to the size of the building (see terms of the loans)
* Energy label E, energy consumption below 250 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

''25% Grant''

* Roof, facade, windows, heating system have to be included in the renovations
* Energy saving of at least 40%
* Energy label D, energy consumption below 200 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

''35% Grant''

* Roof, facade, windows, heating system, and heat-recovery ventilation have to be included in the renovations
* Energy saving of at least 50%
* Energy label C, energy consumption below 150 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Implementation and operations ===

Application for the renovation loan has to be made through [[Swedbank]] or [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken|SBE]].

Prior to making the application, building owners must contract an energy auditor themselves, and put together the required documents (energy audit, energy consumption reports, construction bids...) on their own. KredEx thus comes in after the applicants’ process of making the decision to renovate and of forming the project (the budget has to be all set out before the application is made). After a loan and/or grant is approved, it is the building owner's responsibility to find a construction company that will undertake the renovation works, and to contract a supervisor that will make sure loan terms are respected.

=== Business plan and results ===

''Number of renovations'': When the KredEx fund was launched in 2009, the objective was to finance at least 1,000 buildings. By the end of 2013, 798 buildings were renovated. 415 buildings used reconstruction grant and KredEx [[soft loan]], 185 buildings used only KredEx loan, and 198 buildings used only reconstruction grant.

''Average amounts'': The average loan amount in 2011 was €100,000, the average self-financing was 27.9% and the average length of loan period was 15.2 years. In terms of grants, the average amount in 2011 was €26,192.

''Energy savings'': For apartment loans, the average predicted savings achieved with the reconstruction work is 39.3%, way above the initial targets of 20 or 30%. This saving relates to an after-works consumption of 75 GWh per year on average.&lt;ref name="adler pres"/&gt;

== Australia - 1200 Buildings ==

=== Context and creation ===

The City of [[Melbourne]] is one of the most innovative cities in Australia in terms of [[sustainability]], and has been devoted for many years to reducing its [[carbon footprint]].

In 2002, the City published Zero Net Emissions by 2020 - A Roadmap to a Climate Neutral City, setting an ambitious target. The strategy is backed by innovative projects such as 1200 Buildings, launched in 2010, aimed at the energy efficient refurbishment of commercial (non-residential) buildings. As stated by 1200 Buildings’ targets, “''fifty percent of the municipality’s greenhouse gas emissions are generated by the commercial sector. If commercial buildings improve their energy efficiency by approximately 38 percent, 383,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2-e) will be eliminated per year''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About 1200 Buildings|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/Pages/About1200Buildings.aspx|website=1200 Buildings|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1200 Buildings published a survey report in 2013 to assess the evolution of the program and its results, drawing a picture of the rate and type of retrofitting achieved, and listing drivers and perceived barriers to the project. The report indicates successful, encouraging results in terms of the level of retrofit activity.

=== Legal status and nature of partnerships ===

To finance environmental retrofits, which is the key challenge in these initiatives, the City of Melbourne developed an innovative finance mechanism. It required an amendment to the City of Melbourne Act 2001 by the state Government of Victoria, enabling Melbourne to levy a new form of statutory charge, the Environmental Upgrade Finance. This new type of finance allows the City of Melbourne, in partnership with Australian financial institutions, to enter into voluntary environmental upgrade agreements with non-residential building owners to finance retrofitting of the buildings.

Environmental Upgrade Finance is available through the 1200 Buildings program, and is administered through the Sustainable Melbourne Fund on behalf of the City of Melbourne.

=== Goals and missions ===

As stated on the 1200 Buildings program's website, its aims are to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retrofitting is good for business|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/Pages/GoodForBusiness.aspx|website=1200 Buildings - City of Melbourne|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Eliminate 383,000 tonnes of CO2-e per annum – equivalent to 7,660,000,000 “black balloons”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wellsphere.com/green-living-article/understanding-co2-emissions-using-black-balloons/125395|title=http://www.wellsphere.com/green-living-article/understanding-co2-emissions-using-black-balloons/125395|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043816/http://www.wellsphere.com/green-living-article/understanding-co2-emissions-using-black-balloons/125395|archive-date=2014-08-08|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drive $2 billion of private sector reinvestment
* Create 8000 ‘[[green collar]]’ jobs – engineers, environmental and sustainability consultants, builders, surveyors and many other industry professionals
* Stimulate Melbourne's economy during global recession
* Lead the way and demonstrate to the world that large-scale transformation can be achieved

1200 Buildings aims to retrofit about 70% of the commercial office buildings, which represents 1200 of them, whence the name of the program.

=== Financial arrangements ===

Environmental upgrade agreements are the cornerstone of 1200 Building's financial arrangements.&lt;ref name="funding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fund your next retrofit with environmental upgrade finance|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/pages/funding.aspx|website=1200 Buildings - City of Melbourne|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An environmental upgrade agreement is a tripartite contract between a building owner, a bank and the City of Melbourne. When the agreement is established, the lending body (bank) forwards the retrofit loan to the owner. The City of Melbourne then collects the loan repayment through a rates charge (the amount funded is declared by the Melbourne City Council as an environmental upgrade charge), and finally passes it back to the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/BUILDINGANDPLANNING/RATESANDVALUATIONS/Pages/Howyourratesarecalculated.aspx|title=Planning and building services - City of Melbourne|website=www.melbourne.vic.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Council rates and charges take precedence over mortgages as charges against property. This means any debt owing to Council will take priority, thereby greatly reducing the risk for banks.&lt;ref name="funding" /&gt;

Conditions to be met before EUA is applied:

* Notify existing mortgage holder 
* Tenants must opt-in
* Only non-residential buildings

According to 1200 Buildings, the benefits of using EUAs include:&lt;ref name="funding" /&gt;

* Fixed interest rates
* No re-financing required
* A repayment period of 10 years or more
* The loan stays with the property if the owner decides to sell

Owners have the option of sharing the cost with their tenants because Council rates and charges are generally passed through to tenants by the property owner under the terms of a [[net lease]] (the legislation requires that any such arrangement can only be made with the tenants’ consent) → The objective is to overcome the split incentive barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/workshop/overcoming-split-incentive-barrier-building-sector-workshop|title=Energy Efficiency - European Commission|website=iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three environmental upgrade agreements have been signed in Melbourne for projects with a total value of $5.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study - 1200 Buildings Program|url=http://www.c40.org/case_studies/1200-buildings-program|website=C40Cities|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first quarter of 2014 has seen significant changes in EUA legislation. New legislation will allow all councils in South Australia to initiate a Building Upgrade Finance program, similar to the City of Melbourne legislation, whereby the loan is tied to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUA Legislation|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/business/legislation.htm|website=NSW Government|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intervention methods ===

The [[City of Melbourne]] oversees the projects. It mainly uses its website to promote the program, via examples of existing retrofits, lists of “big company” signatories, and case studies.

While the City accompanies building owners in their journey and can provide help at all steps of the project, owners are left on their own to undertake their [[energy audit]], select and hire consultants and contractors, apply for permits... Therefore, planification, implementation, operations, updates and assessment are left to the charge of contractors, through tenders managed by the building owners themselves. Consultants and contractors can be architects, builders, commissioning agents, electrical engineers, energy auditors, energy performance contractors, environmentally sustainable design consultants, fire engineers, hydraulic engineers, installation contractors, mechanical engineers, and project managers.

The Energy Efficiency Council (EEC) is a body designed to help companies undertake energy efficiency measures, providing a platform for energy efficiency and [[cogeneration]] products and services, and is thus used by commercial building owners to find consultants and contractors. The Council was formed in 2009, and incorporates the members and activities of the Australasian Energy Performance Contracting Alliance (AEPCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.eec.org.au/about%20us|website=Energy Efficiency Council|accessdate=18 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628023448/http://eec.org.au/about%20us|archivedate=28 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation and operations ===

Once a commercial building owner is convinced to undertake retrofitting, the first step is for him to become a “signatory” of the project, by sending the Lord Mayor a signed copy of the “1200 Buildings Letter of commitment”. The owner then selects a model for implementing its project:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project managing your retrofit|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/what/Pages/ProjectManaging.aspx|website=City of Melbourne - 1200 Buildings|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Energy Performance Contracting (EPC)'': an [[energy services company]] (ESCo) is hired to improve the energy efficiency of the building. A contract is signed between the building owner and the selected company, stating the level of energy savings guaranteed by the ESCo, the fee structure of the project and the duration of the project (a typical energy performance contract is four to ten years). The ESCo is paid from the guaranteed savings for the term of the contract. If the energy savings are not achieved, the ESCo is not paid. Once the work is completed and the contract has ended, the full savings are reverted to the owner. The energy services company acts as a project manager and is responsible for hiring, managing and paying the third parties required to carry out the works, meaning the building owner deals directly with one party rather than several. Once the works are finished, the building is monitored for the remainder of the EPC period and energy savings are verified and reported to all parties. The party that carries out the monitoring and verification should be nominated in the EPC. Monitoring and verification is usually carried out by the ESCo, though an independent third party can be used instead.
* ''Integrated Design'': the building owner appoints a designer, who inspects the building and designs the changes to it, and selects a number of suitably qualified parties (building and installation contractors), who carry out the work under the supervision of a project manager. All parties are involved at the design stage. After a process of exchanging ideas among the different parties,the building owner signs a contract with the design consultant, agreeing to a schedule of works. Once the works are finished, a commissioning agent commissions and “fine tunes” the building systems to ensure they are working correctly. When the project is complete and the building back in use, ongoing maintenance is performed either by the installation contractor, the building's facility manager or a third party to ensure the design intent is realized. 
* ''Design and construct'': this model is similar to the integrated design model, except that design, installation and construction are all performed by the same party (installation contractors).

=== Business plan and results ===

According to the Melbourne Retrofit Survey 2013, between 2008 and 2013, 25% of Melbourne's commercial buildings had retrofitted or were currently undertaking a retrofit, indicating an acceleration of retrofit activity compared to 21% between 2006 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/Resources/Documents/1200_Buildings_Report_FA_LR_Dec2013.pdf|title=1200 Buildings - City of Melbourne|website=www.melbourne.vic.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 16% of the buildings surveyed claimed they were intending to undertake a retrofit within the next five years, a significant increase from the 10% in 2011. Most of the retrofits recently undertaken were self-funded (81%), and only 1% had used Environmental Upgrade Finance. 40% of owners surveyed declared they were “not at all interested” in Environmental Upgrade Finance. These numbers indicate a certain lack of interest in 1200 Buildings’ financing mechanism, possibly caused by a lack of awareness or understanding of its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;1200 Buildings - Melbourne Retrofit Survey 2013, Melbourne City Council, 2013. PDF available: https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/Resources/Documents/1200_Buildings_Report_FA_LR_Dec2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the 1200 Buildings program counts 53 signatories to date, including “big name” corporations such as ING, Asia Pacific Group, Hilton, and Stockland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Signatories|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/1200buildings/CurrentSignatories/Pages/CurrentSignatories.aspx|website=City of Melbourne - 1200 Buildings|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four buildings have used Environmental Upgrade Agreements to access finance to retrofit, representing $5.6 million of investment and aiming to save 5660 tonnes carbon emissions and $491,000 in energy costs per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne: Sustainable Buildings Program|url=http://cityclimateleadershipawards.com/melbourne-sustainable-buildings-program/|website=City Climate Leadership Awards|accessdate=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725180025/http://cityclimateleadershipawards.com/melbourne-sustainable-buildings-program/#|archive-date=2014-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the [[Clean Energy Finance Corporation]] (CEFC) announced it will provide finance of up to $30 million for EUAs, bringing the total to a joint amount of $80 million allocated for EUAs.&lt;ref&gt;"CEFC finance for commercial property energy productivity improvements", Clean Energy Finance Corporation, 28 March 2014.

== Belgium - Marshall Plan 2.Green ==

The Marshall Plan 2.Green was first developed and experimented in [[Wallonia]], before being applied to the [[Brussels]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investinwallonia.be/why-wallonia/economie-et-plan-marshall/?lang=en|title=The Marshall Plan 2.Green for  Wallonia's economy {{!}} Invest in wallonia|last=Bleu|first=Globule|website=www.investinwallonia.be|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Context and Creation ===

==== The Marshall Plan 2.Green ====

In August 2005, the [[Walloon Government]] adopted priority actions for the Walloon future: the ''Marshall Plan'', gathering €1.2 billion.&lt;ref name="evaluation 2014"&gt;"Evaluation du Plan Marshall 2.Vert," Institut wallon de l'évaluation, de la prospective, et de la statistique, Mars 2014. PDF available: [http://www.iweps.be/sites/default/files/pm2.v_-_rapport_evaluation_globale.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808184713/http://www.iweps.be/sites/default/files/pm2.v_-_rapport_evaluation_globale.pdf# |date=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After promising results, the [[Walloon Government]] renewed the initiative in 2009 through a “Marshall Plan 2.Green”. The plan organizes around 6 pillars (human capital valorization, company network creation, scientific research support, quality jobs and activities creation, '''employment-environment alliances''', social employment and well-being) and cross-cutting dynamics.&lt;ref name="texte 2010"&gt;[http://www.wallonie.be « Plan Marshall 2.vert », Texte intégral, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marshall Plan 2.Green gathers a total of €1.6 billion of conventional credit, to which €1.15 billion of alternative financing have been added. That is, almost €3 billion for the 2010-2014 time frame.&lt;ref&gt;"PM2.vert : 6 axes, 2 dynamiques transversales et des résultats enregistrés!". Gouvernement wallon. Consulté le 21 Juillet 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Employment-Environment Alliances (EEA) ====

The 5th pillar of the Marshall Plan 2.Green, Employment-Environment Alliances, focuses on the sustainable aspect of the development plan. Its objective, set in 2009, is to “''support a new economic development model, sustainable and solidary, via employment-environment alliances constituting an opportunity in terms of employment, economic development, and environmental challenges. Positioning Wallonia as a sustainable development leader at the European and international levels, by developing a regarded expertise, while creating domestic employment.''”&lt;ref name="texte 2010" /&gt;

The EEA is notably the first alliance with a “[[green construction]]” aspect. The Walloon housing sector is highly inefficient: nearly 44% of housing is badly isolated, and average energy consumption is 72% above the European average.&lt;ref name="bilan 2014"&gt;Alliance Emploi-Environnement, « 1ère Alliance Emploi-Environnement : Le bilan », 2014. PDF available : http://www.nollet.info/images/upload/doc/bilan_AEE.pdf{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first measure aims at developing a multi-year plan for energy savings and sustainable construction, and a multi-sectorial contract. The objective is to “concentrate on the potential of energetic and environmental improvements of buildings to generate employment, create economic opportunities, increase training notably in sustainable construction jobs.”&lt;ref name="texte 2010" /&gt;

=== Legal Status and Partnerships ===

Various public and private decision makers, as well as concerned social partners and field actors are involved in the EEA. The Ministry of Sustainable Development is entrusted with EEA coordination. In February 2012, 41 multi-sectorial contracts have been signed with partners for the first Employment-Environment Alliance. Federations of construction companies, public interest and services organizations, unions, training operators, as well as groups and associations involved in sustainable development and construction participated in this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction : Alliance emploi-environnement|url=http://www.wallonie.be/fr/actualites/construction-alliance-emploi-environnement|website=Portail de la Wallonie|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3 commitments of the multi-sectorial contracts signatory:

* The actor is associated as a partner in the implementation of the first EEA
* The actor states its adhesion to the 1st EEA's objectives
* The actor commits to contributing in the implementation of actions defined in the multi-sectorial contract

=== Goals and Missions ===

The first EEA's principal objective is to “''concentrate on the potential of energetic and environmental improvements of buildings to generate employment, create economic opportunities, increase training notably in sustainable construction jobs.''”&lt;ref name="texte 2010" /&gt; To do so, four dimensions are considered:

* Launch an energy savings multi-annual plan, setting quantitative objectives and norms in terms of [[energy conservation]] (starting with isolation) and environmental improvement, to renovate existing buildings. This plan is put in place through a multi-sectorial contract (through consultation, coordination, control structures and certification organizations, and cross-cutting studies).
* Create optimal conditions for the development of a quality offer, by developing innovation through research and project financing in the [[green construction]] sector, and by implementing trainings for the EEA jobs. 
* Reinforce the attractiveness of sustainable investments in the housing field, by intervening among both households (energy and housing bonuses, third-party investor system, communication strategy) and the public sector (pursuit of the plan to renovate the housing stock through a [[cadastre]], development of collective heating in public housing, implementation of a global strategy for energy management in regional and local buildings, realization of pilot projects in the public housing sector).
* Reinforce sectorial policies et actions in terms of research, economy, employment and training in other “[[green jobs]]”.&lt;ref name="texte 2010" /&gt;

The multi-annual plan comprises around 50 measures declined around 3 specific objectives:&lt;ref name="bilan 2014" /&gt;

* Stimulation of private demand for sustainable renovation or construction
* Stimulation of public demand for sustainable renovation or construction
* Consolidation of the offer and of the construction sector capacities, to allow it to answer in a suitable way to this public and private demand reinforcement

=== Intervention Methods ===

In order to reinforce the attractiveness of sustainable investments in the housing sector, the EEA action plan focuses on:&lt;ref name="bilan 2014" /&gt;

#On the demand side:

* Implementation of financial and non financial incentives, with particular attention given to low income people
* Implementation of a public investment policy
* Setting progressive environment performance requirements

# On the offer side:

* Help to companies
* Promotion of [[Research and Development]] in companies
* Implementation of financial incentives and tools for companies
* Progressive stages of [[energy performance]] requirements

# At the intersection of supply and demand:

* Various audiences targeted by “green trainings” (jobseekers, students/young people, workers, trainers)
* Training devices adapted to these different audiences

==== Development of a public-household partnership (PHP) ====

The partnership articulates around the implementation of a “one-stop shop” and of EEA contact points that accompany households all along their renovation project. The PHP aims at stimulating demand for private housing renovation through a reform of the energy and housing bonuses, the availability of attractive financing and of complementary incentives.

===== Implementation of a "one-stop shop" =====

This measure aims at correctly informing and accompanying Walloon citizens in the whole of their renovation project. The “one-stop shops” accompany the individuals all along their administrative proceedings, centralizing the information and formalities for greater efficiency and visibility.&lt;ref name="plan pluriannuel"&gt;« Première Alliance Emploi-Environnement - Plan pluriannuel. » Plan Marshall 2.vert Wallonie. 1er Janvier 2014. PDF available : http://www.wallonie.be/sites/wallonie/files/pages/fichiers/brochure_aee_ld_soc_gd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Its missions:

* Realizing a succinct diagnostic of the dwelling unit
* Establishing a building “passport”
* Helping with the operation's financial and administrative arrangements
* Accompanying all along the works

===== Building "Passport" =====

The building passport includes information relative to the EU [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings]] and to the Energy Advice Procedure (EAP), and takes into account other dimensions such as material use, location, and wholesomeness. This building passport aims to become a unique database integrating all dimensions linked to renovation, including EAPs and works recommendations.

Energy Performance Certificates are classified according to the address of the house, instead of the individual's identity. This allows for a house's new owner to know the history of proceedings and diagnostics already performed on his property. The certificate is valid for 10 years, providing that no modifications are made on the energy equipment. Its realization is carried out by an approved certifier who, after examining the building, has to mention various informations:&lt;ref&gt;"Certificat de performance énergétique Wallonie : obligation pour les vendeurs et les bailleurs." Certificat-energetique.net. PDF available : http://www.certificat-energetique.net/blog/certificat-de-performance-energetique-wallonie/&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Energy consumption]]
* Ecological impact ([[CO2 emissions]])
* Efficiency of the [[building envelope]], heating systems and other sources of energy (walls, roof, floors...) 
* Ventilation
* [[Renewable energies]]
* Recommendations for eventual improvements

===== Establishment of "EEA Advisors" =====

The one-stop shop system includes a pool of “EEA Advisors” inside the contact points. These advisors work hand in hand with the teams established in the contact points and are in charge of instructing financial arrangement files and of establishing the building “passport”.&lt;ref name="plan pluriannuel" /&gt;

In total, around 250 EEA Advisors are scattered over the entire Walloon territory (one advisor for 5 000 houses). The intention is to reach an audience that does not come to the information counter by itself, and so to take them by the hand from the beginning. To do so, the government launches calls for collective projects by neighbourhood, destined to the associative and communal services. In exchange for subventions for operations and after fixing quantitative objectives, these organizations are tasked with the proximity work in a neighbourhood (door to door solicitation, information meetings with an EEA Advisor...).&lt;ref name="plan pluriannuel" /&gt;

===== Provision of attractive financing ("Ecopack")&lt;ref name="bilan 2014" /&gt; =====

Before the creation of the EEA, numerous financial incentives for the residential sector existed, but were often dissociated, granted by different administrations and sometimes incoherent (e.g. isolation bonus granted by the Energy Department, and woodwork renovation bonus granted by the Housing Department).

Within the EEA, Walloon households can benefit from an “''Ecopack''”: a type of financing that covers 100% of the renovation cost, constituted by existing bonuses (energy and housing) put together, and by a 0% loan for the part that is not covered by bonuses. The two bonuses are unified and disbursed at once, with a possibility to pre-finance, based on a thorough quotation (i.e. the financing is disbursed as soon as the works are accepted, rather than at the end of the renovation, allowing the household to avoid financing the payments to the contractor during the works).

Depending on the applicant's income, a rate is applied to the bonuses (from +10% for high incomes to +40% for low incomes). The repayment duration of the 0% loan is lengthened for the lowest income categories: from 5 years for high incomes to 12 years for low incomes. The 10% highest income households cannot benefit from the Ecopack.

This mechanism is operational since March 2012, and is met with great success (especially as the federal tax credit has disappeared).

The 0% loans component is funded by a regional budget system of recoverable advances, made available to households by the structures tasked with implementing and managing the mechanism. The bonuses component of the system is funded by conventional budget allocations dedicated to the “energy” and “housing” bonuses. The system falls within a global budget envelope aimed at maintaining the volume of 0% loans at €150 million.

The Ecopack is granted by the FLW (Walloon Housing Fund) for large families and by the SWCS (Walloon Social Credit Company) for the rest of households. Beneficiary households repay their 0% loan directly to the structures tasked with implementing the mechanism, which then repay the recoverable advances granted by the Walloon Region. The resources from the repayments are distributed by Wallonia to a budgetary fund. The funds can then be reallocated ([[revolving fund]]), in the form of new recoverable advances, to the managing structures, so that they can grant new 0% loans to households, while respecting the €150 million limit.&lt;ref name="bilan 2014" /&gt;

===== Financed works and conditions =====

The necessary condition to access financing is to undertake at least two types of different renovation works, for an investment above €2,500, following a “sustainable bunch” logic. The objective of the EEA is to entice households to undertake a more ambitious project instead of settling for punctual renovation, and so provoke a greater marginal effect on the energetic quality of their house.

An eligible “bunch” is composed of at least two types of sustainable renovation works, with at least one of “energetic performance” type.

The “energetic performance” type works are the following:

* Thermic isolation of the roof, walls, and floors
* Replacing the windows or window frames
* Installation of a ventilation system
* Installation of a condensing boiler with natural gas or oil
* Installation of a heat pump
* Installation of a biomass boiler
* Connection to a heat network

Other accepted works in the “bunch” are:

* Induced works: replacement, refection, stabilization or treatment of the roof, placing an exterior facing, inner lining of a wall, replacing the floors, wall drying, casing a fireplace.
* Small energy saving works: thermostat or thermostatic valve, closing the protected volume, isolating the heating pipes, energy audit. 
* Works for the production of renewable energy: photovoltaic panels, installation of solar collectors for domestic hot water and/or heating, micro-generation.

The priority ranking of the works is established with the household, on an ad hoc basis, by the EEA advisor on the basis of elements provided by the applicant, and if the household desires, on the basis of a site visit or of an eventual EAP audit. The EEA advisor makes an analysis note of the bunch request and gives an opinion, which will be used by the Back Office in its financing request study.

In the “energetic performance” type works, the roof thermic isolation has priority. If, in his analysis, the EEA advisor estimates that this work is necessary, this priority shall be considered for certain low-income categories as an entire bunch.

EEA financing is capped at a maximum of €30,000 per works bunch. A maximum of two bunches per house on a 3 years period is eligible for EEA financing, i.e. a maximum cap of €60,000/house/3 years period.

==== Reinforce the construction sector capacities for buildings renovation ====

===== Implementation of a "green training" integrated plan =====

Within the development of a quality offer, training for EEA jobs, in particular for the first Alliance, is a particularly important issue, because it determines the firms’ capacity to employ adequate personnel, and opens insertion opportunities to job seekers and professional progression opportunities to workers. The two privileged formation axes are continuous training, and on the middle term, initial training.

===== Elaboration and implementation of a quality label for firms: NRQual =====

The objective is for Wallonia to have a label that allows to guarantee the quality of the works to clients, and to identify professionals from a qualitative point of view.

The label is used as a quality reference for the public, and, at some point, as a reference for financial incentives.

===== Training in the green construction industry =====

In order to reinforce and improve the offer, 80 accompanying jobs have been created in 2012 to help companies formulate their transition strategies towards [[green construction]] and allow for time to implement them. Specific help for firms has been put in place via roundtables on EEA jobs, contractor clubs and awareness and vulgarization campaigns.

Trainings are organized for various audiences. The objective is to integrate new competences linked to [[green jobs]] in training repositories, teaching programs, and trainers' training.

==== Stimulate renovation demand/public buildings construction ====

Beyond renovation of the private housing stock, a number of measures in the EEA target public buildings:&lt;ref&gt;"Plan pluriannuel de la 1ère Alliance Emploi-Environnement - Seconde lecture." Plan Marshall 2.vert, Wallonie. PDF available: http://www.ufenm.be/IMG/pdf/Plan_AEE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support public markets:
# Pursue the integration of social and environmental clauses in public organizations’ [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] for construction and renovation;
# Define help tools for public actors.
* Implement a large plan for renovation of the public housing stock;
* Realize pilot projects in public housing;
* Accelerate creation and renovation procedures for public housing;
* Develop collective heating in the public housing sector;
* Implement a subventions device aimed at supporting public law persons and non-commercial organisms that want to reduce their building's energy consumption.

=== Implementation/Operations ===

==== Management ====

EEA coordination is managed by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Public Service, Energy, Housing and Research. A coordination cell mandated with the implementation of the multi-annual plan and multi-sectorial contracts is part of the administration services. Its mission is to elaborate evaluation and impact indicators of the EEA. The cell is under direct authority of the Minister mandated with EEA coordination, who organizes implementation and works.

The ministers have a decisional power on all measures of the multi-annual plan. The majority of the executive power (27 measures) is delegated to Walloon public actors, and the rest is scattered between extra-regional public actors, private sector companies federations, other private sector actors, associative sector actors, clusters, and training centres. Administrative or budgetary management is entirely in the hands of Walloon public actors.&lt;ref name="plan pluriannuel" /&gt;

==== Follow-up and evaluation ====

In the framework of the Marshall Plan 2.Green evaluation, thematic evaluations have been carried out during realization of the Plan, and a global evaluation at the end of programming, by the IWEPS (Walloon Institute for Evaluation, Prospective and Statistics).&lt;ref name="evaluation 2014" /&gt;

Steering for the implementation of the “[[Green construction]]” axis of the Alliance is carried out by a mixed follow-up committee, presided by a representative of the minister mandated with EEA coordination and composed of representatives of ministers of the Kern (i.e. restricted Council of Ministers), of the administration, unions, and construction sectors.

=== EEA Financing ===

Each axis of the Marshall Plan 2.Green has a specific budget. The budgetary envelope is closed and the budgetary means shall be allocated exclusively to public policies part of the plan, except in case of a decision made by the Walloon executive.

A budget made of €1.6 billion of ordinary credits and €1.15 billion of alternative financing is devoted to the implementation of the measures, for the whole 2010-2014 period. The annual MP2.Green financing represents 4.2% of the Walloon region budget.

The financing source of the different measures depends on their nature:

* Ordinary financing allows the Walloon region to manage its current expenditures
* The alternative financing mechanism is activated to finance investments (real estate, public equipment, sanitation, or rehabilitation of disused sites of economic activity) amortized on a minimum of 20 years. Alternative financing is refinanced by loans contracted by third party institutions whose interest charges and investment amortization appear each year. The use of alternative financing is a classical debudgetisation process allowing the executive power to undertake public investments (infrastructure, housing, economic activity zones arrangement, sanitation of polluted sites...) whose charge is spread over a minimum of 20 years. Alternative financing is mobilized through Walloon financial instruments (SOWAFINAL, CRAC and SWL).

The new policies of the Plan that target the development of sustainable investments in the housing sector and the increase in welcoming structures are largely financed by alternative credit (70%).

In 2009, the total EEA budget was of €279,6 million of ordinary financing and €600 million of alternative financing, i.e. a planned total of €880 million over the Plan's duration.&lt;ref name="evaluation 2014" /&gt;

===== Affected public =====

Various awareness actions, other than direct help, have occurred towards owners, tenants, companies and merchants, with a total of 870,000 persons sensitized in one way or another over the legislation duration.

===== Jobs =====

Through jobs creation, EEA measures benefited 420,000 employees and 15,600 employers over the legislation. €1 million invested in the sector allows to create or maintain 10 jobs for 1 year. On average in a year, 4,700 jobs are linked to the EEA over the 2010-2014 period.

This kind of policy brings about an important return effect (on the middle and long term) that benefits federal, regional and local public finances: [[value added tax]] revenues, [[corporation tax]], tax on individuals, communal additions to the tax on individuals, Social Security National Office contributions, reduction of unemployment benefits, etc. This return effect is estimated at 40% of the direct public investment.

===== Environment =====

The energy administration detains estimations concerning the avoided CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. They are based on the savings in terms of MWh.

The EEA measures put in place during the legislature allowed to save 590,000 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 2014. This corresponds to an annual consumption of 50,000 households.

Adding the tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saved during the legislature, we get to a cumulative total of over 1.5 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===== Purchasing power =====

From the calculation of saved MWh, the realized financial savings have been estimated at €215 million in 2014, and €556 million over the duration of the legislature.

A study taking into account the amount of financed works, the impact on energy saving, and the lifetime of installations, estimated that in terms of purchasing power, the investment in housing isolation and performance allows households to realize economy savings of €2.5 billion over the lifetime of the equipment.

In 2010, the [[Brussels]] government decided to adopt a strategy similar to that of Wallonia, by setting up an Employment-Environment Alliance.

The first employment-environment alliance was defined around 4 axis:

* Axis 1: [[Green construction]]
* Axis 2: Water
* Axis 3: Resources and waste
* Axis 4: Sustainable supply of food

The objective of the “Green construction” axis is to “''stimulate and accompany the Brussels actors in the construction sector so that they develop a competitive offer in terms of green construction and renovation.''”

===== Partnerships =====

The Agreement on the Sustainable Construction Axis gathered 50 private and public signatories. The process involves 130 organizations (52% public and 48% private). The actors in question elaborated 44 concrete actions aimed at answering challenges of teaching, training, insertion, technical references, research, support to companies, financing, labels... After the elaboration phase, the concrete engagements have been approved by the government, and the actors signed the Agreement text on February 25, 2011.

The EEA multiannual plan engages 44 partners who signed the multi-sectorial contracts.

===== Objectives =====

The current actions and policies of the EEA provide for the creation of 10,100 jobs until 2020, with in particular 4,300 jobs in sustainable construction.

===== Results =====

* 12,200 sq m of sustainable construction training centers have been established
* 184,000 hours of training between 2011 and 2013
* 1,800 companies (among which some in social economy) or independents sensitized, accompanied, supported or involved in the transition towards sustainable construction
* 15 training operators committed
* 26 schools part of at least one EEA action, i.e. almost the whole of Brussels schools concerned
* 155 teaching professors and trainers trained or involved in actions, i.e. more than half of teachers and workshop leaders from “construction” teaching sections
* 1,915 young people involved in the Alliance, including indirectly 1,600 young people at the stage of initial sustainable construction training, i.e. half of student promotions of 2012-2012 and 2013-2014
* 800 job seekers trained
* 100 public executives informed about new social and environmental clauses to be introduced in specifications
* 59 research laboratories and 92 research projects recorded in the sustainable construction field

Within a follow-up committee, social partners involved in steering the sustainable construction axis identified three major contributions from the project:

* The process allowed for the encounter of various actors and ended up in a real collective dynamic that concretized in the development and reinforcement of collaborations and partnerships between the different types of actors.
* The [[Top-down and bottom-up design|“bottom-up” approach]] allowed to direct public means towards the answers to the needs of companies and of the sector's workers.
* The animation method allowed to increase the responsibility of involved actors on the implementation of the actions: regular organization of follow-up workshops and of meetings between actors fosters efficiency and relevance of actions, as well as the actors being well informed about the evolution of actions.

== United Kingdom - The Green Deal ==

{{main|The Green Deal}}

=== Context and Creation ===

The major idea underlying the Green Deal is the “pay as you save” principle, whereby a homeowner gets renovation works performed by a contractor, and then pays the costs according to the amount saved on its energy bill. Pilot programs took place from the 2008 up until mid-2011. When the ''Pay As You Save'' (PAYS) pilot ended, the government implemented the “''[[Green Deal]]''”, introducing various new measures: the “Golden Rule” (whereby repayments must not exceed energy savings), financing linked to the energy bill, obligation for the energy suppliers to adapt their billing system to collect repayments, and introduction of the “Energy Company Obligation” (ECO).

The first Green Deal policy was outlined in 2010 by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The amount of the loans would be of up to £6,500.&lt;ref name="ECEEE"&gt;Guertler, Pedro, David Robson and Sarah Royston. 2013. “Somewhere between a ‘Comedy of Errors’ and ‘As you like it’? A brief history of Britain’s ‘Green Deal’ so far.” ECEEE Summer Study Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of setbacks, a renewed Green Deal was launched on 28 January 2013, with mixed results.

At the time of creation, the Green Deal was praised as “revolutionary,” its initiators setting very high targets. The government expected that 14 million homes could benefit from it until 2020, that investments could reach £10 billion, and that 65,000 jobs could be created. However, in 2012, numbers in take-up rates were greatly disappointing, making the Green Deal look like it was “''doomed to fail''.”&lt;ref name="ECEEE" /&gt; The Green Deal principle relied on take-up by the market, which was greatly criticized for having “''never worked anywhere in the world […] and unlikely to happen in the UK.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=‘Green Deal’ Will Fail, Government’s Climate Advisers Warn.|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/20/green-deal-fail |website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2014|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the Government considered obliging householders who are undertaking home improvements to spend an extra 10% of the cost on energy efficiency measures. The media portrayed it as a “conservatory tax” robbing householders and making any building project overly expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lean |first1=G. |title=The Green Deal Feels the Heat. |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/businessand-ecology/energyefficiency/9202836/The-Green-Deal-feels-the-heat.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |agency=The Telegraph |date=13 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ministers thus decided to abandon the idea.

A new impetus given at the beginning of 2013 allowed the government to rescue the project. In July 2014, the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|DECC]] closed applications for the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund. The £120 million fund has been depleted by “overwhelming public demand”, triggering furious reactions by the sector, and displaying another setback for the Green Deal (but also promising take-up results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Peter|title=DECC Closes Green Deal Home Improvement Fund with immediate effect.|url=http://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/news/decc_closes_green_deal_home_improvement_fund_with_immediate_effect_2356|accessdate=30 July 2014|agency=Solar Power Portal|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 3,234 households had Green Deal plans in progress at the end of June 2014, 15% more than the 2,828 at the end of May, and more than double the 1,500 at the end of November 2013. Nearly half of all plans were completed (all measures installed).

The [[global surveillance disclosure]] released to media by [[Edward Snowden]] has caused tension in the [[bilateral relations]] of the [[United States]] with several of its allies and economic partners as well as in its relationship with the [[European Union]]. In August 2013, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] announced the creation of "a review group on intelligence and communications technologies" that would brief and later report to him.&lt;ref name="MacAskill"&gt;{{cite news|last=MacAskill|first=Ewen|title=White House insists James Clapper will not lead NSA surveillance review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/13/white-house-james-clapper-nsa-surveillance-review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using "[[backdoor (computing)|backdoors]]" in hardware or software.&lt;ref name=reviewpanel&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|title=Obama panel recommends new limits on N.S.A. spying|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/report-on-nsa-surveillance-tactics.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 18, 2013|author2=Savage, Charlie}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey R. Stone]], a White House panel member, said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any [[terror attacks]].&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/19/21975158-nsa-program-stopped-no-terror-attacks-says-white-house-panel-member?lite |title=NSA program stopped no terror attacks, says White House panel member – Investigations |publisher=NBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[general (United States)|General]] [[Keith B. Alexander]], then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, "These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security." He added that "the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks."&lt;ref name="nsaalexander1"/&gt;

In June 2014, Alexander's recently installed successor as the NSA's director, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Michael S. Rogers]], said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done overall did not lead him to conclude that "the sky is falling." Conceding there was no absolute protection against leaks by a dedicated insider with access to the agency's networks, Rogers said the NSA must nevertheless "ensure that the volume" of data taken by Snowden "can't be stolen again."&lt;ref name=SkyNotFalling&gt;Sanger, David E. (June 29, 2014) [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/us/sky-isnt-falling-after-snowden-nsa-chief-says.html New N.S.A. Chief Calls Damage From Snowden Leaks Manageable].

[[File:Ron Wyden and James Clapper - 6 June 2013.webm|thumb|Excerpt of James Clapper's testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]

On June 21, 2013, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R. Clapper]] issued an apology for giving erroneous testimony under oath to the [[United States Congress]]. Earlier in March that year, Clapper was asked by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ron Wyden]] to clarify the alleged surveillance of U.S. citizens by the NSA:

{{quotation |[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ron Wyden|Wyden]]: '''"Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"'''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[Director of National Intelligence|Director]] [[James R.

In an interview shortly after Snowden's disclosures were first published, Clapper stated that he had misunderstood Wyden's question and answered in what he thought was the "least untruthful manner".&lt;ref name="ClapperNBCInterview"&gt;[http://www.nbcuni.com/corporate/newsroom/nbc-news-exclusive-transcript-of-andrea-mitchells-interview-with-director-of-national-intelligence-james-clapper/ NBC News Exclusive Transcript of Andrea Mitchell's Interview with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, June 9, 2013]. Retrieved July 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in his letter of apology, Clapper wrote that he had only focused on Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] during his testimony to Congress, and therefore, he "simply didn't think" about Section 215 of the [[Patriot Act]], which justifies the mass collection of telephone data from U.S. citizens. Clapper said: "My response was clearly erroneous—for which I apologize".&lt;ref name="dni"&gt;{{cite web|title=DNI Clapper Letter on Misunderstandings Arising from his March 12th Appearance Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|url=http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/2013-06-21%20DNI%20Ltr%20to%20Sen.%20Feinstein.pdf|publisher=[[Director of National Intelligence]]|accessdate=July 9, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I9BnJX1H|archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase transparency and because it is in the public interest the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of the following documents pertaining to the collection of telephone metadata pursuant to [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA|Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act]] on July 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Shawn|title=DNI Clapper Declassifies and Releases Telephone Metadata Collection Documents|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/908-dni-clapper-declassifies-and-releases-telephone-metadata-collection-documents|publisher=Director of Public Affairs Office of the Director of National Intelligence|accessdate=August 17, 2013|date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were:

; Press censorship
In June 2013, British government officials issued a confidential [[DA-Notice]] to several press organizations, with the aim of restricting their ability to report on these leaks.&lt;ref name="danotice2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=MoD serves news outlets with D notice over surveillance leaks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/defence-d-bbc-media-censor-surveillance-security|work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013|location=London|date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the [[United States Army]] barred its personnel from access to parts of the website of ''[[The Guardian]]'' after that site's publication of Snowden's leaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montereyherald.com/local/ci_23554739/restricted-web-access-guardian-is-army-wide-officials "Restricted Web access to the Guardian is Armywide, say officials"], Philipp Molnar, ''Monterey Herald'', June 27, 2013.

According to a survey undertaken by the human rights group [[PEN International]], these disclosures have had a [[chilling effect]] on American writers. Fearing the risk of being targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have [[self-censorship|self-censored]] themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings.&lt;ref name="penc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Matt Sledge|title=NSA 'Chilling' Effect Feared By Writers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/13/nsa-writers_n_4267716.html|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=November 14, 2013|date=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PEN American Center Report Shows Impact of NSA Surveillance on American Writers|url=http://www.pen.org/press-release/2013/11/13/pen-american-center-report-shows-impact-nsa-surveillance-american-writers|publisher=[[PEN American Center]]|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Destruction of evidence

''The Guardian'' editor [[Alan Rusbridger]] said the newspaper had received legal threats from the British government and was urged to surrender all documents leaked by Snowden.

;Comments
On August 18, 2013, [[Amnesty International]] asserted that if journalists maintain their independence and report critically about governments, they too may be "targeted" by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK: Detention of Guardian journalist's partner at Heathrow unlawful and unwarranted|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/uk-detention-guardian-employee-heathrow-unlawful-and-unwarranted-2013-08-18|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2013, [[Index on Censorship]] argued that the British government's "threat of legal action" against ''The Guardian'' was a "direct attack on press freedom in the UK".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forcing The Guardian to destroy materials is a direct attack on press freedom|url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/08/forcing-the-guardian-to-destroy-materials-is-a-direct-attack-on-press-freedom/|publisher=[[Index on Censorship]]|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on trade ===

In March 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that revelations of NSA spying had cost U.S. tech companies, including [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]], over $1 billion. A senior analyst at the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] said it was "clear to every single tech company that this is affecting their bottom line," and predicted that the U.S. cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. [[Forrester Research]], an independent technology and market research company, said losses could be as high as $180 billion, or 25 percent of industry revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|title=Revelations of N.S.A.

=== Allegations of adverse consequences for US and UK security ===
U.S. Army General Keith Alexander, then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, "These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security." He added that "the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks."&lt;ref name="nsaalexander1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roulo|first=Claudette|title=Leaks Damage National Security, NSA Director Says|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=120387|publisher=American Forces Press Service|accessdate=July 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/OS678|archivedate=December 16, 2013}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6I9BwalAH Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Martin Dempsey]] said that Snowden "has caused us some considerable damage to our intelligence architecture. Our adversaries are changing the way that they communicate."&lt;ref name="ThisWeek"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/joint-chiefs-chairman-gen-martin-dempsey-week-19865953. |title=Transcript for Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

In October, former GCHQ director Sir [[David Omand]], speaking of how useful for [[Russian Intelligence Community|Russia's intelligence services]] Snowden's stay in Russia could be, told the BBC: "Part of me says that not even the [[KGB]] in its heyday of [[Kim Philby|Philby]], [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Maclean]] in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents."&lt;ref name="Omand"&gt;{{cite news |last= Corera|first=Gordon|title=Edward Snowden revelations: Can we trust the spying state? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24399213|date=October 4, 2013 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden stated that he had not leaked any documents to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/edward-snowden-russia_n_3573844.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Michael | last=Calderone | title=Snowden Refutes Anonymous Media Claims About Him | date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in October, [[Andrew Parker (MI5 officer)|Andrew Parker]], director general of the UK [[MI5|Security Service]], maintained that the exposing of intelligence techniques had given extremists the ability to evade the intelligence agencies; he said, "It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques.

That same month, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' editorialized that security chiefs were "right to be alarmed, knowing that terrorists can change their modus operandi in response to new information on their capabilities" and there was "no firm evidence that the intelligence agencies are using these new collection capabilities for malign ends."&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web |title= The security threat posed by Snowden|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9b4b5afe-30dc-11e3-b991-00144feab7de.html#undefined|date=October 9, 2013 |work=[[The Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2013, U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R.

In August 2013, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities even before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations.&lt;ref name=CNN081313&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Z.

On October 31, 2013, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] stated that "in some cases" the NSA had "reached too far" in some of its surveillance activities, and promised that it would be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/230197991.html Kerry: Some NSA surveillance work reached 'too far' and will be stopped].

In January 2014, James Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]]. He asked that "Snowden and his accomplices" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word "accomplices" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, "Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs."&lt;ref&gt;

Also in January 2014, a review by the [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] (PCLOB) concluded that the NSA's collection of every U.S. phone record on a daily basis violates the legal restrictions of the statute cited to authorize it. "The Section 215 bulk telephone records program," PCLOB reported, "lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215 [of the [[Patriot Act]]], implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only limited value.

Also in July 2013, Rep. [[Justin Amash]] (R-Mich.) and Rep.

In October 2013, Congressman [[Jim Sensenbrenner]], author of the [[Patriot Act]], introduced a proposal to the House of Representatives called the [[USA Freedom Act]] to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/10/patriot-act-author-seeks-usa-freedom-act-to-rein-in-nsa 'Patriot Act' Author Seeks 'USA Freedom Act' to Rein In NSA – US News and World Report]. Usnews.com (October 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Senators introduced two different reform proposals.

Another proposal is the [[FISA Improvements Act]] that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=NSA bills set up a choice in Congress: End bulk collection of phone records or endorse it|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-bills-set-up-a-choice-in-congress-end-bulk-collection-of-phone-records-or-endorse-it/2013/10/28/99007880-3fd5-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html|accessdate=November 1, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judiciary ===
In April 2014, ''The Washington Post'' reported that some federal judges holding low-level positions had been balking at sweeping requests by law enforcement for cellphone and other sensitive personal data. The ''Post'' called it "a small but growing faction, including judges in Texas, Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania," and said the judges deemed the requests overly broad and at odds with basic constitutional rights. Although some rulings were overturned, said the ''Post,'' their decisions have shaped when and how investigators can seize information detailing the locations, communications and online histories of Americans. Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at [[Perkins Coie]] who represents technology and telecommunications companies, told the ''Post'' that these judges "don't want to be the ones who approve an order that later becomes public and embarrassing…. Nobody likes to be characterized as a rubber stamp." According to the ''Post,'' some legal observers have called this "the Magistrates' Revolt," which began several years ago; however, it gained power amid mounting public anger about government surveillance capabilities after the NSA disclosures.&lt;ref name=WaPoJudgesBalk&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-level federal judges balking at law enforcement requests for electronic evidence|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/low-level-federal-judges-balking-at-law-enforcement-requests-for-electronic-evidence/2014/04/24/eec81748-c01b-11e3-b195-dd0c1174052c_story.html|work=WashingtonPost|accessdate=25 April 2014|first1=Ann E.|last1=Marimow|first2=Craig|last2=Timberg|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lawsuits====
In the wake of the NSA leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and [[Judicial Watch]] founder [[Larry Klayman]] filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him (see ''[[Klayman v. Obama]]''), and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against Director of National Intelligence James Clapper alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional (see ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]''). Once the judge in each case had issued rulings seemingly at odds with one another, Gary Schmitt (former staff director of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]) wrote in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', "The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff."&lt;ref&gt;

An analysis released by the [[New America Foundation]] in January 2014 reviewed 225 terrorism cases since the [[September 11 attacks]] found that the NSA's bulk collection of phone records "has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism," and that U.S. government claims of the program's usefulness were "overblown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-phone-record-collection-does-little-to-prevent-terrorist-attacks-group-says/2014/01/12/8aa860aa-77dd-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | title=National Security | date=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/13/262098004/review-of-terrorism-cases-finds-nsa-spying-helped-very-little|title=Review Of Terrorism Cases Finds NSA Spying Helped Very Little|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Snowden's stay, the two main political groups, the pan-democrats and [[Pro-Beijing camp]], found rare agreement to support Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ma|first=Mary|date=June 20, 2013|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=49&amp;art_id=134784&amp;sid=39840738&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130620&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2013|title=Ip in security minister's shoes|work=The Standard|location=Hong Kong|quote=However, surrounding the Snowden case is something never before seen in local politics.

[[People's Daily|The ''People's Daily'']] and the ''[[Global Times]]'' editorials of June 19 stated respectively that the central Chinese government was unwilling to be involved in a "mess" caused by others, and that the Hong Kong government should follow the public opinion and not concern itself with Sino-US relations.&lt;ref name="ZuoSCMPEditorials"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zuo|first=Mandy|date=June 20, 2013|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1264604/newspaper-commentaries-suggest-beijing-wants-hong-kong-handle-snowden-its|title=Beijing wants Hong Kong to handle Snowden on its own, party newspapers suggest|postscript=.

After Snowden left Hong Kong, Chinese-language newspapers such as the ''[[Ming Pao]]'' and the ''[[Oriental Daily]]'' expressed relief that Hong Kong no longer had to shoulder the burden of the Snowden situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Lai Ying-kit |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268012/edward-snowdens-depature-seen-relief-chinese-language-newspapers |title=Edward Snowden's depature [sic] seen as a relief: Chinese-language newspapers |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainland experts said that, although the Central Government did not want to appear to be intervening in the matter, it was inconceivable that the Hong Kong government acted independently in a matter that could have far-reaching consequences for Sino-US relations.

====Malaysia====
On November 2, 2013, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|Malaysian Foreign Minister]] [[Anifah Aman]] summoned the ambassadors of Australia and the United States to protest an alleged American-led spying network in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia protests at 'US and Australia spying' in Asia|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24784895|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====
Early in July 2013, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, [[Cecilia Malmström]], wrote to two U.S. officials that "mutual trust and confidence have been seriously eroded and I expect the U.S. to do all that it can to restore them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European Union threatens to stop sharing data with United States over spying reports |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/eu-threatens-stop-sharing-data-u-s-spying-reports-article-1.1391702|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2013, a committee at the [[European Parliament]] backed a measure that, if enacted, would require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The legislation has been under consideration for two years. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by NSA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html "Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe"], James Kanter and Mike Scott, ''New York Times'', October 21, 2013. Retrieved October 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Council]] meeting at the end of October 2013 in its statement signed by all 28 EU leaders while stressing that "intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism" and noting "the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership", said that this must "be based on respect and trust," a lack of which "could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU-US spying row stokes concern over anti-terror campaign |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/us-intelligence.r38|work=EU Business|date=October 26, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU says distrust of US on spying may harm terror fight |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24668286|work=BBC|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2013, the European Parliament released the results&lt;ref name="MoreasReport"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moreas|first=Claude|title=DRAFT REPORT on the US NSA surveillance programme, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their impact on EU citizens’ fundamental rights and on transatlantic cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs.

No individual EU country has looked into the scandal this thoroughly and no EU government has been as explicit in its criticism of the US government."&lt;ref name="DW20130109" /&gt; The draft report covered the preceding six months and was, said Deutsche Welle, "hard on all sides—including governments and companies in the EU." Presented by [[Claude Moraes]], British [[Member of the European Parliament]] from the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]], the report found what it called "compelling evidence of the existence of far-reaching, complex and highly technologically advanced systems designed by US and some Member States' intelligence services to collect, store and analyze communication and location data and metadata of all citizens around the world on an unprecedented scale and in an indiscriminate and non-suspicion-based manner." The fight against terrorism, said the report, can "never in itself be a justification for untargeted, secret and sometimes even illegal mass surveillance programs."&lt;ref name="DW20130109"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haase|first=Nina|title=EU report reveals massive scope of secret NSA surveillance|url=http://www.dw.de/eu-report-reveals-massive-scope-of-secret-nsa-surveillance/a-17352243|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moreas and his fellow rapporteurs considered it "very doubtful that data collection of such magnitude is only guided by the fight against terrorism, as it involves the collection of all possible data of all citizens; points therefore to the possible existence of other power motives such as political and [[economic espionage]]."&lt;ref name="MoreasReport"/&gt;

====France====

On October 21, 2013, France summoned [[Charles Rivkin]], the U.S. Ambassador to France, to clarify and explain the NSA's surveillance of French citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France summons U.S. ambassador over spying report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/21/us-france-nsa-idUSBRE99K04920131021|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 24, 2013|date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists, President [[François Hollande]] said, "We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies.

According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "The outcry over NSA eavesdropping has been most pronounced in Germany, a country whose history of dictatorship has left the population particularly sensitive to violations of personal privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579372832399168684?mg=reno64-wsj |title=NSA Flap Strains Ties With Europe |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that, beginning in 2002, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone has been "on an NSA target list".&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/nsa-spied-schroeder-iraq-648/|title=NSA spied on Germany’s Schroeder over Iraq War opposition - report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the NSA also spied on then-Chancellor [[Gerhard Schroeder]] starting in 2002 after the Schroeder criticized plans for the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;

On July 1, 2013, the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Ministry]] summoned [[Philip D. Murphy]], the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, over allegations that the NSA had spied on institutions of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German Foreign Ministry Summons US Ambassador Over NSA Spying Claims|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130701-702136.html|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'|date=July 1, 2013|quote=Seeking clarification on the matter, the foreign ministry has called the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Philip Murphy, for a meeting later Monday, a spokesman for the ministry said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of July, the media reported that Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND), had been actively cooperating with the NSA, which sparked demonstrations in 40 German cities involving thousands of protesters all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands fill German streets to protest Berlin's NSA spying involvement|url=http://rt.com/news/germany-nsa-merkel-writers-669/|publisher=RT|location=Russia|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2013, Germany canceled largely symbolic [[Cold War]]-era administrative agreements with Britain, the United States and France, which had granted the Western countries which had troops stationed in West Germany the right to request surveillance operations to protect those forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23553837|title=Germany ends spy pact with US and UK after Snowden|publisher=BBC |date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August, under the orders of the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|German domestic intelligence agency]], a federal police helicopter conducted a low-altitude flyover of the [[Consulate General of the United States, Frankfurt|United States Consulate]] in [[Frankfurt]], apparently in search of suspected clandestine eavesdropping facilities. A German official called it a symbolic "shot across the bow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-helicopter-searched-for-nsa-listening-post-in-frankfurt-a-921257.html German Helicopter Searched For NSA Listening Post In Frankfurt] SPIEGEL ONLINE.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2013, EU heads of state met to discuss a proposed data protection law. The representatives of Italy, Poland and France wanted the law to be passed before the May 2014 European Parliament elections. Germany, represented by [[Angela Merkel]], and the UK, represented by [[David Cameron]], favored a slower implementation; their wishes prevailed. About the "[[Five Eyes]]" espionage alliance, Merkel remarked, "Unlike David, we are unfortunately not part of this group."&lt;ref&gt;

The [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]] was started on March 20, 2014, by the [[German Parliament]] in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany and to search for strategies on how to protect German telecommunication with technical means.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2014 the [[Director of the Government Communications Headquarters|Director of GCHQ]] authored an article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the topic of [[internet surveillance]], stating that "however much [large US technology companies] may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals" and that GCHQ and its sister agencies "cannot tackle these challenges at scale without greater support from the private sector", arguing that most internet users "would be comfortable with a better and more sustainable relationship between the [intelligence] agencies and the tech companies". Since the 2013 surveillance disclosures, large US technology companies have improved security and become less co-operative with foreign intelligence agencies, including those of the UK, generally requiring a US court order before disclosing data.&lt;ref name=ft-20141103rh&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c89b6c58-6342-11e4-8a63-00144feabdc0.html |title=The web is a terrorist's command-and-control network of choice |author=Robert Hannigan |newspaper=Financial Times |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft-20141103&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4a35c0b2-636e-11e4-9a79-00144feabdc0.html |title=Tech groups aid terror, says UK spy chief |author1=Sam Jones  |author2=Murad Ahmed  |lastauthoramp=yes |newspaper=Financial Times |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Foreign Minister]] [[Bob Carr]] remarked that the U.S. would be critical of any other nation that failed to prevent the release of such sensitive documents. "Certainly if it had gone the other way," said Carr, "if there'd been some official in Canberra, some contractor in Canberra, who allowed a slew of material as sensitive as this to be plastered over the world's media, America would be saying very stern things to someone they'd be regarding as a woefully immature ally and partner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-19/indonesia-gives-australia-two-days-to-explain-spying-row/5101050 Spying row: Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono accuses Tony Abbott of taking claims too lightly]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renosterveld''' is a term used for one of the major [[plant community|plant communities]] and [[vegetation]] types of the [[Cape Floristic Region]] (Cape Floral Kingdom) which is located in southwestern and southeastern [[South Africa]], in southernmost [[Africa]]. It is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]].

==Etymology==

'''Renosterveld''' directly translated in the [[Afrikaans]] language means "rhinoceros-field", a possible reference to the high number of [[rhinoceroses]] seen by the Afrikaner settlers at the time. It may also derive its name from the [[Elytropappus rhinocerotis|renosterbos]] ("rhinoceros bush - ''Elytropappus rhinocerotis''), which is a common species of shrub found here. The dull grey colour of renosterbos is similar to the colour of a rhino's hide.


==Geology==
Renosterveld plants grow on rich soil, which makes them more nutritious than typical fynbos plants. Typically, renosterveld is largely confined to fine-grained soils - mainly clays and silts - which are derived from the shales of the Malmesbury and [[Bokkeveld Group]]s and the Karoo Sequence. In drier regions it also occurs on Cape Granite Suite-derived soils.

Renosterveld usually grows in areas that have moderate winter rainfall of 300–600&amp;nbsp;mm per year. It can survive relatively frequent fires.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Elytropappus rhinocerotis - Renosterbos - Cape Town 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Elytropappus rhinocerotis|Renosterbos (rhinoceros bush)]] (''Elytropappus rhinocerotis'')]]
===Flora===
This vegetation type is dominated by a species of grey-coloured plant called the [[Elytropappus rhinocerotis|renosterbos]]. However, the ''[[Protea]]s'', ''[[Erica]]s'' and ''[[Restio]]s'' - typical of [[fynbos]] [[habitat]]s, tend to occur in very low abundance in renosterveld. There are few endemics to renosterveld vegetation alone, many of the species occurring in fynbos as well. However, species [[endemism|endemic]] to the Cape Floristic Region comprise about one-third of renosterveld plant species, and many of these belong to families which are not considered to be of "Cape affinity" (i.e. these families are also diverse outside the Cape Floral Kingdom). 
:Typical renosterveld plants include: 
;Grasses: ''[[Themeda triandra]]''
;Shrubs and small trees: [[Elytropappus rhinocerotis|renosterbos]], [[karee]], [[Eriocephalus africanus|wild rosemary]], [[wild olive]].
;Perennials: [[geophyte]]s from the iris, [[amaryllis]], [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], [[orchid]] and other plant families. 

====Uses====
The original inhabitants of the Western Cape, the [[Bushmen|San]] and [[Khoi]], used renosterveld plants for food, medicine and grazing. Because of their relatively small populations and simple lifestyles, they did not cause a great deal of damage to this ecosystem.

Many renosterveld trees and shrubs produce berries, which attract fruit-eating birds (e.g. [[bulbul]]s, [[Cape white-eye]]s) and other animals (e.g. [[geometric tortoise]]s, [[chacma baboon]]s). 

During spring, renosterveld flowers attract a wide variety of pollinators, like [[bee]]s, [[flies]], [[beetle]]s and [[sunbird]]s.

===Fauna===

Because of its high soil fertility, it is probable that all the herds of large game in the fynbos biome occurred in renosterveld. Thus [[mountain zebra]], [[quagga]], [[bluebuck]], roan antelope, [[red hartebeest]], [[common eland|eland]], [[bontebok]], elephant, [[black rhino]] and [[Cape buffalo]] were common, as were [[lion]], [[cheetah]], [[African wild dog]], [[spotted hyena]] and [[leopard]]. 

Two of these only ever occurred within the fynbos biome: bluebuck and bontebok. Of these large mammals, only the mountain zebra and leopard survived (by fleeing to the mountains), with the bontebok just surviving near Bredasdorp. All the other species became extinct in the fynbos biome (a tiny relict elephant population  still survives in the area around the Gouritz River and surrounding areas within the fynbos biome area), although many have been introduced into conservation areas from outside the region. The quagga and bluebuck are extinct, although there is a project (the [[Quagga Project]]) to restore [[plains zebra]]s with quagga-like markings.

==Threats==
The high fertility of renosterveld soils has meant that most of the area has been converted to agriculture, mainly [[wheat]]. 

It is alleged that the high shrub cover is a result of continuous grazing. Early records suggest that the renosterveld had abundant grasses, and that the game and Khoi cattle migrated over the region. With the establishment of European stock farmers, continuous grazing and the elimination of the diverse grazing-browsing fauna, the shrubby element was promoted. This theory is not universally accepted, but proponents argue to the sudden decline of hay near Cape Town in the early 18th century, and the many historical records of early explorers claiming that renosterbos was taking over and that grass was becoming scarce. 

In the Cape Floristic Region, less than 2% of renosterveld vegetation types are formally conserved. These are some of the most threatened types of vegetation in the world.

It seems unlikely that viable populations of large mammals will ever be reintroduced into the fynbos biome for this reason.

==Conservation==

Conservation organisations and volunteers are working with farmers and municipalities to identify, map and protect the remaining precious areas of renosterveld in the [[Western Cape]]. For more information go to:

The '''respiratory quotient''' (or '''RQ''' or '''respiratory coefficient'''), is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]] used in calculations of [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR) when estimated from carbon dioxide production. It is calculated from the ratio of carbon dioxide produced by the body to oxygen consumed by the body. Such measurements, like measurements of oxygen uptake, are forms of indirect [[calorimetry]]. It is measured using a [[respirometer]]. The Respiratory Quotient value indicates which macronutrients are being metabolized, as different energy pathways are used for fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function|last=Widmaier|first=Eric P.|last2=Raff|first2=Hershel|last3=Strang|first3=Kevin T.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2016|isbn=9781259294099|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A value of 0.7 indicates that lipids are being metabolized, 0.8 for proteins, and 1.0 for carbohydrates. The approximate respiratory quotient of a mixed diet is 0.8.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the other factors that may affect the respiratory quotient are energy balance, circulating insulin, and insulin sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Amy C|last2=Hyatt|first2=Tanya C|last3=Gower|first3=Barbara A|last4=Hunter|first4=Gary R|date=2017-05-02|title=Respiratory Quotient Predicts Fat Mass Gain in Premenopausal Women|journal=Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)|volume=18|issue=12|pages=2255–2259|doi=10.1038/oby.2010.96|issn=1930-7381|pmc=3075532|pmid=20448540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used in the [[alveolar gas equation]].

==Calculation==
The respiratory quotient ('''RQ''') is the ratio:

'''RQ''' = CO&lt;sub&gt;2 eliminated&lt;/sub&gt; / O&lt;sub&gt;2 consumed&lt;/sub&gt;

where the term "eliminated" refers to carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) removed from the body.

In this calculation, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be given in the same units, and in quantities proportional to the number of molecules. Acceptable inputs would be either [[mole (unit)|moles]], or else volumes of gas at standard temperature and pressure.

Many metabolized substances are compounds containing only the elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]]. Examples include [[fatty acids]], [[glycerol]], [[carbohydrates]], [[deamination]] products, and [[ethanol]]. For complete oxidation of such compounds, the chemical equation is

C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; + (x + y/4 - z/2) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
→ x CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + (y/2) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

and thus metabolism of this compound gives an RQ of x/(x + y/4 - z/2).

For glucose, with the molecular formula, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the complete oxidation equation is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
→ 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Thus, the RQ= 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.

The range of respiratory coefficients for organisms in metabolic balance usually ranges from 1.0 (representing the value expected for pure carbohydrate oxidation) to ~0.7 (the value expected for pure fat oxidation). In general, molecules that are more oxidized (e.g., glucose) require less oxygen to be fully metabolized and, therefore, have higher respiratory quotients. Conversely, molecules that are less oxidized (e.g., fatty acids) require more oxygen for their complete metabolism and have lower respiratory quotients. See [[Basal metabolic rate|BMR]] for a discussion of how these numbers are derived. A mixed diet of fat and carbohydrate results in an average value between these numbers.

'''RQ''' value corresponds to a caloric value for each liter (L) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced. If O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption numbers are available, they are usually used directly, since they are more direct and reliable estimates of energy production.

'''RQ''' as measured includes a contribution from the energy produced from protein. However, due to the complexity of the various ways in which different amino acids can be metabolized, no single '''RQ''' can be assigned to the oxidation of protein in the diet.

Insulin, which increases lipid storage and decreases fat oxidation, is positively associated with increases in the respiratory quotient.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; A positive energy balance will also lead to an increased respiratory quotient.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Practical applications of the respiratory quotient can be found in severe cases of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], in which patients spend a significant amount of energy on respiratory effort. By increasing the proportion of fats in the diet, the respiratory quotient is driven down, causing a relative decrease in the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced. This reduces the respiratory burden to eliminate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby reducing the amount of energy spent on respirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuo|first=C. D.|last2=Shiao|first2=G. M.|last3=Lee|first3=J. D.|date=1993-07-01|title=The effects of high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet loads on gas exchange and ventilation in COPD patients and normal subjects|journal=Chest|volume=104|issue=1|pages=189–196|issn=0012-3692|pmid=8325067|doi=10.1378/chest.104.1.189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respiratory Quotient can be used as an indicator of over or underfeeding. Underfeeding, which forces the body to utilize fat stores, will lower the respiratory quotient, while overfeeding, which causes [[lipogenesis]], will increase it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClave|first=Stephen A.|last2=Lowen|first2=Cynthia C.|last3=Kleber|first3=Melissa J.|last4=McConnell|first4=J.

This is particularly important in patients with compromised respiratory systems, as an increased respiratory quotient significantly corresponds to increased respiratory rate and decreased [[tidal volume]], placing compromised patients at a significant risk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Because of its role in metabolism, respiratory quotient can be used in analysis of liver function and diagnosis of liver disease. In patients suffering from [[Cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]], non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) values act as good indicators in the prediction of overall survival rate. Patients having a npRQ &lt; 0.85 show considerably lower survival rates as compared to patients with a npRQ &gt; 0.85.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nishikawa|first=Hiroki|last2=Enomoto|first2=Hirayuki|last3=Iwata|first3=Yoshinori|last4=Kishino|first4=Kyohei|last5=Shimono|first5=Yoshihiro|last6=Hasegawa|first6=Kunihiro|last7=Nakano|first7=Chikage|last8=Takata|first8=Ryo|last9=Ishii|first9=Akio|date=2017-01-01|title=Prognostic significance of nonprotein respiratory quotient in patients with liver cirrhosis|journal=Medicine|volume=96|issue=3|pages=e5800|doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000005800|issn=1536-5964|pmc=5279081|pmid=28099336}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in npRQ corresponds to a decrease in glycogen storage by the liver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similar research indicates that non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases are also accompanied by a low respiratory quotient value, and the non protein respiratory quotient value was a good indication of disease severity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''sacred tree at Uppsala''' was a [[tree worship|sacred tree]] located at the [[Temple at Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], in the second half of the [[11th century]]. It is not known what species it was, but a scholar{{who|date=September 2017}} has suggested that it was a [[Taxus baccata|yew tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Ohlmarks, Å. (1994). ''Fornnordiskt lexikon''. p 372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0354.html Hellquist, O. (1922). ''Svensk etymologisk ordbok''. p 266]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is even more sparsely documented than the famous temple by which it stood. In the 1070s, the writer of a [[scholium]] in [[Adam of Bremen]]'s ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' explained: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Near that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] there where the pagan are accustomed to perform [[sacrifices]] and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen's ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The description of the tree and the location of a well nearby are reminiscent of the [[evergreen]], [[Yggdrasil]], which stood above the [[Well of Urd]], and it is possible that the [[Swedes]] consciously had created a copy of the world of their [[List of Germanic deities|Norse gods]] at Uppsala.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Uppsalatemplet.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Image showing the sacred tree to the right of the temple, from [[Olaus Magnus]]' ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'' (1555). To the right of the tree is a depiction of a man being sacrificed in the spring.]]
The later [[Iceland]]ic source, ''[[Hervarar saga]]'', contains a description of how the tree was used in the pagan rites, concerning an event taking place only a few years after the scholium was written. It is in reference to the ancient [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European ritual]] of [[horse sacrifice]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Blot-Sweyn|Svein]], the King's brother-in-law, remained behind in the assembly, and offered the Swedes to do sacrifices on their behalf if they would give him the Kingdom. They all agreed to accept Svein's offer, and he was then recognized as King over all Sweden. A horse was then brought to the assembly and hewn in pieces and cut up for eating, and the sacred tree was smeared with blood. Then all the Swedes abandoned Christianity, and sacrifices started again. They drove King [[Inge I of Sweden|Ingi]] away; and he went into [[Västergötland]].&lt;ref name=hervarar&gt;[http://www.home.ix.netcom.com/%7Ekyamazak/myth/norse/kershaw/Kershaw1s-hervor-and-heithrek.htm ''The Saga of Hervör and Heithrek'' (c. 1325)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227085107/http://www.home.ix.netcom.com/~kyamazak/myth/norse/kershaw/Kershaw1s-hervor-and-heithrek.htm |date=2006-12-27 }}, in translation by Nora Kershaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stewart Island/Rakiura''' (commonly called '''Stewart Island''') is the third-largest island of [[New Zealand]]. It lies {{convert|30|km}} south of the [[South Island]], across the [[Foveaux Strait]]. Its permanent population is 381 people as of the 2013 [[New Zealand census|census]], most of whom live in the settlement of [[Oban, New Zealand|Oban]] on the eastern side of the island.&lt;ref name=Quickstats&gt;{{NZ Quickstats2013|15148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and naming ==
[[File:Paterson Inlet.jpg|left|thumb|[[Paterson Inlet, New Zealand|Paterson Inlet]] at sunset]]
[[File:Stewart Island Oban Mudflats.jpg|left|thumb|Mudflats near Oban]]

The original [[Māori language|Māori]] name, ''Te Punga o Te Waka a Maui'', positions Stewart Island/Rakiura firmly at the heart of Māori mythology. Translated as ''The Anchor Stone of Maui’s Canoe'', it refers to the part played by the island in the legend of [[Maui (Māori mythology)|Maui]] and his crew, who from their canoe, the South Island, caught and raised the great fish, the [[North Island]].

Rakiura is the more commonly known and used Māori name. It is usually translated as ''Glowing Skies'', possibly a reference to the sunsets for which it is famous or for the [[aurora australis]], the southern lights that are a phenomenon of southern latitudes.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

For some, Rakiura is the abbreviated version of Te Rakiura a Te Rakitamau, translated as "great blush of Rakitamau", in reference to the latter's embarrassment when refused the hand in marriage of not one, but two daughters, of an island chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/national-parks/rakiura/features/ |title=Features: Rakiura National Park | publisher=Department of Conservation (New Zealand) |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Māori legend, a chief on the island named Te Rakitamau was married to a young woman who became terminally ill and implored him to marry her cousin after she died. Te Rakitamau paddled across Te Moana Tapokopoko a Tawhiki ([[Foveaux Strait]]) to the South Island where the cousin lived, only to discover she had recently married. He blushed with embarrassment; so the island was called Te Ura o Te Rakitamau.

Captain [[James Cook]] and his crew were the first Europeans to sight the island from the ''Endeavour'' in March 1770. As the ship sailed south around it, Cook recorded its insularity and described the strait that separates it from South Island. But a few weeks later, he changed his mind. He was operating during the period of intense [[France-United Kingdom relations| Anglo-French rivalry]] that filled the twelve years between Britain's success in the [[Seven Years' War]] and France's revanche in the [[American Revolutionary War]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage|date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=9780648043966 |page=80-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  He recalled the [[Admiralty]]'s verbal instructions to conceal strategically important discoveries that could become security risks, such as off-shore islands from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power. Cook knew he had to hide Foveaux Strait and depict Stewart Island as a peninsula.  Consequently, he altered his journal entry and redrew his chart of New Zealand showing the two southerly islands joined by an isthmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island received its English name in honour of [[William W. Stewart]], who was first officer on the ship ''Pegasus'', which visited from [[Port Jackson]] ([[Sydney]]), [[Australia]], in 1809 on a [[Seal hunting|sealing]] expedition. Stewart charted the large southeastern harbour that now bears the ship's name ([[Port Pegasus]]), and determined the northern points of the island, proving that it was an island. He made three further visits to the island from the 1820s to the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard John Foster. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, the island was established as one of the three [[Provinces of New Zealand]], and was named [[New Leinster]]. However, the province existed on paper only and was abolished after only five years, and with the passing of the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1846]] the province became part of [[New Munster Province|New Munster]], which entirely included the South Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  |date=  |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/P/Provinces/NewLeinsterNewMunsterAndNewUlster/en |title=New Leinster, New Munster, and New Ulster |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When New Munster was abolished in 1853, Stewart Island became part of [[Otago Province]] until 1861 when [[Southland Province]] split from Otago. In 1876 the provinces were abolished altogether.

For most of the twentieth century, "Stewart Island" was the official name, and that is still in common use by most New Zealanders. The name was officially altered to Stewart Island/Rakiura by the ''Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998'', one of many such changes under the [[Ngāi Tahu]] treaty settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1998/0097/10.0/DLM431335.html Schedule 96 Alteration of place names]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Stewart Island.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Stewart Island/Rakiura]]
[[File:Stewart Island as seen from i plane.jpg|thumb|Northern part of Stewart Island, with a view over some of the bays]]

Stewart Island  has an area of {{convert|1680|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/stewart-islandrakiura/1 |title=Stewart Island/Rakiura – New Zealand’s third main island |first=Carl |last=Walrond |date= 3 September 2012 |work=Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its terrain is hilly and, like most of New Zealand, Stewart Island has an [[Oceanic climate]]. The north is dominated by the swampy valley of the [[Freshwater River, New Zealand|Freshwater River]]. The river rises close to the northwestern coast and flows southeastwards into the large indentation of [[Paterson Inlet, New Zealand|Paterson Inlet]]. The highest peak is [[Mount Anglem, New Zealand|Mount Anglem]] ({{convert|980|m}}), close to the northern coast. It is one of a rim of ridges that surround Freshwater Valley.

The southern half is more uniformly undulating, rising to a ridge that runs south from the valley of the [[Rakeahua River]], which also flows into Paterson Inlet. The southernmost point in this ridge is Mount Allen, at {{convert|750|m}}. In the southeast the land is somewhat lower, and is drained by the valleys of the [[Toitoi River]], Lords River, and [[Heron River]]. South West Cape on this island is the southernmost point of the main islands of New Zealand.

Mason Bay, on the west side, is notable as a long sandy beach on an island where beaches are typically far more rugged. One suggestion is that the bay was formed in the aftershock of a meteorite impact in the [[Tasman Sea]].

Three large and many small islands lie around the coast. Notable among these are [[Ruapuke Island]], in Foveaux Strait {{convert|32|km}} northeast of Oban; [[Codfish Island]], close to the northwest shore; and [[Big South Cape Island]], off the southwestern tip. The Titi/Muttonbird Islands group is between Stewart Island/Rakiura and Ruapuke Island, around Big South Cape Island, and off the southeastern coast. Other islands of interest include Bench Island, Native Island, and [[Ulva Island, New Zealand|Ulva Island]], all close to the mouth of [[Paterson Inlet, New Zealand|Paterson Inlet]], and Pearl Island, [[Anchorage Island, New Zealand|Anchorage Island]], and Noble Island, close to [[Port Pegasus]] in the southwest. Further offshore [[The Snares]] are oceanic islands, a volcano and some smaller islets, that were never connected to the larger Stewart Island.

The climate of Stewart Island is mild for temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stewartisland.co.nz/index.php?pageLoad=6 | title=weather |year= 2012|work=Stewart Island |publisher=Stewart Island Promotion Association Inc |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one travel guide mentions "frequent downpours that make 'boots and waterproof clothing mandatory'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/new-zealand/stewart-island-and-outer-islands/weather |title=Weather in Stewart Island |year=2012 |work=When to go &amp; weather |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606204610/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/new-zealand/stewart-island-and-outer-islands/weather |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another guide says that rainfall in Oban, the capital, is {{convert|1600|to|1800|mm|abbr=on}} a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruggedyrange.com/stewart-island-weather.htm |title=Weather |year=2012 |work=Wilderness Experience |publisher=Raggedy Range | accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geomagnetic anomaly ===
Owing to an anomaly in the magnetic latitude contours, this location is well placed for observing [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora australis]].

== Settlements ==
[[File:Oban Stewart Island.jpg|thumb|Overlooking [[Oban, New Zealand|Oban]] and [[Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island|Halfmoon Bay]] on Stewart Island/Rakiura]]

The only town is [[Oban, New Zealand|Oban]], on [[Halfmoon Bay (Stewart Island)|Halfmoon Bay]].

A previous settlement, [[Port Pegasus]], once boasted several stores and a post office, and was located on the southern coast of the island. It is now uninhabited, and is accessible only by boat or by an arduous hike through the island. Another site of former settlement is at [[Port William, New Zealand|Port William]], a four-hour walk around the north coast from Oban, where immigrants from the [[Shetland Islands]] settled in the early 1870s. This was unsuccessful, and the settlers left within one to two years, most for sawmilling villages elsewhere on the island.

Since 1988 the electricity supply on Stewart Island/Rakiura has come from diesel generators; previously residents used their own private generators. As a consequence electric power is around three times more expensive than in the South Island, at NZ$0.59/kWh in 2016.&lt;ref name="righthouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.righthouse.co.nz/useful-stuff/news/stewart-is-may-lead-nz-in-green-power|title=Stewart Is may lead NZ in green power|date=26 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603072640/http://www.righthouse.co.nz/useful-stuff/news/stewart-is-may-lead-nz-in-green-power|archivedate=3 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southland District Council]] has partnered with [[Meridian Energy]] to develop renewable energy sources for the island, and experiments with photovoltaic and wind generation are in progress.&lt;ref name="righthouse" /&gt;

== Economy and communications ==
Fishing has been, historically, the most important element of the economy of Stewart Island/Rakiura, and while it remains important, tourism has become the main source of income for islanders. There has also been some farming and forestry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Oban, New Zealand|Oban]] has mainly sealed main roads, and some gravel roads on the outskirts.

[[Stewart Island Flights]] links [[Ryan's Creek Aerodrome]] and [[Invercargill Airport]] and aircraft also land on the sand at Mason Bay, Doughboy Bay, and West Ruggedy Beach. A regular passenger ferry service runs between [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]] and Oban. The only ferry/barge link to the South Island for vehicles is to Bluff.

Oban has phone and [[broadband]] (ADSL) services. Cellphone coverage is provided by Spark and Vodafone. All these services rely on a radio link to Bluff, so broadband speeds are limited.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Stewart Island is able to receive most AM and FM radio stations broadcast in the Southland region. Television services are available via satellite using [[SKY TV (New Zealand)|Sky]] or [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]]. Analogue terrestrial television services could be received on Stewart Island from the Hedgehope television transmitter located in the South Island prior to the analogue switch off on April 28, 2013.

From 1841 to 1853, Stewart Island was governed as [[New Leinster Province]], then as part of [[New Munster Province]]. From 1853 onwards, it was part of the [[Otago Province]]. In [[Local government in New Zealand|local government]] today, Stewart Island/Rakiura is part of the [[Southland District]] and the [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland Region]]. However, it shares with some other islands a certain relaxation in some of the rules governing commercial activities. For example, every transport service operated solely on [[Great Barrier Island]], the [[Chatham Islands]], or Stewart Island/Rakiura is exempt from the Transport Act of 1962.

== Ecology ==

=== Flora ===
Although the clay soil is not very fertile, the high rainfall and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as [[Metrosideros umbellata|rātā]] and [[Weinmannia racemosa|kāmahi]] in the lowland areas with [[Leptospermum scoparium|mānuka]] shrubland at higher elevations. The trees are thought to have become established here since the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which would explain why the [[Nothofagus|beech]] trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island.

[[Noeline Baker]] purchased land near Halfmoon Bay in the early 1930s, and with a checklist by botanist [[Leonard Cockayne]] populated it with all the local indigenous plants. She gifted the land and her house to the government in 1940, and today [[Moturau Moana]] is New Zealand's southernmost public garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|Taylor|Leah|4b2|Isabel Noeline Baker|31&lt;!--exact day is artificially added here because otherwise an error is thrown--&gt; December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fauna ===
There are many species of birds on Stewart Island/Rakiura that have been able to continue to thrive because of the relative absence of the cats, rats, stoats, ferrets, weasels and other predators that humans brought to the main islands. There are even more species of birds, including huge colonies of [[sooty shearwater]] and other seabirds, on [[The Snares]] and the other smaller islands offshore. The birds of Stewart Island include [[weka]], [[New Zealand kaka|kākā]], [[albatross]], the flightless [[Southern brown kiwi|Stewart Island kiwi]], [[silvereye]]s, [[New Zealand fantail|fantails]], and [[New Zealand pigeon|kererū]]. The [[endangered]] [[yellow-eyed penguin]] has a significant number of breeding sites here &lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while the large colonies of sooty shearwaters on the offshore [[Muttonbird Islands]], are subject to [[muttonbirding]], a sustainable harvesting program managed by Rakiura Māori. Meanwhile, a small population of the [[kakapo]], a flightless parrot which is very close to extinction, was found on Stewart Island in 1977 and the birds subsequently moved to smaller islands ([[Codfish Island]]) for protection from feral cats. The [[South Island saddleback]] is similarly preserved.

=== Threats and preservation ===
As the island has always been sparsely populated and there has never been very much logging, much of the original wildlife is intact, including species that have been devastated on the larger islands to the north since their habitation by humans. However, although habitats and wildlife were not threatened by invasive species historically, now there are populations of cats, rats and [[Common brushtail possum in New Zealand|brushtail possum]]s on the island, as well as a large population of [[white-tailed deer]], which are hunted for meat and sport, introduced to coastal areas. There is also a small population of [[red deer]] confined to the inland areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0407|name=Rakiura Island temperate forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the island is owned by the New Zealand government and over 80 per cent of the island is set aside as the [[Rakiura National Park]], New Zealand's newest national park. Many of the small offshore islands, including the Snares, are also protected.

== Claims of independence ==
Residents of Stewart Island/Rakiura have held a number of promotional fundraising mock events regarding a [[declaration of independence]] for the island and to have it renamed to its original name of "Rakiura".

In the late 1950s or early 1960s they had a local printer [[Private overprint|overprint]] “INDEPENDENT RAKIURA” on eight values of some earlier New Zealand [[postage stamp|postage]] and [[semi-postal|health]] stamps. There were also eight different values from one penny to £1 [[Private overprint|overprinted]] on these stamps as well as having their original values blotted out with small black circles. These were sold to [[stamp collecting|collectors]] with the proceeds helping to refurbish the Rakiura Museum.

There was another fundraising effort to raise [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]6,000 for a new swimming pool for the island's school, by selling 50-cent passports for the newly "independent" island. A mock ceremony featured a declaration of independence on 31 July 1970 when the new republic's flag was unveiled.

These efforts were not serious attempts for independence, and Stewart Island/Rakiura remains a part of the New Zealand [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/nz-sti.html Stewart Island (New Zealand)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1573">'''Two-photon photovoltaic effect''' is an energy harvesting technique based on [[two-photon absorption]]. The effect occurs when two [[photon]]s are absorbed simultaneously in a semiconductor material and give rise to an electron-hole pair.  The photon-generated electron and hole are then collected for electrical power generation using a [[p-n junction]] [[diode]]. The two-photon photovoltaic effect can be considered as the nonlinear equivalent of the conventional [[photovoltaic effect]] commonly used in [[p-n junction]] [[solar cell]]s.  The effect was first discovered in [[silicon]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4384661], S. Fathpour, K. Tsia and B.

==Major forest zones==
The Tyrrhenian-Adriatic Sclerophyllous and Mixed Forests ecoregion has four major forest zones.

*The Tyrrhenian mixed oak forests are dominated by the [[sclerophyll]]ous evergreen oak ''[[Quercus ilex]]'' and ''[[Quercus suber]]'', and by deciduous species such as ''[[Quercus pubescens]]'', ''[[Fraxinus ornus]]'', and ''[[Ostrya carpinifolia]]''.
*Some surviving temperate deciduous oak woodlands, mainly of ''[[Quercus robur]]'', appear in coastal wetlands on the Italian peninsula and on the island of Corsica. Stone pine ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' is found on some coastal sand dunes.
*The southeastern Italian woodlands, in the region of [[Apulia]], contain the oak species ''[[Quercus trojana]]'' and ''[[Quercus macrolepis]]'',   [[Endemism|endemic]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, together with the evergreen holm oak ''[[Quercus ilex]]'' and the deciduous oak ''[[Quercus pubescens]]''. The Aleppo pine ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'' is also found in such woodlands.
*The islands of [[Dalmatia]] are dominated by Aleppo pine ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'' and holm oak ''[[Quercus ilex]]''. A relict and endemic pine, ''[[Pinus nigra]]'' ''dalmatica'' also occurs.

The '''Zimmerwald Observatory''' ({{lang-de|'''Observatorium Zimmerwald'''}}) is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] owned and operated by the AIUB, the Astronomical Institute of the [[University of Bern]]. Built in 1956, it is located at [[Zimmerwald]], 10 kilometers south of [[Bern]], Switzerland.

Numerous [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s have been discovered by [[Paul Wild (Swiss astronomer)|Paul Wild]] (1925–2014) at Zimmerwald Observatory, most notably comet [[81P/Wild]], which was visited by NASA's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust space probe]] in 2004. The [[main belt]] asteroid [[1775 Zimmerwald]] has been named after the location of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top |title=1775 Zimmerwald (1969 JA) |work=[[JPL]] – Small-Body Database Browser |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1-meter aperture ZIMLAT telescope was inaugurated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ZIMLAT Telescope |url=http://cmslive3.unibe.ch/unibe/philnat/aiub/content/zimmerwald/the_zimlat_telescope/index_eng.html |work=Universität Bern, Astronomisches Institut, Zimmerwald Observatory |date=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
